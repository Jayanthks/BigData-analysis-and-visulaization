according to court documents unsealed WednesdayBy taking over the sites Microsoft can stop future cyberattacks and monitor how previously infected computers were compromised the company saidThe hackers specifically directed their attacks on people in Washington Microsoft said in the filing The hacking group typically has targeted the personal email accounts of people working in both the public and private sectors including dissidents and workers in government agencies Microsoft said in court documentsPeople working in the Treasury Department and similar agencies in other Western governments were among those targeted according to a person with knowledge of the attacks who spoke on the condition of anonymityThe Treasury Department which did not immediately respond to a request for comment oversees economic sanctions against IranMicrosoft sued the hackers in the United States District Court in Washington and asked to gain control of the sites saying the hackers had harmed its brand and the value of its trademarks by impersonating its products to trick victims On March  Judge Amy Berman Jackson granted a temporary restraining order that let Microsoft take over the websitesMicrosoft said the hacking group which it calls Phosphorus but is also known as APT  and Charming Kitten had been linked to Iran The group uses a technique known as spear phishing sending email and social media links to victims while imitating the personas of people or institutions they may know That either prompts the users to click on links that install malware that lets the hackers spy on the victims computers or prompts the victims to enter their login credentials which the hackers then later use to log in to official systemsThe Iranian hackers faked the look and language of several Microsoft products including LinkedIn OneDrive and Hotmail Microsoft said in the documentsBy seizing the sites Microsoft set up what is known as a sinkhole which lets it monitor the traffic that otherwise would have been captured by the hackersWhile weve used daily security analytics tracking to stop individual Phosphorus attacks and notify impacted customers the action we executed last week enabled us to take control of websites that are core to its operations Tom Burt a Microsoft security executive said in a blog postMicrosoft has used this legal and technical approach before including for fighting the botnets that spit out spam email It also used the approach against Fancy Bear a hacking group widely considered to be affiliated with Russian intelligence which Microsoft

problem By Emily BadgerWith its  million pledge to address affordable housing in the Seattle area Microsoft isnt primarily cutting checks to local charities Private companies have done that before Nor is it proposing to create housing for its own employees as corporations have done in the past tooRather Microsoft is trying to help fix a market failure  a job government typically doesIt really represents something almost unprecedented said Matthew Gordon Lasner an associate professor of urban studies and planning at Hunter College What were seeing Microsoft do is in effect privately assume the role that historically the federal government and the states have playedMicrosofts announcement is welcome news in the Seattle region where housing costs have risen faster lately than in any other part of the country But the fact that a tech company has to step in to help ensure the development of affordable housing points to a longbuilding reality nationwide The federal government has largely retreated from this roleThe government spent about three times as much on housing programs in the s as it does today according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition In the years since the government has gotten out of the business of building public housing And capital funds to repair the remaining public housing stock have been cut in half over the last  years Over this time federal resources have increasingly shifted away from subsidizing the construction of affordable housing to subsidizing renters who find housing in the private market And now most new belowmarketrate housing is built not by public agencies but by nonprofit developers leveraging tax credits The value of those credits has declined recently as well as a result of changes in the tax bill passed in In a sense Microsofts proposal is an extension of this story as private actors continue to step in where the government once stoodOur part to play is to bring capital to solve this problem Microsofts president Brad Smith said at an event introducing the plan on Thursday Today in the Seattle region the problem isnt simply that government support has dwindled Construction and land costs to build new housing have risen and the wages that lowskilled workers can afford to spend on rent have stagnatedThere is no public entity that can fill a hole as big as this Mr Smith said If the only focus is putting money into public housing he said it will go too slowly and you will end up with housing that may not stand the test of timeMicrosoft says it plans to spend  million on grants to local nonprofits working on homelessness But the bulk of the money will be invested some in affordable housing developments that use tax credits and others in middleclass developments that wouldnt be financially feasible without lowerinterest loans As those loans are repaid Microsoft will lend the capital to other developments as well in theory leveraging the money to create what Microsoft estimates could be tens of thousands of units of housing or far more than would be possible if the company simply spent the money directly building apartments itselfEd Goetz a professor at the University of Minnesota who has studied the history of public housing in America said I dont want to diminish the magnitude of what theyre doing I think its important and it will help But it wont solve Seattles problem Microsoft has called for other companies to become involved But Mr Goetz said he couldnt imagine a situation where there were enough Microsofts out there to truly address the countrys housing crisisThe federal government is the entity that has the resources to do this Mr Goetz saidDiane Yentel the president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition said she would welcome a trend in which more major tech companies put up money to address housing But she warned of the risk of further letting the government off the hook Todays modern phenomenon of homelessness didnt exist in the late s because our country housed almost everyone including the lowestincome and most vulnerable families Ms Yentel said in an email The key difference between then and now is declining federal subsidiesAs Microsoft unveiled its plans the Department of Housing and Urban Development remained largely shuttered in Washington during the government shutdown Federal contracts with hundreds of property owners who provide housing to subsidized tenants have expired during the shutdown leaving thousands of families at risk of losing their homes Activists in communities like Seattle have made a strong case that tech companies bear some responsibility for making the housing crisis worse Those companies have brought thousands of highly paid workers into housing markets that dont have room for everyone But among the many culprits behind the crisis the governments retrenchment is critical tooThis is a problem that is rooted in our political culture Mr Lasner said Its a problem thats rooted in the myths we tell ourselves about who we are as Americans Weve always been skittish and uncomfortable with the idea of housing subsidies or even interventions like rent control Americans are more comfortable with privatesector solutions he said But for an area as complicated as housing he added theyre not enough to cope with the challengeKaren Weise contributed reportingEmily Badger writes

give indications of whether companies and consumers around the world are cooling their spending because the business taps into so many markets Apple reported on Tuesday that its revenue was down in part because consumers are buying new phones less frequently and the chipmakers NVIDIA and Intel both indicated weakening demand for the components they build for data centersBut on Wednesday Microsoft showed solid performance across its commercial and consumer businesses reporting revenue of almost  billion in the last quarter and a profit of almost  billion both increases of more than  percent over the same period a year agoMicrosoft had handily beat analyst expectations recently In the last quarter the results fell mostly in line with what investors expected and shares fell about  percent in aftermarket trading wiping out most of the gains made earlier in the dayThe company continued its shift to cloud computing which allows businesses to store and analyze their data in remote centers Its offering is now widely seen as the strong No  in the market that had once been dominated only by AmazonSatya Nadella the companys chief executive said in a call with investors that Microsoft was not seeing a slowing in demand Its very healthy and will continue to be healthyThe companys consumer products also did well during the holiday season with a  percent increase in sales of Surface tablets and laptops compared with the same quarter in  Sales of its highmargin Windows operating system fell which the company tied to a continuing shortage in computer chipsThe last quarter illustrated Microsofts increasing strength At times it surpassed Apple and Amazon to become the most valuable company in the world which was both a sign of its resurgence and the stumbles faced by its peers The company announced a series of major multiyear partnerships with large customers that validate a bet by Mr Nadella to shift the companys focus to cloud computing and away from personal computersA few months ago Microsoft indicated that its rapid global expansion of data centers would moderate this year but it signaled this was more about making the best use of all its capacity rather than a sign that customers were less interested in cloudbased servicesWe think this is cyclicality  you build then you grow you build then you grow said Jennifer Lowe an analyst who covers the company for UBSSales for Azure Microsofts core cloud computing offering were up  percent over the same period last year the same pace as last quarter This is a slower growth rate than  and the first

Microsofts overall commercial cloud computing revenue which includes both Azure and subscriptions to cloudbased Office  grew  percent to  billionThey havent just changed the product set  they have literally changed the culture and they are really acting like a cloud platform Mr Reback said He added that Microsoft uses the constant flow of data passing though its cloud computing services to develop and improve its products and sales more quicklyMicrosoft has found success in offering a socalled hybrid cloud offering in which customers keep some data on their own servers and others in the cloud and manage it all with a single set of tools Analysts say the company has an advantage over Amazon in that area because so many large business already use Microsoft tools on their serversAmy Hood Microsofts chief financial officer pointed to  percent growth in server products and cloud services revenue as an indicator of strength in that business She said that figure includes pure Azure sales as well as premium traditional server sales that can be managed together That gives customers flexibility to decide when to move she saidSome customers adopt Azure just for basic cloud computing but Microsoft is looking for ways to bring technology deeper into how businesses operate what Mr Nadella has called embracing tech intensityThe opportunity for our shareholders when they think about Microsoft has never been better Mr Nadella said in a call with analysts He said Microsofts interests align with those of its customers because the companys cloud products often bring in revenue from subscriptions and use rather than large upfront costs We want to make sure we are in fact making our customers fully capable digital customers in their own right he saidMicrosoft and Kroger are working to develop cloudconnected physical retail stores with new products like digital price tags and sensors to track shoppers and show them customized ads Another partnership with Walgreens Boots

election security nuclear policy and foreign relationsMicrosoft didnt address what country the attacks came from but it blamed a group of hackers sometimes called Fancy Bear Online security companies have identified Fancy Bear as a Russian group and it is widely believed to be tied to Russian intelligenceFancy Bear was involved in the  hacking of the Democratic National Committee in the United States according to the party and security researchers Last year the American authorities indicted  Russian intelligence officers related to the hacks of the party headquarters and the Clinton presidential campaignRussian officials have denied that Moscow had any role in the hacking attemptsDespite scrutiny of groups like Fancy Bear the attacks have continued Last year the same hacking group similarly targeted Republican think tanks that had criticized President Trump before the midterm elections in the United States Microsoft also detected those as part of its cybersecurity operationsIncreasingly the attacks have also targeted groups that are not directly involved in elections but seek to steer debate or focus on specific targets as both the  attacks and the new attacks disclosed in Europe showMicrosoft said the latest attacks had taken place in advance of the European Parliament elections which are set for May as well as several key national electionsThe company said the attacks occurred between September and December and took the form of spearfishing campaigns Spearfishing involves sending emails that appear to come from legitimate sources to get users to click the links inside If a user clicks those links hackers can install malware steal passwords or conduct other online mischiefThe German Council on Foreign Relations the European offices of the Aspen Institute and the German Marshall Fund of the United States were among the groups that were targeted and agreed to be disclosed Microsoft saidIn a statement on its website the German Marshall

explosive growth of tech hubs Now Microsoft arguing that the industry has an interest and responsibility to help people left behind in communities transformed by the boom is putting up  million to help address the problemMicrosofts money represents the most ambitious effort by a tech company to directly address the inequality that has spread in areas where the industry is concentrated particularly on the West Coast It will fund construction for homes affordable not only to the companys own nontech workers but also for teachers firefighters and other middle and lowincome residentsMicrosofts move comes less than a year after Amazon successfully pushed to block a new tax in Seattle that would have made large businesses pay a peremployee tax to fund homeless services and the construction of affordable housing The company said the tax created a disincentive to create jobs Microsoft which is based in nearby Redmond Wash and has few employees who work in the city did not take a position on the taxThe debate about the rapid growth of the tech industry and the inequality that often follows has spilled across the country particularly as Amazon with billions of taxpayer subsidies announced plans to build major campuses in Long Island City Queens and Arlington Va that would employ a total of at least  people In New York elected officials and residents have raised concerns that Amazon has not made commitments to support affordable housingMicrosoft has been at the vanguard of warning about the potential negative effects of technology like privacy or the unintended consequences of artificial intelligence Executives hope the housing efforts will spur other companies to follow its leadWe believe everybody has a role to play and everybody needs to play their role said Brad Smith Microsofts president and chief legal officerThe companys strong finances a sign of its resurgence under Satya Nadella as chief executive have given it resources to deploy Mr

supported homeless service providers through his personal foundation and the Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff helped fund a proposition in San Francisco to tax businesses to pay for homeless services Voters approved the tax in November rejecting opposition from some tech leaders including Twitters chief executive Jack DorseyOthers plan to build housing for their own employees Such housing may help with demand but it has also reinforced the impression that the companies are focused too closely on their own backyardsThis is longrange thinking by a company that has been around for a long time and plans to be around for a long time said Margaret OMara a professor at the University of Washington who studies the history of tech companiesMicrosoft began researching the regions housing last summer after the nasty tax fight in Seattle and around a peak of the housing market The company analyzed data and hired a consultant to decide how to focus its work The areas home prices have almost doubled in the past eight years and Mr Smith said he learned that the region has counterintuitively done less to build middleincome housing than lowincome housing especially in the suburbsThat squeeze hits a range of workers Of course we have lots of software engineers but the reality is that a lot of people work for Microsoft Cafeteria workers shuttle drivers Mr Nadella said this week at a meeting with editors at the companys headquarters It is a supply problem a market failureMicrosoft plans to lend  million at subsidized rates to preserve and build middleincome housing in six cities near its Redmond headquarters It will put an additional  million into lowincome housing across the region Some of those loans may be made through the federal programs that provide tax breaks for lowincome housingThe company plans to invest the money within three years and expects most of it to go to Seattles suburbsThe loans could go to private or nonprofit developers or to governmental groups like the King County Housing Authority As the loans are repaid Mr Smith said Microsoft plans to lend the money out again to support additional projectsThe remaining  million will be grants to local organizations that work with the homeless including legal aid for people fighting eviction The Seattle Times reported Wednesday that if the  million were put into one project it would create only about  units so instead Microsoft will most likely put smaller amounts in many projects to help build tens of thousands of unitsThe initial reaction to the companys announcement was positiveThere is almost no level of housing that isnt direly needed said Claudia Balducci a member of the King County Council who helps lead the Regional Affordable Housing Task ForceA report in December by the task force said that the region needs  more affordable housing units and will need  more units by  to accommodate future growthA growing body of research has tied the lack of affordable housing to increasing homelessness A December study from the real estate website Zillow said that was particularly true when households pay more than a third of their income in rent The New York Boston Los Angeles San Francisco and Seattle regions  the countrys largest tech hubs  have all already crossed that thresholdThe idea that you can live in your bubble and put your fingers in your ears just

for Tiananmen Square or the Falun Gong religious group were similarly scrubbed though over the years users reported that using coded language could help turn up posts about some topics that were generally controlledBlocking Bing would brick over one of the last holes in a wall of online filters that has isolated Chinas internet from the rest of the world Although not widely used in China Bing has remained an option of last resort for some in China looking for an alternative to the dominant local search engine Baidu While it continues to dominate search traffic in China Baidu has been at the center of complaints about poor search results and advertisements for questionable medical treatmentsEarlier this week a former journalist Fang Kecheng accused Baidu of largely returning search results that were links to its own products instead of those from external sites The accusation which Mr Fang posted on social media with the headline Baidu the Search Engine is Dead went viral in ChinaBaidu said in a statement that less than  percent of its search results included one specific Baidu product that Mr Fang had singled out and that its practices of using its own products in search results helped speed up download timesIn an interview Mr Fang said the Chinese internet was developing into a series of walled gardens rather than the sprawling forum for ideas that makes online life appealing to many thanks to censorship and to the rise of big Chinese internet companies like Tencent and Bytedance that dominate the online experience on mobile phones Blocking Bing would only make it worseBing compromised in order to have a Chinese version to get into the country said Mr Fang a doctoral candidate at the Annenberg School for Communication at University of Pennsylvania It would be pathetic if even this cant exist We have one less alternativeChina has long been a difficult market for Microsoft For years it struggled to contend with widespread piracy of its Windows and Office softwareIn July  four of its offices in China were stormed by officials who questioned executives copied contracts and records and downloaded data from the companys servers What was described as an antitrust inquiry was spurred by Microsofts decision to end support for older Windows software to encourage users to switch to newer versions that were more difficult to pirate according to analysts The withdrawal of support for a still widely used if dated version of Windows only underscored the countrys reliance on foreign softwareIn  to ensure state support for Windows the company partnered with a staterun firm to produce a governmentapproved version of its Windows  software The firm Chinese Electronics Technology Corporation makes electronics for the Chinese military and is a major vendor of surveillance technology in Xinjiang where the government has thrown hundreds of thousands of Uighurs a local Muslim minority into reeducation campsBeijing has insisted on closer scrutiny of software used by government agencies and companies since Edward Snowden a former American government consultant revealed that United States intelligence agencies used American technology for hacking purposesDespite the difficulties foreign companies still hold out hope for access to China which with its size and its thriving mobile phone culture represents a potentially vast market LinkedIn and Airbnb still have businesses there though they take pains to comply with local laws LinkedIn which Microsoft bought in  censors content in China and Airbnb coordinates with local authorities to provide access about who is staying at its listingsBut trade tensions between China and the United States are only adding to the difficulties Many American companies along with Trump administration officials accuse China of systematically forcing American companies to hand over their intellectual property to local partners or to government officials in the name of national security So far China has stopped short of boycotting American products which could escalate the trade conflict and damage the Chinese economyBaidus falling reputation led to some support among Chinas intelligentsia for a reentry by Google into the market with a censored search engine internally codenamed Project Dragonfly Its plans led to widespread criticism from Googles own employees Some Chinese activists also protested arguing a censored search would be tantamount to complicity with Chinese censorship Googles chief executive Sundar Pichai has said it is not close to launching a search product in ChinaMr Fang the former journalist said he had mixed feelings about a Google reentry noting that it would be good for Chinese who want a better search engine but also that it would normalize censorshipI feel people in the West can say from their point of view that they are totally against Google coming back as they have nothing to do with China he said But as someone who truly wishes that Chinese are able to get betterquality information I cant  percent stand against itPaul Mozur reported from Shanghai and Karen Weise from Seattle Qiqing Lin contributed researchAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byCities should treat rising rents like pollution and tax the companies that cause itBy E Tammy KimMs Kim is a journalistOn Wednesday Microsoft announced a commitment of  million to advance affordable housing solutions in the greater Seattle area While it was striking for the company to acknowledge how supremely difficult it is for lower and middleincome workers to afford to live close to where they work  percent of its commitment would be in the form of loans to housing developers much of it for marketrate housing that will benefit moreaffluent residentsWhat is needed in Seattle  as well as San Francisco Austin Tex New York City Boulder Colo and other urban areas where the rapid influx of highpaid tech workers has made housing unaffordable for nearly everyone else  isnt a corporate takeover of housing policy but rather a peremployee head tax that would fund real investments in affordable housing which should be a public goodThe notion of a head tax isnt unprecedented even in Seattle In May  faced with a crisis of homelessness and housing insecurity the Seattle City Council levied a fee of  per employee on corporations whose annual revenues exceed  million  the most conspicuous of which is Amazon Microsoft is based in nearby Redmond Wash The tax would have raised a modest but useful sum to build affordable housing units and fund social services But just weeks later after Amazon hinted that it might leave Seattle altogether the Council voted overwhelmingly to reverse its decisionIt was a terrible loss for Seattles housing advocates who were hoping for a systemic response to doubling rents inhumanely fast evictions Washington State has a threeday notice period and a rise in the number of families living in their cars And they were not reassured when a few months after killing the head tax Jeff Bezos Amazons chief executive announced that he would pay a minimum wage of  per hour to all of its United States workers a boost to lowwage warehouse and cafeteria workers But in Seattle where the minimum wage is now  for big employers low wages cannot buy decent housing The average rent in Seattle was nearly  in  and nearly half of all renters spent more than  percent of their incomes on housing For many workers  or even  an hour at  or  hours a week means couchsurfing At a deeper level by rejecting taxation but agreeing to a wage increase Amazon seemed to imply that corporations rather than the government should dictate the terms of redistribution The same is true of Microsofts  million pledge It subordinates public policy to a wealonecanfixit hubris Rather than becoming landlords tech giants should pay their fair share More and more cities are pushing them to do so In November voters in San Francisco approved Proposition C a tax on large businesses that will fund homeless services Down the peninsula residents of East Palo Alto where Amazon recently leased  square feet of office space for  new employees approved a parcel tax on large plots of commercial real estate In Googles hometown Mountain View  percent of voters said yes to a peremployee tax to fund transportation and affordable housing These California cities are providing the rest of the United States with a template to address the housing crisis local targeted taxes on large companies that employ a significant proportion of high earners Such taxes could be based on square footage the number of employees or even workers salary range and would apply to any industry  not just tech  that puts pressure on the local housing market by suddenly hiring thousands of highly paid employees Such measures do not make businesses pay a price for creating jobs as corporations opposing the Seattle head tax claimed They are a tax on negative externalities  something akin to a pollution tax A halfcentury ago it seemed inconceivable that factories smelters or power plants should have to account for the toxins they released into the air But we have since accepted the idea that businesses should pay the public for the negative externalities they cause Today corporations must answer for increased rents and evictions and for worsening traffic jams Like air and water pollution these costs are shared by all of usModestly taxing gentrification is unlikely to drive tech companies into suburbia their employees increasingly prefer the amenities of city life Its true that a head tax could make one place less desirable than another  Amazon played off that fear with its implied threat to leave Seattle  but the answer is not for cities to give up billions of dollars in tax incentives A better approach is for all metropolitan areas that are being transformed by the extremes of corporate wealth to enact redistributive policies focused on housing justice There are many possible solutions Across the country local advocates are pushing for increased housing subsidies rentstabilization laws renter protections to prevent arbitrary eviction permanently affordable public and private housing community land trusts and free legal representation and emergency funds to prevent tenants from being evicted Some combination of these measures deployed on a large scale  and funded through corporate taxes  is needed to address what is so clearly a crisisCall it a head tax or a luxury tax But recognize what is behind it the rapid rise of companies employing tens of thousands of highearning workers has caused and will continue to cause displacement This has happened in the Seattle area and Silicon Valley and it will soon happen in Long Island City and Northern Virginia where Amazon will add two new headquarters Unaffordable rents are not a personal failing or an inevitable outcome of the market they are a corporate externality as

on the Sony PlayStationBut as the handheld controllers became more complex and her muscular dystrophy became more debilitating she was eventually forced to stop playing console games Even holding a controller is difficult for Ms Hawley because of the weight and her hands are unable to reach certain buttonsTo support gamers with physical disabilities an industrious community has for years modified existing controllers or devised new ones altogether And now those efforts by organizations like Warfighter Engaged the AbleGamers Charity and SpecialEffect have been amplified by Microsoft which in September released an adaptive controller for the Xbox OneWe tried to figure out a way to accelerate their practices so that they could help more people said Bryce Johnson Microsofts inclusive lead for product research and accessibility The idea of cracking open a controller for someone who just needs a couple of extra buttons is an arduous taskThat gray rectangle with two red buttons is a gaming relic Modern controllers require the player to combine a sweeping legato  two analog sticks one controlling a characters head and one its feet are used simultaneously  with the precise staccato of four buttons two triggers and two bumpersIt can be challenging and especially so for those with physical disabilities Some esports competitors have operated controllers with their lips and chin or their cheek and tongue Ms Hawley  cannot use her index finger to pull the right trigger on the traditional Xbox controllerInstead she can press an elbow against one of the two fourinch buttons on the adaptive controller which she tested for Microsoft and which has resurrected a pastime She now plays games like Mortal Kombat and Kingdom Hearts with her brother and her niece every SundayThe power of the adaptive controller stems from its  millimeter input jacks and two USB ports which enable users to plug in peripherals like external switches and buttons Many players share intel about setups to accommodate specific physical needsA lot of my friends it just changed how they gamed said Ms Hawley who created the Geeky Gimp website which examines how the entertainment industry portrays disabilities And its also changed how they engage in the communityPowerful and reliable hardware is foundational for the video game industry which generated an estimated  billion  the vast majority of its revenue  in software sales last year according to the analyst group NewzooComputer gaming has long had an ethos of customization and Ms Hawley turned there during the six years she did not play console games She can operate a keyboard and mouse and people without use of their hands can benefit from eyetracking and voice commandsBut console developers design their products for the masses and people with disabilities had long been overlooked In  Nintendo released a handsfree controller that players operated with their chins while blowing into and sucking from a tube but for decades the market was ceded to external creatorsIt takes Benjamin J Heckendorn about three hours to create a dozen parts on a D printer and screw them to the bottom of a traditional Xbox controller The first onehanded controller he built was for a veteran who had lost an arm in the Iraq War he has sold about  since for  each many to customers who have had strokes or been in motorcycle crashesPart of the recovery process is doing the normal things in life you love Mr Heckendorn said and for an increasing number of people thats video gamesThe Adroit Switchblade a  black box sprinkled with ports to plug in auxiliary controls was a precursor to Microsofts adaptive controller It truly was a person sitting there all day soldering wires together and testing it said Mark Barlet the founder of AbleGamers which teamed up with Evil Controllers to distribute about  SwitchbladesMicrosofts adaptive controller was envisioned at an internal hackathon in  and refined in consultation with nonprofits and hospitals Its reach was extended by the cost savings of mass production and an advertising budget large enough to air a Super Bowl commercialKeeping the controller reasonably priced was important to Microsoft Mr Johnson said It costs  but maximizing its potential  unlike the traditional  controller it does not come with analog sticks or rumble packs which vibrate to provide tactile feedback  will require a larger investment On its website Microsoft lists thirdparty attachments ranging from a  foot pedal to a  mouthoperated joystickThe controllers versatility Mr Johnson said may also make it attractive to professional gamers who value any technical advantages And accessibility is expected to become more important to the gaming industry as an aging user base faces more physical limitations including loss of fine motor skills vision and hearingMost games now let players wholly remap controllers so any ingame action such as reloading a weapon can be assigned to any physical input Recent blockbuster titles like Uncharted  A Thiefs End and Shadow of the Tomb Raider allow players to navigate using only one of the two analog sticks and Microsoft has introduced a copilot feature that allows two controllers to act as oneThe increased commitment to accessibility has benefited people who frequently turn to video games as a respite from the physical demands and social pressures of the real worldIf youre on the streets everyone knows youre a profoundly disabled individual Mr Barlet said You cant hide this fact But in a video game youre a player We all jump

On June   Google made a pledge to its small but growing number of customers in a blunt word statement Google is sensitive to the privacy concerns of its users The internet allows individuals to explore and communicate with unprecedented ease but it also allows websites to collect and distribute personal information with equal ease We at Google know that many users are understandably concerned about such practicesThe statement which today reads like a quaint artifact of a simpler time would become the companys first privacy policy  a gently lawyered explanation of how the company collects and distributes its users data and information Googles was far from the first privacy statement from a big technology business but its one of the first examples of the form from a company that helped lay the foundation for the modern informationguzzling internetAs technology advances will it continue to blur the lines between public and private Sign up for Charlie Warzels limitedrun newsletter to explore whats at stake and what you can do about it  And it wasnt only Google that was sensitive to the privacy concerns of its users All of todays tech giants have made similar commitmentsIn  the Microsoft founder Bill Gates declared Users should be in control of how their data is usedThree years later Facebook through its founder Mark Zuckerberg echoed the statement in a note to its campus user base We give you control of your informationSimilar statements from countless technology companies have followed in the years since Over that time they have said they would like to protect your privacy  even as many companies began to collect and display information invasivelyTechnology companies have also tried to explain all the ways they protect your privacy  but the rhetoric was different from reality where a number of companies experienced hacks and data breachesSince the early s companies have argued that despite all the data they collect you still own it  and yet default designs and settings and lax security have long left information vulnerableFinally since the advent of concerns about Google and Facebooks use of personal data for advertising  companies have pointed out that they dont sell your data  and nonetheless many of the companies business models are predicated on a targeted advertising model that relies on the continued collection of increasingly personal informationIts been almost  years since Googles first privacy statement The internet today is a significantly different place one thats largely powered by the transmission and transfer of our personal information Data breaches  some of vertiginous scale  are common as is the creeping sense that in order to log on were forced to submit to being tracked and targetedBut if the modern internet has changed greatly the statements from the multinational corporations that transformed it have remained strikingly similar The tech companies and their leaders have been saying we

says computer science is a foundational skill one that future doctors lawyers and politicians should all possess Hadi Partovi the founder of CodeorgCreditCreditMatt Edge for The New York TimesSupported byBy David GellesJust how much influence should Silicon Valley have over the classroom Its a question roiling educational circles and one The New York Times explored in a recent series of articles At the center of the debate are organizations like Codeorg a nonprofit group that advocates computer science training and provides coding curriculum for schools around the country Founded by Hadi Partovi an Iranian immigrant who had an enormously successful career in the technology industry Codeorg is backed by companies including Google Facebook and MicrosoftMr Partovi grew up in Iran during the revolution moving to the United States when he was  He attended Harvard then joined Microsoft where he worked on Internet Explorer during the browser wars After leaving Microsoft he founded Tellme Networks which was acquired by Microsoft for  million He is also an angel investor and was an early backer of Facebook Dropbox and AirbnbMr Partovis relatives are similarly precocious His twin brother Ali also founded a company that was sold to Microsoft And his cousins include Dara Khosrowshahi the chief executive of Uber as well as senior executives at Intel Google and Allen  Company the influential investment bank This interview which was condensed and edited for clarity was conducted in San Francisco What was your childhood like When I was  and the country was going through a revolution and war I dont remember thinking Oh my god Im suffering hardship I had no context I just was like OK This sucks But I can just go on with the day I got used to seeing people getting killed and waking up every morning to go to the roof to see which houses near us were still standing or not Thinking about it now Im like God thats horrible Back then that was just routineWhat did your parents do Both my parents were educated in the United States My dad had gone to MIT My mom was a computer scientist from Boston University And we had a whole lot of extended family herePart of the challenge for me living in Iran was that my entire family other than my mom and dad and brother basically had left and fled the country and we stayed behind The reason we stayed behind was that my father had started the technology university there and he said The countrys going through all this challenge but if the education system falls apart who knows whats going to happenWhen did you get interested in technology My dad started teaching us on a programmable calculator when my brother and I were  years old And then the next year he brought a Commodore  home In Iran at the time there was nothing fun to do There was no Xbox no PlayStation no internet We had one TV channel it was all propaganda There were no sports in school So for us this computer was an escape from just a horrid life situation It was really the only good thing we had in our lifeHow did you get out of IranTo get the permission to leave my dad had to promise the minister of education that he was coming back  that he wasnt taking his family to leave forever He was like I give you my word Im coming back And when we came to America pretty much the first thing he did was to say All right Im going back You guys can stay here My mom was like What are you talking about Were done with that country And he said I just want to go for one or two years because I gave my word and then Ill join you guys So we spent a year or two in America with our dad living in Iran only because he wanted to stay true to his wordTell me about arriving in the United StatesWe were not welloff at all Our family couldnt afford a home So all four of us lived in one bedroom in my grandmas house in one bed which is an awkward thing to do when youre  years old My parents worked three jobs but they put all of the money toward our education That left an imprint of how important education is Education is the No  thing you should invest inYou have many relatives whove also been successful in the technology industry How do you explain that Entrepreneurship is in my familys blood My grandfather and all of his brothers started a great company together almost  years ago It was called Alborz Corporation and it was one of the largest industrial companies in Iran They started by being a trading company and importing goods but then all the most popular goods theyd import theyd start manufacturing locally in partnership with whoever was the original producer Then the entire company was taken away by the government as part of the revolution So growing up in America there was this desire for us to effectively make back the money that our family had lostAfter you graduated college you went to work for Microsoft What did you work on while you were thereThe project Im most proud of is Internet Explorer Today Internet Explorer is the dead bastard stepchild of the Web browser market But I joined that team when it was nine people and two years behind Netscape Navigator in the famous browser wars It was one of the craziest startup experiences in a very large company My proudest creation there was Internet Explorer  and  At the time it was a really fantastic productIts a bit hard to imagine Microsoft acting like a startupThe Internet Explorer team was probably the hardestworking team Ive ever been on And Ive been at multiple startups We would have foosball tournaments for the team at  am just to get everybodys energy back up to continue working Everybody was working every day every night One of the team managers had a sign on his door saying This is why Im going home this evening And it was a picture that his daughter had made of the family that showed mommy and daddy and son But the picture of daddy was a car leaving the garage There were many divorces and broken families and bad things that came out of that But what I learned was that even at a person company you can get a team of  or  people to work like their life depends on itYouve gone on to be an angel investor How do you decide which companies to invest inI give coding interviews to the chief technology officers of any startup I invest in When I met Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi from Dropbox I flew them out to meet in Seattle and I had them both do coding interviews in my house I had them take a list of numbers and remove all the duplicates from the list And the other was to write the code to shuffle a deck of cards So relatively simple stuff I mean you should be able to do it in  minutes if you know what youre doing Its not rocket scienceIm not a coder Is there one right answer to those questionsNo Theres a little back and forth of seeing how youre going to go about the problem And also since these were two that were going to be startup founders what are their communication skills like Because if the CEO just writes the answers and gives it back to you thats different than if they walk you through their thinking and explain why they come up with something When youre interviewing a potential leader you need to look for both of those thingsHow did Codeorg get startedThe moment of inspiration was the day Steve Jobs died I had wanted to make a video that featured the best technologists talking about the importance of computer science and I was like God The best of them just died He cant be in my video anymore That gave me the onus to start CodeorgAnd why is it so important that kids learn to code The idea for Codeorg isnt that every kid should learn to code its that every school should teach computer science We use the word coding because its more hip But computer science really is a subject that needs to be taught And the reason for this isnt because theres so many coding jobs or that coding pays well or things like that The reason is because computer science is foundational Every school teaches biology every school teaches chemistry every school teaches algebra You wouldnt envision going to a school that just said We dont teach that Weve done some reporting on the influence that big tech companies are gaining over educational curriculum Is that appropriate What Codeorg does is focus primarily on foundational learning And even when we involve our industry donors were very clear with them that what were doing isnt vocational You cant take Codeorgs courses and then get a job at Google But it gets you interested that maybe hey I might want to pursue thatThere are a few companies that are proactively trying to get their platform into schools or trying to sell their devices into schools and theres some selfinterest there but the Codeorg ecosystem doesnt have that Do you think there should be legislation that mandates schools teach computer scienceI believe schools should be mandated to teach computer science You would never send your child to a school that didnt teach math In the st century computer science is as important as biology Understanding photosynthesis or HO or electricity is just as foundational as understanding how the internet works or what an algorithm is These things are impacting our daily lives We need future lawyers and doctors and politicians to all understand it Were not trying to prepare kids for jobs Were trying to prepare kids for lifeDavid Gelles is the Corner Office columnist and a business reporter Follow him on LinkedIn and Twitter  dgelles AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftBy Kevin RooseOver the past few months a fierce debate has erupted in Silicon Valley over whether large technology companies like Amazon Google and Microsoft should join forces with the United States military along with agencies like Immigration and Customs EnforcementThe debate has largely been conducted along ethical linesOn one side are tech executives and many government officials who argue that at a time when advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning are poised to reshape top issues like drone warfare or border security American tech giants have a patriotic duty to pitch inJeff Bezos Amazons chief executive summed up this view last year If big tech companies are going to turn their back on the US Department of Defense this country is going to be in troubleOn the other side are groups of employees at those companies including many antiTrump progressives who dont want their tools to be used for drone warfare immigrant detention and other projects they consider immoral This side took a stand at Microsoft last month when a group of employees wrote an open letter to the companys top executives demanding that they abandon an Army contract that would adapt HoloLens the companys augmentedreality headsets for use by soldiers on the battlefieldWe did not sign up to develop weapons and we demand a say in how our work is used the Microsoft employees wroteThis is a debate worth having But there is a more pragmatic question swirling around it one surprisingly few people are asking Namely Could Big Techs decision to pursue controversial defense and law enforcement contracts be a financial mistakeAs business deals some of these contracts seem like nobrainers Microsofts HoloLens deal is worth about  million  less than  percent of the companys  revenue but a meaningful sum nonetheless Amazon IBM Microsoft and Oracle are all battling over a Defense Department cloudcomputing contract known as Project JEDI that will be worth as much as  billion to the winning bidderBut these contracts may be less lucrative than they appear And in fact they could come with enormous hidden costs in the form of damaged reputations recruiting problems and customer boycotts that could swamp any shortterm gainsTo explain why lets consider one of the most notorious military contracts of the past centuryIn  Dow Chemical a Michiganbased chemicals manufacturer was awarded a  million Department of Defense contract to produce napalm a highly incendiary chemical used by American troops during the Vietnam WartranscriptHosted by Michael Barbaro produced by Rachel Quester and Clare Toeniskoetter and edited by Lisa TobinShould Big Tech partner with the Pentagon We examine a cautionary talemichael barbaroFrom The New York Times Im Michael Barbaro This is The Daily Today Across Silicon Valley tech companies are pursuing contracts with the US military Kevin Roose on a cautionary tale of where that can lead Its Wednesday March kevin rooseSo Im a tech columnist I spend a lot of time talking with and looking at the big tech companies and where theyre going And one of the most interesting threads thats come up in the past year or so is this question of how Silicon Valley should engage with the government and with the military specifically And I think were at a point right now where the government is saying we want the things that youre building We want you to be part of our modernization effortsmichael barbaroMmhmmkevin rooseAnd within some of these companies theres a growing divide between the management of the companies and what they want for their business and some of the people actually building this technology  the engineers who are working on these advanced systems that are in hot demand by the military and other government agencies And we just saw this play out in a pretty meaningful way at Microsoftmichael barbaroWhat happened there exactly So last year Microsoft signed a contract with the Department of Defense to use a technology called HoloLens in the Armyarchived recordingGood morning everyone A few years ago we started asking ourselves could we make things so simple that technology would just disappearkevin rooseAnd HoloLens was originally developed  its kind of like a headset for augmented realityarchived recordingCould we place your digital content right into your world right into your life with more reality than ever beforekevin rooseI saw a demo of this a couple years ago and they were touting it as the next generation of gamingmichael barbaroMmhmmarchived recordingWelcome to a new era of Windows Welcome to Windows Holographickevin roosePeople were wearing HoloLens and you would be swinging your imaginary sword at imaginary monsters But it all looked like it was happening right there in your living roommichael barbaroMmhmmkevin rooseAnd last year Microsoft signed a contract to develop HoloLens technology for use on the battlefield  to give soldiers the ability to wear these headsets and get information about their surroundings and to increase the lethality of the soldiers on the battlefieldmichael barbaroSo this technology will specifically be deployed within the military so that American soldiers are better at killing the enemykevin rooseThats the way its described in the contract yesmichael barbaroAnd so Im guessing that this was something that Microsoft engineers objected toarchived recordingAnd then theres Microsoft Theyre receiving backlash from their own employees over new groundbreaking technologykevin rooseWell a few of them did But they did it pretty vocallyarchived recordingYeah so more than  Microsoft employees signed a letter demanding that the company cancel a  million contract to build a HoloLens for the Pentagon saying they quote kevin rooseDear Satya Nadella and Brad Smith We are a global coalition of Microsoft workers and we refuse to create technology for warfare and oppression And it goes on And basically they argue that this crossed the line into weapons development  that this was basically taking something that they had built and turned it into something that was designed to help soldiers on the battlefield kill other soldiersmichael barbaroNot what they decided to dokevin rooseRight Not their intent not what they were told they were going to be working on and not something they were comfortable withmichael barbaroAnd Kevin thinking about this its hard to imagine that the US military would not use US technology Americanmade technology like this in warfare That seems inevitable doesnt itkevin rooseWell right I mean as long as there has been a US tech industry theres been a partnership with the US government and with the military I mean the original internet came out of a Defense Department projectmichael barbaroMmhmmkevin rooseAnd since then lots of advances in technology have been spurred by this collaboration between the Pentagon and Silicon Valley And a lot of these companies already provide technology to the military I mean a lot of military computers run Windowss operating system But this was a bridge too far for these employees They say were OK basically providing generaluse technology the same stuff that you and I could go and buy But the specific development of our technology for use in this specific case crosses a line for us and we dont want to be a part of itmichael barbaroSo Kevin whats interesting to you about this storykevin rooseWell Im interested in the ethical debate around the use of artificial intelligence and other technologies But Im also a business reporter I think this is a decision that is not just being made along ethical lines These companies are also thinking about their businesses and the amount of money and the profitability of developing these systems for the military So I wanted to look at it along those lines as well Lets just bracket the ethical discussion for a second and say does this make financial sensemichael barbaroWell not just bracket it right Isnt a company often going to make decisions about moral dilemmas based on the implications to their financeskevin rooseExactly These are not philanthropies or think tanks These are forprofit corporations that generally operate on a costbenefit calculation And so just on that plane I wanted to see does this make sense for them MUSIC And so I did a little bit of digging and I went back about  years in history and I found an example of a company that sold something to the military and later came to regret itmichael barbaroWhich was whatkevin rooseIts the case of Dow Chemical In  Dow Chemical is this small littleknown chemicals company based in Michigan They make lots of different things  household chemicals agricultural chemicalsarchived recordingNow at your favorite grocery store the most amazing food wrap ever developedkevin rooseThey were probably best known for making Saran Wrapmichael barbaroHeard of itarchived recording speaker Have you tried Saran Wrap It really is amazing And look Saran Wrap clings like magicarchived recording speaker Saran Wrap is a product of the Dow Chemical Companyarchived recording speaker JET PLANES AND EXPLOSIONS Vietnam United States helicopter gunships backed up ground forces in a strong assault on a Viet Cong position kevin rooseMeanwhile the Vietnam War is happening And in  Dow Chemical wins a contract with the Department of Defense to produce a new chemical called napalm B And napalm which is a highly flammable gel that binds and sticks to things and then burns them  had been in use But napalm B was the new formulation and the military was very excited in using this in Vietnamarchived recordingTroops followed up the advantage gained by the air support to knock out the VCkevin rooseThey thought it had a lot of promise on the battlefield It was hard to contain and hard to put out It was a very effective form of weaponry  a very horrible form of weaponry And it produced very very bad burns on people They would basically be burned alive And so theres not much noise about this for the first little while And then Americans start seeing images from the Vietnam War And for a lot of people this is their first time seeing the effects of napalmmichael barbaroMmhmmkevin rooseMost famously theres this photograph  youve probably seen it It won the Pulitzer Prize It is a photograph of a yearold girl whos been badly burned by a napalm weaponarchived recording martin luther king jrSo far we may have killed a million of them mostly childrenkevin rooseAnd it sort of shocks the American public and it galvanizes the antiwar movementarchived recording martin luther king jrWhat do they think as we test out our latest weapons on them just as the Germans tested out new medicine and new tortures in the concentration camps of Europearchived recordingCROWDS CHANTING No more napalm No more napalm No more napalm No more napalmkevin rooseAnd they decide to go after the use of napalm by US armed forces And the way that they do that is by going after Dow Chemicalarchived recordingCROWDS CHANTINGarchived recording speaker This is Monday afternoon November  on the San Jose State college campus What youre watching is the result of a demonstration that began about an hour agokevin rooseThey staged demonstrations outside the companys headquarters and they go to dozens of colleges where Dow was recruiting students to come work for themmichael barbaroHmarchived recordingThe professors against the war and the Students for a Democratic Society had marched in front of the administration building to protest the recruitment on this campus by Dow Chemical Company of employeeskevin rooseAnd they protest the recruiting sessions They have signs like Dow deforms children Dow deals deatharchived recordingTheyre not allowing anyone in Like the only people theyre allowing in are those people that are connected with Dow PROTESTERS SHOUTINGkevin rooseMy favorite story from this period is that the Dow recruiters  the people that would go to campus to talk to the students  they would get locked up in classrooms They would get like held hostage by the activists And at one point one of the recruiters got so used to this that he started bringing a sandwich in his briefcase so that if the inevitable happened and he got locked in a room with a bunch of angry protesters michael barbaroHe would survive the daykevin rooseHe would at least have lunchmichael barbaroSo this sounds like a complete corporate nightmare  that your company is so associated with war and with death and not with the household product that you make  Saran Wrapkevin rooseRight And Dow was particularly offended by this because napalm was a very small part of its business I mean it accounted I think for a half of  percent of its annual sales And yet it had sort of come to take over its corporate identity So there was some internal discussion there were some debates within the company and at the board level about what to do whether to stop manufacturing napalm And there were lots of reasons for that I mean there were customer boycotts They did take a financial hit And they had to do a lot to counter their corporate reputation as a warmonger But what they really worried about was recruiting They worried that on these visits to college campuses they werent going to get the best people They werent going to get the scientists and the engineers who would help them in the years ahead And as a result they would have longterm costs not just financial but also in terms of what they were missing out onmichael barbaroThe future employee with moral objections to napalm who doesnt come work at Dow Chemical and make the next blockbuster productkevin rooseRight But ultimately they decided to stand their ground They said we have a duty to produce napalm for the US government Its our patriotic obligation and we can withstand the controversymichael barbaroDow Chemical feels like such an extreme case and it feels quite different from whats going on with these tech companies todaykevin rooseYeah absolutely These are not totally comparable I mean the Vietnam War at this point was extremely unpopular You had these horrific images coming back Theres no good use for napalm right Theres no prosocial healthy use for napalm Its a weapon Whereas a lot of these technologies  AI facial recognition image recognition augmented reality  these can all be used for very productive and healthy things Its only when you put them into a certain context that they can be used for harmmichael barbaroAnd that would seem to be the case for most tech companies right They are developing products not explicitly for the military They just happen to be used that waykevin rooseExactlyarchived recordingArtificial intelligence drones warfare and Google  its a mixture that caused an uproar inside the tech giant where the early motto was Dont be evilkevin rooseThere was a big controversy at Google last year about this military contract known as Project Mavenarchived recordingGoogle is developing artificial intelligence to analyze drone video datakevin rooseAnd this was a Defense Department program that basically used AI and imagerecognition technology to interpret video imagesmichael barbaroMmhmmkevin rooseSo the same kind of AI that Google would use in Google Photos or in its selfdriving car unit to recognize images out on the road archived recordingIt would apparently be used as part of a drone programkevin roose could be used to for example improve the targeting of drone strikes to make drone strikes more accurate to be able to recognize certain people or certain buildings and be able to direct a drone at that target specificallymichael barbaroAgain not what Google engineers probably ever thought the technology would be used forkevin rooseExactly I mean they didnt sign up for that And some of them didnt even know that this was happeningarchived recordingThousands of Google workers now protesting Googles involvement in a Pentagon drone programkevin rooseSo there was a big uproar There was lots of heated internal meetingsarchived recordingAt least  maybe  employees did resignkevin rooseSome resignations michael barbaroWow People quit the company over itkevin rooseYeah people quit the company over itarchived recordingMeantime thousands of Google employees have signed a letter protesting the companys participation in an artificial intelligence project by the Pentagonkevin rooseThere was a petition that was signed by thousands of Google employeesarchived recordingQuote We believe that Google should not be in the business of war Therefore we asked that Project Maven be canceledkevin rooseCalling for the company to not only not enter into this contract but to stop making tools of weaponry altogether And ultimately archived recordingTech giant Google will end a project with the Pentagonkevin rooseGoogle bowed to the pressure They pulled the contract They said they wouldnt renew it They put out a statement saying well still work with the military on other projects but were not going to manufacture weapons and weaponsrelated technology And that seemed to quiet the unrest MUSICmichael barbaroI feel like people would be surprised that a huge tech company like Google would back down like thatkevin rooseYeah I mean it does speak to the difference between a conventional contractor like Dow Chemical and these tech companies I think there are three main differences there The first is that these companies are beloved They have loyal followings and they dont want to do anything to upset that The second is that these companies are very idealistic And in Silicon Valley this is a big deal Companies market themselves not just as profitable enterprises but as humanitarian projects And anything that compromises that hurts themmichael barbaroRight Worldchangerskevin rooseTotally And I think the biggest difference is that employees at these companies  especially the engineers who work on very specialized projects like AI development  have a ton of leverage because there are not very many of them they make a ton of money and theyre really hard to recruit If a couple of chemical engineers walk out of Dow Chemical in protest they can probably find some more where that came from But if hundreds or thousands of AI engineers are upset about a project that Google is working on thats a real threat to their business It doesnt take many people staging a protest or threatening to walk out to really get the attention of senior leadershipmichael barbaroSo these three differences that you just laid out explain why Dow didnt back down despite images of dying children affected by their products whereas Google did back down long long before anything like that happened to itkevin rooseRight And I want to be clear What happened at Google was the exception not the rule This is not happening in any vast quantity across the tech industry At Microsoft for example they came right out and said we appreciate the objections of this small group of employees They can move elsewhere in the company if they want but were committed to seeing this contract through And theyve defended themselves by saying we have a patriotic duty to provide technology to the military We think that we can advocate for the ethical use of technologies like AI if were at the table in these discussions And they say that basically these technologies could be good These could save lives on the battlefield The army has said it wants to use HoloLens not just for combat training but for things like measuring vital signs and monitoring soldiers for concussions and having some sort of hearing protection on peoples ears So those are the kinds of arguments theyre making to justify staying in these contractsmichael barbaroSo the argument here being that engineers who came to these companies to do good having their technology used by the military does not necessarily mean not doing goodkevin rooseYeah I mean thats one of the arguments that theyre making is that basically if the US military doesnt have the best technology available on the market our adversaries will and we will be endangered as a resultmichael barbaroI guess the question is do the engineers buy that argumentkevin rooseWell some of them probably do But as weve seen a number of them dont MUSICmichael barbaroSo Kevin we started by talking about this intersection of the moral and the financial as these tech companies navigate this question of should they work with the military Whats your understanding in Silicon Valley about how these companies are thinking about thatkevin rooseSo I think a lot of these companies have really shifted their view on this in the last couple of years A lot of Silicon Valley companies used to just think of themselves as toolmakers right We build this stuff and we put it out into the world and people use it And our responsibility basically stops at the moment of salearchived recording mark zuckerbergTo me entrepreneurship is about creating change not just creating companieskevin rooseAnd now I think were seeing that these companies are being held responsible by the public and by their own employees not just for the tools theyre building but for how theyre being used in the world And this is not just about the militaryarchived recordingAt this hour some  programmers are threatening to leave Microsoft unless the tech giant drops its contract with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency known as ICEkevin rooseI mean also companies are being scrutinized for working with ICE or working with law enforcementarchived recordingAn Amazon worker is pushing the company to stop selling facial recognition technology to law enforcementkevin rooseSocial media companies are being held responsible for bad things that happen on their platformsarchived recordingFacebook defending Alex Jones this morning saying the platform will continue to allow the video blogger to run video on its site even as it claims to crack down on fake newskevin rooseThis is really happening across technology And as technology embeds itself into every part of our lives were seeing that these companies are having to make new kinds of decisions Its not just a dollarsandcents profitandloss calculation anymore They also have to consider what might happen out in the world once they release these technologiesmichael barbaroWhich is another way of saying that the morality element of this is now playing a much bigger role than it has in the past and perhaps is not beating out financial but rivaling itkevin rooseIts certainly part of the discussion now in a way it hasnt been before Its not just about how much money well make or how many resources it will take Its about what were building and why were building it and who were selling it to MUSICmichael barbaroKevin thank you very muchkevin rooseThank you for having meDow was not known as a defense contractor  in fact until its Pentagon contract the business was best known for making industrial chemicals and household plastics like Saran WrapBut over the next few years as Americans began seeing gruesome images of South Vietnamese children with horrific napalm burns the antiwar movement set its sights on the companyActivists boycotted Dow Chemicals products staged protests at its recruiting events on college campuses and barraged its executives with accusations of unethical war profiteering One demonstration outside the companys annual shareholder meeting featured signs like Dow KnowHow in Every Drop of Napalm Dow Chemical executives dug in their heels They claimed that napalm was a small part of the companys overall business and that it was the companys duty to provide necessary materials to the militaryBut the companys pleas of patriotism were drowned out by the antiwar opposition As Robert M Neer explains in his book Napalm Dow Chemicals reputation plummeted as a result of its napalm contract Its recruiting ability suffered and its marketing department was forced to embark on a long and expensive campaign to win back the publics trustWe went from being a company that made Saran Wrap to keep food fresh to a kind of war machine the companys former chief executive Andrew Liveris said in Dow Chemical stopped making napalm for the military in  just four years after it had begun But the reputational damage haunted the company for decades Dow Chemical merged with DuPont in  the company is still a defense contractor but it produces mainly agricultural and industrial chemicalsAll told the  million napalm contract most likely cost Dow Chemical billions of dollars And it was the kind of unforced error that could have been avoided if company executives had listened to early signs of opposition done some risk analysis and changed courseTodays biggest tech companies are in a similar spot Many of them such as Amazon and Microsoft are among the most beloved brands in the world They employ lots of conscientious idealistic engineers whose skills are highly valuable giving them considerable leverage in discussions about company values And they are operating in an era of heightened consumer sensitivity  in which one misstep can tarnish a brand for yearsTech companies arent making anything as obviously harmful as napalm In fact supporters of these deals argue that some of the technologies being offered to the military such as imagerecognition algorithms that can help better target drone strikes could save civilian livesBut the truth is that tech companies have absolutely no idea how the government will use their products in the future  and how the political landscape might shift throwing them into an unwanted spotlightIn some ways Silicon Valley tech companies face the same choice Dow Chemical faced in  Accept controversial government contracts and risk a damaging backlash or leave those deals to conventional defense contractors and protect their reputationsAlready there are signs of trouble on the horizon At Stanford fliers recently appeared on campus walls urging students not to work for Amazon Microsoft Palantir and other companies with reported contracts with ICE and law enforcement agencies And artificial intelligence experts caution that the stigma of being seen as a war profiteer could repel idealistic recruits for years to comeTop AI talent doesnt want to work for Lockheed Martin said Jack Clark the policy director of OpenAI a nonprofit artificial intelligence labIn fact in todays corporate operating environment turning down controversial military and government contracts could be a selling pointRecently I talked with Rana el Kaliouby a cofounder of Affectiva an artificial emotional intelligence startup Ms el Kaliouby whose software uses AI to track human emotions had several early offers from government agencies including a venture fund backed by the Central Intelligence Agency that wanted to use the product to improve their surveillance capabilitiesEven though the company needed the money at the time it turned down the deals Affectiva has since raised more than  million from other nongovernmental sources and has made ethical AI use a core part of its brandWe wanted to be trusted Ms el Kaliouby said We used the core value of integrity and respecting peoples privacy as a way to weed out use casesTake note tech giants Turning down controversial military and government contracts wont doom your business In fact in the long run your shareholders might

Internet cables in service by 
By ADAM SATARIANO Graphics by KARL RUSSELL TROY GRIGGS and BLACKI MIGLIOZZI  Photographs by CHANG W LEE
The internet consists of tiny bits of code that move around the world traveling along wires as thin as a strand of hair strung across the ocean floor The data zips from New York to Sydney from Hong Kong to London in the time it takes you to read this wordNearly  miles of cable already connect the continents to support our insatiable demand for communication and entertainment Companies have typically pooled their resources to collaborate on undersea cable projects like a freeway for them all to shareBut now Google is going its own way in a firstofitskind project connecting the United States to Chile home to the companys largest data center in Latin AmericaPeople think that data is in the cloud but its not said Jayne Stowell who oversees construction of Googles undersea cable projects Its in the oceanGetting it there is an exacting and timeintensive process A foot ship named Durable will eventually deliver the cable to sea But first the cable is assembled inside a sprawling factory a few hundred yards away in Newington NH The factory owned by the company SubCom is filled with specialized machinery used to maintain tension in the wire and encase it in protective skinThe cables begin as a cluster of strands of tiny threads of glass fibers Lasers propel data down the threads at nearly the speed of light using fiberoptic technology After reaching land and connecting with an existing network the data needed to read an email or open a web page makes its way onto a persons deviceWhile most of us now largely experience the internet through WiFi and phone data plans those systems eventually link up with physical cables that swiftly carry the information across continents or across oceansIn the manufacturing process the cables move through highspeed mills the size of jet engines wrapping the wire in a copper casing that carries electricity across the line to keep the data moving Depending on where the cable will be located plastic steel and tar are added later to help it withstand unpredictable ocean environments When finished the cables will end up the size of a thick garden hoseA year of planning goes into charting a cable route that avoids underwater hazards but the cables still have to withstand heavy currents rock slides earthquakes and interference from fishing trawlers Each cable is expected to last up to  yearsA conveyor that staff members call the Cable Highway moves the cable directly into Durable docked in the Piscataqua River The ship will carry over  miles of cable weighing about  metric tons when fully loadedInside the ship workers spool the cable into cavernous tanks One person walks the cable swiftly in a circle as if laying out a massive garden hose while others lie down to hold it in place to ensure it doesnt snag or knot Even with teams working around the clock it takes about four weeks before the ship is loaded up with enough cable to hit the open seaThe first transAtlantic cable was completed in  to connect the United States and Britain Queen Victoria commemorated the occasion with a message to President James Buchanan that took  hours to transmitWhile new wireless and satellite technologies have been invented in the decades since cables remain the fastest most efficient and least expensive way to send information across the ocean And it is still far from cheap Google would not disclose the cost of its project to Chile but experts say subsea projects cost up to  million depending on the length of the cableIn the modern era telecommunications companies laid most of the cable but over the past decade American tech giants started taking more control Google has backed at least  cables globally Amazon Facebook and Microsoft have invested in others connecting data centers in North America South America Asia Europe and Africa according to TeleGeography a research firmCountries view the undersea cables as critical infrastructure and the projects have been flash points in geopolitical disputes Last year Australia stepped in to block the Chinese technology giant Huawei from building a cable connecting Australia to the Solomon Islands for fear it would give the Chinese government an entry point into its networksContent providers like Microsoft Google Facebook and Amazon now own or lease more than half of the undersea bandwidthShare of used internationalundersea cable bandwidthOthersInternetbackboneContentprovidersOthersInternetbackboneShare of used internationalundersea cable bandwidthContentprovidersYann Durieux a ship captain said one of his most important responsibilities was keeping morale up among his crew during the weeks at sea Building the infrastructure of our digital world is a laborintensive jobWith  bedrooms and  bathrooms the Durable can hold up to  crew members The team splits into two hour shifts Signs warn to be quiet in the hallways because somebody is always sleepingThe ship will carry enough supplies to last at least  days roughly  loaves of bread  gallons of milk  cartons of a dozen eggs  pounds of beef  pounds of chicken and  pounds of rice There are also  rolls of paper towels  rolls of toilet paper  bars of soap and almost  pounds of laundry detergent No alcohol is allowed on boardI still get seasick said Walt Oswald a technician who has been laying cables on ships for  years He sticks a small patch behind his ear to hold back the nausea Its not for everybodyPoor weather is inevitable Swells reach up to  feet occasionally requiring the ship captain to order the subsea cable to be cut so the ship can seek safer waters When conditions improve the ship returns retrieving the cut cable that has been left attached to a floating buoy then splicing it back together before continuingWork on board is slow and plodding The ship at sea for months at a time moves about six miles per hour as the cables are pulled from the giant basins out through openings at the back of the ship Closer to shore where theres more risk of damage an underwater plow is used to bury the cable in the sea floorThe Durable crew doesnt expect the work to slow down anytime soonAfter the Latin America project Google plans to build a new cable running from Virginia to France set to be done by  The company has  data centers open around the world with eight more under construction  all needed to power the trillions of Google searches made each year and the more than  hours of video uploaded to YouTube each minuteIt really is management of a very complex multidimensional chess board said Ms Stowell of Google who wears an undersea cable as a necklaceDemand for undersea cables will only grow as more businesses rely on cloud computing services And technology expected around the corner like more powerful artificial intelligence and driverless cars will all require fast data speeds as well Areas that didnt have internet are now getting access with the United Nations reporting that for the first time more than half the global population is now onlineThis is a huge part of the infrastructure thats making that happen said Debbie Brask the vice president at SubCom who is managing the Google project All of that data is going in the undersea cablesNote Cables shown in the map are ones that are currently in use planned or being constructed They do not show cables that were decommissioned The content providers comprise cables publicly announced that Facebook Google Microsoft or Amazon partly own solely own or are a major capacity buyer of a cable owned by another company

An earlier version of a footnote with a map associated with this article misstated which companies own undersea cables or rely heavily on them The companies include Amazon Facebook Google and Microsoft they do not include Apple and NetflixAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftBy Kevin RooseAUSTIN Tex  Among the techies who attended the annual South by Southwest Interactive conference the past few days the hottest topic of conversation  besides the swarms of drunken idiots careening around Austin on rented electric scooters  was Senator Elizabeth Warrens groundshaking proposal to break up large tech companies like Amazon Google and FacebookIn her proposal which she released on the eve of the conference Ms Warren argued that these companies have abused their power and harmed competition in two big waysThe first is by offering their own products on platforms they control Amazon giving preferential treatment to its house brands or Apple promoting its own apps inside the iOS App Store Ms Warren a Massachusetts Democrat and presidential candidate argues that the companies should be required to do one or the other  sell their own goods or run a thirdparty marketplace  but not bothYou can be an umpire or you can own teams she said But you cant be an umpire and own one of the teams thats in the gameMs Warren also argues that by acquiring potential competitors as in Facebooks acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp large tech companies have made it harder for smaller startups to compete on fair terms She proposes appointing regulators who would undo such mergers and break up the conglomeratesRegulating big tech is quickly becoming a central theme of the  presidential race Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and others have also talked about the need to rein in the tech giants And Ms Warren has demonstrated more technology literacy than most elected officialsBut many of the techindustry insiders I spoke with in Austin including some who agree with Ms Warren that the big companies are too powerful cautioned that some of the details in her proposal were too vague and could backfire if put into effect as writtenMs Warrens plan is a bold first stab at reform and some of her proposals make a lot of sense But Id offer a few editsApply specific fixes to specific problems One shortcoming in Ms Warrens plan  and its an understandable one given that this is a campaign proposal and not a final set of rules  is that it proposes broad solutions to narrow problemsLawmakers dont typically craft regulations for individual companies Thats for good reason A law that specifically targeted Amazon and not its competitors would be seen as creating an unfair double standardInstead Ms Warrens proposal targets technology companies with more than  billion in annual revenue that operate thirdparty marketplaces  a group that includes Apple Amazon Facebook and Google  and proposes a set of rules that apply to all of them as well as any companies that meet the threshold in the future Microsoft which makes more than  billion in annual revenue and has a thirdparty marketplace in the form of the Windows app store was somehow sparedThe problem with applying a onesizefitsfour model to tech as the industry analyst Ben Thompson has written is that the large tech companies have different business models that pose different anticompetitive risks The stranglehold that Google and Facebook have on the digital advertising market is different from the way Amazon muscles out ecommerce brands which is different from the way Apple uses its App Store to force burdensome terms on developersThe possibility of unintended consequences means that tailoring regulations to address each of these problems is important A law that banned Amazon from competing with thirdparty sellers on its platform could also cripple Chromebook laptops or prevent iPhone users from getting access to their iTunes librariesRather than one giant package that crams everything together a set of effective tech regulations would treat each problem discretely and address each with surgical precisionSplit off cloud businesses Ms Warren proposes having big tech companies split off significant chunks of their businesses like separating Googles ad operations from its search engine But she does not mention one of the clearest examples of oligopolistic behavior in the tech industry cloud computingRight now much of the internet is powered by infrastructure owned by a small number of giant tech companies that include Amazon Microsoft and Google These companies make a killing by renting out data storage computing power and other essential services to other businesses essentially selling the picks and shovels of the digital gold rushThe cloudcomputing market may not seem like an obvious antitrust target It is highly competitive and years of price wars between the giants have driven the costs of these services down Doesnt giving young startups the ability to rent worldclass infrastructure make it easier not harder for them to competeYes it does But the concentration of critical infrastructure among so few companies  each of which also operates enormous consumerinternet businesses of its own  gives those companies enormous power and invites anticompetitive abuseFor example lets imagine that Jeff Bezos Amazons chief executive decided to sabotage Netflix which runs on Amazon Web Services Amazons cloudcomputing unit in order to help his companys streaming video service He could theoretically tell the Amazon Web Services team to slow Netflixs traffic or analyze its usage patterns to determine which Netflix shows Amazons streamingvideo team should copyTo be clear Mr Bezos is extremely unlikely to do that given that it would be a scandalous violation of Amazons privacy policies and would cost the company a lucrative customer But the reality that companies with dominant internet services also provide the infrastructure that powers much of the consumer internet is a clear example of the kind of market consolidation Ms Warren is trying to addressAn effective breakup proposal could require companies like Amazon Google and Microsoft to spin their cloudcomputing divisions off into standalone businesses in a manner similar to the one Ms Warren proposed for breaking up ecommerce marketplaces To adapt her baseball analogy tech companies would either play on the team or own the stadium but not bothGet rid of the app tax Another easy specific fix would be to stop Apple and Google the makers of the two dominant mobile operating systems from taking unfair advantage of mobile app developersAt the moment any company that wants to sell inapp purchases or subscriptions through an iOS app must pay what software developers derisively call the Apple tax a fee of  to  percent that Apple skims off the top of inapp purchases and subscriptions bought by users Googles mobile app store charges similar feesThese fees add up quickly Before it removed inapp subscriptions last year Netflix was paying Apple an estimated  a day for the privilege of selling subscriptions in its app And some competitors have begun to complain that these platforms strict developer policies amount to bullying On Wednesday Spotify filed a complaint with the European Commission over Apples App Store policies arguing that they unfairly stifle competitionApple and Google would argue that their fees are justified because operating an app store requires hiring reviewers and security teams and all kinds of other expenses But these companies have monopoly control of their own mobile universes and they have used that power to set up virtual tollbooths that suck billions of dollars a year out of the pockets of smaller competitorsDont get lured into a censorship debate Something bizarre happened on Monday when Facebook momentarily took down several of Ms Warrens Facebook ads promoting her proposal to break up big tech Ms Warren seized on the episode saying it was proof of Facebooks ability to shut down a debate over its powerThe ads were quickly reinstated and Facebook made it clear that the removal was not a case of politically motivated censorship The company has a longstanding policy that limits the use of Facebooks name in ads a measure that is mostly meant to prevent sketchy advertisers from claiming falsely to be Facebooks official quiz game or whateverBut the idea that Facebook would censor one of its prominent critics was irresistible to politicians including Senator Ted Cruz Republican of Texas and other conservative lawmakers who have spent the past several years complaining that social media platforms are engaging in partisan censorshipShes right  Big Tech has way too much power to silence Free Speech Mr Cruz wrote of Ms Warren in a message on TwitterOne problem with the debate over the tech companies power is that it risks conflating real anticompetitive behavior like Facebooks shutting off data access to competitors with imaginary abuses like Mr Cruzs unsupported claims that social media platforms are biased against conservatives The former is a real menace the latter is a badfaith attempt to work the refs and preserve a partisan advantage But in political discourse both can be framed as proof of the need for neutral platformsThe best advice I could possibly give Ms Warren or any other Democrat hoping to bring big tech to heel is to focus squarely on competition and to avoid being sucked into partisan debates about content censorshipThe worst outcome of a push to regulate big tech companies would be a set of rules that made it easier for people to exploit these companies power while leaving their fortresses intactKevin Roose is a columnist for Business and a writeratlarge for The New York Times Magazine His column The Shift examines the intersection of technology business and

Every day people create  roughly  quintillion  followed by  zeros bytes of data For many workers though this deluge of information  and the technology that harvests it  has done little to make work easier Employees today find themselves more distracted and overworked than ever Theyre burdened with mundane tasks from tracking time to scheduling scores of meetings and bombarded with small requests that disrupt focus As a result people are often prevented from sharing strategic expertise and conducting lateral thinking the indirect rather than stepbased problemsolving that inspires creativity and leads to breakthrough ideasWhat can businesses do to make sure employees have the ability to focus and connect with colleagues who can push their thinking Companies need to invest in technologies like AI that constantly analyze data to optimize employees time and help them share new ideas throughout the organization experts say

AI can help workers deploy their skills make unexpected connections and be better prepared for different facets of their dayJaime Teevan the chief scientist for Experiences and Devices at MicrosoftOne of the things were thinking about is how AI can increase the knowledge in an organization by helping a company understand all of its data says Jaime Teevan the chief scientist for Experiences and Devices at Microsoft AI can help workers deploy their skills make unexpected connections and be better prepared for different facets of their dayBut large organizations can be slow and walled off A sales department for instance might have used AI to make a discovery about employee engagement but it might not have the mechanisms to share insights or to help other teams carry out plans Thats why Microsoft is building AI to make it easy for companies large and small to analyze reams of raw data break down silos and share new ways of boosting creativity and job satisfactionCompanies that dont harness their data are operating blind when it comes to managing their workforces says Natalie McCullough the general manager of MyAnalytics and Workplace Analytics at Microsoft Theres so much evidence that heightened employee experience and engagement lead to organizational productivity and ultimately profitability innovation and growth
Freeing Your Mind
 While you might think of AI as a technology that benefits organizations its actually being used to bolster individual success  and often before workers even start their jobs At Microsoft for example the human resources department uses AI to optimize the onboarding of new hiresThe companys HR department uses its Workplace Analytics software to securely merge employee collaboration data like time spent in meetings and on email with employee engagement data to determine the factors that lead to successful onboarding and support employees As a result Microsofts HR department discovered key markers that can spark greater productivity and engagement during an employees first  days at work The HR department shared these insights with other groups at Microsoft so they could be used throughout the company

When youre in meetings all day theres little time for deep thought or cognitive workNatalie McCullough the general manager of MyAnalytics and Workplace Analytics at MicrosoftOnce employees are onboarded AI can curtail tiresome tasks that often stifle creative thinking Microsoft built AI for instance into its productivity apps that act as personal assistants flagging missed emails suggesting meeting locations transcribing notes and even blocking off time for lunch and quiet thinking And when an employee is on her way to a meeting intelligent technologies like Microsoft  can save time by surfacing insights from LinkedIn highlighting relevant materials and sharing documents before the event beginsLike any good intuitive assistant AI can also sense when people are overloaded When youre in meetings all day theres little time for deep thought or cognitive work McCullough says Thats why Microsoft has built programs to make sure people have the focus they need When someone is invited to many meetings McCullough says AI can nudge her and ask Hey this week is filling up Do you want to block off some focus time
Perfectly Paired Teams
 Behind the scenes AI is busy learning how people work both as individuals and on teams AI can make relevant connections between people and content says Anton Andrews the lead of Envisioning for Modern Work and Life at Microsoft In this era of information abundance and uncertainty its unlikely that well always have the right mix of expertise and knowledge on our teams to come to the most innovative or creative solution Andrews says AIpowered platforms allow people to work in the open creating opportunities for the right people and information to coalesce around the challenge at hand How might this work Imagine a product manager in New York whos looking for someone in her organization to build a product Her ideal candidate needs a particular skill set access to specific datasets and availability for a set period But her company is large and complex there arent readily accessible systems to supply her with candidates and crossdepartment communication can be slow In the end it can take weeks  maybe months  to find the right person critical time that can stall or limit innovation 
But AI offers a clear solution to this alltoocommon organizational quagmire It can see across an organizations network and suggest a team member  maybe even a remote one  whos not only a strong fit but also available to take on more work AI can help people find each other assemble discover the information they need and support their collaboration Andrews says Its helping to create connections across our networksWhen teammates assemble AI can help them be more nimble and creative In a concept space at Microsoft headquarters in Redmond Wash the company has built a footlong digital whiteboard called Collaboration Corner which shows how workers can meet in person or virtually Team members can display information on the wall from different apps and collaborate in real time using Microsoft Smart Ink sticky notes text images and video from nearly any device Its all part of Microsofts plan to design intelligent work tools that remove boundaries from collaboration and creativity Our vision is to break down the barriers between different apps and capabilities Andrews says What if you could work the way your mind works using an open canvas Andrews imagines scenarios where people can create lists and diagrams or pull up videos imagery and documents with teammates around the world without jumping from app to app Our research on human behavior suggests that this type of AIpowered flexible work environment can increase a persons ability to focus while making remote collaboration more fruitful he says
AI All Around UsTo help people succeed AI must anticipate their needs and make their daily tasks easier And to help companies succeed AI must go beyond merely connecting people It needs to unite teams departments divisions and external partnersOrganizations have a very large amount of information Andrews says with fresh data generated every day This makes it increasingly easy to lose track of information or stash it so it cant be shared he says Its important to create a shared consciousness  a shared understanding of where were headed  by freely sharing information Andrews says Once different teams know whats happening around them they can reach out and help each other and leadership can push decisionmaking to the edges In the long term AI has the potential to make work more meaningful and satisfying by reducing mundane tasks and amplifying human abilities Soon interacting with AI will become much more natural and seamless AI will eventually be layered into our work environments so people wont have to be tethered to devices to access it Youll be engaged with people not a machine Teevan says

including experts at Google Facebook Microsoft and a recent winner of the prestigious Turing Award have signed a letter calling on Amazon to stop selling its facialrecognition technology to law enforcement agencies because it is biased against women and people of colorThe letter which was publicly released Wednesday reflects growing concern in academia and the tech industry that bias in facialrecognition technology is a systemic problem Some researchers  and even some companies  are arguing the technology cannot be properly controlled without government regulationAmazon sells a product called Rekognition through its cloudcomputing division Amazon Web Services The company said last year that early customers included the Orlando Police Department in Florida and the Washington County Sheriffs Office in OregonIn January two researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology published a peerreviewed study showing that Amazon Rekognition had more trouble identifying the gender of female and darkerskinned faces in photos than similar services from IBM and Microsoft It mistook women for men  percent of the time the study showed and misidentified darkerskinned women for men  percent of the timeBefore publishing their findings on Amazon Rekognition the MIT researchers released a similar study examining services from IBM Microsoft and Megvii an artificialintelligence company in China All three updated their services to address concerns raised by the researchersIn separate blog posts from the Amazon executives Matthew Wood and Michael Punke the company disputed the study and a Jan  article in The New York Times describing itThe answer to anxieties over new technology is not to run tests inconsistent with how the service is designed to be used and to amplify the tests false and misleading conclusions through the news media Dr Wood wrote Amazon did not directly engage with the MIT researchersThe letter released on Wednesday was signed by the Google researchers Margaret Mitchell Andrea Frome and Timnit Gebru the Facebook researcher Georgia Gkioxari William Isaac a researcher at DeepMind the London lab owned by Googles parent company Alphabet and Yoshua Bengio one of the worlds most important AI researchersLast week Dr Bengio was one of three people to receive the Turing Award  often called the Nobel Prize of computing  for his work with neural networks the technology that underpins modern facial recognition servicesThere are no laws or required standards to ensure that Rekognition is used in a manner that does not infringe on civil liberties the AI researchers wrote We call on Amazon to stop selling Rekognition to law enforcementThe researchers added that Dr Wood and Mr Punke had misrepresented the technical details of the MIT study and modern facialrecognition technology Amazon declined to comment on the letter on WednesdayA day after this article was published an Amazon spokeswoman responded saying that the company had updated its Rekognition service since the MIT researchers completed their study and that it had found no differences in error rates by gender and race when running similar testsMicrosoft by contrast improved the accuracy of its facial recognition last year after an earlier MIT study reported that its system was better at identifying the gender of lighterskinned men in a photo database than darkerskinned womenDuring a February talk at the Cornell Tech graduate school in New York Brad Smith Microsofts president and chief legal officer said the company had participated in the market for law enforcement in the United States but had also turned down sales when there was concern it could unreasonably infringe on peoples rightsIn February Microsoft backed a bill in Washington State that would require notices to be posted in public places using facialrecognition tech and ensure that government agencies obtain a court order when looking for specific people The bill is still pending But the company did not back other legislation that provides much stronger protectionsMr Punke wrote in his February blog post that Amazon also supported regulation of facialrecognition technology and called for law enforcement agencies to be transparent in how they use facialrecognition technology But Amazon has declined to disclose how police or intelligence agencies are using its Rekognition system and whether the company puts any restrictions on its useAmazon has said that it has not received any reports of Rekognition misuse by law enforcement and that the companys acceptable use policy prohibits customers from using its services in ways that violate lawsAn earlier version of this article misstated the timing of Microsofts support for a law on facial recognition technology in

American economy the overwhelming response by politicians and the public was Meh Almost instantly all was forgiven and forgottenNow the tech industry  which among other impressive innovations provides the worlds knowledge on demand lets people freely broadcast their diverse opinions and has made shopping as easy as pushing a button  has made some mistakes of its own It has abused privacy squeezed the competition and casually spread hate And thats just the beginning of the listGoogle Facebook Amazon and Apple might not get away as cleanly as Goldman Sachs and Citigroup Elizabeth Warren the Massachusetts senator who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination released proposals this month that would force tech breakups and impose severe restrictions on what remained Another Democratic presidential candidate Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota covered more briefly some of the same ground saying We have a major monopoly problemAt a moment when nearly everything in America seems wildly contentious antitrust action against tech is getting a sober look Antitrust is the nuclear bomb of regulatory policy but the reaction to Ms Warrens and Ms Klobuchars ideas was surprisingly receptiveWeve got to break these guys apart Ms Warren said in an interview on Face the Nation The show could name only one critic of her proposal Howard Schultz the Starbucks mogul who is flirting with an independent run for president to the deep disregard of votersA billionaire right Ms Warren notedFor decades a politician who mentioned antitrust was essentially arguing for more government oversight which has been dangerous territory at least since the Ronald Reagan administration Antitrust was relegated to the shelf with socialism and wealth inequality and higher taxes for higher incomesIt didnt help that what could be called maximum antitrust  when the Justice Department decides a company is abusing its monopoly power and should be broken up  has a mixed history The government dropped such a case against IBM in  after more than a decade It settled its case against Microsoft in  Only ATT which agreed in  to dissolve itself into a longdistance company and the seven Baby Bells could be considered an unqualified success from the governments point of viewThe political landscape is shifting however at a speed that dumbfounds even antitrust experts President Barack Obama thought of the tech companies in the way they think of themselves as progressive smart entrepreneurs who want whats best for America His administration declined to pursue Google on antitrust charges and hired from the tech industry for top posts Top staff members later went to work for the tech industry in top posts too It was a cozy relationshipSomething has definitely changed said Geoffrey A Manne the founder of the International Center for Law and Economics a think tank in Portland Ore Most voters are very fond of Amazon Apple Google and even Facebook But I think theres also a growing sense of skepticism about all these companies The shine has come offMr Manne who has been a critic of the antitrust arguments against Google and has received funding from the search giant as well as from some of its competitors including Comcast and ATT eviscerated Ms Warrens proposal with his colleague Alec Stapp in a recent blog post They wrote that the senators plan to turn the top companies into heavily regulated platform utilities would make them as resistant to improvement as sewer systems or AmtrakAnd yet Mr Manne conceded in an interview increased regulation is an idea whose time may have comeThere is a long history in America  just not a recent one  of using the power of the state to counteract the economic power of private enterprise he said We may be at that moment againThe financial firms were predatory last decade exploiting weak spots in the mortgage markets in a way that undermined their viability Google and Facebook by contrast offer their services for free while Amazon built its reputation on selling as cheaply as possible That makes it hard to regulate them by the antitrust consensus which for a couple of decades has held that there is no injury unless consumers directly suffer by paying higher pricesNothing is ever really free of course and there has been a dawning realization among some consumers that they are paying for these services with information about themselves How most users feel about this seems up in the air as evidenced by a new SurveyMonkey poll done for the news site AxiosThe headline finding was that a growing majority now views our online privacy as a crisis But deeper in the survey was the revelation that more than half the respondents said they were unwilling to pay to keep from being tracked by a service they were using Twentyone percent said they would pay less than  a month and no more for the rightUsers it seems want it both ways privacy and free services This is the contradiction at the heart of the internetDaniel Crane an antitrust expert at the University of Michigan said Ms Warrens proposal might be a hard sell to voters The median consumer probably feels that she gets lots of free goodies from Big Tech and will worry about what it would mean to go after them he saidBut Mr Crane noted that being broken up was the least of the companies worries A likelier consequence is that the next acquisition they want to make will be rejected he said Even just the rhetoric can complicate their lives and put pressure going forwardThat is already happening One of the anticompetitive complaints about Amazon is that it prohibited its merchants from selling more cheaply elsewhere That prevented a new platform from underselling Amazon and gaining a competitive edgeAmazon ended this practice in Europe six years ago but it continued in the United States Senator Richard Blumenthal a Democrat from Connecticut asked for regulators to investigate in December Last week Amazon confirmed that it had dropped the requirementAntitrust talk emboldens competitors as well Google controls much of the market for online ads in Australia just as it does elsewhere That presents a big problem for News Corporation which owns eight of the  largest papers in the countryThe Rupert Murdochcontrolled media conglomerate asked Australian regulators last week to take the very serious step of breaking up Google in the country because of the unparalleled power that it currently exerts over news publishers and advertisers alikeIn this new environment winning can soon look a lot like losingAmazon opposed a proposal in Seattle last spring for a corporate tax to help the homeless and succeeded in getting it cut in half Then the retailer decided it just couldnt live with the measure at all A repeal effort began The City Council killed the tax just as it was going into effectAt the time that looked like another triumph for Amazon But in the months since even some of those who thought the tax was a bad idea have found their views evolvingMy feelings about Amazon have changed and not in a good way said Julie Shapiro a Seattle University professor of family law I think they want the ability to be a bully and once they have it theyre quite willing to use itThat is the crux of the issue Can a company be dominant without coming off as a bully It is no accident that the company that was the subject of the biggest antitrust action in the last quartercentury  Microsoft  had a terrible reputation in the tech community Voters love innovation convenience and entrepreneurs They dont love bulliesAmazon failed to avoid bullying behavior in its nowabandoned bid to build a headquarters in New York and Facebook likewise failed last week when it took down Ms Warrens posts about Facebook having too much power The company which said the posts had violated the use of its logo quickly restored them but the public relations damage had been doneCurious why I think FB has too much

government when it comes to artificial intelligenceMy first reaction was good on you because you are thinking morally and you are thinking about whether what you are doing is right or wrong Mr Carter said at The New York Times New Work Summit in Half Moon Bay CalifThe sentiment comes at a time of strained relationships between Silicon Valley technology behemoths and the United States governmentWhen Mr Carter was secretary of defense in the Obama administration he was often considered a bridge builder between the Beltway and the Valley founding agencies that brought together technologists and policymakersHe notably issued a directive that stands today In any application of machineassisted weaponry that involves the use of lethal force there shall be a human being involved in the decisionmaking he saidBut those partnerships have been tested in the past year as protests pushback and petitions have circulated widely among employees of technology companiesLast July Microsoft employees presented their chief executive Satya Nadella with a petition signed by more than  people that called on the company to cancel its contract with Immigration and Customs EnforcementLast June Google declined to renew its contract with Project Maven at the Pentagon after extensive pushback from employees The project used Googles artificial intelligence software to improve the sorting and analysis of imagery from dronesAnd in October Google executives declined to even bid on another artificial intelligence project at the Pentagon valued at as much as  billionThese protests speak to the newfound power of employees said Pedro Domingos a professor of computer science at the University of Washington and the author of The Master Algorithm How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our WorldEmployees of tech companies like Google and Microsoft have an extraordinary amount of power which is much different than it was  years ago he said adding that technology companies were major players in both World War II and the Cold War Often companies want to do things but then they have to backtrack because they dont want to displace employeesMr Carter was supportive of that kind of employee involvement in his conversation with Kevin Roose a reporter for The Times Its a fair thing to challenge your leaders Mr Carter said Thats true for troops and its true for employees at a tech companyBut he said I find a lot of things more objectionable than helping your country protect youThats a sentiment echoed by the president of Microsoft Brad Smith In October Mr Smith wrote his employees  a public note on the Microsoft blog regarding defense projects and collaboration with the United States governmentFirst we believe in the strong defense of the United States and we want the people who defend it to have access to the nations best technology including from Microsoft he wrote We are not going to withdraw from the future In the most positive way possible we are going to work to help shape itBut at the New Work Summit he also shared some instances in which he was uncomfortable working with the government when he had ethical and technological misgivingsWere very excited about facial recognition technology but we also have concerns he said referencing a partnership he declined to enter with a local police force This is a space where theres been welldocumented cases of bias invasion of privacy and the potential for fundamental democratic freedoms to be placed at riskThe way forward has to be in the hands of

confidential legal matters Both companies had entered into partnerships with Facebook gaining broad access to the personal information of hundreds of millions of its usersThe companies were among more than  including Amazon Apple Microsoft and Sony that had cut sharing deals with the worlds dominant social media platform The agreements previously reported in The New York Times let the companies see

used commercially Selling user data would have violated Facebooks rules at the time yet the social network does not appear to have regularly checked that apps were complying Facebook deleted the quiz app in December The disclosures about Cambridge last year thrust Facebook into the worst crisis of its history Then came news reports last June and December that Facebook had given business partners  including makers of smartphones tablets and other devices  deep access to users personal information letting some companies effectively override users privacy settingsThe sharing deals empowered Microsofts Bing search engine to map out the friends of virtually all Facebook users without their explicit consent and allowed Amazon to obtain users names and contact information through their friends Apple was able to hide from Facebook users all indicators that its devices were even asking for dataPrivacy advocates said the partnerships seemed to violate a  consent agreement between Facebook and the FTC stemming from allegations that the company had shared data in ways that deceived consumers The deals also appeared to contradict statements by Mark Zuckerberg and other executives that Facebook had clamped down several years ago on sharing the data of users friends with outside developersFTC officials who spent the past year investigating whether Facebook violated the  agreement are now weighing the sharing deals as they negotiate a possible multibilliondollar fine That would be the largest such penalty ever imposed by the trade regulatorFacebook has aggressively

college student helped Joy Buolamwini of the MIT Media Lab test facial technologies from Amazon IBM Microsoft Face and KairosCreditCreditJaime Hogge for The New York TimesSupported byBy Natasha SingerOver the last two years Amazon has aggressively marketed its facial recognition technology to police departments and federal agencies as a service to help law enforcement identify suspects more quickly It has done so as another tech giant Microsoft has called on Congress to regulate the technology arguing that it is too risky for companies to oversee on their ownNow a new study from researchers at the MIT Media Lab has found that Amazons system Rekognition had much more difficulty in telling the gender of female faces and of darkerskinned faces in photos than similar services from IBM and Microsoft The results raise questions about potential bias that could hamper Amazons drive to popularize the technologyIn the study published Thursday Rekognition made no errors in recognizing the gender of lighterskinned men But it misclassified women as men  percent of the time the researchers said and mistook darkerskinned women for men  percent of the time Microsofts technology mistook darkerskinned women for men just  percent of the timeA study published a year ago found similar problems in the programs built by IBM Microsoft and Megvii an artificial intelligence company in China known as Face Those results set off an outcry that was amplified when a coauthor of the study Joy Buolamwini posted YouTube videos showing the technology misclassifying famous AfricanAmerican women like Michelle Obama as menThe companies in last years report all reacted by quickly releasing more accurate technology For the latest study Ms Buolamwini said she sent a letter with some preliminary results to Amazon seven months ago But she said that she hadnt heard back from Amazon and that when she and a coauthor retested the companys product a couple of months later it had not improvedMatt Wood general manager of artificial intelligence at Amazon Web Services said the researchers had examined facial analysis  a technology that can spot features such as mustaches or expressions such as smiles  and not facial recognition a technology that can match faces in photos or video stills to identify individuals Amazon markets both servicesIts not possible to draw a conclusion on the accuracy of facial recognition for any use case  including law enforcement  based on results obtained using facial analysis Dr Wood said in a statement He added that the researchers had not tested the latest version of Rekognition which was updated in NovemberAmazon said that in recent internal tests using an updated version of its service the company found no difference in accuracy in classifying gender across all ethnicitiesWith advancements in artificial intelligence facial technologies  services that can be used to identify people in crowds analyze their emotions or detect their age and facial characteristics  are proliferating Now as companies begin to market these services more aggressively for uses like policing and vetting job candidates they have emerged as a lightning rod in the debate about whether and how Congress should regulate powerful emerging technologiesThe new study scheduled to be presented Monday at an artificial intelligence and ethics conference in Honolulu is sure to inflame that argumentProponents see facial recognition as an important advance in helping law enforcement agencies catch criminals and find missing children Some police departments and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have tested Amazons productBut civil liberties experts warn that it can also be used to secretly identify people  potentially chilling Americans ability to speak freely or simply go about their business anonymously in publicOver the last year Amazon has come under intense scrutiny by federal lawmakers the American Civil Liberties Union shareholders employees and academic researchers for marketing Rekognition to law enforcement agencies That is partly because unlike Microsoft IBM and other tech giants Amazon has been less willing to publicly discuss concernsAmazon citing customer confidentiality has also declined to answer questions from federal lawmakers about which government agencies are using Rekognition or how they are using it The companys responses have further troubled some federal lawmakersNot only do I want to see them address our concerns with the sense of urgency it deserves said Representative Jimmy Gomez a California Democrat who has been investigating Amazons facial recognition practices But I also want to know if law enforcement is using it in ways that violate civil liberties and what  if any  protections Amazon has built into the technology to protect the rights of our constituentsIn a letter last month to Mr Gomez Amazon said Rekognition customers must abide by Amazons policies which require them to comply with civil rights and other laws But the company said that for privacy reasons it did not audit customers giving it little insight into how its product is being usedThe study published last year reported that Microsoft had a perfect score in identifying the gender of lighterskinned men in a photo database but that it misclassified darkerskinned women as men about one in five times IBM and Face had an even higher error rate each misclassifying the gender of darkerskinned women about one in three timesMs Buolamwini said she had developed her methodology with the idea of harnessing public pressure and market competition to push companies to fix biases in their software that could pose serious risks to peopleOne of the things we were trying to explore with the paper was how to galvanize action Ms Buolamwini saidImmediately after the study came out last year IBM published a blog post Mitigating Bias in AI Models citing Ms Buolamwinis study In the post Ruchir Puri chief architect at IBM Watson said IBM had been working for months to reduce bias in its facial recognition system The company post included test results showing improvements particularly in classifying the gender of darkerskinned women Soon after IBM released a new system that the company said had a tenfold decrease in error ratesA few months later Microsoft published its own post titled Microsoft improves facial recognition technology to perform well across all skin tones genders In particular the company said it had significantly reduced the error rates for female and darkerskinned facesMs Buolamwini wanted to learn whether the study had changed overall industry practices So she and a colleague Deborah Raji a college student who did an internship at the MIT Media Lab last summer conducted a new studyIn it they retested the facial systems of IBM Microsoft and Face They also tested the facial systems of two companies that were not included in the first study Amazon and Kairos a startup in FloridaThe new study found that IBM Microsoft and Face all improved their accuracy in identifying genderBy contrast the study reported Amazon misclassified the gender of darkerskinned females  percent of the time while Kairos had an error rate of  percentMelissa Doval the chief executive of Kairos said the company inspired by Ms Buolamwinis work released a more accurate algorithm in OctoberMs Buolamwini said the results of her studies raised fundamental questions for society about whether facial technology should not be used in certain situations such as job interviews or in products like drones or police body camerasSome federal lawmakers are voicing similar issuesTechnology like Amazons Rekognition should be used if and only if it is imbued with American values like the right to privacy and equal protection said Senator Edward J Markey a Massachusetts Democrat who has been investigating Amazons facial recognition practices I do not think that standard is currently

length of an American football field and is powered by six engines on a twin fuselage took to the air shortly before  am Pacific time  GMT and stayed aloft for more than two hours before landing safely back at the Mojave Air and Space Port as a crowd of hundreds of people cheeredWhat a fantastic first flight Stratolaunch Chief Executive Officer Jean Floyd said in a statement posted to the companys website Todays flight furthers our mission to provide a flexible alternative to ground launched systems Floyd said We are incredibly proud of the Stratolaunch team todays flight crew our

Pentagon and some employees questioned the ethics of building artificial intelligence that analyzed video captured by drones the company said the project would save the lives of civilians and soldiersClarifais mission is to accelerate the progress of humanity with continually improving AI read a blog post from Matt Zeiler the companys founder and chief executive and a prominent AI researcher Later in a news media interview Mr Zeiler announced a new management position that would ensure all company projects were ethically soundAs activists researchers and journalists voice concerns over the rise of artificial intelligence warning against biased deceptive and malicious applications the companies building this technology are responding From tech giants like Google and Microsoft to scrappy AI startups many are creating corporate principles meant to ensure their systems are designed and deployed in an ethical way Some set up ethics officers or review boards to oversee these principlesBut tensions continue to rise as some question whether these promises will ultimately be kept Companies can change course Idealism can bow to financial pressure Some activists  and even some companies  are beginning to argue that the only way to ensure ethical practices is through government regulationWe dont want to see a commercial race to the bottom Brad Smith Microsofts president and chief legal officer said at the New Work Summit in Half Moon Bay Calif hosted last week by The New York Times Law is neededThe new ethics position at Clarifai never materialized As this New York City startup pushed further into military applications and facial recognition services some employees grew increasingly concerned their work would end up feeding automated warfare or mass surveillance In late January on a company message board they posted an open letter asking Mr Zeiler where their work was headedA few days later Mr Zeiler held a companywide meeting according to three people who spoke on the condition that they not be identified for fear of retaliation He explained that internal ethics officers did not suit a small company like Clarifai And he told the employees that Clarifai technology would one day contribute to autonomous weaponsClarifai specializes in technology that instantly recognizes objects in photos and video Policymakers call this a dualuse technology It has everyday commercial applications like identifying designer handbags on a retail website as well as military applications like identifying targets for dronesThis and other rapidly advancing forms of artificial intelligence can improve transportation health care and scientific research Or they can feed mass surveillance online phishing attacks and the spread of false newsAs companies and governments deploy these AI technologies researchers are also realizing that some systems are woefully biased Facial recognition services for instance can be significantly less accurate when trying to identify women or someone with darker skin Other systems may include security holes unlike any seen in the past Researchers have shown that driverless cars can be fooled into seeing things that are not really thereAll this means that building ethical artificial intelligence is an enormously complex task It gets even harder when stakeholders realize that ethics are in the eye of the beholderAs some Microsoft employees protest the companys military contracts Mr Smith said that American tech companies had long supported the military and that they must continue to do so The US military is charged with protecting the freedoms of this country he told the conference We have to stand by the people who are risking their livesThough some Clarifai employees draw an ethical line at autonomous weapons others do not Mr Zeiler argued that autonomous weapons will ultimately save lives because they would be more accurate than weapons controlled by human operators AI is an essential tool in helping weapons become more accurate reducing collateral damage minimizing civilian casualties and friendly fire incidents he said in a statementGoogle worked on the same Pentagon project as Clarifai and after a protest from company employees the tech giant ultimately ended its involvement But like Clarifai as many as  other companies have worked on the project without bowing to ethical concernsAfter the controversy over its Pentagon work Google laid down a set of AI principles meant as a guide for future projects But even with the corporate rules in place some employees left the company in protest The new principles are open to interpretation And they are overseen by executives who must also protect the companys financial interestsYou functionally have situations where the foxes are guarding the henhouse said Liz FongJones a former Google employee who left the company late last yearIn  when Google acquired DeepMind perhaps the worlds most important AI lab the company agreed to set up an external review board that would ensure the labs research would not be used in military applications or otherwise unethical projects But five years later it is still unclear whether this board even existsGoogle Microsoft Facebook and other companies have created organizations like the Partnership on AI that aim to guide the practices of the entire industry But these operations are largely toothlessThe most significant changes have been driven by employee protests like the one at Google and pointed research from academics and other independent experts After Amazon employees protested the sale of facial recognition services to police departments and various academic studies highlighted the bias that plagues these services Amazon and Microsoft called for government regulation in this areaPeople are recognizing there are issues and they are recognizing they want to change them said Meredith Whittaker a Google employee and the cofounder of the AI Now Institute a research institute that examines the social implications of artificial intelligence But she also told the conference that this change was slow to happen as the forces of capitalism continued to drive these companies toward greater profitsEmployees at Clarifai worry that the same technological tools that drive facial recognition will ultimately lead to autonomous weapons  and that flaws in these tools will open a Pandoras box of problems We in the industry know that technology can be compromised Hackers hack Bias is unavoidable read the open letter to Mr ZeilerThousands of AI researchers from across the industry have signed a separate open letter saying they will oppose autonomous weaponsThe Pentagon has said that artificial intelligence built by the likes of Google and Clarifai has not been used for offensive purposes And it is now building its own set of ethical principles realizing it needs the support of industry which has snapped up most of the worlds top AI researchers in recent yearsBut many policy experts say they believe these principles are unlikely to hold any more influence than those laid down at the big corporations especially because the Pentagon is motivated to keep pace with China Russia and other international rivals as they develop similar technology For that reason some are calling for international treaties that would bar the use of autonomous weaponsIn their open letter the Clarifai employees said they were unsure whether regulation was the answer to the many ethical questions swirling around AI technology arguing that the immediate responsibility rested with the company itselfRegulation slows progress and our species needs progress to survive the many threats that face us today they wrote addressing Mr Zeiler and the rest of the company We need to be ethical enough to be trusted to make this technology on our own and we owe it to the public to define our ethics clearlyBut their letter did not have the desired effect In the days after Mr Zeiler explained that Clarifai would most likely contribute to autonomous weapons the employee who wrote the letter and was originally tapped to serve as an ethics adviser Liz OSullivan left the companyResearchers and activists like Ms Whittaker see this as a moment when tech employees can use their power to drive change But they have also said this must happen outside tech companies as well as withinWe need regulation Ms Whittaker said before namedropping Microsofts chief legal officer Even Brad Smith says we need regulationAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy

heading to the stock marketSlack which is based in San Francisco gave no details about the offerings timing and said it was awaiting a standard review of its paperwork by the Securities and Exchange Commission The move was expected given that Slacks chief executive Stewart Butterfield had long indicated that he planned to take the company public Slack recently hired Goldman Sachs to lead the offeringSlacks confidential filing comes amid a rush by privately held companies to go public this year Many of these startups which have been highly valued by private investors are part of a generation of technology companies known as unicorns Public share sales by the companies are expected to create a bonanza of riches in Silicon Valley for entrepreneurs and venture capital investorsIn December the ridehailing companies Uber and Lyft filed confidential paperwork for their own public offerings Their efforts stalled temporarily last month when a government shutdown hampered the SECs ability to review the companies registration documents Other tech companies expected to go public this year include the online scrapbooking firm PinterestSlack declined to comment beyond its statement about the confidential filingThere is likely to be a strong demand for Slack stock The company was valued at  billion by private investors last year but in recent weeks investment firms have offered to buy its shares at a price that values Slack at  billion according to a person with knowledge of the details who was not authorized to speak publiclySlack also plans an unusual form of public

that communication tool called SlackStartups quickly adopted Slack and larger companies followed suit The company offers free and paid versions of Slack and counts more than  paying customers including  Fortune  companies Last month Slack said  million people now used its product every day The company generated more than  million in revenue last year said the person with knowledge of the detailsSome companies that have filed to go public have never reached that finish line Over the last year a number of highprofile business software companies that took steps to go public were snapped

down on his pursuit of a technological idea called a neural networkIt was a way for machines to see the world around them recognize sounds and even understand natural language But scientists had spent more than  years working on the concept of neural networks and machines couldnt really do any of thatBacked by the Canadian government Dr Hinton a computer science professor at the University of Toronto organized a new research community with several academics who also tackled the concept They included Yann LeCun a professor at New York University and Yoshua Bengio at the University of MontrealOn Wednesday the Association for Computing Machinery the worlds largest society of computing professionals announced that Drs Hinton LeCun and Bengio had won this years Turing Award for their work on neural networks The Turing Award which was introduced in  is often called the Nobel Prize of computing and it includes a  million prize which the three scientists will shareOver the past decade the big idea nurtured by these researchers has reinvented the way technology is built accelerating the development of facerecognition services talking digital assistants warehouse robots and selfdriving cars Dr Hinton is now at Google and Dr LeCun works for Facebook Dr Bengio has inked deals with IBM and MicrosoftWhat we have seen is nothing short of a paradigm shift in the science said Oren Etzioni the chief executive officer of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in Seattle and a prominent voice in the AI community History turned their way and I am in aweLoosely modeled on the web of neurons in the human brain a neural network is a complex mathematical system that can learn discrete tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data By analyzing thousands of old phone calls for example it can learn to recognize spoken wordsThis allows many artificial intelligence technologies to progress at a rate that was not possible in the past Rather than coding behavior into systems by hand  one logical rule at a time  computer scientists can build technology that learns behavior largely on its ownThe Londonborn Dr Hinton  first embraced the idea as a graduate student in the early s a time when most artificial intelligence researchers turned against it Even his own PhD adviser questioned the choiceWe met once a week Dr Hinton said in an interview Sometimes it ended in a shouting match sometimes notNeural networks had a brief revival in the late s and early s After a year of postdoctoral research with Dr Hinton in Canada the Parisborn Dr LeCun moved to ATTs Bell Labs in New Jersey where he designed a neural network that could read handwritten letters and numbers An ATT subsidiary sold the system to banks and at one point it read about  percent of all checks written in the United StatesThough a neural network could read handwriting and help with some other tasks it could not make much headway with big AI tasks like recognizing faces and objects in photos identifying spoken words and understanding the natural way people talkThey worked well only when you had lots of training data and there were few areas that had lots of training data Dr LeCun  saidBut some researchers persisted including the Parisborn Dr Bengio  who worked alongside Dr LeCun at Bell Labs before taking a professorship at the University of MontrealIn  with less than  in funding from the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research Dr Hinton created a research program dedicated to what he called neural computation and adaptive perception He invited Dr Bengio and Dr LeCun to join himBy the end of the decade the idea had caught up with its potential In  Dr Hinton and his students helped Microsoft IBM and Google push the boundaries of speech recognition Then they did much the same with image recognitionHe is a genius and knows how to create one impact after another said Li Deng a former speech researcher at Microsoft who brought Dr Hintons ideas into the companyDr Hintons image recognition breakthrough was based on an algorithm developed by Dr LeCun In late  Facebook hired the NYU professor to build a research lab around the idea Dr Bengio resisted offers to join one of the big tech giants but the research he oversaw in Montreal helped drive the progress of systems that aim to understand natural language and technology that can generate fake photos that are indistinguishable from the real thingThough these systems have undeniably accelerated the progress of artificial intelligence they are still a very long way from true intelligence But Drs Hinton LeCun and Bengio believe that new ideas will comeWe need fundamental additions to this toolbox we have created to reach machines that operate at the level of true human understanding Dr Bengio saidFollow

investigation to the list of technical difficulties and PR disasters By Kara SwisherMs Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer Exactly when did Facebook become the Job of internet companiesJust like the beleaguered biblical character who endured woe after woe at Gods behest this social media giant finds itself repeatedly hit by bad news The difference is that Job was blameless while Facebook has brought many of these disasters upon itselfThe biggest recent blow was a report on Wednesday that federal prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York were conducting a criminal investigation into deals Facebook had made with other companies that gave them access to data allegedly without the consent of usersOther calamities within the last week alone include a report from the British government accusing Facebook and other companies of hindering consumer choice and stifling innovation and calling for strong regulation Facebook managing to look as if it was trying to block Senator Elizabeth Warrens attempt to advertise her plan to break up big tech companies like Facebook on Facebook its services including the popular Instagram app going down around the globe and on Thursday the announced departures of Chris Cox Facebooks powerful chief product officer and Chris Daniels the boss of WhatsApp  a giant neon sign that the company is in pain I think we can safely say that only Aunt Becky from Full House  that would be Lori Loughlin captain of the college admissions bad parenting squad  is having a worse time this week The Warren ad mess appears to reflect sloppiness by Facebook  she used its logo without permission in some ads and the company typically pulls down those fast They have since been restored And the breakdown The company has ruled out an outside attack so it just looks like some Facebook technical issueBut the other developments are more serious for the company The page report from the chancellor of the Exchequer in Britain calls for giving users the ability to move data to third parties making that data available to rivals and creating a code of conduct that includes fines for violationsSenator Warren has gone further by calling for both a breakup of business units and also an unwinding of acquisitionsLike Facebooks purchase of Instagram Like Facebooks purchase of WhatsApp ThoseBasically she is aiming directly at the social giants future which Mark Zuckerberg Facebooks founder and chief executive pretty much admitted last week when he wrote a memo about integrating those purchases and shifting the platform to a focus on privacy rather than public sharingThat memo became more interesting to me after The New York Times reported on the new criminal investigation in the Eastern District Facebook was already lousy with active investigations led by an alphabet of federal agencies including the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission as well state inquiries and tons of lawsuits Whats more federal prosecutors in the Northern District of California are looking into whether Facebook was in fact misled by Cambridge Analytica or if it knew more than it has acknowledged But that inquiry has been only flirting with the idea of criminal culpability The new one revealed on Wednesday is a significant escalation for the companyLets be clear This is a criminal investigation not an oopswemadeanothersloppyerror one Which is why Facebook is trying so mightily to lump it in with the other inquiriesIt has already been reported that there are ongoing federal investigations including by the Department of Justice a Facebook representative said in a statement As we have said before we are cooperating with investigators and take these probes seriously Weve provided public testimony answered questions and pledged that we will continue to do soBut the Eastern District inquiry is not the same and this is new and worrisome territory for FacebookCriminal anything is scary enough but this news will also have an impact on its managements ability to concentrate on creating innovative products or buying companies to help it get to the next phase of the alwayschanging tech game That is no small thing As the British report pointed out there have been  acquisitions in tech none of which has been rejected by regulators That will surely no longer be the case for FacebookThe departure of the two Facebook managers is also a distraction the internal situation is looking as unstable as the external All this is a reminder of what happened almost two decades ago when Microsoft was under investigation for anticompetitive behavior and monopoly practices Back then the company was hit by the press and regulators daily which drastically slowed its momentumAs the accusations piled up Microsoft lost peoples trust Of all the consequences that Facebook faces this would be the most damagingYou cant calculate trust by coding or algorithms But Facebook is clearly losing it Everyone is beginning to assume the worst even if it is not fair Whats ironic is that this is all escalating when its evident that the management of the company does seem to get that it needs to change and quicklyMark knows he is over a barrel said one person familiar with Mr Zuckerbergs thinking That has sunk in very much nowGood because such selfreflection has been painfully slow for Mr Zuckerberg and others at FacebookThis doesnt mean the situation is hopeless for the company Despite being seen as the font of all that was bad with tech way back in  Microsoft recovered nicely and is today considered one of techs most upstanding citizens Mr Zuckerberg may be able to pull something similar off After all this is one guy we can be sure didnt need to bribe his way into HarvardThe Times is

introduced a new video game service on Tuesday that allows people to play highdefinition games instantly over the internet joining an industrywide experiment to offer a socalled Netflix of gamingThe new service called Stadia will work for anyone with a fast internet connection and a computer phone or tablet The service will also work with Googles Chromecast an inexpensive dongle that plugs into television sets to stream videosGoogle said Stadia would be released later this year but did not announce a priceBy focusing on streaming games  titles that are pulled from servers instead of downloaded to the customers device  Google is trying to catch the next wave of gaming The premise users pay a subscription to access a library of games that they can immediately play as opposed to the traditional model of paying for a disc or waiting to download a gameThere are pros and cons to each approach The streaming model lets people try lots of games until they find some they enjoy but the games tend to be superficial with rougher graphics Downloaded games typically have more polished graphics but they can take time to install and require a sizable onetime paymentConsole makers having been pushing into streaming services Sony offers a monthly subscription to a service called PlayStation Now with hundreds of titles while Microsoft said it planned to offer a trial service later this year to stream games to Xbox consoles computers and mobile devicesBut video games still present a significant technical challenge compared with streaming a song or movie because of the amount of data involved and the unpredictability of game play So the industry has continued to largely revolve around the releases of new game machines from Sony Microsoft and NintendoGoogle though is trying to take a leap beyond that  by starting with no game machine at allThis new generation of gaming is not a box Phil Harrison a veteran video game industry executive who is leading Stadia for Google said at the Game Developers Conference an annual industry event in San Francisco where the service was announced We will be handing over the extraordinary power of the data centers to you the game developersLewis Ward an IDC analyst that follows the video games industry said the viability of Googles online games strategy relied on many factors that had not been addressed For one it remains unclear how much the service will cost and how revenue will be shared with game developers And much of Googles success will rely on building a library of deep compelling games meaning the company must attract game developers of blockbuster franchises like Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead RedemptionIf the catalog that launches this year is overwhelmingly casual PC titles and Android titles that will be a huge disappointment he said I dont think Candy Crush Saga is going to drive up Google data center traffic by a whole lotThis new service builds on Project Stream a trial program introduced in October to iron out the kinks of streaming video games It offered a select group of users the opportunity to play Assassins Creed Odyssey a game that is part of one of the industrys biggest franchises over the internet through a Chrome browserIn a demonstration on Tuesday Google showed a YouTube trailer for Assassins Creed Odyssey A Play Now button appeared on the screen and clicking on it loaded the game in five secondsGoogle also demonstrated a WiFi connected game controller with a button to access the companys artificialintelligence assistant A player could for example ask for help in defeating a certain level in a gameThe company said Stadia would rely on Googles powerful data centers to do the heavy lifting and let consumers including those with old sluggish computers stream highquality games immediatelyWe are dead serious about making technology accessible for everyone said Sundar Pichai the companys chief executiveAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressLOS ANGELES  Vasyl Lomachenko left Ukraine and moved stateside several years ago because he dreamed of fighting for big money in the worlds most popular boxing venuesAfter headlining at Madison Square Garden in Macau and in several spots around Las Vegas Lomachenko is going Hollywood on Friday nightLomachenko   KOs risks his two lightweight world titles at Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles when he takes on Britains Anthony CrollaCrolla   KOs is a big underdog against the masterful Lomachenko whose technique and athleticism have propelled him from two Olympic gold medals to the short list of the worlds greatest poundforpound fightersLomachenko trains outside Los Angeles and he has already fought in the LA area twice But he has never appeared in this fightloving citys most prominent indoor arena and the mere idea of headlining in such a cavernous venue would have been improbable just a few years agoIts a very exciting place Lomachenko said After my first LA fight at Microsoft Theater I looked across the street and thought Wow maybe someday I can get into Staples CenterLess than two years after that LA debut in the smaller Microsoft venue Lomachenko has moved across the street for a title defense he is expected to win with style  and not just because hes wearing an outlandish robe worth a reported  into the ringAny opponent under  pounds would be an underdog against Lomachenko but the lack of a theoretically worthy opponent doesnt interest the champion Until a bona fide challenger to his dominance emerges at  or  pounds he will keep racking up winsI dont care Lomachenko said with a smirk In my fights I just want to show off my skills My opponent whoever I just want to enjoy it and to put on a good and interesting fightLomachenkos next fight was supposed to be a title unification bout with Ghanas Richard Commey who holds one of the two remaining lightweight belts that Lomachenko covets But Commey emerged from his bout Feb  with an injured right hand and Lomachenko elected to stay active by entertaining his mandatory challenger for the WBA crownWhile Crolla is widely respected for his toughness and resilience Lomachenko sometimes seems to be competing in a different sport His footwork alone inspires rhapsodic appreciation from veteran fight watchers and his hand speed is similarly peerlessCrolla has watched Lomachenkos bouts with admiration but he has been fighting for too long to be intimidatedHes the best fighter in the sport and Im grateful for this chance Crolla said Even the best fighter in boxing is beatable Nobody is bigger than the game so I go into this fight knowing Ive got a chance and a strategy to beat himCrolla is making his US debut but the Manchester native is likely to have every British athletes contingent of vociferous stateside fans Crolla has another advantage according to LomachenkoHes very good and hes in a comfortable position because he has nothing to lose Lomachenko saidThe Staples Center card also includes Mexican star Gilberto Zurdo Ramirez making his light heavyweight debut against Tommy Karpency in the comain event along with veteran brawler Mike Alvarado facing unbeaten Arnold Barboza JrLomachenko isnt looking beyond Crolla to other fights partly because no big fight looms He wants Commeys belt but the biggest money would come from a showdown with former American lightweight champion Mikey GarciaBut even if Garcia could get over his antipathy toward Top Rank boss Bob Arum  his former promoter and Lomachenkos current promoter  Lomachenko and Garcia probably cant find a common weight Lomachenko says he is too small for  pounds and Garcia could struggle to get back down to  after fighting at welterweight  and getting thrashed by Errol Spence Jr  last month in TexasUntil money creates the motivation to solve this dilemma Lomachenko will go on showcasing himself to the world against the best opponents he can find Crolla is worthy and Lomachenko is taking him seriouslyI get nervous a little before a fight but when I step in the ring Im in my place Lomachenko said I start to enjoy it right away A couple of rounds and then I find my momentAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersBERLIN  Europes largest technology company SAP aims to more than double its market value to between  billion euros and  billion euros  billion by

Stephen GrocerOne by one the concerns that have hung over the stock market have faded Fears that the United States economy would dip into a recession this year have eased The Federal Reserve seems to be finished raising interest rates for the foreseeable future and optimism has increased that the United States and China could end their trade warBut if the January snap back it was the best start to a year for stocks in decades after the worst December for stocks in an even longer period is to sustain itself big technology companies likely will have to lead the way So far this year they have not done that For much of the past decade the fate of the stock market has been tied to the performance of a handful of the largest tech companies Amazon Apple Alphabet Facebook Microsoft and Netflix led the market from one record to the nextBy the end of August their sway over the direction of the SP  exceeded all but two of the indexs  sector groupings As the index pushed to a record high last summer the rise in those six companies shares accounted for half of its gain They led on the way down too dragging the broader market lower over the final three months of  and nearly ending the

Inc on Tuesday unveiled a new chip for speeding up artificial intelligence work aiming to diversify beyond its stronghold in mobile phone chips and into a fastgrowing market now dominated by Nvidia Corp and Intel CorpAt an event in San Francisco Qualcomm said it plans to begin testing its new Cloud AI  chip with partners such as Microsoft Corp later this year with mass production likely to begin in Qualcomms new chip is designed for what artificial intelligence researchers call inference  the process of using an AI algorithm that has been trained with massive amounts of data in order to for example translate audio into textbased requestsAnalysts believe chips for speeding up inference will be the largest part of the AI chip marketNvidia has released special chips for the task and Intel is working with Facebook Inc on one that will be released later this year Cloud computing vendors such as Amazoncoms Amazon Web Services and Alphabet Incs Google Cloud unit are also making their own inference chipsAll that activity means Qualcomm is entering a crowded field behind its rivals But Cristiano Amon Qualcomms president and the chief of its chip division said the San Diego company is taking a different approach by aiming to serve the smaller simpler data centers that are proliferating around the world so that consumers can benefit from faster response times for their internetconnected appsIn order to serve those smaller edge data sites Qualcomm is focusing on AI chips that consume small amounts of electricity and generate little heat  a specialty it developed when making chips for mobile phones which run on small batteries and live in pocketsRivals such as Intel and Nvidia make more powerful chips that dominate in centralized data centers that suck up electricity and need complex cooling systemsYou cant rely on big data center buildings with air conditioning Amon told reporters at the San Francisco event Thats our bet  performance per watt

grueling overtime hours at some companies a rare push back against the work culture in the countrys tech industry The posts on Microsofts GitHub which calls itself the worlds largest code host and other programming tools have gone viral amid largescale layoffs in the sector The protest is aimed at the industrys  work culture which refers to the  am to  pm workday six days a week An anonymous activist launched project ICU on GitHub last week where workers share examples of excessive overtime and vote for the top blacklisted companies as well as firms with better working conditions Whats the difference between these  companies and the old landlords who oppressed peasants said one post Alibaba Group Holding Ltd JDcom Inc and drone maker DJI Technology Co Ltd were among the blacklisted firms Alibaba did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday a public holiday in ChinaA DJI spokesman said the company does not discuss specific employment issues but it has a firm commitment to treating our employees with the highest respect and providing a healthy working environmentA spokesman for JDcom declined to commentICU was Githubs most bookmarked project on Friday with over  followers The campaign against  work culture went viral on Weibo drawing thousands of responses on Chinas version of TwitterSome locally developed browsers this week barred access to the anti GitHub repository citing legal reasonsThe anti campaign is the latest example of activists demanding better work conditions and supporting calls for greater union representation at a time of slowing economic growthKatt Gu law and regulatory consultant at Shanghaibased tech startup Dimension called the  campaign a turning pointIts a time to punish those big evil companies who are not protecting their employees rights she said Gu and Dimension chief executive Suji Yan have published an Anti open source license which would potentially bar a company from accessing open source software if it did not comply with local labor lawsThey said the license would be tough to enforce but could give employees a new way to raise concerns about working conditionsThe programmer group is very civilized and educated Gu said adding they did not have political goalsIts really a tender and soft way and an effective way to fight for their rights Reporting by Cate Cadell Additional reporting by Andrew

reassembling parts from two used Boeing jetlinersOn Saturday the worlds largest airplane took flight for the first timeThe twinfuselage plane called the Stratolaunch flew for about two and a half hours over the Mojave Desert in Southern California reaching a speed of  miles per hour and an altitude of  feet in its maiden voyage the Stratolaunch team saidThe flight itself was smooth which is exactly what you want the first flight to be Evan Thomas a test pilot with Scaled Composites who flew the Stratolaunch said at a news briefing And for the most part the airplane flew as predicted which is again exactly what we wantThe vessel the largest plane by wingspan is designed to carry rockets to blast commercial satellites into space The company is betting that doing so would be more efficient than launching them from the ground which is an approach of several other spaceminded companiesPaul G Allen a founder of Microsoft funded the project and announced plans for Stratolaunch in  Mr Allen died in October prompting questions about the initiatives future The company declined to say how much the project costNever miss an eclipse a meteor shower a rocket launch or any other astronomical and space event thats out of this worldIn August Stratolaunch said it was developing a family of launch vehicles that could be deployed from the plane to carry satellites But in January the company scaled back those effortsThere have been concerns about how Stratolaunchs business will work once it takes on customers with some questioning whether a trend toward smaller satellites would dampen demand for such a large planeEven so the flight on Saturday was billed as a milestone and an engineering marvelAll of youve been very patient and very tolerant over the years waiting for us to get this big bird off the ground and we finally did it Jean Floyd chief executive of Stratolaunch said at the briefingThe team on Saturday checked the planes handling and tested rolls and yawsMr Thomas said there were a few little things that were off nominal but the company did not immediately specify what those wereThe airplane felt really nice on the touchdown gear felt good Mr Thomas said We had a couple of corrections to line up in the slowdown and ended up rolling to a stop pretty much where we wanted to coming off the runwaySo it was overall fantasticStratolaunch said that by launching rockets from the air it can circumvent bad weather air traffic and other variables that cause delays with traditional ground launchesExecutives have also said the plane can easily move to areas that are better suited for launching satellites into certain orbits although it needs a landing strip that can handle its great sizeAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byAfter Uber sold its

Lawyer and Gordon Crovitz a former publisher of The Wall Street Journal On Wednesday the company announced that it had signed Microsoft as its first major clientNewsGuard has created the equivalent of nutrition labels for news organizations rating more than  news and information sites with tags red for unreliable green for trustworthy A team of roughly  journalists and analysts is making the evaluationsNewsGuard has given its stamp of approval to established publications like The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal as well as later entrants like BuzzFeed and Newsmax FoxNewscom The Hill The Daily Beast and HuffPost have also gotten green lightsSites to watch out for according to NewsGuard include Infowars and Breitbart on the right and Daily Kos on the left Media Matters a leftleaning advocacy organization with a prolific mediawatchdog blog has received a green rating but scores negatively on four of the nine criteria used by NewsGuardThe startup hopes to become a regular part of the reading experience on the web Its premise is that it is more efficient to rate news organizations than the endless stream of articles rolled out each hourThe service free to readers offers a browser extension that shows a news operations rating when a reader lands on its site The NewsGuard tag also appears in search results next to article links for those who have the extensionThe point is to make this ubiquitous Mr Brill said in an interviewTo make money the company has pitched major technology companies to license its software and incorporate its ratings into their services The first major tech player to sign on is Microsoft which has agreed to install the system onto its mobile browser NewsGuard saidThe venture is not Mr Brills first goround on the media beat In  he founded the monthly magazine Brills Content which chronicled how the journalism sausage got made until it closed in He acknowledged that for now NewsGuards analysis lacked the distribution to have a major effect but a Gallup survey funded by the Knight Foundation suggested that independent ratings can change how people consume news Readers who participated in the poll were less likely to share headlines that were flagged as potentially misleading The Knight Foundation is also an investor in NewsGuardNewsGuard has raised about  million at a valuation of around  million Its biggest corporate backer is Publicis an advertising holding companyBoth founders said they were surprised at first by the advertising industrys interest in their project For them its the whole problem of fake news being an issue for brand safety Mr Brill said I hadnt even heard that term until we looked out for investorsLast year some advertisers fled YouTube after they noticed their messages were appearing alongside videos promoting terrorists And while they havent abandoned Facebook marketers are requesting more data to make sure their brands arent being associated with questionable contentFacebook has become a flash point for the spread of false reports To combat media pollution the company has worked with fact checkers and has enlisted thirdparty groups including The Associated Press Snopes and PolitiFact to make evaluations Still it can take up to three days for Facebook to verify content  which has little or no effect in most cases since articles go viral in minutesFacebook and other social networks have not signed on with NewsGuard but Mr Brill and Mr Crovitz anticipate that some kind of ratings service will eventually be adopted across the web And despite their positioning as a nutrition label for news they said no one should interpret their work as an endorsement for some kind of media equivalent to the Food and Drug AdministrationWed be very uncomfortable if the government were mandating anything with regard to news Mr Crovitz said That would violate free speech values You have the First AmendmentAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Steve LohrTwo hallmarks of American economic policy under President Trump are a reflexive aversion for regulation and goitalone nationalismBut in technology policy that stance is changingIn September the Trump administration abandoned its handsoff approach and began working closely with the nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to create international guidelines for the design and use of artificial intelligenceThe administration has also started to discuss a new law to protect privacy in the digital age seeking consensus domestically and common ground internationally It has fielded more than  publiccomment filings from advocacy groups corporations and individualsThere is a real desire in the United States to see leadership at the federal level said David Redl a senior Commerce Department official helping to guide the administrations privacy effortOn both issues the administration has moved from indifference to engagement said Julie Brill a former commissioner at the Federal Trade Commission who now helps oversee regulatory affairs for Microsoft It certainly has been welcomeThe shift is a pragmatic recognition that regulations that will affect the nations tech industry and its citizens are coming and that if federal officials want a say in them they must participateChina  which is not a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  has gone its own way using personal data and artificial intelligence as tools of a governmentbacked surveillance state If the United States were another digital island experts warn there would be a real danger of a fragmented global marketplacePrivacy can be seen as the first step toward regulating artificial intelligence more broadly Vast volumes of data often personal information are the fuel of modern AI systemsSeveral American states led by California have passed or proposed privacy laws threatening to fragment the marketplace in the United States too They are following Europe where a sweeping privacy law took effect in May harnessing the popular backlash against American tech giants like Facebook and GoogleEurope is saying Were in charge defining the global rules in the next iteration of the digital economy said Daniel Weitzner a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was a policy adviser in the Obama administrationThe new European privacy law known as the General Data Protection Regulation lets people request their data online restricts how businesses obtain and handle information and opens a door to classactionstyle lawsuits and huge finesJust how strict or effective enforcement will be remains to be seen But other nations are adopting similar rules and tech companies are retooling their datahandling software to comply Last year Europe and Japan agreed to allow personal data to flow freely between the two economies since Japans rules were deemed the equivalent of EuropesMounir Mahjoubi the French secretary of state for digital affairs pointed to the EuropeanJapanese pact as the first impact worldwide of the European standardMr Redl of the Commerce Department said the administration had been prompted to seek a new privacy law by action in Europe and state legislatures Though it has solicited public comments the administration has not yet drafted a proposed law and passage would require bipartisan support in CongressBut the goal Mr Redl said is a federal law that will harmonize data privacy rules in the United States and mesh enough with the European standard to avoid a more splintered marketplaceOne sign of the administrations more cosmopolitan approach to technology policy was a small private forum on industries of the future at the White House in early December Most of the guests were tech company leaders including Sundar Pichai of Google Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Ginni Rometty of IBMAt that session White House technology advisers discussed the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Developments artificial intelligence guidelines and the importance of shaping the outcome That impressed the tech executives as a newfound embrace of international engagement according to a person briefed on the meeting who would speak only anonymouslyThe White House confirmed that its side had brought up the organizations guidelines at the meeting In February President Trump signed an executive order on artificial intelligence that called for not only more investment but also regulation to foster public trust in AI systemsIn a statement last week Michael Kratsios deputy assistant to the president for technology policy said Were focused on promoting an international environment that supports AI research and development and ensures the technology is developed in a manner aligned with our nations core civil liberties and freedomsThe administrations emphatic cooperation on artificial intelligence guidelines contrasts with an earlier armslength wariness of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development In  for example the administration given its nationalist trade agenda insisted that the term free trade not appear in a ministerial statement according to two people involved in drafting the language who would speak only on the condition of anonymityThe organizations AI initiative has involved meetings and presentations around the world Groups from engineers to human rights activists are represented on the advisory panels that help draft recommendations which are tentatively scheduled for ministerial approval in MayTheir guidelines are soft law  suggestions not requirements But the Parisbased organization has a track record of influencing global policyThe most recent eightpage draft lays out rights and responsibilities Those responsible it says include any individual or organization that makes or operates AI technology  and these AI actors should do systematic risk assessments of privacy digital security safety and biasPeople affected by an AIgenerated prediction or recommendation it says should have the right to challenge the outcome based on plain and easytounderstand information on how an automated decision was madeThe draft recommendations call for global AI standards that are trustworthy and allow for data to flow fairly freely across borders so that it is interoperable The latter is a vital point for the American side National laws and approaches will differ they say but they should not hobble the global data economyNo one is entirely satisfied in the collective giveandtake of developing guidelines Marc Rotenberg executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center a nonprofit digital rights research and advocacy group is one of the expert advisers He is a champion of more forceful guidelines like a prohibition on Chinesestyle scoring of individuals based on their personal information and online behaviorBut Mr Rotenberg described the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Developments effort as the right synthesis to pursue combining economic development and a fundamental human right to privacy The guidelines he said should be a very important policy

gives it a key entry into a market where it is seeking to expand Amazon  which controls nearly onethird of the global cloud computing business ahead of rivals Microsoft Corp and Google  has until recently struggled to lure public institutions in Latin America to store their data online instead of on physical machinesAt a ceremony announcing the project in Santiago on Tuesday Chile Economy Minister Jose Ramon Valente said the country had selected Amazon to provide the infrastructure for the initiative calling it one of the largest centers for the study of big data in the worldOur objective was to create an organization that would be open to the community and neutral that could make the best use of the  data that is generated in our country he said We want this to be very inclusive Chilean officials have previously told Reuters tools developed for the astrodata project would also be applicable for a wide variety of other uses such as tracking potential shoplifters

selected by the nonprofit Chilean Data ObservatoryThe deal also comes amid speculation about where in the region the tech giant will install its next data center which would allow local firms and government to store information on the cloud Chile and Argentina are both vying for Amazons investmentEconomy Minister Valente said the project bodes well for Chiles relationship with AmazonThis

global technology giants and prompting comparisons to censorship in ChinaUnder the proposed rules Indian officials could demand that Facebook Google Twitter TikTok and others remove posts or videos that they deem libelous invasive of privacy hateful or deceptive Internet companies would also have to build automated screening tools to block Indians from seeing unlawful information or content Another provision would weaken the privacy protections of messaging services like WhatsApp so that the authorities could trace messages back to their original sendersThe new rules could be imposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modis government anytime after the public comment period ends on Thursday night The administration has been eager to get them in place before the date is set for this springs national elections which will prompt special preelection rules limiting new policiesCivil liberties groups and other critics said the changes would violate constitutional protections for free speech and privacy and put India in the same league as autocratic countries like China and Russia Some of them suggested that the Modi administration was rushing to adopt the regulations so it could more easily pressure the tech platforms to remove social media posts by political opponents in the coming electionThe proposed changes have an authoritarian bent said Apar Gupta executive director of the Internet Freedom Foundation a digital rights group which plans to challenge the rules in court if they are enacted This is very similar to what China does to its citizens where it polices their every move and tracks their every post on social mediaIndias proposals add to the growing resistance worldwide against internet behemoths like Google and Facebook which once flourished largely unimpeded In Europe officials last year enacted tough new rules to protect peoples online data forcing the companies to change some practices China has long used a system of internet filters known as the Great Firewall to block content and shut out global tech companies And in a  review The New York Times tallied more than  countries that had passed laws in recent years to gain greater control over how their people use the webThe result may be a splintering internet where a onetime unified information superhighway has become increasingly restricted in certain areas In India the government has used laws to nudge people away from the American tech giants and toward local competitors such as ShareChat a social network that operates only in Indian languages and Reliance Jio a cellphone giant bankrolled by Indias richest manMishi Choudhary founder of SFLCin a legal advocacy group in New Delhi said Indian governments had tried for nearly a decade to exercise more control over internet content but had been restrained by the courts Now the government is trying again she saidMinisters have said these companies will have to comply with Indian rules and Indian rules are pretty regressive said Ms Choudhary whose group filed comments opposing the new rules We have Indian morality We have to keep law and order And we cannot hurt religious sentimentsIndias Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology which proposed the online content changes has said the new rules simply build on existing laws and are necessary to combat false and illegal information on social media The regulations also seek to hold foreign tech companies  including Chinese app makers that have little presence in India now  more accountable Companies with more than five million Indian users would be required to set up a local subsidiary and appoint leaders based in the countryAjay Sawhney the information technology secretary did not respond to requests for an interview Officials have privately suggested that they will consider the public responses to their draft rules and make adjustments before issuing a final versionWorking independently as well as through trade groups Microsoft Facebook and dozens of other tech companies are fighting back against the proposals They criticized the rules as technically impractical and said they were a sharp departure from how the rest of the world regulates data intermediaries a term for companies that host data provided by their customers and usersIn most countries including under Indias existing laws such intermediaries are given a safe harbor That means they are exempted from responsibility for illegal or inappropriate content posted on their services as long as they remove it once notified by a court or another designated authorityIn a filing with the ministry last week Microsoft said that complying with Indias new standards would be impossible from the process legal and technology point of viewThe company  whose Hyderabadborn chief executive Satya Nadella is a business icon in India  said the proposal lumped together all intermediaries as varied as social networks and WiFi hot spots even though each has a different level of control over content that flows through it In the filing Microsoft said it would be difficult to screen out gambling content as the rules would require Filtering the full range of content demanded by the government would not only violate privacy and freedom of expression the company wrote but would also be so challenging that the cost of even attempting compliance will be prohibitiveTrade groups representing the largest tech companies have made similar arguments in their filingsLast week WhatsApp which is owned by Facebook and has some  million active users in India said it could not meet the proposed requirement that it trace viral messages to their origin without destroying the privacy protections that are core to the serviceWhatsApp cares deeply about creating a space for private conversations online Carl Woog a company spokesman said at a news conference in New Delhi He said the proposed rules would require us to rearchitect WhatsApp leading to a different product one that would not be fundamentally privateGoogle and Facebook declined to comment beyond filings made by the industry groups to which they belong Twitter which is jousting with Indias Parliament over claims that it suppresses rightwing content said in a statement that it hoped that any changes to the rules would strike a careful balance that protects important values such as freedom of expressionIndia began signaling last year that it planned to impose tough rules on the tech industry ending the free rein that American tech giants have long enjoyed in this country of  billion people which has been the worlds fastestgrowing market for new internet users Among other things officials discussed Europeanstyle limits on what big internet companies can do with users personal dataThe newest proposals on internet content were introduced at a private meeting with tech companies in December They were on track for quick passage until the details leaked to The Indian Express a local newspaper which prompted the government to invite broader feedbackOfficials have offered little public explanation for the proposals beyond a desire to curb the kind of false rumors about child kidnappers that spread on WhatsApp a year ago and that incited angry mobs to kill two dozen innocent people That wave of violence has since subsidedThe coming national election has added urgency to the proposals Indias Election Commission which administers national and state elections is considering a ban on all social media content and ads aimed at influencing voters for the  hours before voting begins according to an internal report obtained by the news media To buttress its legal authority to order such a ban the commission wrote to the IT ministry last week asking it to amend the new rules to specifically prohibit online content that violates election laws or commission ordersOne of the biggest cheerleaders for the new rules was Reliance Jio a fastgrowing mobile phone company controlled by Mukesh Ambani Indias richest industrialist Mr Ambani an ally of Mr Modi has made no secret of his plans to turn Reliance Jio into an allpurpose information service that offers streaming video and music messaging money transfer online shopping and home broadband servicesIn a filing last week Reliance Jio said the new rules were necessary to combat miscreants and urged the government to ignore freespeech protests The company also said that encrypted messaging services like WhatsApp although perceivably beneficial to users are detrimental to national interest and hence should not be allowedFollow Vindu Goel on Twitter vindugoelAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersSINGAPORE  Grab is looking to raise another  billion  billion pounds this year to ramp up

CondliffeEach week we review the weeks news offering analysis about the most important developments in the tech industry Want this newsletter in your inbox Sign up hereHi Im Jamie Condliffe Greetings from London Heres a look at the weeks tech newsWeb regulators are getting into their groove But are they going too quicklyThis past week the British government proposed new powers to issue fines and make individual executives legally liable for harmful content on their platforms My colleague Adam Satariano said it would be one of the worlds most aggressive actions to rein in the most corrosive online contentDays earlier Australia passed legislation that threatens fines for social media companies that fail to rapidly remove violent material And theres a growing pipeline of other internet regulation along with existing laws like the European Unions sweeping General Data Protection RegulationWere entering a new phase of hyper regulation said Paul Fehlinger the deputy executive director of the Internet and Jurisdiction Policy Network an organization established to understand how national laws affect the internetThis flurry of content rules is understandable Much of the material they would police is abhorrent and social medias rapid rise has caught lawmakers off guard now the public wants something doneBut the regulations could have unintended consequencesDifficulties in defining harmful mean governments will develop different standards In turn the web could easily look different depending on your location  a big shift from its founding principles This is already happening The Chicago Tribunes website for example doesnt comply with General Data Protection Regulation so theres no access to it from EuropeThere may be less visible effects If regulation required differences at a hardware level that could fragment the infrastructure said Konstantinos Komaitis a senior director at the nonprofit Internet Society which promotes the open development and use of the internet That could make the internet less resilient to outages and attacksAnd bigger richer companies will find it easier to comply with sprawling regulation which could reinforce the power of Big TechThere is a major risk that we end up in a situation where shortterm political pressure trumps longterm vision Mr Fehlinger saidMr Komaitis said avoiding unintended consequences was very simple yet very difficultIt is all about collaboration he added The idea lawmakers work together across borders to ensure rules are more consistentThe challenge is that collaboration could slow the pace of regulation that lawmakers desire But Mr Komaitis said many proposed regulations lack clear plans for implementation and envisions snags when governments come to apply them If they struggle he said collaboration and sharing of expertise may be the only way to make their plans workHow is technology blurring the lines between public and private Sign up to Charlie Warzels new limitedrun newsletter to find out more  and what you can do stop itArtificial intelligence could make our lives easier and more efficient But like any powerful technology its more complicated than that AI can be used for surveillance To control autonomous weapons It can be biased It could erode jobs The list goes onNone of those are reasons to reject AI outright But they underscore how its development must be approached with careBig Tech has struggled to publicly demonstrate that care Amazon Google and Microsoft have all drawn criticism for their AI work with military and government agencies Just this month Googles plan to create an AI ethics board ended disastrously when backlash about board members led to its dissolutionMissteps should be called out especially when theyre made by such powerful corporations But in an emergent field mistakes also serve as lessons And a new set of AI ethics guidelines from the European Commission is a good example of how trial and error will be a fundamental part of ethical AI developmentThe guidelines developed by  experts contain seven requirements that AI systems should meet to be deemed trustworthy What stands out about them for Charlotte Stix a policy officer at the Leverhulme Center for the Future of Intelligence at Cambridge University is that theyre designed to be carried outUnlike other AI ethics guidelines they attempt to join ethical principles to firm recommendations  something that has divided opinions among some people working in the field Thats why the European Commission hopes companies will adopt and test them between now and  so that they can be improvedFrank Buytendijk a vice president in Gartners data and analytics group said the guidelines sent a message to big tech companies that may have struggled with AI ethics in the past Heres your chance to do the right thingAmazon joined the ranks of tech companies wanting to blanket the world with the internetIts Project Kuiper plan which came to light in filings made by the Federal Communications Commission would put  satellites into low Earth orbit to deliver the internet to underserved communities around the world It has been likened to a network under development by SpaceX Facebook has plans for a similar system and Google has teamed up with the satellite operator Telesat along the same linesThese initiatives seek to provide affordable internet connections to people who currently lack them  from Alaska to subSaharan Africa Satellites appear to be a frontrunner Christopher Mims of The Wall Street Journal noted that according to the satellite industry veteran Shayn Hawthorne some kind of affordable satellite internet now appears inevitableFor big tech companies this is not selfless A good example of why is the Free Basics program offered by Facebooks nonprofit

WeiseSEATTLE  Amazon held off stiffer competition for online shoppers during the holiday season once again increasing its sales But the company said on Thursday that growth slowed from its usual breakneck pace  and it came at a cost with the company spending far more on shipping to win customersWhile strong the latest quarterly results suggested that Amazons retail business not only faces more competition it is also maturing The company reported that its revenue from retail sales and services grew  percent to almost  billion globally while its shipping costs rose  percent to  billion compared with the same quarter a year agoThe company is compensating for slowing growth in ecommerce by expanding its fastmoving highly profitable cloud and advertising businesses Over all the company produced a profit of  billion in the quarter up more than  percent from the same period a year earlierCompetition for shoppers over the holidays was intense and expensive as other big retailers stepped up their promotions Target offered free twoday shipping no matter how small an order and Walmart and others tried to maximize use of their physical stores an advantage they have over Amazon On Christmas Eve Best Buy customers could order products online from store inventory as late as  pm and pick them up just an hour laterAmazon pushed back with expanded free shipping to all customers until about a week before Christmas and made more products eligible for free oneday shipping for Prime membersBut revenue from online shopping slowed in part because now most of Amazons retail sales come from thirdparty merchants selling on its marketplace rather than from Amazons own inventory Amazon gets only a slice of this revenueIn addition the growth of Prime membership which costs  a year is approaching a plateau About  percent of American households will be Prime members this year up only slightly from  percent in  Morgan Stanley estimated Prime members spend far more on the site making them crucial to increasing salesAnother risk awaits the company India The country which Amazon has made its most important emerging market imposed new regulations that prohibit foreign ecommerce companies from owning a stake in sellers that offer items on their sites That has limited the selection available on Amazon by almost a third virtually overnight Brian Olsavsky Amazons finance chief cited uncertainty in India as a reason Amazon predicted lower revenue for the next quarter than analysts had expectedEven as sales growth has slowed though Amazon has increased profit marginsThe thirdparty merchant business for example is generally more profitable than when Amazon sells products it buys directly because the costs are lowerIt has also tried to squeeze costs from its operations Mr Olsavsky pointed to how the number of employees grew  percent in  excluding acquisitions but just  percent in  There were similar trends in the construction of data centers and warehouses We had a banking if you will of some large expansions in the prior two years Mr Olsavsky said on a call with analystsThe theme has been Amazon shifting from a product seller to a fee collector said Simeon Siegel an analyst at Instinet The shift from growth to profit is common as companies mature he said We are going through growing painsShares in the company fell nearly  percent in afterhours trading after the quarterly results were releasedAmazons two great profit engines are not in the core business of selling and fulfilling items however  they are in cloud computing and advertisingAmazon Web Services the leading provider of cloud computing grew  percent with  billion in sales and almost  billion in operating incomeAfter several years of dominating the market which it essentially helped create Amazon now faces robust competition including from Microsoft At its annual cloud conference in November Amazon announced a number of new products including AWS Outposts which lets companies use a single set of tools to manage data across cloud and local servers an area known as hybrid cloud where Microsoft has had successMr Olsavsky said the company had been hiring aggressively to bring in more engineers and sales staff for the cloud offerings saying AWS maintained a very strong growth rate and continued to deliver for customersInvestors have increasingly looked to Amazons ad business which displays ads on its own site as well as across the web based on consumer shopping habits as a major driver of profit The Other business unit which analysts say is almost entirely advertising had almost  billion in revenue during the quarter and more than  billion over the last yearThey have long been a sleeping giant and had capacity to build a big advertising

long time agoBy Kara SwisherMs Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer If you want to know why Mark Zuckerberg is suddenly so interested in privacy I have one word for you dataMark makes decisions based on data and not values a person familiar with Facebooks inner workings said when I asked about the chief executives stunning aboutface this week on the new trajectory of the social media industry he pretty much foundedI would bet a lot that Mr Zuckerberg saw the data I have seen that shows that the future is not looking good for the bloated oversharing fakenewsspewing Russianinfected big blue app that made him both rich and powerful and now quite vulnerableKara Swisher answered your questions about this column on TwitterAnd what do those numbers say Well first and foremost that social media is in big trouble with the young and that it is long past time for it to shift to a privacyoriented stance that was never part of its DNA except perhaps as a throwaway line in a news releaseWhile Facebook has always insisted otherwise its commitment to protecting the information of users has been weak at best since its very founding But now Mr Zuckerberg has written a blog post  with not one single trace of irony and with nary a mention of the many privacy abuses he has presided over  announcing that the company would be betting big on private messaging and protected communications for its billions of usersYou know like Snapchat but on a Facebook scaleOver the years Facebook has swiped many nifty ideas from Snapchat the ephemeral messaging platform  which Mr Zuckerberg actually tried to buy many years ago when it was still a startup That has been especially true at the Facebookowned Instagram which did a wholesale shoplift of Snapchats Stories by creating  wait for it  Instagram StoriesIn a podcast interview with me the Instagram cofounder and former chief executive Kevin Systrom did not even bother to hide the act He said that he admired the creativity of Evan Spiegel the Snapchat founder and that taking a good idea and making it better was a thing that always happened in tech He compared the Stories feature to a car radio that Instagram had simply improved on Indeed it did and it has been a huge hit for FacebookThats fair enough I guess But this time Mr Zuckerberg is pilfering so much more sketching out a future business that looks a lot like Snapchat with a little bit like Chinas WeChat mixed in And mostly not at all like FacebookThe big takeaway is that the penny has finally dropped with Mr Zuckerberg that messaging and social media are very different to users as much as he has tried to force them into an unholy mushAll you would have to do to figure that out is ask my yearold But I recently saw some internal Snapchat data that drove this message home using data from both Snapchat and Facebook Ad Managers It showed that Snapchat ads reach more  to yearolds in the United States than ads on Facebook Instagram and Messenger combined Among  to yearolds the delta is even widerEven if those are Snapchat stats it is clear that the young demographic that Facebook covets doesnt much care about public sharing via posting If it did would Mr Zuckerberg have seen the need to make this announcement He would not since the adheavy Facebook bulletin board is still a huge moneymaker and its much harder to make such scratch from a business focused on private messagingThat has been one of the problems of Snapchat which is much smaller than Facebook  as well as internal missteps caused by a rotating series of managers and strategiesBut Mr Spiegels idea  that people care a lot about privacy and dont want the information they upload to be sold like a Christmas pig  remains a stellar one Ironically Mr Zuckerberg may turn out to be the one who can make it profitableSo indulge me for a minute with a comparison Mr Zuckerberg is to Bill Gates as Mr Spiegel is to Steve JobsMr Jobs always had better ideas and vision than Mr Gates But Apple spent a long time in dire straits while he pushed his highlevel concepts about security privacy and design and simplicityMr Gates on the other hand was an unqualified genius at business models and systems and he clearly understood the depressing truth that good enough was good enough for a lot of consumers Of course Mr Jobss stunning creativity eventually won out with the advent of the iPod which was soon followed by the iPhone and well the rest is history Mr Gates and his No  at Microsoft Steve Ballmer scoffed at the efforts of Apple before trying to backpedal furiously It did not workRemember the Microsoft Zune Me neitherIn a podcast interview last year Mr Zuckerberg namechecked Mr Gates as an important mentor and he has obviously learned well He has already shown a talent for turnarounds shifting the company from desktop to mobile in one of the most impressive management moves in tech history While he stumbled at first by doing a Facebook phone I dont remember that either the deft Mr Zuckerberg quickly recovered and the company has never looked backAnd now this a chance to leave behind all the headaches that come with running an enormous public platform As I have said before Facebook is like a megapolis presided over by Mr Zuckerberg Managing it is hard because it needs a strong police force and competent people to pick up the garbage and working sewers and there are bad people all over the place While the growth of this city lets call it ZuckTown has been impressive it has also been sloppily managed in ways that have hurt societyMaybe the Facebook of the future will be different That could be a very good thing for the world and Im glad that Mr Zuckerberg seems to have decided that the map laid out by Snapchat is the one to go with  even if he didnt give Snapchat any credit for it One person I spoke with likened Mr Zuckerberg to a captain who has decided not to go down with a ship that has sprung some serious leaks Hes just going to jump to another ship rather than fix the first one And keep on goingI guess there is not much else to say but Godspeed MarkThe Times is committed to publishing a

titans like IBM to startups working on the future of artificial intelligenceIn this weeks newsletter were largely taking a break from the consumer internet giants and the various controversies swirling around them Exception Amazons surprise announcement on Thursday to abandon its plans to build a headquarters in New York See belowInstead were going to look at recent research and reports that track how digital technology is moving into mainstream industries and the implicationsLets start with a smart piece this week by my colleague Erin Griffith The Next Wave of Unicorn StartUps Erin asked CB Insights a research firm that studies startups and venture capital to create a list of the next wave of young companies likely to reach valuations of  billion or more She then reported on some of the  companiesThe first round of wellknown unicorns led by Uber and Airbnb she writes exploited smartphones and cloud computing to upend oldline businesses The next companies poised to become unicorns are going narrower deeper and into more fieldsThey largely focus on software she writes for specific industries like farms banks and life sciences companiesThat kind of broadbased adoption across the nations  trillion economy is what will deliver growth and higher living standards for many Yet the advance of datadriven artificial intelligence will also provide realworld evidence of how much and how quickly this technology may widen income disparities and kill jobsThe short answer it seems is not as fast as technopessimists fear AIs progress is impressive but limited An article this week by Cade Metz AI Shows Promise Assisting Physicians  underlines that pointThe piece describes an AI research program whose accuracy matched or slightly surpassed human physicians in diagnosing common childhood diseases like influenza The software was trained on the medical histories lab tests and other clinical data in more than  electronic health records of children in southern ChinaIt was an encouraging demonstration But the experimental system relied on the easy access to personal data in China where privacy regulations are less restrictive and was confined to diagnosing common ailmentsThat stepbystep approach is the counsel for business in a new book by Thomas Davenport The AI Advantage How to Put the Artificial Intelligence Revolution to Work MIT Press Mr Davenport a professor of information technology and management at Babson College is a seasoned expert in using digital data to streamline operations and spot opportunities And hes been at it since well before the current AI wave which is both a technological evolution and a branding crazeHis advice to mainstream companies is that the best course is often to use basic AI tools to automate mundane office tasks in operations like accounting billing payments and customer service  and to avoid moon shotsOne of Mr Davenports prime examples of a misguided moon shot was IBMs initial efforts to apply its Watson technology to diagnosing cancer That was a highprofile science project that proved more difficult timeconsuming and costly than anticipated though IBM continues that work with several leading cancer centersSpeaking of IBM the company was out in San Francisco this week for its annual Think conference which attracted more than  attendees Its executives presented its Watson and cloud technology as the trusted path for companies across the industrial spectrum that want to embrace AIIBM cannot compete headon with Amazon Microsoft and Google in the bigspending game of building out massive data centers to provide the infrastructure layer of cloud computing to one and all So it is seeking to shift the competitionIBM talks about chapter two in the cloud market Increasingly it says companies will run not only new applications but also their legacy software on the cloud either private clouds in their own data centers or on IBMs cloud The next stage of cloud computing Virginia Rometty IBMs chief executive told Jon Fortt of CNBC is going to be driven by the modernization of missioncritical apps Thats our sweet spotAnd in a nod to reality IBM announced a Watson Anywhere initiative Its AI technology will run on the popular clouds of Amazon Microsoft or Google as well as IBMs cloudIn other news J David Goodman City Hall reporter for The Times deftly explained the shifting politics before Amazon withdrew its plan in Why Amazon Is Caught in an Unexpected Brawl in New York But what happened in Queens is part of a broader resistance to the tech boom and its consequences After the protests surfaced last year Fred Wilson the dean of New York venture capitalists told me that its partly from a sense that Amazon coming in is not going to help them and will only drive up their costs To really be a success in New York the benefits of the tech sector have to extend to every borough and every neighborhoodThat concern across the country as AI technology marches ahead is the subject of  a lengthy analysis this week by Mark Muro a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution For a rich enlightening read I recommend a piece in this weeks New York Times Magazine The Secret History of Women in Coding The secret is a headline writers exaggeration Anyone with an interest in computing history knows about Ada Lovelace Grace Hopper and the women who programmed the early Eniac computer Those stories have been told repeatedly including in booksBut Clive Thompson the author elegantly weaves that history around the story of an early female programmer who is alive and recalls it all His piece captures what it was like in the s through early s when writing software was a wideopen field before a maledominated culture took rootAs Lois Haibt  who in  as a freshly minted Vassar College

David Gelles and Cade MetzTechnology and business writers from The Times participated in the New Work Summit last week in Half Moon Bay Calif which featured some of the top tech minds in the country Over a day and a half they engaged in spirited conversations about the relationship between artificial intelligence and human beings  and how or whether the creators of AI should be held to ethical standards Here are the takeaways from David Gelles of the Timess Corner Office and the technology writers Nellie Bowles and Cade MetzMR METZ I dont know about you David and Nellie but what struck me were the vast differences of opinion swirling around the notion of ethical artificial intelligence Ethics are very much in the eye of the beholderMS BOWLES They are My panel with the ethicist Tristan Harris and AI researcher Meredith Whittaker dove into some of the complexities for companies like Google and Facebook trying to establish ethical guidelines for what theyre rolling out In some ways its unfair to ask an engineer to also be a philosopher And even if a company hopes that the engineers think about implications those workers mostly white mostly male mostly in office parks around Palo Alto cannot possibly conceive of how many lives the algorithms will impact and how So my panelists argued in favor of transparency As artificial intelligence is being developed companies should open up for researchers and the public to grok it and start having these debates And in terms of that morning theres nothing better than philosophy by candlelightMR GELLES Ah yes the lack of electricity The power was out the live stream was down and the stage was lit with candles It was a good look for a tech conference But yes ethics seemed well  relative Speakers like Mr Harris and Ms Whittaker spoke passionately about the need for companies to respect users privacy while former Secretary of Defense Ash Carter made a compelling argument that launching a Tomahawk missile was not so different than dispatching a swarm of autonomous killer dronesMR METZ You can see this same split inside the big tech companies It was recently revealed that Microsoft employees have protested the companys decision to supply HoloLens augmented reality headsets to the military but Brad Smith who you interviewed on stage strongly defended this and other military projects For him this is about defending the freedoms of our countryMR GELLES Its refreshing to see a big company stand up to its employees for once For so much of the last few years it has seemed like activist employees  often a small but vocal minority  have been dictating the policies of big companies Microsoft seems to have remembered that its employees work for the company and not the other way aroundMR METZ After Google shut down some of its military work in response to employee protests many saw this as the beginning of something larger But you do wonder how much of that was driven by Googles unique corporate culture where there is open communication across the company and employees are on some level encouraged to voice their personal opinionsMS BOWLES Exactly Google is extremely unique and Im curious how long management will tolerate its rebellious work force Facebook for example operates as an almost cult of secrecy and loyalty so you dont see similar highprofile protests in Menlo ParkMR GELLES Cade whats your take on how impactful some of these technologies really are right now I heard some examples of AI and machine learning being put to work in specific ways But at times it felt like everyone was still speculating about a science fiction filmMR METZ This is an ongoing problem There have been very real and very significant gains in image recognition speech recognition and language translation over the last several years That can help with talking digital assistants driverless cars and certain aspects of health care  not to mention face recognition services and autonomous weapons But so many tech executives  and the press  talk about AI in a weirdly exaggerated way Driverless cars are still years from the mainstream Better translation is very different from a more general intelligence that can do anything a human can doMR GELLES Nellie you spoke with Meredith Whittaker and Tristan Harris two cautionary voices in tech today Do you get the sense that the people really making decisions at companies like Facebook and Google are really listening to them or merely pretending to care about the issues theyre raisingMS BOWLES I would ask what exactly it means to care Do

Thursday A central player in the project is the philanthropy founded by Facebooks chief executive Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Dr Priscilla ChanThe effort called the Partnership for the Bays Future is

the partnership Californias governor Gavin Newsom called the move a bold action Mr Newsom who has criticized tech companies for not doing enough to help solve a problem they are widely believed to have exacerbated praised the projects collaboration of private companies nonprofits government agencies and community leadersMorgan Stanley Kaiser Permanente Facebook and Genentech are also contributing to the partnership But the role that any one company will play is small compared with Microsofts pledge last week  to spend  million toward affordable housing in the Seattle areaThe Bay

byWhite House MemoBy Katie RogersWASHINGTON  On a threestate tour this week to promote her childfocused initiative Be Best Melania Trump showed that her time as first lady has sharpened an already sophisticated understanding of how to enhance her public imageIn a glossy and tightly controlled environment Mrs Trump restricted the majority of her interactions to emphasize motherhood  perhaps the only part of her private life that she has publicly embraced In Tulsa Okla she had a heartwarming exchange with a child who dislikes homework In Seattle she spoke to assembled Microsoft executives about the challenges children face online And onstage at a theater in Las Vegas she shared a rare personal story about warning her yearold son Barron about the dangers of drug abuseI try to explain how drugs are dangerous Mrs Trump said and how they will mess up your head mess up your body and nothing positive comes of itMrs Trumps tour firmed up her commitment to Be Best which addresses social media well being and the opioid crisis and which has faced setbacks from the start The momentum of a Rose Garden debut in May was slowed when Mrs Trump fell ill from a kidney condition soon afterward And since then she and her person East Wing staff have had to deal with a departing policy director a lengthy government shutdown and countless chaotic news cycles engulfing President Trumps White HouseWhen Mrs Trump embarked on this weeks trip she made it clear that she would not be talking about anything she deemed off topic when she ignored a reporters shouted question about the testimony of Michael D Cohen her husbands former personal lawyer Last week Mr Cohen told Congress that he deeply regretted lying to Mrs Trump about an alleged affair between her husband and the pornographic film star Stormy DanielsMrs Trump instead tried to keep her message trained on Be Best But by Tuesday the second and final day of her trip she took a moment at the townhallstyle event in Las Vegas to chide the news media for dedicating time to other coverage besides the opioid crisisI challenge the press to devote as much time to the lives lost and the potential lives that could be saved by dedicating the same amount of coverage that you do to idle gossip or trivial stories Mrs Trump saidThe first lady did not specify which stories she considered unwelcome but like her husband she pays close attention to her news coverage poring over the headlines on social media That private behavior tends to conflict with her public admonishments Mrs Trump has castigated the news media for focusing on her image including matters of her personal style despite relying on it as a powerful messaging tool  with mixed results  in the pastModern first ladies said Anita McBride who served as Laura Bushs chief of staff have faced intense pressure to field questions about their private lives while trying to build substantive policy platforms without the luxury of a West Wingsize staff Mrs Bushs National Book Festival survived in part because it was coopted by the Library of Congress And several partners helped push along Michelle Obamas Lets Move initiative including her efforts to find funding for salad bars in schoolsEven so both women faced questions regarding anything but those platformsIts not just her Mrs McBride said of Mrs Trump Its this constant focus on the clothes and the private life But any first lady she added must endure scrutiny about what she called that mystery behind the walls of the White HouseIn recent months Mrs Trump has continued to try to reinforce the idea that her behindthescenes efforts are more important than surface curiosities In December she hired Art Harding who previously worked on policy issues at the United States Agency for International Development to fill the role of policy director Stephanie Grisham Mrs Trumps communications director said in an emailMs Grisham said the East Wing was also working on partnerships that are meant to help Mrs Trumps Be Best message endure Those partners include Lilys Place a West Virginia clinic that treats babies born with neonatal abstinence syndrome the National Institutes of Health and MicrosoftThe opioid crisis is one issue that administration officials and those close to the crisis say Mrs Trump has succeeded in spotlightingKellyanne Conway the counselor to the president said that Mrs Trump decided to fold the subject of opioids into her portfolio in the summer of  and has regularly been at the presidents side since he declared the matter a public health emergency that fallThis is the one public policy issue that they work on together Ms Conway said The first lady lending her voice and visibility is priceless currencyOthers say Mrs Trumps willingness to lend her image has led to a noticeable increase in awareness around neonatal abstinence syndrome a condition in which babies are born in opioid withdrawal  one suffering from the condition is born every  minutes according to government statisticsAs deaths from drug overdoses skyrocket the Trump administrations handling of opioid addiction has not escaped the reaches of the House Oversight and Reform Committee which announced on Wednesday that it would hold a hearing to determine if the White House had been deficient in its approach to national drug policy Even so Jessica Hulsey Nickel the founder of Addiction Policy Forum a group of organizations working to elevate awareness of the opioid crisis said Mrs Trumps work was a gift for people struggling to find resourcesTo pay attention and to shine a spotlight on the moms and babies affected by this disease who are often overlooked Ms Hulsey Nickel said thats important and it deserves recognitionAs she closed out her Be Best tour in Las Vegas Mrs Trump shared her thoughts on the opioid crisis with Eric Bolling a friend of the Trumps whose son died after an accidental opioid overdose in  Mr Bolling said that interest in the townhallstyle events he hosts as part of an initiative by Sinclair Broadcast Group the countrys largest broadcaster blows up when he is able to announce Mrs Trumps participationYou can probably fake a lot of things a lot of initiatives Mr Bolling said But you cannot fake empathyIn the end even Mr Bolling could not resist asking Mrs Trump a round of personal questions She told him that her days involve renovation projects  including the White House bowling alley  overseeing the White House residence staff working with the White House Historical Association and managing her sons scheduleMr Bollings comparatively casual line of questioning prompted dozens of offtopic headlines including those that focused on the preferred Trump family dish  spaghetti Mrs Trump guessed  over the importance of the

covers Google computer accessories are important Very importantFeaturing Daisuke WakabayashiHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives Daisuke Wakabayashi a technology reporter in San Francisco discussed the tech hes usingWhat are your most important tech toolsIm most particular about the tech products I use as basic tools of my job Im a maniac about keyboards and mice I generally hate most of them While I use Macs at home and at work I dislike every Apple keyboard and dont care for the companys mice either The keys are too flat I never know if Ive pressed hard enough and it hurts my hands after a whileAs my colleagues will tell you I use a very loud mechanical keyboard made by Das Keyboards These mechanical keyboards are similar to the ones that came with my familys first IBM computer from the s Ive also used the same mouse for the last five yearsAside from that I use an app called Voice Record Pro on my iPhone for recording interviews If Im recording a phone call  with permission of course  Ill use an app from Rev which is also the service I use to have my interviews transcribed Its a little steep at  per minute but the accuracy is so much better than the AIonly alternatives that cost like  cents a minuteWhy are you so particular about your mouse and keyboard I feel like I type faster and more accurately with this keyboard  which is important because Im already a slow typer Whats more the tactile responsiveness when I push a key is so satisfying Its silly but it also makes me feel productive each keystroke an audio reminder that Im one step closer to my goalThere are drawbacks The keyboard is not as sleek and visually appealing as the Apple keyboards They are also super loud and the clickclacks can be distracting for people around you as well as unsettling for people youre on the phone with if youre taking notes Ive often been stopped by sources who ask why Im typing so feverishly afraid that Im pounding the keys because they said something they shouldnt have Now Ill sometimes take notes by hand using a pen and paper and then transcribe them later if its a sensitive conversationMy mouse for the last five years has been a wireless one from Microsoft Its called the Sculpt Ergonomic Mouse I like this mouse because it has good heft Some wireless mice are too light and they dart around like a hyperactive child I also dont want too big of a mouse and then I feel like armwrestling with the device This one provides a good balance Also the bottom is plastic and its quiet when I move the mouse around on my desk The Apple ones make this cringey scraping sound Again I acknowledge that Im crazy when it comes to my computer accessoriesYou cover Google and in a past life you covered Apple Both are fierce competitors with their own mobile operating systems internet services smartphones and computers What do you see as the challenges for the companies going forwardApple has focused on creating beautiful easytouse products but I find that its products are becoming harder to use I think some of it is just a function of our devices being asked to do more  my iPhone is central to my life in ways that it wasnt even three years ago  and how do you build in that additional capability without bogging down the software Apples products are still beautiful but I think that form is overtaking function in some areas See headphone jack lack of ports on laptops A devices beauty is meaningful only if it is also usefulGoogles issues are different Theyre not purely product questions but are more fundamental The company turned  last year and it feels like its going through an identity crisis Google was the antiMicrosoft in the early days Many of its longtime employees were drawn to Google not purely because it was a moneymaking machine but because it also seemed interested in being a force for good in the tech industry Who can forget Dont Be Evil and all that But as Google has grown increasingly dominant it has become difficult to subscribe to a selfimage of a whimsical dogooder when everyone else sees you as Godzilla trampling across the internet landscape Weve already seen some employee revolts and I suspect well see more Look at how it is wrestling with what it plans to do with search in China which shows this identity crisis is filtering into its business and products decisionsOutside of work what tech product are you and your family currently obsessed with My wife and I have a yearold son and he just loves playing with our digital speakers We have an Amazon Echo in the kitchen and a Google Home upstairs Theyre both connected to Spotify He knows that he can ask Alexa or Google to play Wheels on the Bus or BaaBaa Black Sheep and voil the music comes onBut these days hes become more particular and he likes a version of Wheels on the Bus performed by Mother Goose Club so hell shout something like Alexa play Wheels on

intervene but occasionally Alexa or Google understands him and he is delightedHis other favorite activity is to ask Google to play sounds of different things His favorite requests in no particular order animals emergency vehicles and modes of transportation Recently he discovered that Google can play the sound of a dinosaur and this excited him to no endBut now my son thinks anything with an

tens of millions of Facebook profiles sued the social media giant on Friday arguing that the company defamed him when it claimed he had lied about how the data was going to be usedSince the full scope of Cambridge Analyticas data mining was revealed last year Facebook has repeatedly tried to shift blame for the privacy breach onto the academic Aleksandr Kogan Facebook executives  including the chief executive Mark Zuckerberg  have said Mr Kogan told Facebook that the data was for academic purposes when it was being collected for use in political campaignsMr Kogan  a former psychology professor used a quiz app to collect the data and has insisted that the fine print accompanying his app said the information could be used commercially That was an outright violation of Facebooks rules at the time but the company does not appear to have regularly checked that apps were complyingAlex did not lie Alex was not a fraud Alex did not deceive them this was not a scam said Steve Cohen a lawyer for Mr Kogan Facebook knew exactly what this app was doing or should have known Facebook desperately needed a scapegoat and Alex was their scapegoatMr Cohen said Mr Kogan was not asking for any specific amount of money Were going to leave that to a jury he saidIn a statement Liz Bourgeois a spokeswoman for Facebook described the action as a frivolous lawsuit from someone who violated our policies and put peoples data at riskCambridge Analytica was founded by Robert Mercer a wealthy Republican donor and Stephen K Bannon who would serve as an adviser to President Trump The consulting firm rose to prominence in  for its work with the Trump election campaignThe company claimed it had used Facebook data and other information to develop analytical tools that could identify the personalities of American voters and influence their behavior Those techniques have been widely questionedCambridge hired Mr Kogan as a contractor in June   the same month the company was founded  and collected the data throughout the summer by asking Facebook users to take a lengthy personality questionnaire The quiz harvested data not only from everyone who took it but also from all their friendsFacebook which has since tightened its privacy protections allowed app developers broad access to its users data at the time Many were unaware their data was exposed and Facebook was plunged into the worst crisis of its year history after the scope of Cambridge Analyticas data harvesting was revealed by The New York Times and The Observer of LondonThe company has since said that as many as  million users were affected and it is facing investigations by federal prosecutors and regulators as a result At least one of those investigations is being run by prosecutors from the Northern District of California and appears to be partly focused on Facebooks claims that it was misled by CambridgeFederal prosecutors in New York are conducting what appears to be a separate criminal investigation into data deals Facebook struck with some of the worlds largest technology companies including Amazon Microsoft and Netflix And the Federal Trade Commission which spent the past year

researchers at the University of Toronto built a system that could analyze thousands of photos and teach itself to recognize everyday objects like dogs cars and flowersThe system was so effective that Google bought the tiny startup these researchers were only just getting off the ground And soon their system sparked a technological revolution Suddenly machines could see in a way that was not possible in the pastThis made it easier for a smartphone app to search your personal photos and find the images you were looking for It accelerated the progress of driverless cars and other robotics And it improved the accuracy of facial recognition services for social networks like Facebook and for the countrys law enforcement agenciesBut soon researchers noticed that these facial recognition services were less accurate when used with women and people of color Activists raised concerns over how companies were collecting the huge amounts of data needed to train these kinds of systems Others worried these systems would eventually lead to mass surveillance or autonomous weaponsHow should we as a society deal with these issues Many have asked the question Not everyone can agree on the

intelligence Some worry they could stunt the industry in the USCreditCreditChris KoehlerSupported byBy Cade MetzSAN FRANCISCO  A common belief among tech industry insiders is that Silicon Valley has dominated the internet because much of the worldwide network was designed and built by AmericansNow a growing number of those insiders are worried that proposed export restrictions could shortcircuit the preeminence of American companies in the next big thing to hit their industry artificial intelligenceIn November the Commerce Department released a list of technologies including artificial intelligence that are under consideration for new export rules because of their importance to national securityTechnology experts worry that blocking the export of AI to other countries or tying it up in red tape will help AI industries flourish in those nations  China in particular  and compete with American companiesThe number of cases where exports can be sufficiently controlled are very very very small and the chance of making an error is quite large said Jack Clark head of policy at OpenAI an artificial intelligence lab in San Francisco If this goes wrong it could do real damage to the AI communityThe export controls are being considered as the United States and China engage in a trade war The Trump administration has been critical of the way China negotiates deals with American companies often requiring the transfer of technology to Chinese partners as the cost of doing business in the country And federal officials are making an aggressive argument that China has stolen American technology through hacking and industrial espionageTech companies academics and policymakers are calling on the Commerce Department to take a light hand with AI export rules ahead of a Jan  deadline for public comment Their argument has three main points Restrictions could harm companies in the United States and help international competitors They could stifle technology improvements And they may not make much of a differenceIn August Congress passed the Export Controls Act of  which added export restrictions to emerging and foundational technologies In midNovember the Commerce Department tasked with overseeing the restrictions published a list of technologies for consideration including several categories of AI like computer vision speech recognition and natural language understandingThe restrictions would affect the export of technology to certain countries Though it does not specify which ones the Commerce Department proposal points to countries that have faced trade and arms embargoes in the past Those include China Russia and IranThe Commerce Department declined to comment on the proposed restrictions After taking public comments the department will draft a formal plan It could result in anything from new licensing rules for AI exports to outright bansArtificial intelligence could be as vital to the tech industry as the World Wide Web was  years agoIt is easy to forget that before the mids the tech industry in the United States was in a slump and the consumer electronics giants of Japan looked unbeatable That changed as Silicon Valley companies popularized innovations like the web browser and ecommerce Today the likes of Google Apple and Facebook dominate tech all over the worldBut American dominion in artificial intelligence is far from guaranteed China is investing billions in AI for both commercial and military use And the expertise that has flooded to Silicon Valley over the years is starting to stay home partly because of immigration restrictions Centers for AI research are popping up all over the world from Toronto to Cambridge England and BeijingEnforcing export controls on artificial intelligence would present an unusual challenge for regulatorsAI is something policymakers call a dualuse technology It has innocuous commercial applications like helping to steer your car or ask your phone a question It also has important military uses like helping a weaponized drone find its targetsDefense planners believe AI represents the next notable change in military weapons akin to the tactical targeting of socalled smart bombs a generation ago or nuclear weapons before that AI can also aid surveillance systems and even disinformation campaigns through software that can produce fake photos and videosBut trying to draw a line between what is military and what is commercial is exceedingly difficult said R David Edelman a technology policy researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology It may be impossibleIt is difficult to put a made in America label on artificial intelligence Research on the technology is often done collaboratively by scientists and engineers all over the worldCompanies rarely hold on to the details of their AI work as if it were a secret recipe Instead they share what they learn in hopes that other researchers can build on it One companys breakthrough is often the latest iteration of what many researchers at private companies and universities have been working onA lot of the computer code for AI is published on sites like Arxivorg a repository of academic and corporate research So many policy experts believe that if the United States restricts the export of AI products and services it will have little effect on the progress of AI in China and other countriesThe core of these technologies is international and freely available said Mr Edelman who was a special assistant for economic and technology policy under President Barack Obama No country  the US or China  has a monopoly on thatFederal regulations exempt publicly available information from export control That means that the government is unlikely to bar companies and universities from publishing fundamental AI research But it could establish controls that restrict foreign access to that information said Greg Jaeger a lawyer at the law firm Stroock  Stroock  Lavan who deals with export controlsThe Commerce Department could also restrict the export of cloudcomputing technology and computer chips related to artificial intelligence The export restrictions memo mentions bothAmazon and Microsoft already operate cloud computing businesses in China through local partners and Google has long hoped to do the same thing Amazon Google and Microsoft declined to commentOverly restrictive rules that prevent foreign nationals from working on certain technologies in the United States could also push researchers and companies into other countriesIt might be easier for people to just do this stuff in Europe said Jason Waite a lawyer with the firm Alston  Bird who specializes in international tradeFollow Cade Metz on Twitter CadeMetzAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy

KaplanDeap Ubhi is a restless guy At  he quit his job in private equity in Northern California where he had grown up and gone to college and then moved to India to found Burrp a local search site similar to Yelp He sold the company in  and along with other alums became what they called the Burrp mafia seeding and growing other startups in IndiaFast and is extremely straightforward one Indian entrepreneur wrote about Mr Ubhi in an online reference Not for the faint of heartAfter returning to the West Coast he joined Amazon in  to encourage startups to adopt the companys cloudcomputing products But in less than two years Mr Ubhi left to start a company that provided technology to restaurants inspired by his familys experience running an IndianJamaicanMexican fusion jointHe then shifted his career in a new direction taking his Silicon Valley mentality to the heart of the Washington bureaucracy He joined a Pentagon effort to recruit techies and turned the restaurant startup into a side hustle He wanted to use his skills not to make a search engine more performant or help a box of stuff get to a customer faster but rather towards service of the American people Mr Ubhi later wroteBut that circuitous career has landed Mr Ubhi now  in the center of a Washington drama The question of what roles he played inside the Pentagon and when is holding up one of the largest federal information technology contracts in history It is a scuffle with an unusual mixture of tech industry rivalries national politics and the obscure world of government procurementThe project a  billion deal to bring modern cloud computing to the Pentagons arsenal drew the attention of the biggest tech companies from the moment it was announced in  Amazon Microsoft Google IBM and Oracle all wanted the prizeBut it had a hitch The contract would go to only one cloud vendor even though many big companies prefer to work with multiple cloud providers Amazon the runaway leader in cloud computing appeared to be perhaps the only company capable of fulfilling the Pentagons huge demands And that is where Mr Ubhis connections to the company where he now works again have thrown a wrench into the processThe software giant Oracle which is widely considered ill equipped to land the deal has aggressively criticized the onevendor approach As part of its opposition the company is arguing in federal court that Mr Ubhis ties to Amazon shaped the contract in the companys favorBefore the case was filed last year the Pentagon found that Mr Ubhi had no improper influence and it continued evaluating the proposals despite Oracles lawsuit But in late February the government said it had received new information about Mr Ubhi that it needed to investigate essentially delaying the processA Pentagon spokeswoman Elissa Smith declined to say what new information about Mr Ubhi had been brought to the departments attention The Pentagon had said that the winner of the contract was projected to be announced in April But Ms Smith said the inquiry into Mr Ubhi was expected to impact the award dateMr Ubhi contacted through Amazon declined to comment as did the companyOracle also declined to comment But in its lawsuit Oracle has highlighted Mr Ubhis outspoken enthusiasm for Amazon In early  he took to Twitter to thank Jeff Bezos the Amazon founder for opposing President Trumps travel ban Once an Amazonian always an Amazonian he wroteThe comments touch on an issue floating around discussions about the contract whether Mr Trump would put his finger on the scale The presidents disdain for Mr Bezos and Amazon is well documented on his Twitter feed At a private dinner with Mr Trump one of Oracles cochief executives Safra A Catz discussed the contract Bloomberg reported last year After that report the White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Mr Trump was not involved in the contracting processBy the standards of most administrations it would be extraordinarily unusual for the president to insert himself into the competition for a government contract But when Mr Trump was presidentelect he drew attention for taking on Boeing over the cost of a new Air Force One aircraft and pressing Lockheed Martin over the cost of the F fighter jetIf Mr Trump went so far as to say who should compete or how one company should be evaluated compared to another that would be a first said David A Drabkin a former procurement official at the Defense DepartmentA Defense Department procurement official is formally overseeing the cloud contract known as the joint enterprise defense infrastructure or JEDI But Ms Smith declined to identify the officials who would be involved with choosing the winnerA White House official reiterated on Wednesday that the president was not involvedThe military has lagged behind the private sector in adopting cloud computing but officials have made clear that they know the stakes The Pentagons move to the cloud has been led by the chief information officer Dana Deasy a former global chief information officer at JPMorgan ChaseBattlefield advantage is driven by who has access to the best information that can then be analyzed to inform decision making at the point and time of need Mr Deasy wrote last yearAdopting technologies widely used in the private sector is key to the mission of the defense digital service the Pentagon tech team Mr Ubhi joined in  It is unclear what Mr Ubhi worked on during most of his time in government But in his last two months during fall  he did market research for JEDI according to the PentagonIn court documents Oracle argues that Mr Ubhi worked on JEDI when the Pentagon decided to take the approach of hiring a single cloud provider Oracle cites internal documents in which Mr Ubhi expressed support for a single cloud When the Air Force awarded a different cloud project to multiple vendors Mr Ubhi wrote that the contract makes me weepOracle says Mr Ubhi clearly favored Amazon over other tech companies In an online chat conversation on Slack about another cloudcomputing provider he sent a closedeyes tongueout emojiAmazon has countered that the Pentagon identified  people substantially involved in developing the contract and its requirements and that Mr Ubhi worked on JEDI for only seven weeks in the early stagesAt the end of October  Mr Ubhi recused himself from JEDI saying Amazon and his restaurant startup Tablehero may soon engage in further partnership discussions Two weeks later he resigned and then rejoined Amazon where he still works on the commercial not government side of the business the company saidThere is no evidence that Amazon bought Tablehero Dheeraj Jain an investor in Tablehero said Mr Ubhi has not responded to emails We have written off this investment unfortunately he added And we are not happy about itThe Pentagon released the JEDI request for proposals nine months after Mr Ubhi recused himself It said a single cloud would let it move faster and with more security a decision the Government Accountability Office later affirmedBecause Amazon appeared to have a leg up the contract immediately became a point of contention among tech contractors Both Oracle and IBM filed protests with the Government Accountability Office which adjudicates federal contract challenges The office denied Oracles protest and later rejected IBMs on procedural grounds Oracle whose cloud market share is small enough to be grouped in the other category in several leading research reports took its fight to the United States Court of Federal ClaimsThe delays from the Oracle lawsuit could help Microsoft In the months since the request for proposals went out the company which has supplied the Pentagon for decades has improved its capabilities to the point that some experts believe it is an increasingly credible competitor to AmazonBut even if Mr Ubhi is found to have tainted the contract it is not clear that it would change the Pentagons plan to use a single cloud provider The Government Accountability Office in November found that the Pentagons justifications reasonably support the decision The office said it would be improper to go against what the Pentagon determined was best for the country even if Mr Ubhi had shaped the contractWhen he was working on the project Mr Ubhi said that bolstering national security was the pointIn October  he wrote in a blog post that he believed his work on JEDI would be a unique asset to help our men and women in uniform make more datadriven decisions and to allow our leadership to be more effectiveLittle did he know it seems that his work on it could put the project on pause or if Oracle has its way in jeopardyKate Conger contributed reporting Alain Delaqurire contributed

FRANCISCO  Dont look now Storm clouds are gathering over techChinese consumers have pulled back their spending blowing a  billion hole in Apples recent quarterly revenue China was again a culprit when Nvidia warned last month that its revenue would come in  percent below expectations though the graphics chip maker also blamed slack demand from Bitcoin miners and cloud data centersIntel the big chip maker cited intensifying trade and macro concerns for financial results in January that did not meet expectations And Samsung another semiconductor powerhouse said sales plunged  percent in the fourth quarter because of weakening demand for its memory chips from data centers and smartphonesChina smartphones Bitcoin and cloud computing have been among the major drivers of the long tech boom which in turn has powered the global economy for the last decade The ingredient common to all of these sectors is computer chips which form the brains of devices and whose ubiquity means they provide early signals about changes in supply and demandWarnings about a sales slowdown this year have come in recent weeks from big chip suppliers that also include Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Micron Technology and Western Digital Its an abrupt reversal coming on the heels of stellar results in  for the business that gave Silicon Valley its nameLast year manufacturers shipped a staggering  trillion chips and other semiconductor devices  percent more than the year before IC Insights estimates But  is shaping up to be a much different story now that several important sources of chip demand appear to be dampeningThe notion that a chip dip could lead to a general downturn evokes memories of  when one day tech had an unlimited future and the next it was crashing in what became known as the dotcom bustBack then investors showed no mercy Intel made what seemed a modest adjustment to its revenue forecast for the third quarter of  saying it would be up  to  percent instead of  to  percent The value of the company immediately fell by nearly  percent over the next few daysThis year with a similar downgrade investors largely shrugged it off Intel shed about  percent of its value over a weekWhile acknowledging the parallels to  Gene Munster research director for Loup Ventures a venture capital firm said I think its different this timeBack then among the best customers for the established chip firms were startups which had more dreams than revenue As the startups faltered the chip firms were imperiled The storm lasted for yearsThese are all real companies now with real customers Mr Munster said People are willing to look past a few bumpy monthsEven if the problems do not linger they are a reminder that demand is not eternal That seems to be what happened with smartphones which use multiple varieties of chips to run software process data and connect to cellular networksConsider Apple which gave a muted forecast in October for the holiday season and followed up early last month with its first fullfledged revenue warning in  years The iPhone maker faces stiff competition and slumping demand in China Total smartphone shipments fell  percent in that country in the fourth quarter according to research firm CanalysMichael Wolf who surveys consumers annually about their technology and media usage for his management consulting firm Activate said people seem to be shifting to lowerpriced phone models and cheaper service plans But he said demand seems strong for digital subscription services like Netflix video games online advertising and businesstobusiness sales for companies like MicrosoftFrom all of our research I dont see some general consumer malaise Mr Wolf saidYet several other businesses appear to be softening as well including the market for server systems used by cloud service operators including Amazon Microsoft and Google Sales of highpriced chips for such hardware have driven profits for companies like Intel and Nvidia but they now say that equipment buyers for data centers have turned cautiousCloud service providers shifted from building capacity to absorbing capacity Robert Swan who was then Intels chief financial officer and acting chief executive said on a conference call after Intel released its fourthquarter results On Thursday Mr Swan became Intels chief executiveLongtime tech industry watchers began picking up trouble signs late last spring in the market for memory chips an essential component in computers that in decades past prompted trade tensions between the United States and rivals in Japan and South Korea Makers of a key category called dynamic randomaccess memory or DRAM have suffered product shortages and gluts that whipsawed pricing and heralded changing fortunes for the broader industryDuring the dotcom bust of  DRAM revenue plummeted  percent while total semiconductor revenue fell  percent according to Gartner dataBut conditions changed dramatically over the years as manufacturers fled from the lack of profits leaving three major DRAM makers  Samsung Hynix and Micron They have been slow to boost production enabling them to keep their prices high And they also benefited as memory became more important in smartphones data center hardware and other products beyond the personal computers that once drove most salesThe markets today are structurally different Sanjay Mehrotra Microns chief executive said in a recent interviewYet market cycles havent disappeared entirely DRAM prices peaked last June and began sliding prompting Micron and Samsung to issue their recent profit warnings DRAMeXchange a Taiwanbased firm that tracks the market predicts DRAM prices will fall an additional  percent in the first quarterMemory chips behave like onions or steel or any other commodity said Jim Handy a market researcher at Objective Analysis If there is an oversupply prices fallNvidia presents an extreme example of both boom and bust The yearold company which pioneered the specialized processors that generate images in video games became one of Silicon Valleys most valuable companies in  as those chips were adapted for artificial intelligence uses by internet giantsBut Nvidias processors also became extremely popular for the mathematical process of mining digital currency driving a surge in demand that inflated prices and created a shortage of chips Buyers wound up placing multiple or overly ambitious orders making it hard for the company to get a handle on conventional demand for its technologyThe cryptocurrency bubble faded suddenly last year causing Nvidias revenue and stock price to tumble as the company wound up with extra inventories of unsold chips The crypto issue ended up being way way bigger for the company than expected said Hans Mosesmann an analyst at Rosenblatt Securities Its been a crazy storyFor all the turmoil industry executives and analysts said that business conditions remain a lot healthier than past semiconductor slumps For one thing a series of mergers has reduced price competition Companies like Micron which routinely lost money in past cycles are expected to remain solidly profitable even if

Warrens announcement on Friday of a plan to break up major tech monopolies like Facebook and Google was critically important  not just as a policy proposal but also as a sign of the return of antitrust to politicsIn the United States economic policy is ostensibly a matter of democratic governance but for too long antitrust has been viewed as a technocratic matter best left to experts This is a mistake Excessive corporate size and power can be linked to many voter concerns including stagnant wages the invasion of privacy the rise of fake news the demise of the middle class and an unresponsive democracyAntitrust is especially salient today because we witness the tremendous power of the tech monopolies firsthand in our daily lives Nearly everyone uses Facebook Google Amazon Apple and Microsoft and nearly everyone can see how smaller businesses have been hurt by their dominance Nearly everyone has an opinion about whether they are too powerful whether they know too much whether they ought to be admired or fearedAdd to these concerns the dangers of agricultural monopolies rising costs for cable and broadband and anticompetitive drug pricing and it is clear that for Ms Warren and other presidential hopefuls in the Democratic field the problem of monopoly power should be a central issue  perhaps the central issue  in the  campaignThough every Democratic candidate is against President Trump and in favor of working Americans antitrust is an issue over which the candidates have real disagreement There are stark differences between say Senator Bernie Sanderss calls to break them up usually a reference to banks and former Vice President Joe Bidens cooperative approach Mr Biden still undeclared has taken the position that big corporations should not be singled out and that their chief executives can be persuaded to shoulder their responsibilities toward workers and communities In the late s Mr Biden resisted efforts to strengthen the antitrust laws though his views may have changed as the law has grown weakerAntitrust law is not an instrument of socialism or of unfettered capitalism it seeks to protect markets from abuse by their participants Ms Warren and Senator Amy Klobuchar seem to have the deepest understanding of this Ms Klobuchar is not as aggressive on the issue as Ms Warren but she has cast herself as an antitrust reformer introducing thoughtful new laws for merger reform Senator Cory Booker for his part has over the last year staked out a trustbusting position centered on labor markets with particular emphasis on the worrisome effects of corporate consolidation on workers and their salariesThe largest question mark among the major candidates is Senator Kamala Harris of California who represents the state where the largest tech monopolies are headquartered She was tough in her questioning of Facebooks chief executive Mark Zuckerberg during congressional hearings last year but she has been silent on the questions raised by tech monopoliesMs Harris attracted some attention last month when she declined to register opposition to the proposed merger of the wireless carriers Sprint and TMobile  in stark contrast to the rest of the senators running for president It may be that she is relatively open to approving mergers it is also possible that her positions are just undevelopedThe variety of antitrust positions in the emerging Democratic field means that it will no longer be enough for a candidate to mutter a few platitudes about big corporations and let the partys technocrats decide what the nations approach to monopoly power ought to be Such questions of economic policy affect us all and therefore should sit at the core of a majoritarian democratic processIndeed they once did Todays interest in excessive

Amazon may be pulling the plug on its Queens campus but New York Citys tech boom is likely to endureLong before Amazon announced that New York had won a share of its secondheadquarters sweepstakes tech was a rising force in the local economy Google which already has thousands of workers in New York plans to double its work force in the city and build a  billion campus just south of the West Village Facebook Apple Uber and other companies are also expanding their presences as is a rising generation of homegrown companiesEven Amazon itself said Thursday that it planned to keep adding to its New York work force of jobsWall StreetTech sector of jobsWall StreetTech sectorEvery part of the city is feeling the impact of the technology boom said William C Rudin a developer and the chairman of the Real Estate Board of New York The geography of where these companies are its not just Midtown South or Meatpacking Its downtown its Midtown East its going to Brooklyn its going to QueensIn terms of raw economic power Wall Street still dominates Its workers earn more than  a year on average close to three times as much as tech workers As a result the finance sector accounts for a huge share of city and state tax revenue and wields disproportionate political power of payWall StreetTech sector of payWall StreetTech sectorMayors dating back to David Dinkins in the early s have sought to make the city less vulnerable to the booms and busts of finance Those efforts accelerated after the  financial crisis which wiped out thousands of jobs on Wall Street Techs rapid expansion came at an auspicious time helping the city rebound much faster than many experts had predictedThere was a wide consensus that New York City needed to diversify its economy to add balance beyond Wall Street said Jonathan Bowles executive director of the Center for an Urban Future a New Yorkfocused think tank I really think that tech has finally allowed New York to do thatNew York has never been a oneindustry town Even at its height in the early s Wall Street accounted for little more than  percent of the citys jobs and  percent of its total pay New York is a center of media advertising and fashion And for the accounting consulting and law firms that serve those industries  as well as for the real estate moguls who build their office towers and condominiumsShare of jobsin New York

tech companies to New York in the first place When Google and other West Coast giants set up outposts here in the mids they were mostly hiring advertising sales representatives and marketing managers not hardcore codersGradually however New York began to become a force for tech talent Media and finance firms were trying to become more digitally savvy and needed programmers Universities  encouraged by successive administrations in City Hall  created and expanded programs to give students digital skillsAs a share of the population New York still has far fewer programmers software developers and similar workers than Silicon Valley and Seattle In raw numbers however the New York area has more such professionals than any other urban areaBut as Amazons pullback in New York shows the technology

strength is as a global headquarters city said Kathryn Wylde the partnerships president and chief executive And if the CEOs of the industry leaders are not here we cant continue to lead the world as a commercial center We wont have the magnetismNot everyone of course is pushing for tech to play a larger role in New York Amazons plans were scuttled by a powerful backlash from unions neighborhood groups and elected officials in Queens Some of that opposition was fueled by the multibilliondollar incentive package the city and state offered to lure Amazon But critics also worried that the flood of wellheeled tech workers would drive up already skyhigh rentsDan J Wang a professor at Columbia Business School said those concerns were particularly acute because of the size and concentration of Amazons planned campus which he likened to the company towns of the early th centuryThere is the possibility of displacement of existing businesses and of the exacerbation of inequality that already exists in New York Mr Wang saidOther companies such as Google have been more subtle building up presences in neighborhoods without taking overThat might explain why before the furor over Amazon techs rise had managed to stay largely beneath the radarTech has become a huge and crucial part of the New York City economy Mr Bowles said Im not sure that most New Yorkers know that right nowAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressThere is a way around the notoriously sluggish internet in West Virginia You just need a car and some timeKelly Povroznik can tell you when she happens to get a good signal She teaches an online college course so hampered by unreliable connections that she has had to drive a halfhour to her brothers place just to enter grades into a databaseIt added so much additional work for me and I just dont have the time said Povroznik who lives in Weston West Virginia I just kept wanting to beat my head into a wallAcross rural America a bandwidth gap separates communities like Weston from an increasingly digital world where highspeed internet has become a fundamental component of modern life putting them at a disadvantage when it comes to economic growth and quality of life advancementsA  billion federal grant program earmarked to expand wireless internet in rural areas was supposed to address the problem but its on hold while the Federal Communications Commission investigates whether carriers submitted incorrect data for the maps used to allocate grantsThe broadband maps deemed Weston a city of about  people too well connected to qualify for a grant  even though the problems there are obvious to anyone whos tried to send emails from their phones or gotten lost because Google Maps wouldnt workFCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel concedes that the agency doesnt know for sure where the needs are most acute calling it embarrassing and shamefulOur maps simply do not reflect the state of deployment on the ground Thats a problem Rosenworcel said We have a digital divide in this country with millions of Americans who lack broadband where they live If we want to fix this gap and close this divide we first need an honest accounting of highspeed service in every community across the countryLawmakers across the country are concerned that flawed carriersubmitted maps on cellphone and home internet connectivity are crippling the effectiveness of various grant programs In February West Virginia Democratic Sen Joe Manchin joined  other senators in pushing the FCC for more accurate baselinesDisagreements over the data have led to wildly different figures on highspeed internet availability nationwide  and a growing sense that the government just doesnt knowOn one end the FCC says more than  million people lack access to broadband at home On the other a recent study by Microsoft  which is pushing its own approach to extending broadband to rural areas  found that  million Americans dont use the internet at high speeds a problem that may point to cost of access as well as lack of availabilityPart of the discrepancy has to do with how the FCC collects data The agency considers an entire area covered if a carrier reports that a single building on a census block has fast internet speeds Experts say this method allows carriers to attract more customers by advertising larger coverage areas Critics argue that it is a poor way to determine internet speeds and have long called for more granular dataComplaints about the wireless map have poured in to the FCC The Rural Wireless Association a trade group asked the agency to investigate data submitted by Verizon and TMobile suggesting the companies overstated coverage The companies have denied doing soThe February letter from Manchin and the other senators implored FCC Chairman Ajit Pai to use crowdsourced data and public feedback to create more accurate maps Some of them have since introduced legislation to force the FCC to widen the scopeFederal lawmakers from New Hampshire sent a separate letter saying the FCC was forcing cashstrapped local governments there to disprove overstated claims made by carriers in the agencys formal process for challenging the mapping dataAll told only about  percent of the  carriers government and tribal entities who could have challenged the FCCs wireless map data actually did so according to the FCCThe whole process frustrated Manchin who told the AP in an email As long as we continue to rely on carriers just telling us what they cover we will never have a complete picture that depicts the realworld experiences of West VirginiansThe FCC put the grant process for the  billion program on hold late last year as it launched an investigation into whether one or more major carriers violated rules and submitted incorrect maps The investigation is ongoingChristopher Ali an assistant professor of media studies at the University of Virginia said the looming mapping question leaves the government flailing blindly at a problem that prevents it from meeting the needs of rural AmericaWe cant fix a problem when we dont know where it exists he said and at the moment we dont know where broadband deserts existPovroznik knows they exist in Weston where she had to come up with workarounds  including jumping in her car  to cope with spotty connections that disrupted her ability to field questions submitted by students online She saw some improvement after switching service providersIn this technologically advanced world that we live in it shouldnt have been as difficult as it was for me to get this situation resolved she saidTali Arbel contributed to this story from New YorkAdvertisementThe Snap chief said that he was impressed by Europes moves and that there was still time to coursecorrect in the United StatesAt The New York Timess New Work Summit in California Evan Spiegel Snapchats founder said he was impressed with the privacy regulations enacted in EuropeCreditCreditMike Cohen for The New York TimesSupported byBy Katie RobertsonHALF MOON BAY Calif  With the continued pressure to regulate Silicon Valley many wonder when and how the United States will actSam Altman president of the startup incubator Y Combinator said the onus was on the governmentThe idea that these companies who are not accountable to us or elected by us should get to decide sort of the new safeguards of society that seems like the wrong way to do it Mr Altman said last week at The New York Timess New Work Summit in California I think we should let our  flawed as they may be  democratically elected and enforced institutions update the rules for the worldHe suggested restrictions around how usergenerated content was amplified or distributed as well as the classifications of hate speech or fake newsThe United States has lagged behind its peers and has provided little regulation of the industry that is one of its biggest economic driversIn January leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos pushed for more global oversight to limit the power of big tech Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan announced plans to use his countrys leadership of the Group of  nations this year to emphasize data governanceAmericas own tech chiefs including the Apple chief executive Tim Cook and executives from Facebook Google and Microsoft have lobbied for a comprehensive federal privacy law Europe has enacted the worlds toughest rules on digital privacy with a sweeping law known as the General Data Protection RegulationIn a recent capitulation to the growing calls for a watchdog the Federal Trade Commission announced Tuesday that it would create a task force to scrutinize tech giants The FTC is also said to be considering a multibilliondollar fine for Facebook over privacy violationsFacebooks very public reckoning recently has hastened the push for more regulation The company is accused of among other things compromising privacy harvesting user data and allowing misinformation propaganda and hate speech to spread including during the  presidential election Also the Times reported that its leaders covered up problems and targeted critics enlisting an oppositionresearch firm to discredit naysayersMr Altman defended Facebooks founder Mark Zuckerberg and its chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg saying the company was rapidly improving its practices Mark and Sheryl are extremely thoughtful people that have built one of the most important companies in human history And I think they are listening Mr Altman saidWhile Facebook and Twitter have taken plenty of hits for their approach to user data and social media Snapchat the disappearingmessage app made by Snap Inc has largely escaped the cascading criticismEvan Spiegel its founder said Snapchats approach was different from that of its contemporaries who are trying to police contentWe believe that just a small percentage of the content out there is really great content he said And so by focusing on that small amount of content and just not allowing really you know that longer tail of content creators to distribute content widely on our platform we ultimately end up with a better content experience for our customersMr Spiegel linked the current climate for technology companies to the thinking in the Clinton administration around innovation at the beginning of the internet  an attitude of we want people to mess around with it and to create wild new things and because of that we dont really think regulation is the right way to goI think our society is now starting to understand how the internet works in a way that maybe they didnt  years ago he saidBut Mr Spiegel acknowledged there was plenty of room to coursecorrect He said he was really impressed with Europes moves which he believed would inspire the next wave of privacy regulationIve found the European Commission to be very wellreasoned and thoughtful in their approach and really putting consumers first Mr Spiegel said The more that companies can align with the government to do whats right for customers I think everyone will win thereHe said the concern that regulating big tech would slow growth should be balanced with a consideration of Americas valuesThe important thing in all of these debates is to I think offer at least the other side of economic progress which may be the preservation of values that we care a lot about he said The real world and the internet are one and the same They have a dramatic impact on one another And that means that I think we need to be a little more thoughtful and deliberate about the products were creating and releasing widelyAdvertisementNew year new you right You may be headed to the gym but what about the health of your phone

countdown to catastrophe has begunWhat you need is an automatic continuous backup system  something that only  percent of us have set upThe easiest solution is an online backup service like Backblaze which is preferred by Wirecutter for its low cost  a year  and lack of size limits Its software continuously copies your computers contents to the cloud Should disaster strike you can download your stuff right back againBetter yet these backups are offsite Fire flood and fiendish burglars are no longer your concern Well theyre not great but at least you wont lose the sole copy of your data should your computer be damaged destroyed or go missingThe downside of course is paying that fee foreverFor that reason some people prefer backing up their stuff onto a second external hard drive Wirecutter suggests the terabyte Western Digital My Book which costs about Once its connected you can set up the Macs Time Machine feature or Windowss File History feature to do the backing up quietly and automaticallyThe drawbacks of this system First your backup isnt offsite so a local disaster can take down both the original and the backup Second no backing up takes place unless the external drive is plugged into your computer  something to remember if youre a laptop luggerTheres a third option by the way thats ideal for a household with several computers For about  you can buy a huge

it left interest rates unchanged yesterday and signaled little appetite for any raises in the near future Jim Tankersley of the NYT writesGrowth appears to be slowing from last year Jay Powell the Fed chairman said Thats a result of the trade war economic slowdowns in Europe and China and fading stimulus from the  tax cuts The central bank now expects  percent growth this year down from its  percent forecast in December  and more than a percentage point less than the  percent the White House predictsRate hikes seem to be off the table Forecasts show that Fed officials broadly expect not to raise rates at all this year with a single rate increase in  and none in  In December they expected two rate increases this year and another in The Fed is effectively giving Mr Trump what he wants from monetary policy but with a twist Mr Tankersley writes The president has publicly pushed Mr Powell to stop raising rates But if the Fed is correct and growth falls well below  percent this year without a single rate increase it will be difficult for Mr Trump to pin the blame on Mr PowellWall Street couldnt be happier Sectors sensitive to interest rates have posted some of the bigger gains in

CEOs economic confidence as measured by a Business Roundtable survey fell for the fourth quarter in a rowEuropean regulators slapped Google with a  billion fine yesterday for antitrust violations involving the search service it offers other websites  the third major financial penalty imposed on the tech company in Europe since Google demanded websites using its search bar let it limit the display of any searchdriven ads from rivals according to EU officials There was no reason for Google to include these restrictive clauses in its contracts except to keep its rivals out of the market

well as restrictions on spreading hate speech And its antitrust lawyers are taking a close look at Amazon Apple and Facebook as wellBut does any of this matter The EU has now fined Google  billion but thats a drop in the bucket compared to the companys  billion in annual revenue and its shares rose  percent yesterday Some worry that without breaking up these kinds of companies its hard to get them

period of time Bob Davis and Rebecca Ballhaus of the WSJ report  We have to make sure that if we do the deal with China that China lives by the deal Mr Trump told reporters as he left Washington for Ohio The president didnt explain whether the US is pressing to keep in place tariffs on all the  billion of Chinese goods the US has hit with levies or some portion of them nor did he indicate for how long US negotiators are more willing to roll back at least some of the  percent tariffs on  billion of Chinese goods which took effect in September as the US tried to put more pressure on China But theyre more resistant to removing  percent levies on  billion of Chinese goods imposed in response to harm to US companies caused by Chinas forced technology transfers As part of any enforcement plan

SuperSonics were lousy having their worst season in  years was only the beginningThough the Sonics were a storied NBA franchise with a league championship in  attendance was down at their Seattle arena along with points scored and revenues earned As the teams lead owner Mr Schultz was facing unrest from fans and partners alike At the same time Starbucks the coffee company he had built into a global giant was about to hit a bad patch too as the first ripples of the Great Recession began to rise into a flood tideYou dont have to be a basketball fan to know which problem Mr Schultz was able to fixThe Sonics no longer exist  sold by Mr Schultzs group that same pivotal year and later moved to Oklahoma City and renamed even the memorabilia packed away Now as Mr Schultz mulls running for president as an independent candidate his path through that moment says a lot about him  how he handles adversity and uncertainty and how he grasped or did not the nettle of local politics as the Sonics were flailing according to more than  people who have observed him befriended him or worked with or against him over the yearsHis basketball legacy has left many in Seattle outraged to this day believing Mr Schultz to be either duplicitous or duped by others Yet his actions at Starbucks  including a raft of innovations introduced before and during the recession like health insurance for baristas  became the stuff of adoring Harvard Business School case studies In Fortune magazines ranking Starbucks is the fifthmost admired company in the worldThe common thread  deeply familiar to people in the city Mr Schultz has called home since the early s and now echoed in his talk of entering politics  is a kind of idealistic righteousness combined with obvious conviction about his own abilities and insights All of which worked like a magic wand in Seattle except when it didntTheres no question that he built an amazing business one that Seattle has benefited from and one that has worldwide reach said Greg Nickels a Democrat who was in his second term as Seattles mayor in The Sonics episode I think was different Mr Nickels added I think he got into it and discovered it was not what he thought it was going to beMr Schultz  a selfmade billionaire who grew up in public housing in Brooklyn said in an interview  conducted at his request in a Starbucks  that he had not decided whether to seek the White House and had set no deadline for doing so A selfdescribed lifelong Democrat Mr Schultz said that he thought the Democrats were veering too far left President Trump and the Republicans too far right and that there was a hunger for a more centrist candidacy like the one he might put upBut he also said as he had repeatedly in recent speeches around the nation promoting a new memoir that he would not run if he became convinced his candidacy could aid in Mr Trumps reelectionIndeed his announcement in January that he was seriously considering running brought an outcry from many Democrats who feared a split vote The president chimed in tweeting that Mr Schultz who had never sought public office doesnt have the guts and Warren Buffett called a Schultz candidacy a mistakeAs a rule in American politics independents fail to get elected Since the Civil War only four minorparty candidates for president have mustered at least  percent of the vote Ross Perot George Wallace Robert La Follette and Theodore Roosevelt Roosevelt a Republican turned Bull Moose candidate in the  election couldnt win despite having been a popular president only a few years earlier But even getting less than  percent can make a difference as Ralph Nader showed in the  election which put George W Bush in the White House through an Electoral College victory even though Al Gore the outgoing vice president won the popular voteFor his part Mr Schultz believes that an independent president could have a powerful mandate in governing as a refutation by voters of the bitter and divisive politics of revenge that have paralyzed Washington The example that it could be done would in turn draw out a surge of likeminded independent candidates who would reshape Congress he addedThe current trajectory were on demonstrates such evidence of a broken system Mr Schultz said Im looking at the situation and realizing that a large majority of Americans agree with meIf Mr Schultz does run his Seattle experience combined with a back story of selfmade success would be the narrative he tells and sells Starbucks started here and is a different company Mr Schultz said because of the culture that defines the Pacific Northwest The Sonics failed here and were a Seattle story too for which Mr Schultz has apologized In his universe its a ventisize place of success and failureWhen Mr Schultz organized an investor group to buy the SuperSonics in  he took the high road of rhetoric Sounding like a civic patron out only for the city he loved  with the grubby business of moneymaking very much an afterthought  he promised to treat the team as a kind of sacred civic trustThis ownership group did not get involved to make a profit he said at one point in testifying before Washington State Legislature We wanted passionate people about not only sports but passionate people about our communityThat language and imagery came back to haunt him in the aftermath of the teams demiseSchultz became a pariah said Gary Washburn a former Seattle sportswriter who now covers the NBA for The Boston GlobeIn February  Mr Schultz drove to the State Capitol in Olympia plunked down in front a microphone in a woodpaneled Senate meeting room and repeated what some considered a threat  that he might have to sell the Sonics if he didnt get more than  million in public money for renovations to their arenaHe said the Sonics were losing money because they had a terrible uncompetitive arena lacking in the profitable addons that other franchises had like restaurants and stores Public money had been lavished on other sports in Seattle in past years he pointed out  with new play spaces for the Mariners a baseball team and the Seahawks a football team It was time to bestow some love on the NBA Mr Schultz saidIt did not go well The Sonics bailout bill did not even come up for a final vote The political appeal of financing athletic venues had faded after the  dotcom economic bust and a ballot measure aimed at reducing taxpayer money in professional sports was gaining favor even as Mr Schultz testified Initiative  as it was called was approved that fall by a  percent majoritySeveral people who were in the Legislature at the time said that Mr Schultz who had never been very involved in politics or lobbying was treated like the outsider he was and never appeared to understand the network of informal alliances that stood in his way Calls were coming to legislative offices from people connected to the citys other sports teams saying they didnt much like the idea of financing a lot of expensive new skybox seatsThe Mariners and Seahawks people were not terribly encouraging  they had several back channels and sort of front channels of stuff going on said James McIntire a Democratic state representative at the time who later served two terms as state treasurerArt Thiel a longtime columnist and sportswriter who covered the Sonics story said Mr Schultz simply didnt understand the state capital He thought that he could do as a pro sports owner the same sorts of things that he could do as a successful business owner which is either to charm the opposition or bully them he said He got neither doneBarely five months after hitting a wall at the legislature Mr Schultz made good on his warning announcing that he and his coowners had sold the team to a group based in Oklahoma which moved it and renamed it the ThunderMr Schultz now calls that decision one of the major regrets of his lifeMy biggest mistake still reverberates Mr Schultz wrote in a recent oped piece in The Seattle Times In his book he elaborates on what happened Almost everyone blamed me and after some initial denial I realized they were right to do so I had squandered the very public trust that I had bought intoA longtime friend of Mr Schultzs Howard Behar a former vice president at Starbucks said that while Mr Schultz learned from the experience he had been warned in advance that straying from the world he knew might be dangerousWhen he bought that company I had a quote in the local newspaper in Seattle I said No good will come from this  I think hes nuts Mr Behar recalled And I was right No good came from itThe storied names of the Seattle business world roll off the tongue all over the world Amazon Boeing Eddie Bauer Microsoft REI Starbucks And just as Microsoft is associated with its cofounders Bill Gates and Paul Allen and Amazon with its founder Jeff Bezos Mr Schultz is Mr Coffee father of the Frappuccino and coffee sizes in butchered Italian The venti for extralarge which just means  in Italian is a nod to the espresso culture Mr Schultz fell in love with on a trip to Italy in Mr Schultz who handed off leadership reins at the company last year came to Seattle with his wife Sheri in  to take a job as marketing director of Starbucks then just a modest local seller of coffee beans Only five years later he organized an investor group to buy the company and then built it  with two stints as chief executive  into a retail giant with nearly  stores around the world and more than  employeesBut like Seattle itself with its vast wealth and abundant homelessness its leftleaning social and environmental policies but no income tax on its considerable allotment of billionaires the Schultz legacy is mixedAt his first Seattle appearance after announcing his presidential considerations protesters gathered outside a downtown theater where he was promoting his new memoir The protesters waved signs about venti egos and failed billionaire politicians while the audience inside cheered at almost every whispered hint of a presidential runIn charitable civic work the Schultz Family Foundation has been a force in homeless advocacy working with shelter groups and youthtraining centers in Seattle with a datadriven approach to moving homeless families off the street quickly and into stable housingThe foundation piloted something and proved that it worked said Marty Hartman the executive director at Marys Place a nonprofit shelter provider that has received more than  million from Starbucks and the Schultz foundationBut by other measures of civic engagement like bothering to vote Mr Schultz has been less involved Of  elections held since  that he could have participated in as a Seattle resident he voted only  times according to King County recordsIm remiss of course that I did not vote in those local elections but you know I travel so much Mr Schultz said in the interview  though he quickly added that he had never missed a chance to vote for presidentAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Kirk JohnsonSEATTLE  As cars and pedestrians passed by during the evening rush on Thursday Paula HarperChristensen a retired teacher smiled and waved her sign with an upsidedown Starbucks mermaid Dont spill our chance the text said under the logo Susan Glicksbergs protest placard was more blunt Do Not RunHoward Schultz the former chief executive of Starbucks has returned to his hometown Seattle and it has not been a uniformly warm welcomeMr Schultz  has come under fierce criticism from many fellow Democrats for being a possible  spoiler after he disclosed his interest in running as an independent candidate for president He says he will weigh whether to run over the few next months as he undertakes a national book tour describing his vision for fixing Americas illsCheck out the Democratic field with our new candidate trackerThursday night was his first major appearance in Seattle since his political announcement Roughly  protesters gathered to greet him before his planned event to promote the book and his possible candidacy Some like Mary Hanke were overtly hostile to Mr Schultz and his record as a businessmanHes just like Trump and the last thing we need is another spoiled selfabsorbed billionaire said Ms Hanke  a retired tech managerBut many others like Ms HarperChristensen said they were more concerned about the impact of a Schultz independent candidacy in  that a thirdparty run could split the vote and help reelect President Trump who is far more unpopular in Seattle than Mr Schultz isI dont even like to say his name Ms HarperChristensen said referring to the presidentSeattle is where Mr Schultz made his fortune as a businessman He organized an investor group to buy in  what was at the time a modest coffeebean retailer called Starbucks with all of  locations and building it into a frappaccino behemoth with nearly  stores around the worldMr Schultz left the company as a billionaire last year and yet remains relatively little known to many Seattle residents compared to other Seattle business leaders who have become household names  notably Jeff Bezos of Amazon and Bill Gates of MicrosoftBut the Starbucks brand with which many Seattle residents have a complex lovehate relationship is everywhere you look The historic nonprofit theater that Mr Schultz hired out for Thursday evening is only a few blocks from the early svintage Starbucks store at Pike Place Market  preserved like a museum or shrine and drawing tens of thousands of tourists a year The corporate headquarters with its blueandgreen mermaid logo rising from the rooftop is a few miles to the southIn the riots that gripped the city during a gathering of the World Trade Organization in  the shattered glass windows of Starbucks stores became one of the symbols of destruction by anarchists and other groups that roved the city denouncing corporate powerAt least one other billionaire with the means to selffinance a bid for the White House Michael R Bloomberg the former mayor of New York is considering a run for president  in Mr Bloombergs case as a DemocratBut it is Mr Schultzs possible path as a moderate independent outside the twoparty system that has drawn the most attention  and criticism by some Democrats who said they feared that a Schultz candidacy could siphon off more Democratic voters than RepublicansWashingtons governor Jay Inslee a Democrat who is also considering a presidential bid said this week that he feared a Schultz candidacy could help reelect President TrumpAnyone who would run as an independent and clearly split the Democratic vote and clearly help Donald Trump  that would be a terrible decision Mr Inslee saidBut Mr Schultz in an interview with The Times and an appearance on  Minutes said he believed that the twoparty system locked in a war of revenge and spite was broken and that Democratic Party leaders had moved too far to the left on some policy issuesBoth parties are consistently not doing whats necessary on behalf of the American people he saidA few people who came to greet Mr Schultz at his speech said they agreed with him on at least that point Jeff Jared  a lawyer and selfdescribed libertarian carried a sign that said Run Howard RunPeople are starving for a third party Mr Jared

for the stock market investors are looking for clues about what  will bringThe hope on Wall Street is that the underlying economy of the United States is sound that the recent selling will burn itself out and that stocks will resume their recordsetting climb But the risk is that the plunge the worst annual decline in a decade could be the start of something more sinisterStocks dropped to start  Read our coverage of the years first trading day hereThe forces that pushed the SP  down  percent in  are still in place The economy is still doing well but it does not appear to be as strong as it once was President Trump is lashing out at the Federal Reserve and the central banks interestrate increases pose a risk to corporate profits and investors appetite for stocks Americas trade war with China continues and the technology giants that dominate the stock market face heightened scrutiny about their business practicesAs investors try to gauge the seriousness of these risks stocks could lurch in different directions at each new event A meeting of the Fed later this month an earnings report in February or a tradenegotiation deadline in March could all prove to be catalysts for a big rise or fallBut Wall Streets top stock pickers are still expecting gains this year even if theyre not quite as boisterous in their predictions as they once wereIt could get more frightening before it gets better said James Paulsen chief investment strategist at the research firm Leuthold Group But I think we survive for another runLast year was a reminder of how unpredictable stock markets can be In January with corporate tax cuts in place the outlook for the market in the United States was great And stocks did hit a record high in September with Apple and Amazon becoming the first publicly traded American companies to be valued at more than  trillion But  was also turbulent with markets falling sharply in February and again at the end of the yearThe SP  narrowly avoided one grim milestone a  percent drop from its high a decline that would signal the start of a bear market The index ended  down  percent from its high point and a bear market could yet be in store should stocks experience another decline similar to what they went through in early December If that happens the pessimism that has hovered over the stock market could leach into the rest of the economy as companies grow wary of taking risks expanding or adding more workersHere are the factors that will help determine whether that happens this yearInterest rates in year Treasury note yieldFederal funds target rate upper limitJanFebMarAprMayJunJulAugSepOctNovDecInterest rates in year treasury note yieldFederal funds target rate upper limitJFMAMJJASONDInterest rates in year Treasury note yieldFederal funds target rate upper limitJanFebMarAprMayJunJulAugSepOctNovDecRising interest rates and expectations about where those rates are headed may have weighed on stock prices more than anything else in With the United Statess economy humming the Fed increased its target rate four times in  pushing up borrowing costs across the economy The yield on the year Treasury note which is the basis for debt like home mortgages and corporate loans climbed to its highest level since  before falling back When borrowing costs rise too much they can be restrictive Companies and consumers pull back and the economy suffersIn the worst case a recession could occurStocks tumbled as investors became increasingly concerned that the Fed under a new chairman Jerome H Powell would raise interest rates too far and send a chill through the American economyOnly more data on the state of the economy will ease the concerns about growth If investors see the economy growing steadily jitters over the Feds intentions and the recession fears that gripped stocks could fadeWere going to see if the market was wildly hysterical about a recession said Ed Yardeni chief investment strategist at Yardeni ResearchIf not then investors could hang on the Feds every move and monetary policy meeting in Heading into  in the days after Mr Trumps tax cuts were enacted investors were mostly buoyant about his presidency and tolerant of his unpredictable declarations on TwitterThat bullishness persisted even after it became clear that Mr Trump was serious about imposing restrictions on trading partners as a way of gaining concessions from them But as the trade war continued unresolved tensions with China started to become a concern and Mr Trumps proclamations started to make investors jumpyWhen Mr Trump referred to himself on Twitter as Tariff Man the message helped spur a drop of more than  percent in the SP I am a Tariff Man When people or countries come in to raid the great wealth of our Nation I want them to pay for the privilege of doing so It will always be the best way to max out our economic power We are right now taking in billions in Tariffs MAKE AMERICA RICH AGAINIt wasnt just the tweets about China that began to bother investors Mr Trump also roiled the markets with criticism of the Fed which he blamed for the stock market turmoilThis is a change for the market When the investment bank RBC Capital Markets surveyed big investors in December about what kept them up at night Mr Trump topped the list interest rates and the trade war ranked second and thirdThe only problem our economy has is the Fed They dont have a feel for the Market they dont understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders The Fed is like a powerful golfer who cant score because he has no touch  he cant puttWhen it comes to Mr Trump investors have a lot to consider They will have to weigh whether a partial government shutdown will dampen the economy what a House of Representatives controlled by Democrats or staff turnover at the White House could mean and what might happen if the United States and China cant reach a trade deal by a March

showed signs of slowing down late in  and reliable indicators of global growth like the price of oil and copper are flashing warningsGrowth may accelerate if trade agreements are forged in  But the problems could be deeper Chinas methods for pulling its economy out of a rut probably are not as effective as they once were And the battle between Italys populist government and the European Union over the countrys spending plans may heat up againThe European economy could also be hit hard if Britain crashes out of the European Union without an agreement that keeps trade flowing freely That could be avoided if Parliament approves a withdrawal deal Prime Minister Theresa May has struck with the union But that is no sure thing Mrs May lacking the necessary support was forced to delay a vote originally set for last month until midJanuary She has been trying so far unsuccessfully to extract changes from European officials in hopes of improving the chances of passage when that vote comesIf Parliament ultimately rejects Mrs Mays proposal investors will probably remain nervous And support may grow among lawmakers for a second referendum on whether Britain should leave the European

markets fate also depends on whether investors fall back in love with large technology companies Last year companies like Facebook Apple Amazon and Netflix helped push key stock benchmarks like the SP  and Nasdaq composite to records and then dragged those indexes down when the companies went into freefallThe tech giants shares plunged in part because they were deemed to be too expensive Put another way investors went from being optimistic that the companies future earnings would be terrific to worried that they wouldntSome of the large tech firms also face substantial problems in their own operations that could take time to resolve Apple for example counts on China as both a market where it sells iPhones and a manufacturing hubFacebook is spending large sums of money to try to protect its network from interference Any sign that its systems have been abused with the goal of swinging an election could subject it to regulationFacebook is not alone in facing this concern Some analysts say that large tech companies are now in a position to similar to what big banks confronted after the financial crisis of The tech companies are a heck of a lot better run than the financial companies were in  said Savita Subramanian equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch but their incentives may not be aligned with the best interests of employees and shareholdersThe United States economy has to grow at a strong enough pace to deliver the corporate earnings that investors are hoping for But if the economy grows quickly investors may return to worrying about higher interest ratesIf the Fed can tread a delicate middle ground the trade war winds down and the economies of Europe and China stabilize a recovery in stock prices could holdI am not sure the upside for

Tech partner with the Pentagon We examine a cautionary taleWednesday March th michael barbaroFrom The New York Times Im Michael Barbaro This is The Daily Today Across Silicon Valley tech companies are pursuing contracts with the US military Kevin Roose on a cautionary tale of where that can lead Its Wednesday March kevin rooseSo Im a tech columnist I spend a lot of time talking with and looking at the big tech companies and where theyre going And one of the most interesting threads thats come up in the past year or so is this question of how Silicon Valley should engage with the government and with the military specifically And I think were at a point right now where the government is saying we want the things that youre building We want you to be part of our modernization effortsmichael barbaroMmhmmkevin rooseAnd within some of these companies theres a growing divide between the management of the companies and what they want for their business and some of the people actually building this technology  the engineers who are working on these advanced systems that are in hot demand by the military and other government agencies And we just saw this play out in a pretty meaningful way at Microsoftmichael barbaroWhat happened there exactly So last year Microsoft signed a contract with the Department of Defense to use a technology called HoloLens in the Armyarchived recordingGood morning everyone A few years ago we started asking ourselves could we make things so simple that technology would just disappearkevin rooseAnd HoloLens was originally developed  its kind of like a headset for augmented realityarchived recordingCould we place your digital content right into your world right into your life with more reality than ever beforekevin rooseI saw a demo of this a couple years ago and they were touting it as the next generation of gamingmichael barbaroMmhmmarchived recordingWelcome to a new era of Windows Welcome to Windows Holographickevin roosePeople were wearing HoloLens and you would be swinging your imaginary sword at imaginary monsters But it all looked like it was happening right there in your living roommichael barbaroMmhmmkevin rooseAnd last year Microsoft signed a contract to develop HoloLens technology for use on the battlefield  to give soldiers the ability to wear these headsets and get information about their surroundings and to increase the lethality of the soldiers on the battlefieldmichael barbaroSo this technology will specifically be deployed within the military so that American soldiers are better at killing the enemykevin rooseThats the way its described in the contract yesmichael barbaroAnd so Im guessing that this was something that Microsoft engineers objected toarchived recordingAnd then theres Microsoft Theyre receiving backlash from their own employees over new groundbreaking technologykevin rooseWell a few of them did But they did it pretty vocallyarchived recordingYeah so more than  Microsoft employees signed a letter demanding that the company cancel a  million contract to build a HoloLens for the Pentagon saying they quote kevin rooseDear Satya Nadella and Brad Smith We are a global coalition of Microsoft workers and we refuse to create technology for warfare and oppression And it goes on And basically they argue that this crossed the line into weapons development  that this was basically taking something that they had built and turned it into something that was designed to help soldiers on the battlefield kill other soldiersmichael barbaroNot what they decided to dokevin rooseRight Not their intent not what they were told they were going to be working on and not something they were comfortable withmichael barbaroAnd Kevin thinking about this its hard to imagine that the US military would not use US technology Americanmade technology like this in warfare That seems inevitable doesnt itkevin rooseWell right I mean as long as there has been a US tech industry theres been a partnership with the US government and with the military I mean the original internet came out of a Defense Department projectmichael barbaroMmhmmkevin rooseAnd since then lots of advances in technology have been spurred by this collaboration between the Pentagon and Silicon Valley And a lot of these companies already provide technology to the military I mean a lot of military computers run Windowss operating system But this was a bridge too far for these employees They say were OK basically providing generaluse technology the same stuff that you and I could go and buy But the specific development of our technology for use in this specific case crosses a line for us and we dont want to be a part of itmichael barbaroSo Kevin whats interesting to you about this storykevin rooseWell Im interested in the ethical debate around the use of artificial intelligence and other technologies But Im also a business reporter I think this is a decision that is not just being made along ethical lines These companies are also thinking about their businesses and the amount of money and the profitability of developing these systems for the military So I wanted to look at it along those lines as well Lets just bracket the ethical discussion for a second and say does this make financial sensemichael barbaroWell not just bracket it right Isnt a company often going to make decisions about moral dilemmas based on the implications to their financeskevin rooseExactly These are not philanthropies or think tanks These are forprofit corporations that generally operate on a costbenefit calculation And so just on that plane I wanted to see does this make sense for them MUSIC And so I did a little bit of digging and I went back about  years in history and I found an example of a company that sold something to the military and later came to regret itmichael barbaroWhich was whatkevin rooseIts the case of Dow Chemical In  Dow Chemical is this small littleknown chemicals company based in Michigan They make lots of different things  household chemicals agricultural chemicalsarchived recordingNow at your favorite grocery store the most amazing food wrap ever developedkevin rooseThey were probably best known for making Saran Wrapmichael barbaroHeard of itarchived recording speaker Have you tried Saran Wrap It really is amazing And look Saran Wrap clings like magicarchived recording speaker Saran Wrap is a product of the Dow Chemical Companyarchived recording speaker JET PLANES AND EXPLOSIONS Vietnam United States helicopter gunships backed up ground forces in a strong assault on a Viet Cong position kevin rooseMeanwhile the Vietnam War is happening And in  Dow Chemical wins a contract with the Department of Defense to produce a new chemical called napalm B And napalm which is a highly flammable gel that binds and sticks to things and then burns them  had been in use But napalm B was the new formulation and the military was very excited in using this in Vietnamarchived recordingTroops followed up the advantage gained by the air support to knock out the VCkevin rooseThey thought it had a lot of promise on the battlefield It was hard to contain and hard to put out It was a very effective form of weaponry  a very horrible form of weaponry And it produced very very bad burns on people They would basically be burned alive And so theres not much noise about this for the first little while And then Americans start seeing images from the Vietnam War And for a lot of people this is their first time seeing the effects of napalmmichael barbaroMmhmmkevin rooseMost famously theres this photograph  youve probably seen it It won the Pulitzer Prize It is a photograph of a yearold girl whos been badly burned by a napalm weaponarchived recording martin luther king jrSo far we may have killed a million of them mostly childrenkevin rooseAnd it sort of shocks the American public and it galvanizes the antiwar movementarchived recording martin luther king jrWhat do they think as we test out our latest weapons on them just as the Germans tested out new medicine and new tortures in the concentration camps of Europearchived recordingCROWDS CHANTING No more napalm No more napalm No more napalm No more napalmkevin rooseAnd they decide to go after the use of napalm by US armed forces And the way that they do that is by going after Dow Chemicalarchived recordingCROWDS CHANTINGarchived recording speaker This is Monday afternoon November  on the San Jose State college campus What youre watching is the result of a demonstration that began about an hour agokevin rooseThey staged demonstrations outside the companys headquarters and they go to dozens of colleges where Dow was recruiting students to come work for themmichael barbaroHmarchived recordingThe professors against the war and the Students for a Democratic Society had marched in front of the administration building to protest the recruitment on this campus by Dow Chemical Company of employeeskevin rooseAnd they protest the recruiting sessions They have signs like Dow deforms children Dow deals deatharchived recordingTheyre not allowing anyone in Like the only people theyre allowing in are those people that are connected with Dow PROTESTERS SHOUTINGkevin rooseMy favorite story from this period is that the Dow recruiters  the people that would go to campus to talk to the students  they would get locked up in classrooms They would get like held hostage by the activists And at one point one of the recruiters got so used to this that he started bringing a sandwich in his briefcase so that if the inevitable happened and he got locked in a room with a bunch of angry protesters michael barbaroHe would survive the daykevin rooseHe would at least have lunchmichael barbaroSo this sounds like a complete corporate nightmare  that your company is so associated with war and with death and not with the household product that you make  Saran Wrapkevin rooseRight And Dow was particularly offended by this because napalm was a very small part of its business I mean it accounted I think for a half of  percent of its annual sales And yet it had sort of come to take over its corporate identity So there was some internal discussion there were some debates within the company and at the board level about what to do whether to stop manufacturing napalm And there were lots of reasons for that I mean there were customer boycotts They did take a financial hit And they had to do a lot to counter their corporate reputation as a warmonger But what they really worried about was recruiting They worried that on these visits to college campuses they werent going to get the best people They werent going to get the scientists and the engineers who would help them in the years ahead And as a result they would have longterm costs not just financial but also in terms of what they were missing out onmichael barbaroThe future employee with moral objections to napalm who doesnt come work at Dow Chemical and make the next blockbuster productkevin rooseRight But ultimately they decided to stand their ground They said we have a duty to produce napalm for the US government Its our patriotic obligation and we can withstand the controversymichael barbaroDow Chemical feels like such an extreme case and it feels quite different from whats going on with these tech companies todaykevin rooseYeah absolutely These are not totally comparable I mean the Vietnam War at this point was extremely unpopular You had these horrific images coming back Theres no good use for napalm right Theres no prosocial healthy use for napalm Its a weapon Whereas a lot of these technologies  AI facial recognition image recognition augmented reality  these can all be used for very productive and healthy things Its only when you put them into a certain context that they can be used for harmmichael barbaroAnd that would seem to be the case for most tech companies right They are developing products not explicitly for the military They just happen to be used that waykevin rooseExactlyarchived recordingArtificial intelligence drones warfare and Google  its a mixture that caused an uproar inside the tech giant where the early motto was Dont be evilkevin rooseThere was a big controversy at Google last year about this military contract known as Project Mavenarchived recordingGoogle is developing artificial intelligence to analyze drone video datakevin rooseAnd this was a Defense Department program that basically used AI and imagerecognition technology to interpret video imagesmichael barbaroMmhmmkevin rooseSo the same kind of AI that Google would use in Google Photos or in its selfdriving car unit to recognize images out on the road archived recordingIt would apparently be used as part of a drone programkevin roose could be used to for example improve the targeting of drone strikes to make drone strikes more accurate to be able to recognize certain people or certain buildings and be able to direct a drone at that target specificallymichael barbaroAgain not what Google engineers probably ever thought the technology would be used forkevin rooseExactly I mean they didnt sign up for that And some of them didnt even know that this was happeningarchived recordingThousands of Google workers now protesting Googles involvement in a Pentagon drone programkevin rooseSo there was a big uproar There was lots of heated internal meetingsarchived recordingAt least  maybe  employees did resignkevin rooseSome resignations michael barbaroWow People quit the company over itkevin rooseYeah people quit the company over itarchived recordingMeantime thousands of Google employees have signed a letter protesting the companys participation in an artificial intelligence project by the Pentagonkevin rooseThere was a petition that was signed by thousands of Google employeesarchived recordingQuote We believe that Google should not be in the business of war Therefore we asked that Project Maven be canceledkevin rooseCalling for the company to not only not enter into this contract but to stop making tools of weaponry altogether And ultimately archived recordingTech giant Google will end a project with the Pentagonkevin rooseGoogle bowed to the pressure They pulled the contract They said they wouldnt renew it They put out a statement saying well still work with the military on other projects but were not going to manufacture weapons and weaponsrelated technology And that seemed to quiet the unrest MUSICmichael barbaroI feel like people would be surprised that a huge tech company like Google would back down like thatkevin rooseYeah I mean it does speak to the difference between a conventional contractor like Dow Chemical and these tech companies I think there are three main differences there The first is that these companies are beloved They have loyal followings and they dont want to do anything to upset that The second is that these companies are very idealistic And in Silicon Valley this is a big deal Companies market themselves not just as profitable enterprises but as humanitarian projects And anything that compromises that hurts themmichael barbaroRight Worldchangerskevin rooseTotally And I think the biggest difference is that employees at these companies  especially the engineers who work on very specialized projects like AI development  have a ton of leverage because there are not very many of them they make a ton of money and theyre really hard to recruit If a couple of chemical engineers walk out of Dow Chemical in protest they can probably find some more where that came from But if hundreds or thousands of AI engineers are upset about a project that Google is working on thats a real threat to their business It doesnt take many people staging a protest or threatening to walk out to really get the attention of senior leadershipmichael barbaroSo these three differences that you just laid out explain why Dow didnt back down despite images of dying children affected by their products whereas Google did back down long long before anything like that happened to itkevin rooseRight And I want to be clear What happened at Google was the exception not the rule This is not happening in any vast quantity across the tech industry At Microsoft for example they came right out and said we appreciate the objections of this small group of employees They can move elsewhere in the company if they want but were committed to seeing this contract through And theyve defended themselves by saying we have a patriotic duty to provide technology to the military We think that we can advocate for the ethical use of technologies like AI if were at the table in these discussions And they say that basically these technologies could be good These could save lives on the battlefield The army has said it wants to use HoloLens not just for combat training but for things like measuring vital signs and monitoring soldiers for concussions and having some sort of hearing protection on peoples ears So those are the kinds of arguments theyre making to justify staying in these contractsmichael barbaroSo the argument here being that engineers who came to these companies to do good having their technology used by the military does not necessarily mean not doing goodkevin rooseYeah I mean thats one of the arguments that theyre making is that basically if the US military doesnt have the best technology available on the market our adversaries will and we will be endangered as a resultmichael barbaroI guess the question is do the engineers buy that argumentkevin rooseWell some of them probably do But as weve seen a number of them dont MUSICmichael barbaroSo Kevin we started by talking about this intersection of the moral and the financial as these tech companies navigate this question of should they work with the military Whats your understanding in Silicon Valley about how these companies are thinking about thatkevin rooseSo I think a lot of these companies have really shifted their view on this in the last couple of years A lot of Silicon Valley companies used to just think of themselves as toolmakers right We build this stuff and we put it out into the world and people use it And our responsibility basically stops at the moment of salearchived recording mark zuckerbergTo me entrepreneurship is about creating change not just creating companieskevin rooseAnd now I think were seeing that these companies are being held responsible by the public and by their own employees not just for the tools theyre building but for how theyre being used in the world And this is not just about the militaryarchived recordingAt this hour some  programmers are threatening to leave Microsoft unless the tech giant drops its contract with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency known as ICEkevin rooseI mean also companies are being scrutinized for working with ICE or working with law enforcementarchived recordingAn Amazon worker is pushing the company to stop selling facial recognition technology to law enforcementkevin rooseSocial media companies are being held responsible for bad things that happen on their platformsarchived recordingFacebook defending Alex Jones this morning saying the platform will continue to allow the video blogger to run video on its site even as it claims to crack down on fake newskevin rooseThis is really happening across technology And as technology embeds itself into every part of our lives were seeing that these companies are having to make new kinds of decisions Its not just a dollarsandcents profitandloss calculation anymore They also have to consider what might happen out in the world once they release these technologiesmichael barbaroWhich is another way of saying that the morality element of this is now playing a much bigger role than it has in the past and perhaps is not beating out financial but rivaling itkevin rooseIts certainly part of the discussion now in a way it hasnt been before Its not just about how much money well make or how many

SatarianoLONDON  The expanding power of technology companies has become a talking point in the United States presidential race a subject of debate in India and a top focus of regulators in the European Union Now Britain is adding its voice to the worldwide backlashBig Tech is reducing consumer choice and harming innovation according to a British government report released on Wednesday The government as a result needs to overhaul its antitrust policiesThe page report ordered by the chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond the countrys top treasury official said the country needed stricter rules on acquisitions in the technology industry and stronger oversight to make sure that new rivals cannot be squashedThere isnt sufficient competition today said Jason Furman a professor of economic policy at Harvard who led the group behind the report and a former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama Addressing that he said is one of the most important economic policy questions in the world todayLast week Senator Elizabeth Warren Democrat of Massachusetts and a presidential candidate called for breaking up the largest tech companies Senator Amy Klobuchar a Democrat of Minnesota who is also making a White House bid has proposed taxes and antitrust laws against the industryOfficials in the European Union have been particularly aggressive in pushing back against the industry issuing billions of dollars in penalties against Amazon Apple and Google for antitrust violations and tax avoidance while passing strict privacy regulations The European Union is weighing copyright regulations and rules to stop the spread of disinformationIndividual countries in Europe have taken stands as well France has proposed taxes on technology companies while Germany passed a law against online hate speechIn India the government last year imposed rules against the ecommerce operations of companies including Amazon and Walmart The country is also weighing regulations to block certain internet content posted on social media deemed libelous an invasion of privacy hateful or deceptiveThe tech industry has thrived over the past two decades thanks in part to little government regulation The companies say that it has allowed them to develop products that benefit consumers like free internet services and online shoppingThe panel said that this handsoff approach had benefits for consumers but that it had also created consequences related to privacy and lack of competitionCritics have argued that existing competition laws cannot keep up with the fast pace and rapid growth of the tech industry By the time authorities issue a verdict the underlying technology has changed and companies have moved on with even greater powerLast year the European Commission issued a record fine against Google of  billion euros or about  billion for antitrust violations related to its Android mobile operating system But the case took more than three years to conclude and is still being appealedOver the last  years the report said the five largest tech companies have made more than  acquisitions globally None have been blocked and only a small number have had conditions attached for approvalCompetition policy will need to be updated to address the novel challenges posed by the digital economy the report saidMr Furmans panel called for the creation of a digital markets unit that would require companies to allow consumers to move data from one service to another Large companies would also have to make data available to competitors a bid to lower barriers to entry by forcing them to share information The report also calls for a code of conduct to be drafted for the biggest tech companies that would be enforceable with finesThe recommendations are part of a broader review of tech industry policies as the country prepares to exit the European Union British officials are also considering taxes on tech companies and making internet companies liable for the spread of misinformation hate speech and terrorist content on their platformsAny regulations would still need to be agreed to by ParliamentIn the United States Ms Warrens regulatory plan would force tech giants to reverse some acquisitions including Facebooks purchase of WhatsApp and Instagram Amazons deal for Whole Foods and Googles purchase of the mapping company Waze Companies also would be prevented from transferring or sharing peoples data with third partiesMr Furman the Harvard economist and former Obama adviser said breaking up the companies was not yet necessary But he voiced some regret that the White House did not do more to regulate the tech industry while he was thereI wish we had gotten to some of the competition issues sooner he saidA common argument against competition regulation is that new companies will emerge as technologies change just as Google and Facebook overtook older technologyThe British report said that rationale no longer applied because the barriers of entry for young companies were much higher The largest companies including Google Facebook Amazon and Microsoft are leaders in the most promising emerging technologies like artificial intelligenceThe companies most able to take advantage of it may well be the existing large companies because of the importance of data for the successful use of these tools the report saidAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byTech TipBefore you get out the hardware use software like free floorplan apps and augmentedreality tools to sketch out the ideas for your remodeling projectsBy J D BiersdorferGot a bunch of homeimprovement dreams but youre not quite sure where to start Let a free or inexpensive threedimensional floor plan program be your guide While making a D model is no substitute for professionally crafted plans and blueprints it will give you a way to experiment with ideas before you hire a contractor or an architect And some programs are simple to use If you can use a tape measure and drag objects on a computer screen you have the necessary skills Heres how to get startedYoull need all the measurements of the room or project area in order to recreate it A locking foot retractable tape measure is the timetested tool but you can also get rough estimates with augmentedreality tools like Googles free Measure app for Android or Apples similarly named iOS  Measure app Some apps like Magicplan for Android and iOS prices start at  can do both the measurements and put together a floor planMeasure everything the length width and depth of the walls doors and windows in the space and dont forget fixtures like radiators You should also grab the dimensions of the furniture appliances and other items in the renovation zone If you plan to buy furniture appliances or shelving collect the measurements from the products specifications online or on the boxYou can find plenty of homedesign apps in a range of prices in your app store And some retailer apps like those from Buildcom and Wayfair use augmented reality to show virtual objects like furniture in a room But if this is all new to you  or if youre adding on a room  the free edition of Sweet Home D for Windows Mac and Linux computers may be your best bet because you get an intuitive interface and many design options The application has many appealing features for beginners including an illustrated user guide and video tutorials A full version of Sweet Home D with more design options is also available for less than  in the Microsoft and Mac App storesSweet Home D has a free online edition that works in a web browser SketchUp Free is another browserbased drawing program and has paid versions Planner D has free versions for Android and iOS that give you plenty of room to play before you need to start making any inapp purchases The program also works on Windows  macOS and the webNext make a scale model within the programs work space which typically looks like a grid of squares representing feet or meters Refer to your list of measurements and use the programs tools and grid to create walls rooms doors and the other central elementsIf drawing a room from scratch intimidates you at first check your program to see if it includes templates or sample files With a little clicking and dragging you can usually modify these examples to match the outline and measurements of your own roomAfter you map out the rooms exterior dimensions start filling in the interior with furniture and appliances Most design apps have an object browser window you can use to drag D models of common items like tables sofas and bar carts into your floor plan where you want them to go More stylish furnishings may require an inapp purchaseDepending on your software you may also be able to select different window and door designs as well as stylized wallpaper flooring curtains and other furnishings to make your model look as close to your renovation dream as possibleSome apps provide a splitscreen view between the D floor plan and a D model that you can spin and rotate Other programs display the project in the flat D view and you add the extra dimension with a tap or click Seeing your room in D can give you a better idea of how everything works within the space and can highlight issues you may not have seen on the flat floor plan like fire sprinklers that block cabinet doors from fully openingWhen youre satisfied with your creation move on to the next phase Print it out to use it as a guide as you work or send a copy to your contractor so youre both on the

that Washington can do little to stop it from flying higherHuawei earned more than  billion in revenue last year up nearly a fifth from  Guo Ping the companys deputy chairman said on Friday Profit grew by a quarter to more than  billion Though Huawei has not sold shares to the public it publishes audited yearly financial results as a gesture toward opennessSpeaking at the companys headquarters in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen Mr Guo said that we will do everything we can to shake off outside distractions improve management and make progress toward our strategic goalsMr Guo said that the United States actions had created a certain amount of trouble for Huawei but that customers would judge the company based on their own interests not WashingtonsWe Chinese would say that they dont mind their table manners Mr Guo said of the United States government I feel very sorry for these socalled gentlemenIn telecommunications equipment smartphones and more Huawei has become a globestraddling colossus despite years of accusations by the United States that the company acts and spies on behalf of the Chinese governmentHuawei today is in the same league in terms of yearly revenue as Microsoft and Google By that metric it is almost as big as three of Chinas most influential internet companies  Alibaba Tencent and Baidu  combinedFor much of the past year though Huawei has battled a torrent of legal and regulatory troublesIn December the companys finance chief Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Canada after the United States accused her of defrauding Huaweis banks and causing them to violate sanctions against Iran Ms Meng  who is the daughter of Huaweis founder and chief executive Ren Zhengfei  remains in Canada while legal authorities decide whether she will be extraditedHuawei which was also charged this month pleaded not guilty to the accusations which also include obstructing a criminal investigation into the company It has said it would never spy on

although it stopped short of calling for a ban on the companys productsThe chief executive of Vodafone the British carrier has warned that a full Huawei ban would delay the construction of G networks Few industry observers believe however that carriers that are blocked from using Huaweis G gear would be put at a major technological disadvantage as they rolled out new data servicesWere talking about an industry with standards meaning that by and large everybodys equipment operates in a similar way said Richard Kramer a founder of the technology research firm Arete I think its an overstatement to say that the rest of the world wont be able to build G networks without HuaweiThe other big unknown on Huaweis horizon is whether Washington will take further measures to undermine the companyThe Justice Department has already filed criminal charges against Huawei and Ms Meng But other federal agencies could do more such as cut the company off from American parts and technology The American chip companies Broadcom and Xilinx both of which count Huawei as a customer have recently told investors that they are monitoring the situation closelyThe immense power that Washington

APRIL  


        On the east side of Bryant Park in Midtown Manhattan three cameras on the roof of a restaurant film the lunch crowds tourists and commuters  everything that goes on each day The feeds are streamed publicly online
        
        
      
        We were able to turn those cameras into a facial recognitionpowered tracking system for less than   using a service available to anyone with an internet connection and a credit card The process was completely legal
        
          We pixelated the faces shown here which were captured over one day

        How easy would it be to figure out who was in the park We built a database using public photos of people who work in the area and matched this college professor on his way to lunch All it took was a few days work
        
        
      
        The cameras are just three among thousands across New York City And if youre an adult in America theres more than a  percent chance that youre already in a law enforcement facial recognition database according to researchers at Georgetown
        
        
          Security cameras in Lower Manhattan in 
 camera recorded by the NYCLU
Most people pass through some type of public space in their daily routine  sidewalks roads train stations Thousands walk through Bryant Park every day But we generally think that a detailed log of our location and a list of the people were with is private Facial recognition applied to the web of cameras that already exists in most cities is a threat to that privacyTo demonstrate how easy it is to track people without their knowledge we collected public images of people who worked near Bryant Park available on their employers websites for the most part and ran one day of footage through Amazons commercial facial recognition service Our system detected  faces from a ninehour period not necessarily unique people since a person could be captured in multiple frames It returned several possible identifications including one frame matched to a head shot of Richard Madonna a professor at the SUNY College of Optometry with an  percent similarity score The total cost about My first reaction was Oh my god that is unbelievable Dr Madonna said after we reached him and explained the experiment I was shocked at how readily it seems that it picked me up because really  its the side of my headIn our exercise we built a database using only photos from public websites and we obtained Dr Madonnas consent before publishing this story Weve deleted the images and data that we collected and are no longer monitoring the Bryant Park camerasOver decades businesses and individuals have installed millions of cameras like the ones we used inadvertently setting up the infrastructure for mass surveillance In the past a human would have to watch the video feed to identify people making it impossible to comprehensively record everyones movements But the accuracy and speed of modern facial recognition technology means that building a dragnet surveillance system is now feasibleThe law has not caught up In the United States the use of facial recognition is almost wholly unregulatedThe technology has advanced faster than even I thought that it would said Jennifer Lynch surveillance litigation director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation She said that because of how quickly the technology has advanced she would now support a wholesale ban on government use of facial recognitionThe cameras in Bryant Park were installed more than a decade ago so that people could see whether the lawn was open for sunbathing for example or check how busy the ice skating rink was in the winter They are not intended to be a security device according to the corporation that runs the parkBut our experiment shows that a person equipped with just a few cameras and facial recognition technology can learn peoples daily habits when they arrive at the office each day who they get coffee with whether they left work early When we identified Dr Madonna he was on his way to lunch with a job candidate  an example of how the midday outings of even lawabiding citizens can sometimes be sensitive informationThe police and governments may also have access to a vast network of cameras Combine that with a comprehensive database of faces  like a drivers license database  and its possible to track citizens throughout an entire region in real time There is no evidence that this is happening on a wide scale in the United States But thats not because the technology doesnt exist Last year companies claimed they could compare live feeds to a database of billions of facesAuthorities have used facial recognition to track down criminal suspects and find missing children But civil liberties advocates warn about the chilling effect on free speech if the government could monitor everyones whereabouts  or say identify individuals at a protest This is not a purely hypothetical concern During  protests after Freddie Gray died in the custody of Baltimore police law enforcement used facial recognition on social media images to identify protesters with outstanding warrantsOnce the government has the ability to track us and identify us wherever we go it is impossible to speak and participate in society anonymously Ms Lynch saidNew York City is nowhere near China where the government has installed approximately one surveillance camera for every seven citizens But according to the ACLU police here have access to more than  camera feeds in Lower Manhattan aloneThe MTA has tried using facial recognition on feeds from licenseplate cameras at the citys entry points to identify drivers through their windshields although those efforts have been unsuccessful so far according to The Wall Street Journal And the Department of Transportation already has hundreds of cameras across New York City used to monitor traffic feeds that are also streamed publicly onlineThe traffic cameras are most likely too lowresolution for effective facial recognition But the citys LinkNYC kiosks which are scattered through the streets and intended to provide free wireless internet each have two security cameras Law enforcement agencies need a subpoena or court order to gain access to the footage and using facial recognition is against the policy of the company that owns the kiosks However the existence of more than  additional cameras has raised concerns about their potential to bolster the citys surveillance capabilitiesCameras onNew York City StreetsLinkNYC kioskTraffic cameraManhattanqueensBrooklynCameras onNew York City StreetsLinkNYC kioskManhattanTraffic cameraBrooklynDetails are sparse but there is evidence that those capabilities are formidable The Police Department claims its Domain Awareness System developed jointly with Microsoft which also offers facial recognition software utilizes the largest network of cameras license plate readers and radiological sensors in the worldIts unclear whether the Domain Awareness System currently uses facial recognition though the Police Department experimented with it in  according to Clare Garvie an associate at the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law School The police have been reluctant to divulge details and the center has sued the department for more informationWe compare facial images picked up by cameras at crime scenes to mugshots in law enforcement records said Sgt Jessica McRorie a spokeswoman for the department in an emailed statement We do not engage in mass or random collection of facial records from NYPD camera systems the internet or social mediaAmazon is one of several companies that sell facial recognition services to the public The company has highlighted positive applications of the service we used Rekognition such as its ability to help find lost children It insists that it requires customers comply with the law and respect others rights but has been criticized for pushing its technology to law enforcement agenciesRekognition is already actively used by the sheriffs office in Washington County Ore including to investigate minor crimes like shoplifting The Orlando Fla Police Department is also using the technology in a pilot programAmazon notes that its service makes predictions not decisions and that the confidence level the service provides should be incorporated in a human review process The company recommends using a threshold of at least  percent for applications of its facial recognition service that involve identification or public safety though critics of the technology say that the scoring is opaque and that the company has no way of enforcing that threshold None of the matches we obtained from the Bryant Park footage correct or incorrect met the thresholdMatt Wood the general manager of artificial intelligence for Amazon Web Services noted that it is possible that Rekognition like other types of information available to law enforcement officials could be used inappropriately The law enforcement agency will have to be accountable to these individuals and to the law if they violate peoples civil liberties he said He added that the company has not received any reports of misuse by law enforcementIn January however the ACLU sent a letter to Amazon asking it to stop selling facial recognition technology to police and government agencies saying that the companys attention to civil liberties has lagged behind that of Google and MicrosoftRekognition marketing materials read like a user manual for authoritarian surveillance said Nicole Ozer the technology and civil liberties director for the ACLU of California in a statement last yearIn the United States there are no federal laws that restrict the use of facial recognition Most states dont have regulations nor does New York City though a city councilman proposed legislation last year that would require businesses to disclose their use of the technology That would apply to our exercise but would not extend to law enforcements use of facial recognitionIts kind of like a wild wild west out there Ms Lynch the EFF lawyer saidThe lack of regulation has opened the door to a wide range of applications In  an Arizona sheriffs office enrolled all of Hondurass drivers licenses and mugshots into its database and a Florida sheriffs office runs  searches each month without requiring its officers to have reasonable suspicion of a crime according to the Georgetown reportThe Georgetown center along with the EFF and others have proposed regulations including requiring that authorities have reasonable suspicion before conducting a search prohibiting except in lifeordeath situations live facial recognition searches using drivers license databases and forbidding tracking individuals based on political beliefs race or religionAmazon itself has called for a legal framework that incorporates human review and transparency But some say that the technology is so dangerous that no regulation is sufficientThe future of human flourishing depends upon facial recognition technology being banned wrote Woodrow Hartzog a professor of law and computer science at Northeastern and Evan Selinger a professor of philosophy at the Rochester Institute of Technology last year Otherwise people wont know what its like to be in public without being automatically identified profiled and potentially exploitedFacial recognition is categorically different from other forms of surveillance Mr Hartzog said and uniquely dangerous Faces are hard to hide and can be observed from far away unlike a fingerprint Name and face databases of lawabiding citizens like drivers license records already exist And for the most part facial recognition surveillance can be set up using cameras already on the streetsIt might be too late for a moratorium or ban however Facial recognition is already being used by police departments around the country Ms Garvie saidWe cant lock law enforcement agencies into thcentury technology just because stcentury technology raises very serious risks she saidDr Madonna the person we identified said he understood that tension He was initially astonished when we reached out to him but he said that as a doctor he often talks to students about the ratio of risk to benefit He saw the tremendous benefits that facial recognition could offer he saidBut the technology is open to abuse he added when individuals or governments can use facial recognition to track any group or just about any

and Mike Corbat of Citigroup all said they had reviewed their account holders for potential Russian moneylaundering Mr Corbat was the only one to say he could not comment on ongoing investigationsGuns JPMorgan has refused to adopt a policy to ensure responsible lending to the gun industry even though you claim that client selection is important said Representative Carolyn Maloney Will you commit to adopting a formal policy that ensures responsible lending in your banks business with the gun industry Jamie Dimon responded that JPMorgan has a very small relationship with gun manufacturers and added that he would be willing to consider adopting a formal policy Mr Gorman said Morgan Stanley had clamped down on doing business with gunmakers Citi and Bank of America have already done soThe economy Asked about the biggest economic threat facing the US Mr Corbat answered Our ability to talk ourselves into the next recessionDiversity Not one of the CEOs thought that his successor would be a woman or a person of colorMore Lloyd Blankfein the former Goldman Sachs CEO who testified at the  hearing tweeted yesterday Boy I really miss my old job To curb disinformation and hateful content Andrew suggests in his latest column that tech giants take a page from the banking industry and make sure they know who theyre doing business with The concept is know your customer  or KYC as its called on Wall Street  and its straightforward Given concerns about privacy security and fraud when it comes to money no bank is allowed to take on a new customer without verifying its existence and vetting its background What if social media companies had to verify their users the same way banks do Youd probably feel more confident that you were interacting with real people and were not just a target for malicious bots When I broached the idea of applying a know your customer principle to their business several senior executives at social media companies recoiled at the prospect questioning how they would pull off such a huge feat especially in emerging markets where many people lack credit cards and even fixed street addresses But theres precedent NextDoor the social network focused on local communities requires users to submit a credit card or phone number which it checks against databases A know your customer rule could become more important as social networks like Facebook become fully encrypted Fake users could easily spread misinformation and be harder to stop in an encrypted world  unless there was a way to verify their identities at the outsetMore Facebook says it is expanding its efforts to clamp down on disinformation through steps like expanding factchecking operations and reducing the reach of groups that share misleading content Its also taking steps to minimize unwelcome reminders of dead friends on its networkThe ridehailing giant has told some investors that its forthcoming market debut could value it at up to  billion Its the first sign from the company about how big its IPO will beUber told holders of some convertible bonds that its stock could be valued at  to  a share That translates into a valuation of about  billion to  billion including the  billion it plans to raise during the IPOThats below the  billion that bankers had predicted last year prompting some commentators to wonder whether Lyfts struggles in the public markets had forced Uber to lower its aims Shares in the smaller ridehailing company are now down nearly  percent from their IPO priceThe big question for Uber along with many of the other tech companies going public this year How long will investors tolerate losses Earlier this year Uber disclosed that it lost  million in the last three months of  alone And the company acknowledges it will lose money for a long time though it plans to show a path to profitsWe expect to learn more about Ubers IPO later today when the company plans to publish a prospectus for the stock sale Its shares are expected to begin trading next monthMore Uber Pinterest and other unicorns are reportedly worried about their existing shareholders lockup agreements which prevent them from selling for several weeks after an IPOLess than  hours before Britains scheduled departure the EU last night extended the exit deadline until Oct  Stephen Castle and Steven Erlanger of the NYT writeIt took nine hours for European leaders to agree on the delay The sixmonth extension is more than the three months that the British prime minister Theresa May had asked for  and that President Emmanuel Macron of France had pushed for  but shorter than the year that some EU leaders favoredThe delay gives Britain time to get its ducks in a row The European Council president Donald Tusk urged the UK Please do not waste this time Mrs May acknowledged that there would be huge frustration back home over the extension but said she would again seek to persuade lawmakers to back her deal The extension could be cut short if she manages to do soBut the path ahead still resembles a minefield dotted with explosive issues like a possible attempt to topple Mrs May a general election or a second Brexit referendum  or some combination of the three Mr Castle and Mr Erlanger write Most immediately Mrs May is likely to face calls to step down and potential successors are already trying to raise money and advertise their credentialsDont rule out another extension At a news conference last night Mr Tusk told journalists Our wish and hope is the UK will be ready with a final solution at the end of October  but Im too old to exclude another scenarioAmerican Media Inc which owns the tabloid said yesterday that the Enquirer is on the block And a deal could be reached within days Ed Lee Andrew and Ben Protess of the NYT reportAmerican Media is led by David Pecker who helped silence a woman who said she had an affair with President Trump by buying her story for  before his  election and never publishing it

tabloid involved in supporting Mr TrumpBut the publisher says its business focus has shifted away from tabloids to glossy magazines like Us Weekly and Mens Journal Because of this focus we feel the future opportunities with the tabloids can be best exploited by a different ownership the company said in a statementThe House approved legislation yesterday that seeks to revive socalled net neutrality regulations that the Trump administration overturned in  Cecilia Kang of the NYT writes The legislation would prohibit blocking and throttling web traffic and would categorize broadband as a service open to heavy regulation Ms Kang writes The to vote effectively supports giving users equal access to content Supporters say the regulation would prevent companies from blocking or slowing the delivery of content like videos Opponents say it would strap broadband providers like Verizon and Comcast with heavyhanded restrictions and could lead to price controlsBut the legislation faces long odds in the Republicanled Senate The Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said this week that the legislation would be dead on arrival And earlier this week the Office of Management and Budget

Blasio is mayor of New York CityThe first word I had that Amazon was about to scrap an agreement to bring  new jobs to New York City came an hour before it broke in the news on ThursdayThe call was brief and there was little explanation for the companys reversalJust days before I had counseled a senior Amazon executive about how they could win over some of their critics Meet with organized labor Start hiring public housing residents Invest in infrastructure and other community needs Show you care about fairness and creating opportunity for the working people of Long Island CityThere was a clear path forward Put simply If you dont like a small but vocal group of New Yorkers questioning your companys intentions or integrity prove them wrongInstead Amazon proved them right Just two hours after a meeting with residents and community leaders to move the project forward the company abruptly canceled it allI am a lifelong progressive who sees the problem of growing income and wealth inequality The agreement we struck with Amazon back in November was a solid foundation It would have created at least  new jobs including for unionized construction and service workers partnerships with public colleges and  billion in new tax revenue to fuel priorities from transit to affordable housing  a ninefold return on the taxes the city and state were prepared to forgo to win the headquartersThe retail giants expansion in New York encountered opposition in no small part because of growing frustration with corporate America For decades wealth and power have concentrated at the very top Theres no greater example of this than Amazons chief executive Jeff Bezos  the richest man in the worldThe lesson here is that corporations cant ignore rising anger over economic inequality anymore We see that anger roiling Silicon Valley in the rocks hurled at buses carrying tech workers from San Francisco and Oakland to office parks in the suburbs We see it in the protests that erupted at Davos last month over the growing monopoly of corporate powerAmazons capricious decision to take its ball and go home in the face of protest wont diminish that anger The city and state were holding up our end And more important a sizable majority of New Yorkers were on board Support for the new headquarters was strongest in communities of color and among working people who too often havent gotten the economic opportunity they deserved A project that couldve opened a path to the middle class for thousands of families was scuttled by a few very powerful people sitting in a boardroom in SeattleIn the end Amazon seemed unwilling to bend or even to talk in earnest with the community about ways to shape their project They didnt want to be in a city where they had to engage critics at all And its a pattern When Seattles City Council passed a tax on big employers to fund the battle against homelessness the company threatened to stop major expansion plans putting  jobs at risk The tax was rescindedEconomic power  the kind that allows you to dangle  jobs and billions in revenue over every metropolitan area in the country  is being steadily concentrated into fewer and fewer handsFor a generation working people have gotten more and more productive have worked longer and longer hours and havent gotten their fair share in return CEOs are reaping the benefits of that work while the people actually responsible for it are keeping less and lessThis is no accident The same day Amazon announced its decision to halt its second headquarters here it was reported that the company would pay no federal income tax on the billions in profits it made last year Thats galling especially at a time when millions of workingclass and middleclass Americans are finding that they are getting smaller tax returns this year thanks to President Trumps tax plan which has hugely benefited the wealthyAs the mayor of the nations largest city a place thats both a progressive beacon and the very symbol of capitalism I share the frustration about corporate America So do many of my fellow mayors across the country We know the game is rigged But we still find ourselves fighting one another in the race to secure opportunity for our residents as corporations force us into allagainstall competitions Amazons HQ bidding war exemplified that injustice Its time to end that economic warfare with a national solution that prevents corporations from pitting cities against one anotherSome companies get it Salesforce founder and chief executive Marc Benioff threw his weight behind a new corporate tax in San Francisco to fund services for the homeless In January Microsoft pledged  million to combat the affordable housing crisis in SeattleAmazons path in New York would have been far smoother had it recognized our residents fears of economic insecurity and displacement  and spoken to them directlyWe just witnessed another example of what the concentration of power in the hands

Slide Show By Tim McKeoughWhen Bob Boyce and Victor Ren first saw their home in the Capitol Hill neighborhood of Seattle it was not the kind of house we were looking for said Mr Boyce Our aesthetic is pretty modern and clean he said while the French Normanstyle house with a turret built in  was more like ye olde countryside manorSo when they bought it in  for  million they knew they would put their own stamp on itAt the time they were living in Shanghai and planning a move to the United States Mr Boyce who grew up in Montana had moved to China in  and founded Blue Horizon Hospitality Group which owns Westernstyle restaurants there he sold the business in  Thats where he met Mr Ren who was born in Mongolia and worked in supplychain logistics management before opening his own restaurant and barFor many years the couple spent summers at a vacation house in Montana overlooking Flathead Lake At the time it was the perfect antidote to a giant metropolis Mr Boyce said Montana is the polar opposite of ShanghaiBut for yearround living they wanted a more urban setting They chose Seattle for the buzz associated with companies like Amazon Microsoft and Starbucks and because they had friends and family there including Mr Boyces sisterIt reminds us of Shanghai  or  years ago when it started booming said Mr Ren While they were browsing real estate listings from abroad one of their Seattle friends suggested the house they eventually bought With a lot of more than a halfacre and an expansive parklike backyard it seemed promising if not what they initially had in mindMr Boyce dispatched his sister to take a lookMy sister said I think you guys would really love this place he recalled We put in an offer sight unseen contingent on me looking at it and approvingWhen he flew to Seattle he was impressed It had a lot of really interesting and charming details like the barrel ceiling in the living room leaded glass little stainedglass details and really beautiful mahogany doors and frames he saidBut like most older houses it needed work Some materials and finishes looked tired the kitchen and master suite were small and a previous owner had tacked on a small addition in the s that seemed out of placeAfter closing the friend who had found the house recommended they contact Bellan Construction a general contracting company about the changes they wanted to make The contractors in turn introduced them to Lisa Chadbourne and Daren Doss the married principals of Chadbourne  Doss Architects The architects were charmed by the property and equally perturbed by the addition as it compromised the flow of interior space and did little to connect the house to one of its greatest assets the backyard It was pretty obvious that we had to rip it off Mr Doss saidWe really wanted to explore ways to open the house up to that amazing backyard Ms Chadbourne said explaining that they envisioned a modernist conservatory wrapped in glassThe twostory addition they designed was enclosed by floortoceiling sliding glass doors with an open kitchen and family room on the ground floor and a master bedroom and covered roof deck on topIn the  portion of the home they employed a light touch restoring most of the original details and adding lighting walnut builtins and blackenedsteel fireplace surrounds We tried to create a cohesive palette throughout the house with this warm rich wood blackened steel and white plaster Ms Chadbourne saidThey also made a few key changes to the floor plan of the squarefoot house They combined a series of small disjointed rooms upstairs to create a new master bathroom with a deep marble soaking tub And they converted the former master bedroom into a dressing room with its own fireplace and plenty of space to spread outIt has a bit of a mens club feel to it Mr Boyce said All of our friends get really jealous when they go inAs the scope of the project grew Ms Chadbourne and Mr Doss took on the propertys outbuildings transforming a large backyard playhouse into a guesthouse with a bathroom They also converted a potting shed into a structure that can function as a bar and turned part of a detached garage into a bathhouse with a hot tub behind it New gardens and hardscape features designed by the landscape architecture firm Alchemie weave all of the structures togetherTo the owners dismay the construction and landscaping took around two years to complete and cost about as much as the house didWe started building just before Seattle hit overdrive so getting subcontractors was difficult just because it was such a boom time Mr Boyce said Everything got stretched out and became more expensiveBut now that they are finished he said it feels like home Its turned into a place we just dont really want to leaveFor weekly email updates

Chinese firm that owns Grindr the gay dating app to relinquish control over concerns that Beijing could use personal information to blackmail or influence American officials according to people familiar with the situationThe action which is being driven by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States is unusual given that the panel typically investigates mergers that could result in control of an American business by a foreign individual or company judging whether deals could threaten national security This appears to be the first case in which the United States has asserted that foreign control of a social media app could have national security implicationsThe administration has not announced the move which will require that Grindr be sold or explained it But officials familiar with the case which was first reported by Reuters say the concern focused on the potential for the blackmail of American officials or contractors if China threatened to disclose their sexual orientation or track their movements or dating habitsThree years ago a Chinese firm that owns both gaming and credit services businesses Beijing Kunlun Tech Co Ltd a public company listed on the Shenzhen stock exchange bought a  percent stake in Grindr which is based in West Hollywood Calif for  million Early last year it bought the remaining shares for a little over  millionWhile there were news reports about both transactions the United States did not take action to block the acquisitions Since then the United States definition of national security threats has expanded in part over concerns by the Trump administration and lawmakers about Chinas ability to gain access to critical American technologyIt is unclear why the panel known as Cfius acted now more than three years after control of the company switched to Chinese hands And so far there is no public evidence that any information on the app has been used by the Chinese governmentBut Senator Ron Wyden Democrat of Oregon said he along with several other senators asked Cfius to conduct a reviewLast year my office met with a top official from the Treasury Department to express my serious concerns about the national security risks associated with a Chinese company buying Grindr he said in a statement While he said he could not confirm specific actions by Cfius a highly secretive panel it is high time for the administration and Cfius to consider the national security impact of foreign companies acquiring large sensitive troves of Americans private dataCongress handed more power to the panel last year allowing it to examine transactions that fell short of majority control of a company and involved just minority stakes The expansion was an effort to counter Chinese minority investments in Silicon Valley companies that gave investors an early look at emerging technologiesThe Kunlun purchases had never been submitted to Cfius giving the government the leverage to go back in after the sale to try to force a divestment Calls to Kunluns office number were not answered and emails seeking comment were not returnedGrindr has already faced questions about its control and use of personal data The company faced a huge backlash for sharing users HIV status sexual tastes and other intimate personal details with outside software vendors After the data sharing was made public by European researchers in  the company said it would stop sharing HIV data with outside companiesLast year was the first time Cfius appeared to be concerned about the purchase of companies that contained sensitive data The government killed a proposed merger last year between MoneyGram the money transfer firm and Ant Financial a payments company related to the Chinese ecommerce giant AlibabaThe United States has also embarked on a global campaign to block a big Chinese telecom equipment giant Huawei from building the next generation of wireless networks known as G over concerns that it could divert critical data through China or be forced to turn over data running through its networks to Beijing The White House has essentially accused Huawei of being an arm of the Chinese government that can be used for spying or to sabotage communications networks a charge that Huawei has vehemently deniedBut the administrations efforts to control what kind of personal data is available to Chinas intelligence services may have come too late Chinas ministry of state security and other Chinese groups have already been accused of successfully stealing personal data from American databasesThe theft of  million security clearance files from the Office of Personnel Management in  along with similar theft of data from the Anthem insurance networks and Marriott hotels have all been attributed to Chinese actors by American intelligence officials who say they were most likely operating on behalf of the governmentThe files stolen in the  government breach contain far more personal data than the Chinese could probably find on any individual social media site They include work history on sensitive United States projects information about bankruptcies medical conditions relationship histories and any contacts with foreigners The loss of the information forced the CIA to reassign personnel headed to China and was considered among the largest losses of sensitive security information in decades The Obama administration declined to publicly concede that the breach was committed by Chinese intelligence servicesChina has taken steps of its own to limit foreign companies access to its citizens personal information A recently enacted cybersecurity law mandates that user data be stored in the country where it can be kept under the governments control In response to the law Apple said it would open its first data center in China and formed a partnership with a Chinese company to run the center and handle data requests from the governmentBefore the law even came into effect the Chinese government had pressured foreign technology companies to operate servers only within its borders  meaning the data is available to Chinese authorities under Chinese law Amazon and Microsoft have partnered with Chinese firms to offer cloud computing services to Chinese customersThe United States has also pressed China to allow insurance companies and other American firms that control personal data to enter the Chinese market a demand that goes back nearly two decades China has agreed to do so and that agreement is expected to be part of the larger trade deal being negotiated between American and Chinese negotiatorsBut the Grindr case could give the Chinese government an excuse to make its own national security claims if American firms sought to purchase a Chinese insurance company or any of its social media firmsRaymond Zhong contributed reporting from Shenzhen and Michael J de la Merced from LondonAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byMaking yourself inaccessible from time to time is essential to boosting your focusBy Anna GoldfarbWhen David Rock needs to immerse himself in his work he goes offline Being reachable he knows will tank his productivityIn fact Dr Rock the CEO of The Neuroleadership Institute and author of Your Brain at Work was able to write four books during several flights to and from Australia He credits the long stretches of uninterrupted time with granting him the ability to fully concentrate on assembling those book draftsSure not everyone can hop a hour flight to Australia when they need to finish a project But the lesson Dr Rock learned is applicable regardless Making ourselves inaccessible from time to time is essential to boosting our focus A  survey from the American Psychological Association found that being constantly and permanently reachable on an electronic device  checking work emails on your day off continuously cycling through social media feeds responding to text messages at all hours  is associated with higher stress levelsThis phenomenon of always being reachable is what Linda Stone a former Apple and Microsoft executive calls continuous partial attention Unlike multitasking  juggling activities of similar importance that dont require too much cognitive processing  CPA is a state of alertness during which youre motivated by the desire not to miss out on anythingMs Stone who gives lectures and consults on issues relating to technology and attention describes CPA as an alwayson anywhere anytime any place behavior that involves an artificial sense of constant crisis Being distractible  allowing incessant beeps flashes and trills to shatter any semblance of concentration  contributes to a strained lifestyle she said Halfpaying attention to everything means youre not able to fully pay attention to anythingThis kind of task switching comes with a cost Its called attention residue a term established by Sophie Leroy a professor at the Bothell School of Business at the University of Washington In a  study Dr Leroy found that if people transition their attention away from an unfinished task their subsequent task performance will suffer For example if you interrupt writing an email to reply to a text message it will take time to refocus when you turn your attention back to finishing your email That little bit of time of adjusting your focus  the residue  compounds throughout the day As we fragment our attention fatigue and stress increases which negatively affects performanceYou cant positively adapt to stress if youre consistently run down said Paula DavisLaack a stress and resilience expert We know that chronic stress is linked to higher rates of errors safety issues lack of concentration working memory problems and inhibits effective problemsolving and kills attention For many people these are critical tools to effectively do their jobs and rates of errors and safety issues impact a wide range of industries where precision is criticalBesides compromising your ability to be an effective worker being available to everyone at all times is exhausting said Catherine Price author of How to Break Up With Your Phone and the founder of ScreenLife Balance a movement dedicated to helping people create a healthier balance between their online and offline lives We need to intentionally make ourselves unavailable to preserve our own sanityHeres what you can expect when you make yourself less accessible put reasonable boundaries in place and reclaim your timeMs Price suggests trying to be unreachable for short periods of time but she cautions you might feel twitchy and anxious at firstThose are withdrawal symptoms she said Stick with it and within a surprisingly short amount of time the anxiety is likely to shift to a pleasant sense of calmShe doesnt think or expect people to ditch their phones entirely  that would be very impractical and unrealistic  but she does recommend experimenting with taking a hour break once in a while Yes she emphasizes it is possible to do It just requires some advance planningAt the very least she said start leaving your phone behind during certain periods of the day and perhaps establishing nophone zones in your house or workplace Treat it as an experiment Try things and see what makes you feel good she saidA still mind is fertile ground for creative thoughts Being unstimulated gives the brain a chance to explore ideas and create new connections that can break through into our conscious awareness Dr Rock explained Thats why we tend to get so many good ideas as we wake up or take a shower  the brain is usually a blank slate while sudsing upOur Aha moments are literally quiet brain signals said Dr Rock To facilitate more flashes of inspiration make space for these serene moments Being always on and jampacking your schedule with demanding cognitive tasks impedes the number of big ideas youll be able to create Those bright bold ideas are the ones that motivate us and can feel the most rewardingIf you want to think deeply or have any sort of creative insight you must give your brain breathing room Ms Price added Its not wise to always be in intake mode which is what can happen when mindlessly scrolling through emails and social media feeds To form longterm memories you need to create new pathways in the brain a process easily disrupted by distraction Ms Price said Sadly our smartphones are built to distract usMs DavisLaack said she wishes workplaces were more accepting of this need to unplug occasionallyWorking to the extreme is often seen as a badge of honor at work and is highly rewarded she said Organizations bear a lot of the burden to examine values process and cultural issues generally that support the inability to disconnect recharge and recoverWe have literally become addicted to doing stuff all the time and think that downtime is laziness or somehow a missed opportunity to get ahead Ms DavisLaack said Organizations reward this so its reinforced Unfortunately its up to us individually to put those boundaries in placeFor optimal productivity Dr Rock suggests focusing intensely for around  minutes and then indulging in a minute break The brain is not a muscle he said but it does need to rest and replenish like a muscle doesHe also recommends taking a brief nap in the afternoon which has tremendous cognitive benefitsYou wouldnt expect someone to do a physical task like chop wood for hours on end with no break he said Its similar with the brainBecause of an

women safe New regulations should beBy Emily ChangMs Chang an anchor at Bloomberg TV is the author of BrotopiaLike too many women Ive been harassed online The harasser described in explicit detail how he intended to violate me though somehow his threats didnt violate Twitters terms of service Twitter despite my repeated reports did nothing So I did I gradually tightened my privacy settings across Twitter Facebook and Instagram I mostly stopped sharing personal nonworkrelated updates and deleted photos of my children I havent posted new pictures for more than a yearIm a tech journalist so perhaps I am extrasensitive to the dangers of the internet But my concerns are widely shared by other womenSeveral studies have found that women are more concerned about privacy risks online than men and are more likely to keep their profiles private and delete unwanted contacts Female Italian college students are less likely to share their political views and relationship status than men and are more concerned about risks posed by other users and third parties Norwegian women post fewer selfies than Norwegian menIn other words digital privacy is a womens issue We just dont think about it that way or discuss it that way Of course privacy is a concern for everyone but this is also an issue like health care on which women have a particular view Women know for example what consent really means Its not scrolling through seemingly endless terms of service and then checking a box Online consent just as it is with our bodies should be clear informed and a requirement for online platforms These views are shaped by the reality that women experience the internet differently just as the experience of walking down a dark alley or even a busy street is different for women than it is for men One Pew study found that women are far more likely to be sexually harassed online and describe these interactions as extremely upsetting The Department of Justice reports that about  percent of the victims of stalking and cyberstalking are women And so women look over our shoulders online just as we do in real lifeIt isnt just that reallife harassment also shows up online its that the internet isnt designed for women even when the majority of users of some popular applications and platforms are women In fact some features of digital life have been constructed intentionally or not in ways that make women feel less safeFor example you cant easily use Facebooks WhatsApp messaging service without a phone number which many women dont want to share Facebooks chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has promised to build encrypted communication into all its platforms Just as important is giving users the option to make their messages disappear so that if a hostile ex somehow got into your phone there would be nothing to see Even wellmeaning efforts at transparency dont always work that way for women Lyfts car pool service shares the registered names of passengers with everyone else in the car The first name of an incoming passenger flashes in lights across the dashboard a feature intended to let riders know they are in the right car A privacy researcher told me that she once jumped into a Lyft shared ride wearing a sweatshirt with her companys logo The next day she received an email from a male passenger saying I found you Clearly he had been able to use her first name and the name of her company to track her down online What he may have thought was cute she thought was creepy Do I have any control over this interaction the researcher asked You want control over the self youre putting online just like you want control over your body Note to Lyft Some passengers would be safer if they were anonymousWith Congress considering whether to draft new privacy regulations it is important that the specific concerns of women be taken into account now while the rules are being debatedAs technology advances will it continue to blur the lines between public and private Sign up for Charlie Warzels limitedrun newsletter to explore whats at stake and what you can do about itCalifornias new privacy law is a case in point It is a bold piece of legislation but it falls short for women In the event of a data breach for example consumers in California will have the right to sue if certain kinds of personally identifying information like Social Security numbers or drivers license numbers are compromised But that may not include material like intimate emails or explicit photos The current iteration of the law is so murky that its not clear whether Jennifer Lawrence the actress whose nude photos were stolen from her iCloud account in  and made public would have a case against Apple if a similar incident occurred after the law goes into effect next yearCalifornias right to be forgotten also doesnt go as far as Europes new privacy legislation the most sweeping data reform in history Under the California law consumers have the right to delete information they personally provide to companies But if someone else  say an unhappy ex  posted something about me online I would not be able to get that taken down Under Europes new law though I would at least be able to request such a post be removed Although womens groups have defended privacy as it pertains to abortion they havent yet broadly taken up the issue of digital privacy Among the few to do so publicly is a grassroots effort called Catalinas List a backer of the California law Anything that gives big business an upper hand on individual choices is corrupting the idea of personal choice freedom and privacy a cofounder of Catalinas List Bobbi Jo Chavarria told me Weaker federal privacy legislation could eventually override the California law Amazon Facebook Google and Microsoft all contributed money to groups opposing the California law and last year these companies and Apple spent more than  million lobbying Congress on privacy and other issues Tech companies are pushing for what they want as the research shows thats not necessarily what women wantSo what can Americans do First we must elect more women to positions of power who can help write privacy legislation I dont think its a coincidence that two of the top digital policymakers in Europe are women including Margrethe Vestager the European Unions competition commissioner and Elizabeth Denham Britains information commissionerThe law of course will never be as fast as tech companies They should build products and services that respect privacy by design To do that these companies need to hire and consult more women Women hold just  percent of jobs across the tech industry and an even smaller percentage of prime engineering rolesMost important all of us must start thinking about privacy as a feminist issue We cannot wait for womens concerns to be addressed The stakes for us are far too highEmily Chang emilychangtv is an anchor at Bloomberg TV and the author of BrotopiaFollow privacyproject on Twitter

a single clip of this new documentary has been released ahead of its debut today but that has not slowed the buzz behind itWesley I became aware of this movie as it was making its way towards Sundance in JanuaryTape Its probably right now the most talkedabout film at SundanceWhats the point of tape like that There are a few explanations First it alleviates the burden of the guest having to tell the entire story him or herself I could listen to Wesley talk all day but its a lot to ask him to deliver every detail of a complex tale Tape is the ultimate storytelling sidekick Here the tape does the work of explaining how much the world awaited this film  or dreaded its arrival Second the tape deepens our understanding of the reaction and impact around it There really were protests over Leaving

ivory tower nonsenseHeres Kevins responseEd thank you for your note I really appreciate you listening and taking the time to respond Im sure many people in Silicon Valley would agree with you that working with or for the US military is a moral duty We also have a long national tradition of making accommodations for people who oppose war for ethical or religious reasons like the thousands of conscientious objectors who were allowed to perform alternative service during World War II instead of doing combat duty Fun fact My grandfather was one of these people I cant speak for the engineers

including tax cuts and loosened regulations An economic miracle is taking place in the United States  and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars politics or ridiculous partisan

and stealing our intellectual property the theft of American jobs and wealth has come to an end Talks between Washington and Beijing over a compromise are continuingAnd he painted his potential rivals as socialists As Democratic presidential contenders promote policies like Medicare for all Mr Trump tried to paint them as peddlers of dangerous ideas Here in the United States we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country he saidWhat didnt he talk about Trumps speech was notable for what he did not mention including the ballooning federal debt once a centerpiece of the Republican

week even as President Trump was meeting with North Koreas leader in HanoiThe attacks which include efforts to hack into banks utilities and oil and gas companies began in  according to researchers at the cybersecurity company McAfee a time when tensions between North Korea and the United States were flaring But even though both sides have toned down their fiery threats and begun nuclear disarmament talks the attacks persistIn  Mr Trump mocked Kim Jongun as rocket man in a speech at the United Nations while North Korea tested missiles capable of delivering a nuclear warhead to the United States The attacks began soon after that Though the two sides failed to reach an agreement last week Mr Trump struck a conciliatory tone toward his North Korean counterpartThe revelation of North Koreas most recent hacking activity adds new details to the tensions surrounding the summit meeting last week which ended abruptly without any deals After their first meeting about eight months earlier North Korea had agreed to stop testfiring its missilesFor  months they havent tested weapons because of this negotiation but over those same  months they have not stopped their cyber activity said Victor Cha the Korea chairman at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in WashingtonWith the help of an unnamed foreign law enforcement agency the McAfee researchers gained access to one of the main computer servers used by the North Korean hackers to stage their attacksThe McAfee researchers said they watched in real time as the North Koreans attacked the computer networks of more than a hundred companies in the United States and around the globe Last month they expanded their targets to companies in Turkey operating from a block of internet addresses traced to Namibia one of the few countries that still maintains friendly relations with PyongyangThey are very very very active Its been nonstop said Raj Samani McAfees chief scientist Weve seen them hit in excess of  victimsThe exact motive of the attacks was not clear They were wellresearched and highly focused and in many cases aimed at engineers and executives who had broad access to their companies computer networks and intellectual propertyMcAfee which is based in Santa Clara Calif would not name the targets of the attacks and said it would make its finding public Sunday But the firm did provide a map of North Korean hackers targetsThe vast majority were in the United States with the most frequent marks in Houston an oil and gas hub and New York a finance hub Other major targets included London Madrid Tokyo Tel Aviv Rome Bangkok Taipei Seoul and Hong Kong Russia and mainland China two countries that have maintained cordial relations with North Korea were relatively untouchedNorth Korea like the United States and many other countries has long been accused of using hackers to further its national interests In  apparently in retaliation for a movie that mocked Mr Kim North Korean hackers hit Sony Pictures Entertainment They destroyed Sonys computer servers paralyzed the studios operations and eventually leaked embarrassing emails from executives in what would become a playbook for the Russian attacks and leaks of emails ahead of the  electionsNorth Korean hackers have been tied to attacks on banks all around the world for financial gain  a rarity among governmentaffiliated hackers but not surprising for a country ravaged by economic sanctions The WannaCry attack which paralyzed more than  organizations around the globe in  was also traced to North KoreaMr Cha of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said cyberattacks remained the third leg of North Koreas overall military strategy Theyre never going to compete with the United States and South Korea soldier to soldier tank for tank he said So they have moved to an asymmetric strategy of nuclear weapons ballistic missiles and the third leg is cyber that we really didnt become aware of until SonySince the Sony attack McAfees researchers said North Koreas hackers had significantly improved their capabilities They are much better at hiding their tracks and researching their targets And in many of the attacks McAfee witnessed North Korean hackers had done their homeworkThey scoured the Microsoftowned business site LinkedIn for example to find the profiles of industry job recruiters They sent emails that appeared to come from those recruiters accounts often in perfect English promoting job opportunitiesWhen a target clicked on an attachment or link in the email the hackers gained access to the targets computerThe campaign was clearly really well prepared said Christiaan Beek McAfees senior principal engineer and lead scientist It was very well researched and very targeted They knew the individuals they were going for and they drafted emails in such a way that their targets clicked on themThe tools they used to implant malware in the recent attacks which McAfees researchers called Rising Sun because of a reference in the code were also starkly improvedThough the implants shared code with previous North Korean attacks McAfees researchers said the hackers added new functions to lift data off infected machines They also went to great lengths to delete their digital movements and encrypt their trafficMr Beek and Mr Samani said their team at McAfee was able to follow the hackers movements only because of their access to the North Koreans server The more code we saw the more links we could see to more and more attacks Mr Beek saidConsidering other recent North Korean hacking campaigns that McAfees researchers have tracked  notably against the  Winter Olympics and a separate spate of attacks on banks last year  Mr Beek said North Korea showed no signs of slowing this activitySecurity experts said the attacks would have to be addressed at some point if the two countries should continue talksTheir very aggressive cyberactivity will have to be addressed in future discussions Mr Cha said They are extremely active and its clear to me at least theyve stopped missile testing because of the ongoing negotiations but theyre not stopping in cyberBecause of an

newsMachines are more than ever controlled by software not humans Occasionally it goes fatally wrongOn March   people died when an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing  Max  jet crashed Five months earlier another crash of the same model of airplane killed  people There are indications that software intended to prevent the jets from stalling may have played a role in both accidentsReporting by The New York Times suggests that the software didnt receive a detailed review by the Federal Aviation Administration before it entered use Under new rules the agency delegated much of the responsibility to Boeing If the software was at fault and the problem did slip through the regulatory net it raises questions about how safetycritical technology is vettedThose questions will become more important over the next few yearsA year ago an Arizona woman was struck and killed by one of Ubers autonomous cars The vehicles autonomy systems failed to brake as did the safety driver behind the wheelCompanies like Uber and Waymo along with most of the auto industry expect autonomous cars to proliferate over the next decade Such advances arent limited to cars  they will further automate everything from air travel to food delivery They are built on technologies like artificial intelligence that will make splitsecond decisions for humansThe Boeing software was designed to perform a simple task Nudge the airplanes nose down based on sensor readings if a stall was anticipated As harder tasks are handed to software the stakes riseAs you create more advanced AI systems the harm that can result from them failing can be really large said Jade Leung a researcher at Oxford Universitys Center for the Governance of Artificial IntelligenceBut increasing the complexity of systems makes checking them more difficult Hardware from chips to special sensors can be difficult to test And it can be difficult for humans to understand how some AI algorithms make decisionsMs Leung said regulators needed to be more aware of tailend risks  the highly unlikely but catastrophic events that could occur if something malfunctioned That might mean introducing more conservative rules that relax as technology matures ideally developed in tandem with technologists who understand deeply how the systems workVerifying the performance and safety of software is a really really hard technical challenge Ms Leung said Nonetheless its a challenge that has to be addressedWhen a company spends billions on worldleading digital infrastructure it naturally wants to wring every last cent of revenue out of it Thats partly what is driving Googles new Stadia gaming service announced on TuesdayGoogles pitch is straightforward Think of it as Netflix for gaming As long as they have a fast internet connection users can pay a subscription to play highdefinition games akin to what theyd find on current topend consoles on any computer phone or tabletThe companys promise that its cloud infrastructure makes that achievable It will add racks of gamingspecific chips to existing server farms to essentially give people an ondemand remote gaming computer And Google officials believe that since most users are now so close to its pervasive hardware lag wont be a problem  an issue that held back earlier game streaming platforms like the nowdefunct OnLiveGoogle is not alone in the push into what some people see as the future of gaming Microsoft had already announced that it planned to offer a trial of a similar service for Xbox consoles computers and mobile devices this year Amazon which owns the gamewatching service Twitch is widely believed to be planning something similar built on its Amazon Web Services cloud infrastructureThose three companies happen to be the worlds largest cloud

companies invest in automation because the tax code encourages it not because robots are more productiveBy Eduardo PorterMr Porter is an economics writer for The TimesWhen Bill Gates floated the idea of imposing a tax on robots a couple of years ago Lawrence Summers a former top economic adviser to President Barack Obama called the Microsoft cofounder profoundly misguided How do you even define a robot to tax it And taxing innovation is a sure way to make a country poorer Europe has also rejected the idea In  the European Parliament soundly defeated a draft motion proposed by its committee on legal affairs that recommended considering a tax on the owners of robots to fund retraining programs for workers displaced by the machines and shore up the finances of their social security system And yet properly constructed a tax on automation may not be as destructive as it sounds South Korea the most robotized country in the world instituted a robot tax of sorts in  when it reduced the tax deduction on business investments in automation There are two sound arguments for taxing robots  The easiest is this Governments need the money In the United States income taxes account for half of the  trillion collected every year by the Internal Revenue Service payroll taxes account for another thirdImagine that the fears about robots taking over jobs actually come true Two years ago the McKinsey Global Institute found that the job functions that are most susceptible to automation in the United States account for  percent of the activities in the economy and  trillion worth of wages The institute estimates half of todays work activities could be automated by  If that happens hundreds of billions of tax dollars would be lost every yearAnd at the same time that the rise of robots shrinks government tax revenue the fallout from automation will place more demands on government services The United States will probably need more money to retrain workers bumped from their jobs by automation to give them a shot at a new one Welfare rolls could grow as millions of workers are displaced to the bottom end of the service economy where wages are low and robots are scarce To afford any kind of government services in the robot era governments will have to find something else to tax Why not the robots themselvesThe case for taxing robots is stronger when you consider that a lot of automation these days is not deployed to enhance economic productivity Instead many businesses are investing in automation simply because the tax code is urging them to do soThe purpose of taxing robots is not simply to stop them from killing jobs It is to level the playing field to ensure that investments in automation raise productivity The tax system incentivizes automation even in cases where it is not otherwise efficient wrote Ryan Abbott and Bret Bogenschneider of the University of Surrey School of Law in Britain in an analysis of tax policy toward automation in the United States and other rich countries The vast majority of tax revenues are now derived from labor income so firms avoid taxes by eliminating employeesDaron Acemoglu an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology explains that automation often produces benefits of dubious value to the business itself More important he suggests that the investment in technologies designed to replace workers has come at the expense of alternative investments that might find more productive uses for human labor This may help explain the sluggishness in overall productivity growth across the economy One powerful reason that businesses deploy so many robots despite their sometimes questionable contribution to the bottom line is that automation is subsidized Subsidies induce firms to substitute capital for labor even when this is not socially costsaving though it is privately beneficial because of the subsidy Professor Acemoglu and his coauthor Pascual Restrepo wrote The tax subsidies to robots are varied For starters machines dont incur payroll taxes which are used to fund Social Security and Medicare For every worker replaced by a robot the employer saves on payroll taxes The federal tax code and many state governments allow companies to use accelerated depreciation for capital investments which allows them to deduct the cost of their robots faster than they could deduct the wage of the payroll of the workers they replaceThis means that eliminating the tax break for robots would not hurt economic growth It would in fact improve economic efficiency By subsidizing capital investment the government is encouraging businesses to use capital when they otherwise would not to replace workers with machines That might be rational for the individual business reaping the tax benefits But as Professor Acemoglu put it across the economy this kind of spending on automation shows up as a productivity lossWhats more curbing businesses pumpedup enthusiasm for robots might help mitigate the broader social costs of automation which has flushed so many workers into unproductive occupations where cheap labor still holds an edge and knocked many more out of the labor force entirelyWhat is the best way to change the tax incentives for robots One solution would be to disallow accelerated depreciation for investments in automation Professors Abbott and Bogenschneider propose that businesses with high levels of worker automation could have their tax depreciation automatically reduced beyond a certain thresholdBusinesses that use robots to replace workers could also be required to cover the payroll taxes of workers knocked out by automation as proposed by the technology analyst William Meisel A tax calibrated according to the ratio of a companys profit to its employee compensation could match the wage taxes avoided by automation Companies deploying robots could also be required to pay some kind of fee just as employers that lay off workers must subsequently pay more into the unemployment insurance systemIn practice taxing automation is likely to be difficult Taxing robots would first of all require defining what robots are Would a robot tax also apply to say machine tools Regardless of where we drew the line a robot tax could distort investment decisions in other waysNonetheless there is a wide gap between the way that the tax code treats human labor and the way it treats automation The hole could be filled by reducing tax subsidies on capital investment altogether Taxes on labor could also be reduced We may not want to tax innovation but there is no reason to subsidize investments that are designed merely to take away jobs At the very least a tax on robots would force businesses to think harder about when and where to deploy themEduardo Porter an

byBitsBy Jamie CondliffeHi Im Jamie Condliffe Greetings from London Heres a look at the weeks tech newsThere is little as fashionable in  as the desire to curb Big Techs power But knowing how far regulators should go in putting limits on Silicon Valleys largest companies isnt straightforwardAt one extreme there are calls to break up Big Tech  Senator Elizabeth Warren grabbed headlines during the week when she called for just that Ms Warren a Massachusetts Democrat argued that companies shouldnt offer their own products on platforms they controlled like Apples selling apps on its App Store  something Spotify called out to European regulators on Wednesday She also said she would roll back anticompetitive acquisitions such as Facebooks takeovers of Instagram and WhatsAppHer pitch isnt perfect as The New York Timess Kevin Roose pointed out  its too generic misses easy wins and overlooks some big issues But it is a bold inspiring rally cry for Big Techs biggest criticsAt the other end of the spectrum tech companies Ideally the likes of Facebook and Google would love to perpetually operate in the lightly regulated world that helped them grow so quickly But even Mark Zuckerberg Facebooks chief executive acknowledged that it was inevitable that there will be some regulation when he testified to the House Energy and Commerce Committee in AprilTheres plenty of room between those extremes Take for example a report published Wednesday by the British government which called for an overhaul of antitrust policies for Big Tech Its main proposal that a new regulator identify companies with strategic market status then block some activities  such as promoting their own products or services in search results over those belonging to competitors hello GoogleThat the reports authors say is a more probusiness and proconsumer solution than changing antitrust law to drive breakup of businessesSo whos right Mr Zuckerberg at least when he says regulatory intervention is inevitable Theres strong bipartisan support for such regulation As for where a line should be drawn thats harder to sayBreaking up big companies isnt easy Its expensive and takes a long time And it doesnt always go to plan The last notable attempt to do so when a judge ruled two decades ago that Microsoft be cleaved for having violated antitrust law was overturned on appeal So Ms Warren could have her work cut out for herBut it may ultimately become a question of balancing ambition with need Is it better to gamble on breaking up big companies or guarantee that new rules curb some of their behavior Thats something that lawmakers are going to have to wrestle withWhen OpenAI was founded three years ago it had a huge goal to build artificial intelligence software that was as capable as the human brain Its founders said that because it was a nonprofit with noble ambitions  it had  billion in funding from backers to pay its way  the public could trust it to build that socalled general artificial intelligenceOnly  billion doesnt go far with goals like that Huge computing resources and big salaries to attract talent burn through cash Actually it turns out some profits might be usefulSo Wired reported Open AI announced that it was changing its business model To keep up with Facebook and Google it created a OpenAI LP a company that can take money from investors that need to return a profit like venture funds That will make it easier to raise funds Down the line it might monetize some of the technology it develops But the company decided to cap the returns that investors will see  to  for every dollar investedOne way to think of that figure is that OpenAI deems a times return to be an ethical margin on building a general AI  enough to make it a feasible endeavor but not so much as to tar it with the Big Tech brush That reasoning clearly holds if you inhabit Silicon Valley But it will be interesting to see if that profit cap is enough to put everyone at easeOn March   Tim BernersLee proposed an idea for linking digital files that his boss Mike Sendall called vague but exciting It ultimately became the World Wide Web and  years later were left with much to love  and hate  about its existenceAt an event at Londons Science Museum on Tuesday to mark the webs passage into its fourth decade Mr BernersLee was asked what it might look like in another  years Heres what he said Its not I think for us to try and guess Look at whats happened over the last  years The web has changed really dramatically and a lot of that we couldnt have predicted What we can do is we can say what web we want We want a web which is open We want a web which is royaltyfree We want a web which is discriminationfreeWorthy goals And in an article he wrote this past week Mr BernersLee laid out steps that may be required to ensure they happen Governments must translate laws and regulations for the digital age They must ensure markets remain competitive innovative and open Companies must do more to ensure their pursuit of shortterm profit is not at the expense of human rights democracy scientific fact or public safety Platforms and products must be designed with privacy diversity and security in mind  And most important of all citizens must hold companies and governments accountableThirty years on Mr Sendalls analysis might apply equally well to this proposal tooElon

Grant is an organizational psychologistIm really sorry I didnt say hi make eye contact or acknowledge your presence in any way when you waved to me in the hallway the other day Its nothing personal I just have too many people trying to greet me these days and I cant respond to everyoneThat sounds ridiculous right You would never snub a colleague trying to strike up a conversation Yet when you ignore a personal email thats exactly what youve done digital snubberyYes were all overwhelmed with email One recent survey suggested that the average Americans inbox has  unread messages But volume isnt an excuse for not replying Ignoring email is an act of incivilityIm too busy to answer your email really means Your email is not a priority for me right now Thats a popular justification for neglecting your inbox Its full of other peoples priorities But theres a growing body of evidence that if you care about being good at your job your inbox should be a priorityWhen researchers compiled a huge database of the digital habits of teams at Microsoft they found that the clearest warning sign of an ineffective manager was being slow to answer emails Responding in a timely manner shows that you are conscientious  organized dependable and hardworking And that matters In a comprehensive analysis of people in hundreds of occupations conscientiousness was the single best personality predictor of job performance It turns out that people who are rude online tend to be rude offline tooIm not saying you have to answer every email Your brain is not just sitting there waiting to be picked If senders arent considerate enough to do their homework and ask a question youre qualified to answer you dont owe them anything backHow do you know if an email youve received  or even more important one youre considering writing  doesnt deserve a response After all sending an inappropriate email can be as rude as ignoring a polite one I have a few general rules You should not feel obliged to respond to strangers asking you to share their content on social media introduce them to your more famous colleagues spend hours advising them on something theyve created or jump on a call this afternoon If someone you barely know emails you a dozen times a month and is always asking you to do something for him you can ignore those emails guiltfree Along these lines the last time I made the mistake of admitting in this newspaper that I believe in being responsive to emails I got a deluge of messages One reader even wrote I just wanted to test you to find out if its true So this time let me be clear Im not writing this article as a personal note to your inbox so it doesnt require a personal reply to mineWe all need to set boundaries People shouldnt be forced to answer endless emails outside work hours  which is why some companies have policies against checking emails on nights and weekends Some people I know tell their colleagues theyll be on email from  to  am and  to  pm each day but not in between If its not an emergency no one should expect you to respond right awaySpending hours a day answering emails can stand in the way of getting other things done One recent study shows that on days when managers face heavy email demands they make less progress toward their goals and end up being less proactive in communicating their vision and setting expectationsBut that same study shows that email load takes a toll only if its not central to your job And lets face it These days email is central to most jobs What we really need to do is to make email something we think carefully about before sending and therefore feel genuinely bad ignoringWhatever boundaries you choose dont abandon your inbox altogether Not answering emails today is like refusing to take phone calls in the s or ignoring letters in the s Email is not household clutter and youre not Marie Kondo PingYour inbox isnt just a list of other peoples tasks Its where other people help you do your job It allows you to pose questions with a few keystrokes instead of spending the whole day on the phone and its vital to gathering information that you cant easily find in a Google searchMy inbox is other peoples priorities bothers me as a social scientist but also as a human being Your priorities should include other people and their priorities Its common courtesy to engage with people who are thoughtful in reaching outThis isnt just about doing unto others as youd have them do unto you Clearing out your inbox can jumpstart your own productivity One set of experiments showed that if youre behind on a task youll finish it faster if youre busy because you know you need to use your time efficiently As a writer I like to start the morning by answering a few emails  it helps me get into a productive rhythm of deep work If you think you have too many emails maybe you just dont have enoughEveryone occasionally misses an email But if youre habitually too busy to answer legitimate emails theres a problem with your process It sends a signal that youre disorganized  or that you just dont careIf youre just hopelessly behind on your inbox at least set up an autoreply giving people another channel where they can reach you A Slack channel Twitter A phone number Postit notes Carrier pigeonRemember that a short reply is kinder and more professional than none at all If you have too much on your plate come clean I dont have the bandwidth to add this If its not your expertise just say so Sorry this isnt in my wheelhouse And if you want to say no just say noWe can all learn from

offerings of Lyft and Pinterest will give investors the chance to buy into young fastgrowing companies led by founders with ambitious visionsBut to get a piece of that action investors will have to give up something big an equal say in how the companies are runLyft a rideshare company and Pinterest a social media network will deprive their new shareholders of full voting rights when they go public in the coming days and weeks Both companies plan to issue shares to a small number of insiders that have far more voting power than the shares everyone else will ownThe use of two classes of shares has become increasingly popular among Silicon Valley startups going public But such share structures have also prompted a backlash Big investors corporategovernance experts and even some tech executives warn that the issuance of supervoting shares undermines the system of accountability that has long been a pillar of public stock marketsStill the Lyft and Pinterest offerings show that the desire to retain control after going public remains strongBoth Pinterest and Lyft are issuing two classes of stock one that gives its holders  votes each and another owned by outside investors that will have one vote eachIn Lyfts case the two founders Logan Green and John Zimmer will control  percent of the companys voting power while holding just under  percent of the overall shares Pinterest has not yet disclosed numbers needed to do a similar breakdown Google opted for a dualclass structure as it went public in  when it was fairly unusual for tech companies to do so Facebook issued shares that gave control to its founders in its  IPO Snap a social media company sold shares to the public in  with no voting rights which prompted an outcry But that hasnt slowed their adoption Last year nearly twothirds of technology companies going public had more than one class of shares compared with a quarter five years earlier according to data from DealogicAnd its not just technology companies that have embraced maintaining control Levi Strauss which went public last week has shares that put most of the voting power in the hands of its founders descendants And some media companies The New York Times Company included have special shares that give control to their holdersUber may buck this trend though The ridesharing company is preparing to make its public market debut this year and is expected to do so with one class of stockAs owners of a company shareholders expect to have some sway over management Full voting rights give them a greater voice in whos on the board and how much executives get paid and on big decisions like whether to sell the company Diminishing public holders voting rights can give insiders too much power and insulate executives who make poor decisions Strong boards as well as the looming threat of activist investors do a lot to assure top executives are responsive says Glenn Kelman chief executive of Redfin an online real estate brokerage The feeling that I serve at the pleasure of the board that it is a privilege to work at Redfin is fundamental to this company and the best of business culture he saidIts hard to say definitively whether companies with unequal voting rights perform better or worse over time Google has grown strongly over the years but so have Apple Amazon and Microsoft which dont give special control to insiders Viacoms stock has done poorly while CBSs has done quite well Sumner M Redstone with the help of his daughter Shari Redstone controls both companies through voting shares Much also depends on the type of control a company grants Robert J Jackson Jr a commissioner at the Securities and Exchange Commission has cited analysis showing that companies that give control to insiders in perpetuity ended up with lower valuations on the stock market than those that planned to get rid of unequal voting rights after a certain periodThe question of control may become crucial when a company gets into trouble Mark Zuckerberg Facebooks chief executive faltered in his response to abuse of the companys network and data Shareholder advisory groups last year pressed for changes that they said would improve governance including setting up a special risk committee on the board but they did not get the necessary votes  Mr Zuckerberg enjoys the protection of powerful voting shares Facebook did not respond to a request for commentPerhaps the biggest is that they can shield executives from pressures to bolster a companys performance in the near term and give them more freedom to make investments that take time to pay off Google has made that argumentOf course it is possible for companies that dont issue special controlling shares to shrug off the shorttermism of the stock market Amazon has plowed significant sums into new businesses for years and is among the most valuable companies in the world But companies at a vulnerable stage in their development may benefit from giving control to their leaders as they pursue their visions for their companies Lyft for instance is planning big investments in selfdriving vehicle technology and the companys stock may suffer if they dont immediately bear fruit And though Facebooks controlling shares may have helped set the stage for its stumbles the arrangement may also have helped the company respond Since the scandals Facebook has increased its spending to safeguard its network Wall Street analysts have at times questioned the need for such costs but Mr Zuckerberg can mostly ignore them because of the voting power in his handsSome efforts to address the use of highvoting shares have focused on how long these classes of shares exist Critics oppose arrangements that allow the holders to keep control until they die or those that allow the shares to be passed on to descendants These create what Mr Jackson the SEC commissioner has called corporate royaltyInstead of granting longterm or perpetual control a few companies have adopted structures that convert controlling shares into ordinary shares after a certain number of years But this approach has failed to gain traction In the three years through  only  percent of the IPOs with special controlling shares had a provision that allow their superior voting power to expire after a certain period according to a New York Times analysis of data provided by the Council of Institutional Investors a group that has criticized unequal voting rightsLyfts controlling shares wont lose any of their power over time but the company has attempted to bolster its corporate governance by having an independent chairman Other companies have taken this step including Snap but it hasnt been enough to satisfy critics of unequal share classes A lot of companies think an independent chair is a good idea but is that person going to last forever Mr Jackson said Is there anything to stop them from removing the independent chairPinterest has a sevenyear time limit but it only kicks in if the holders of the highvoting shares own less than half the shares they had just before IPO I would not count that as a true timebased sunset said Andrew Winden a fellow at Stanford

writing to you from wintry New York City as the government shutdown increases financial pressure on federal workers and the tech elites jet off to Davos Switzerland to hobnob at the World Economic ForumFor the last few years the forum has been heralding the Fourth Industrial Revolution Thats the idea that todays digital innovations are generating entire new industries  in much the way electricity enabled the mass production of the Model T Ford in the early th centuryBut a provocative new book The Age of Surveillance Capitalism by Shoshana Zuboff a professor emerita at the Harvard Business School offers a more sobering counternarrativePublished on Tuesday the book argues that digital services developed by the likes of Google and Facebook should not be viewed as the latest iteration of industrialization Instead Dr Zuboff writes they represent a new and problematic market form that trades in predicting and influencing human behaviorSurveillance capitalism has taken human experience specifically private human experience and unilaterally claimed it as something to be bought and sold in the marketplace Dr Zuboff told me during a visit to The Timess office This new kind of marketplace trades in behavioral futures Its like a form of derivative But its about usYet most of us are not aware that platforms like Google and Facebook may track and analyze our every search location like video photo post and punctuation mark the better to try to sway us she saidIn fact a new study on Facebook from the Pew Research Center illustrates how opaque this behavior marketplace can be to consumersThe study my colleague Sapna Maheswari writes reported that about threefourths of Facebook users were unaware that the social network maintained lists of their personal interests such as their political leanings for advertisers And about half of users who looked at their ad preferences  the Facebook pages displaying these details  said they were uncomfortable with the companys creating lists of categories about themThe technologies that power the behavior speculation market of course have spread far beyond online adsThey enable auto insurers to surveil drivers and offer discounts based on their driving performance They allow workplace wellness programs to charge higher health insurance premiums to employees who decline to wear fitness trackers They helped Kremlinlinked groups mount political influence campaigns on Facebook although as my colleague John Herrman pointed out this past week we have yet to learn how effective those campaigns wereThe flashtrading in human behavioral data was not inevitableIn her book Dr Zuboff describes how Google in its early days used the keywords that people typed in to improve its search engine even as it paid scant attention to the collateral data  like users keyword phrasing click patterns and spellings  that came with it Pretty soon however Google began harvesting this surplus information along with other details like users webbrowsing activities to infer their interests and target them with adsThe model was later adopted by FacebookThe companies pivot  from serving to surveilling their users  pushed Google and Facebook to harvest more and more data Dr Zuboff writes In doing so the companies sometimes bypassed privacy settings or made it difficult for users to opt out of datasharingWe saw these digital services were free and we thought you know Were making a reasonable tradeoff with giving them valuable data Dr Zuboff told me But now thats reversed Theyve decided that were free that they can take our experience for free and translate it into behavioral data And so we are just the source of raw materialOf course tech companies tend to bristle at the word surveillance They associate it with government spying on individuals  not with their own snooping on users and trying to sway them at scaleWhen organizations do surveillance people dont have control over that Mark Zuckerberg Facebooks chief said in April during a Senate hearing on Cambridge Analytica the voterprofiling company that improperly harvested the data of millions of Facebook users But on Facebook everything that you share you have control overSurveillance however simply means observation or supervision often with the intent of channeling the surveilled in a particular direction As Dr Zuboffs book points out that is at the core of Facebooks panopticon of a business modelIn other news Microsoft pledged nearly  million in loans to help build affordable housing in the Seattle area The money

managed to make a finding that could be worldchanging  and its kind of terrifyingIts possible to record the subtle sounds of a DNA synthesis machine working in a lab and then reverseengineer whatever genetic materials the machine is makingIn other words its possible to hack such a machine by in effect listening to itThe idea for the project said Mohammad Al Faruque an associate professor of electrical engineering and computer science at UCI stemmed from his previous work stealing blueprints for things printed by a D printerIf you can eavesdrop on a machine you can understand what its making he said And with the D printer we demonstrated thatBut if what youre stealing is a genetic blueprint the stakes are much higher It could be health information or pharmaceuticals  or the recipe for a biological weaponPhilip Brisk a UC Riverside associate professor of computer science and engineering said that because Microsoft was working on DNA data storage the finding could have implications for information securityAnd William Grover a UC Riverside assistant professor of bioengineering said that while not everybody has a D printer or a DNA synthesizer lots of people have Alexas or Google HomesEverybody makes noises in their daytoday business which can be vulnerable to sidechannel attacks he said And medical machines like the ones in health care offices also make noiseStill before you get the urge to wrap your house in tinfoil team members said the research was encouragingFirst Mr Al Faruque said as engineering as a discipline undergoes a paradigm shift research is the result of a new kind of collaboration that will be necessary to solve increasingly multifaceted problems The team for example needed bioengineering experts as well as computer engineersWe had the right grouping of players he saidSecond doing research that highlights vulnerabilities makes it possible to design products with solutions in mindMr Brisk said that right now cost

violations in the online advertising market continuing its efforts to rein in the worlds biggest technology companiesThe fine worth about  billion is the third against Google by the European Union since  reinforcing the regions position as the worlds most aggressive watchdog of an industry with an increasingly powerful role in society and the global economy The regulators said Google had violated antitrust rules by imposing unfair terms on companies that used its search bar on their websites in EuropeEuropes regulatory approach was once criticized as unfairly focusing on technology companies from the United States but is now viewed as a potential global model as governments question the influence of Silicon Valley Europe is at the forefront of a broad debate about the role of tech platforms like Apple Amazon Facebook and Google and whether their size and power hurt competitionWith the announcement on Wednesday the European fines against Google total roughly  billion euros or  billion But the bloc has not received any of the money yet Google is appealing the earlier decisions and is mulling whether to appeal the most recent rulingGoogle has cemented its dominance in online search adverts and shielded itself from competitive pressure by imposing anticompetitive contractual restrictions on thirdparty websites Margrethe Vestager Europes top antitrust watchdog said in a statement This is illegal under EU antitrust rulesThe fine centers on contracts that license the use of Googles search bar on websites run by newspapers blogs travel services and other companies European regulators said the operators of the thirdparty websites using Googles search bar had been required to display a disproportionate number of text ads from Googles own advertising services over competing digital advertising companiesThe practice regulators said undercut competitors such as Microsoft and Yahoo that were trying to challenge Google in searchThere was no reason for Google to include these restrictive clauses in its contracts except to keep its rivals out of the market Ms Vestager said at a news conference in Brussels She said the ruling covered  to  when Google stopped the practicesEuropes actions against Silicon Valley are influencing policy debates around the world but some critics question the overall effectiveness of the penaltiesThe European Union spent a decade investigating Google a slow and deliberate process during which the companys business and power continued to grow Annual revenue at Googles parent company Alphabet reached  billion last year compared with  billion a decade earlier On Wednesday Google shares rose  percentThe Google cases highlight a larger question policymakers face in overseeing the digital economyAs it becomes increasingly clear that antitrust fines or afterthefact remedies are not enough to bring vibrant competition to the market governments will need to move to deeper tech sector regulation to remedy

updates to give more visibility to rivals in EuropeThe case is the last of three investigations the European Commission has pursued against Google which has headquarters in Mountain View CalifLast year Ms Vestager fined Google a record  billion for using its ownership of the Android mobile operating system to unfairly undercut rivals in the mobile phone market a decision that also forced the company to change how it bundled its apps on smartphones In  the company was fined  billion euros for unfairly favoring its own shopping services over those of rivalsThe two previous rulings have not had a big impact on Googles financial health but they have forced the tech giant to adjust some business practicesAfter the Android ruling last year Google for the first time began charging handset makers to preinstall Gmail Google Maps and other popular applications for Android devices in the European UnionPerhaps in an attempt to head off additional inquiries Google announced a number of further changes to services across Europe on Wednesday after rivals complained that it continued to benefit from anticompetitive business practicesFor the first time the company said it will ask Android phone users in Europe if they want to switch to a web browser and search engine not owned by Google To allow more competition when customers shop with Google it will give other shopping sites more prominence in its search results the company also said Google said it would do the same with local search queries in Europe such as when a person searches for a restaurant a move that could help companies like TripAdvisor and OpenTableOutside of its review of practices by Google and others the European Union has adopted tough new privacy rules that many countries outside Europe now view as a template Regulators here have also investigated tech companies tax practices and called for more scrutiny of artificial intelligenceThe decision on Wednesday against Google will be one of the final major antitrust rulings in the fiveyear term of Ms Vestager whose crackdown on Silicon Valley while competition commissioner has made her a minor celebrity in the oftenstaid world of European politicsMs Vestager has expressed openness to serving another term as the blocs top antitrust watchdog but she is also considered a contender to become president of the European Commission the most powerful executive position in the European Union Her future will depend in part on the outcome of European parliamentary elections in MayEven with her possible departure pressure on the technology industry is not easingThe European Union is expected to adopt new copyright regulations as early as next week that would impose restrictions to stop unlicensed content like music and videos from being shared on tech platforms like Google and Facebook Another proposal tries to block the sharing of hate speech and extremist content a policy that some critics say could lead to censorshipAt the same time regulators across Europe are pursuing several lines of inquiryMs Vestagers office announced last year that Amazon was under investigation for its treatment of independent sellers who use its website to reach customersApple which in  was ordered to pay Ireland  billion in back taxes is now under scrutiny for its App Store policies Facebook is facing separate inquiries related to its business practices and handling of user data Googles advertising practices are also being monitored by privacy advocates who are urging regulators to begin a new investigation for violating privacy rightsBusinesses and consumers they depend on platforms to get the best out of digitization Ms Vestager said Illegal behavior in these cases is a very serious affairAn earlier version of this article

painstakingly preserved in a video archive In the age of YouTube and cloud storage is it worth anythingCreditCreditVincent Tullo for The New York TimesSupported byBy Alex VadukulWhat you need to know to start the day Get New York Today in your inboxTheres a small apartment on th Street in Hamilton Heights that contains one of the most peculiar videotape collections in New York The dusty VHS archive fills a vast library that contains the analog history of a sport  cassettes with recordings of over  boxing matches that span  yearsIt was the lifes work of Bela Szilagyi a classical pianist and passionate fight enthusiast who started the collection in  when he taped a featherweight title match on a Quasar videocassette recorder Mr Szilagyi died in  at  years old and his wife a softspoken piano teacher became the collections archivistOn a recent Sunday night Elizabeth Szilagyi  commenced her ritual in the living room She poured herself a glass of red wine put on her reading glasses and sat in front of her TV with a notepad in hand to record a welterweight fight at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles She ate a salad while taking notes about the match for the information card that gets filed in the archive The bell rang and the boxers marched toward each otherThe fights have gotten boring now she said Everything is soft and controlledThe fighters traded blowsPacquiao came back recently but hes past his prime she said I always liked De La Hoya He looked innocent but he knew what he was doingOne fighter got stung on the jaw with an uppercut Ms Szilagyi jotted down the detail in her notepadHes over she said The ref is going to stop it Too bad Hes a good fighterMs Szilagyi ejected a disc from a recorder  the archive transitioned to DVD a few years ago  and scribbled some information onto it before slipping it away into a shelf These days the collection rarely receives visitors and dust has grown thick across its cassette boxesShe held a framed photograph of her husband Bela smiling beside Muhammad Ali Before he died he told me The collection is going on forever It has to go on she said But he left that for me to sort out Last year Ms Szilagyi made the anguished decision to wind down her duties as an archivist and try to sell the collectionIve decided this cant be the rest of my life anymore she said If the collection is here hes still here But he left me with an albatross and I just dont have more to give I think hed understand Everyone has said I need to move on Ive told them Ill stop when Im ready Now its time to let goMs Szilagyis attempts to free herself of the collection have proved difficult however and shes struggled to find a market for the videotapes in the YouTube era For decades the archive filled a niche in the boxing world operating as a wordofmouth videotape rental service for networks needing archival footage fighters wanting to study opponents and fight buffs seeking obscure bouts but that business has dried out in recent yearsShes been approaching museums auction houses and sports historians about purchasing the collection she said but interest has been muted Im hoping to get a good number but at this point Im open to anything she said I cant get away from it I cant not see it I cant leave without thinking of it It has a life of its own nowBela Szilagyi was a celebrated concert pianist and his love of boxing made for a poetic contrast that people remarked on his whole life As a child he played at Carnegie Hall and then studied at Juilliard and he would listen to fights on the radio as a reward from the rigors of practice Mary Elizabeth Brett met him in  when she studied with him On one of their first dates he took her to a fight at Madison Square Garden I remember if you sat too close to the ring youd end up with red spots on your clothes she said They married in  and toured as an act that performed classical piano duetsMr Szilagyis collection started humbly enough He recorded the first tape in  Danny Little Red Lopez versus Robert Castanon But he soon had grander visions seeing himself as a curator of boxing history He began taping every fight he could and typing up reviews of each bout When Buster Douglas knocked out Mike Tyson in  Bela wrote a breathless dispatch Douglas has stood the boxing world on its head and now calls the shots he wrote Was it a fluke or is Tyson finished A CLASSIC FIGHTMs Szilagyi sometimes worried about his hobby Here is the man I love she said I wondered Is this what my marriage is going to look like for the rest of my lifeBy the mids word had spread about the collection and promoters fight fans and networks were calling the Szilagyi apartment for tapes A rental service Captain Video Boxing was founded Their clients Ms Szilagyi said included promoters like Don King and the teams of fighters like Evander Holyfield Mike Tyson and Oscar De La HoyaTeddy Atlas who helped train Mike Tyson as an amateur remembered relying on the archive Everyone used Captain Video he said If I wanted to see how a fighter was in the ring Id call them to get the tape If I was training a fighter wed get the tape to look at opponents He added Its relevance has been diminished with the passing of time Now its a thing that represents a mans love for boxingMr Szilagyi died in  and a mix of classical musicians and boxing industry personalities attended his funeral By that point his collection was becoming increasingly obsolete Just about every fight was available online and you didnt have to trek up to Hamilton Heights and find a working VCRToday Ms Szilagyi still has a few loyal customers who rent tapes she said including an old Atlantic City matchmaker and a construction worker in the Bronx Her youngest daughter Anda  grew up around the collection and helped record fights when her parents were awayThis has all been part of a grieving process for her It was never just about the tapes Anda said But its time for her to live her own life again Shes not just a widow Shes much more than that Shes an amazing pianist and teacherThe other night as Ms Szilagyi recorded a match a fighter was knocked out She put on her reading glasses and dutifully jotted KO into her notes After taking a sip of wine she said that she still senses her husbands presence in the apartment When theres a big fight on  and only then  the light above my TV turns on and flickers she said I think thats Bela saying helloShe doesnt know what the fate of the collection will be The offers shes received have been miserly she said and shes suspicious it will get poorly taken care of I want to get rid of it but its very important to me it ends up in the right hands she said It will be hard Like he died again At least it would be gone She admitted briefly considering a drastic measure What if she just tossed the videotapes out onto the streetI dont think I could do that she said That would be cruel Bela would come back That light would start going off like crazyAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported bymatterDNA is spelled out with four letters or bases Researchers have now built a system with eight It may hold clues to the potential for life elsewhere in the universe and could also expand our capacity to store digital data on EarthBy Carl ZimmerIn  the chemist Steven A Benner sat down with some colleagues and a notebook and sketched out a way to expand the alphabet of DNA He has been trying to make those sketches real ever sinceOn Thursday Dr Benner and a team of scientists reported success in a paper published in Science they said they have in effect doubled the genetic alphabet Natural DNA is spelled out with four different letters known as bases  A C G and T Dr Benner and his colleagues have built DNA with eight bases  four natural and four unnatural They named their new system Hachimoji DNA hachi is Japanese for eight moji for letterCrafting the four new bases that dont exist in nature was a chemical tourdeforce They fit neatly into DNAs double helix and enzymes can read them as easily as natural bases in order to make moleculesWe can do everything here that is necessary for life said Dr Benner now a distinguished fellow at the Foundation for Applied Molecular Evolution in FloridaHachimoji DNA could have many applications including a far more durable way to store digital data that could last for centuries This could be huge that way said Dr Nicholas V Hud a biochemist at Georgia Institute of Technology who was not involved in researchIt also raises a profound question about the nature of life elsewhere in the universe offering the possibility that the fourbase DNA we are familiar with may not be the only chemistry that could support life Like the Science Times page on Facebook  Sign up for the Science Times newsletterThe four natural bases of DNA are all anchored to molecular backbones A pair of backbones can join into a double helix because their bases are attracted to each other The bases form a bond with their hydrogen atomsBut bases dont stick together at random C can only bond to G and A can only bond to T These strict rules help ensure that DNA strands dont clump together into a jumble No matter what sequence of bases are contained in natural DNA it still keeps its shapeBut those four bases are not the only compounds that can attach to DNAs backbone and link to another base  at least on paper Dr Benner and his colleagues thought up a dozen alternativesWorking at the Swiss university ETH Zurich at the time Dr Benner tried to make some of those imaginary bases realOf course the first thing you discover is your design theory is not terribly good said Dr BennerOnce Dr Benner and his colleagues combined real atoms according to his designs the artificial bases didnt work as he had hoped Nevertheless Dr Benners initial forays impressed other chemists His work was a real inspiration for me said Floyd E Romesberg now of the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego Reading about Dr Benners early experiments Dr Romesberg decided to try to create his own basesDr Romesberg chose not to make bases that linked together with hydrogen bonds instead he fashioned a pair of oily compounds that repelled water That chemistry brought his unnatural pair of bases together Oil doesnt like to mix with water but it does like to mix with oil said Dr RomesbergIn the years that followed Dr Romesberg and his colleagues fashioned enzymes that could copy DNA made from both natural bases and unnatural oily ones In  the scientists engineered bacteria that could make new copies of these hybrid genes In recent years Dr Romesbergs team has begun making unnatural proteins from these unnatural genes He founded a company Synthorx to develop some of these proteins as cancer drugsAt the same time Dr Benner continued with his own experiments He and his colleagues succeeded in creating one pair of new basesLike Dr Romesberg they found an application for their unnatural DNA Their sixbase DNA became the basis of a new sensitive test for viruses in blood samples They then went on to create a second pair of new bases Now with eight bases to play with the researchers started building DNA molecules with a variety of different sequences The researchers found that no matter which sequence they created the molecules still formed the standard double helixBecause Hachimoji DNA held onto this shape it could act like regular DNA it could store information and that information could be read to make a moleculeFor a cell the first step in making a molecule is to read a gene using special enzymes They make a copy of the gene in a singlestranded version of DNA called RNADepending on the gene the cell will then do one of two things with that RNA In some cases it will use the RNA as a guide to build a protein But in other cases the RNA molecule floats off to do a job of its ownDr Benner and his colleagues created a Hachimoji gene for an RNA molecule They predicted that the RNA molecule would be able to grab a molecule called a fluorophore Cradled by the RNA molecule the fluorophore would absorb light and release it as a green flashAndrew Ellington an evolutionary engineer at the University of Texas led the effort to find an enzyme that could read Hachimoji DNA He and his colleagues found a promising one made by a virus and they tinkered with it until the enzyme could easily read all eight basesThey mixed the enzyme in test tubes with the Hachimoji gene As they had hoped their test tubes began glowing greenHere you have it from start to finish said Dr Benner We can store information we can transfer it to another molecule and that other molecule has a function  and here it is glowingIn the future Hachimoji DNA may store information of a radically different sort It might someday encode a movie or a spreadsheetToday movies spreadsheets and other digital files are typically stored on silicon chips or magnetic tapes But those kinds of storage have serious shortcomings For one thing they can deteriorate in just yearsDNA by contrast can remain intact for centuries Last year researchers at Microsoft and the University of Washington managed to encode  songs videos documents and other files totaling  megabytes in a batch of DNA molecules With eight bases instead of four Hachimoji DNA could potentially encode far more information DNA capable of twice as much storage Thats pretty amazing in my view said Dr EllingtonBeyond our current need for storage Hachimoji DNA also offers some clues about life itself Scientists have long wondered if our DNA evolved only four bases because theyre the only ones that can work in genes Could life have taken a different pathSteves work goes a long way to say that it could have  it just didnt said Dr

at largeWelcome to  where it takes just  hours for a faked homemade video of Joe Biden to travel from the keyboard of a pseudonymous memesmith to the president of the United States The video which splices footage from Mr Bidens recent apology for unwanted touching of several women with older footage of Mr Biden ricocheted around the proTrump corners of the internet First on Twitter then across Reddit forums before getting picked up by White House director of social media Dan Scavino Donald Trump Jr and finally the president who appended the caption WELCOME BACK JOE WELCOME BACK JOE pictwittercombNbBSXsxThe video has been viewed   million times and counting and forced Mr Biden to respond in a tweet I see that you are on the job and presidential as always Yep a grainy edited parody clip of the former vice president thats made to look as if hes kissing his own neck and creepily massaging himself will now be forever preserved by the Presidential Records Act Its a perfectly unbelievable and dispiriting artifact of our fractured and chaotic political media ecosystem where politicking is conducted through viral memes and retweetsAs technology advances will it continue to blur the lines between public and private Sign up for Charlie Warzels limitedrun newsletter to explore whats at stake and what you can do about itThe entire event is at once silly trivial offensive and thanks to Donald Trumps Twitter feed something were now begrudgingly made to pay attention to The same goes for the videos creator a stayathome dad in his mids who goes by the pseudonym CarpeDonktum As his handle indicates the meme creator is purposefully outrageous and yet seemingly now has an indirect line to the Oval Office And his elevation  from a Kansas City keyboard warrior to rightwing internet fame as the presidents unofficial meme maker  is a telling example of how the internet has fully blurred the lines between meme posting and business of politicsIts definitely an organic process CarpeDonktum told me over the phone shortly after Mr Trump tweeted his video Dan Scavino follows me on Twitter but theres no formal relationship there between me and the president If theres something I want to make sure Scavino sees Ill wait for him to post a tweet and try to be the first to reply linking to what I want to show He said that he doesnt get paid for any of his videos other than his Patreon crowdfunding account and occasional YouTube ad revenue and has no relationships to outside politiciansBack in February Mr Trump tweeted out a CarpeDonktum video mocking liberal members of congress during the State of the Union speech The video set to the tune of REMs Everybody Hurts was removed from the presidents account for copyright violations sparking outrage in proTrump spheres over allegations of censorship The controversy bolstered CarpeDonktums reputation among the MAGA crowd If a political campaign wanted to hire me to do viral marketing stuff for them that could be interesting he mused I asked if hed work on a Trump  campaign It depends on the specifics he saidCarpeDonktum started making memes like countless other online Trump supporters after spending time on Reddits TheDonald forum The forum has come under scrutiny for alleged instances of harassment and sometimes hosting content alleged to be from white nationalist personalities or communities CarpeDonktum denied such behavior went on in the forumsHis first public meme was posted in the summer of  when Mr Trump tweeted an infamous gif made by a Reddit user depicting the president body slamming a wrestler whose face had been replaced by CNNs logo He argues that the nod from Trump and the fallout after the tweet encouraged a race on the proTrump internet to create the most elaborate meme to troll mainstream media organizations Thats when the game changed he said and memes went from being crummy images to these highfidelity onesSince CarpeDonktum said hes gone from creating the videos frame by frame in Microsofts Paint program to using the expensive highpowered motion graphics software Adobe After Effects Last year he won a  meme contest hosted by the conspiracy site Infowars and now said that he gets more than dozen requests per day to make bespoke political memes While he said he doesnt need or care about the money he expressed hope that his information warfare tactics could someday lead to something more  like a job doing viral marketing for political candidatesAccording to their creator its no fluke that the videos caught the eye of the president he tailors them to an older generation of internet users The elaborate memes feature footage from old Looney Tunes cartoons or depict Mr Trump as a cowboy from an old John Waynestyle Western slapping a man with a CNN or MSNBC logo across its head Its boomer humor he said of his style of videos Im not a boomer But that brand of humor is most easily shareable by lots of people So I stay away from real violence or overly sexualized stuff so it appeals to the largest amount of people The strategy works The videos share extremely well among an aging Trump supporter contingent who are prolific and aggressive posters of misinformation and hyperpartisan content on platforms like Facebook They also make the rounds on Fox News Sean Hannity is going to play the video tonight he told me a short clip ran early in his Hannitys broadcast Some kids that are  can retweet it and so can some grandma in Wisconsin Its slightly edgy but universalThough his videos are dressed up using cartoons or slapstick humor all of them center on the incendiary offensive and hyperpartisan themes of Mr Trumps politics the wall antimedia sentiment making fun of Hillary Clinton and other Democrats And CarpeDonktum who described himself as an entertainer who wants to make people laugh is not above engaging in allcaps Trumpian politics which includes angrily tweeting at liberal politicians His desire not to reveal his name suggests that hes aware that those outside Trumpland find his content toxic Im not shy about this stuff but I dont advertise it he said If I were to go to a party I wouldnt introduce myself as the Trump meme guy from TwitterThat CarpeDonktums online musings or personal life should be picked apart is controversial in its own right At first glance it feels silly maybe even wrong to elevate him Hes not a politician Hes a Reddit user wielding farright Dad humor Hes not a public figure save a few Infowars appearances and Persicope live stream videos where he films himself talking while he makes lunch for his childrenBut at a time when our politics is programmed by whats viral on Twitter CarpeDonktum appears  stupefyingly as it might seem  to have something approaching power in MAGAland It appears he senses it too All of the memes and stuff like that he said Thats the future of political advertising The  second spots on TV arent the way to market anymore The stuff online that people dismiss as memes  thats the way to motivate people he added Its the viral political marketing of the future In theory his story is a perfect realization of the utopian understanding of the utopian promise of the internet a truly democratic system of communication where anyone anywhere can create things and get them seen by important people  even the president But in keeping with our current political moment that utopian vision is used for vapid divisive ends The reality as we should all know by now is darker and a whole lot dumber The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of

safety risks in August  when a Boeing  operated by the Trump Shuttle which he had bought a few months earlier and rebranded with his name failed to lower its nose gear as it prepared to land in BostonHe was quite terrified that we were going to have an airplane burning on the runway with his name splashed across it said Bruce R Nobles who was the airlines presidentThe Trump Shuttle jet landed safely if in a shower of sparks and a euphoric Mr Trump hailed the pilots as heroes But Mr Nobles said his boss was nervous about flying to Boston on a shuttle flight the next day to demonstrate the airlines safetyThat same mix of swagger and uneasiness was on display in the White House on Wednesday when Mr Trump preempted the Federal Aviation Administration in announcing that the United States would ground Boeings fleet of  Max planes after two deadly crashesBoeing he said was an incredible company and would find and fix the problem But in the meantime he said I felt it was important both psychologically and in a lot of ways to ground the planesIt was the latest illustration of Mr Trumps longstanding peculiar affinity for aviation  an industry he knows as an owner and frequent flier but often claims to understand as an aeronautical engineerWhether it is the merits of Boeings FA Super Hornet fighter jet the cost of a new Air Force One or Mr Trumps frequent assertion that the F stealth fighter is literally invisible the president barges into the technical details of aviation with more enthusiasm than expertiseA day before grounding the s Mr Trump declared that modern planes were too complex for anyone but computer scientists from MIT to fly Aviation experts pointed out that the problem with the  Max might be exactly the opposite Boeing designed the modified  so that it would require minimal additional training of the pilotsPeople who have worked with Mr Trump said his knowledge of aviation reflected someone who had owned private planes  first a  and later a   but little more than that His older brother Fred Trump Jr was a pilot for Trans World Airlines and married a flight attendant But Mr Trump channeled his passion into real estate developmentHe knows more about airlines and aviation than the average person but he doesnt know as much as I do said Mr Nobles who ran Hawaiian Airlines and Air Jamaica after his time at the Trump Shuttle Then again I dont know as much as him about real estateMr Trumps shortlived tenure as an airline executive captures his strange relationship with the industry He was drawn to the shuttle less because he loved flying than because he saw it as a diamond  a prestigious preAcela system of transportation for the nations East Coast eliteAfter buying the shuttle from financially strapped Eastern Air Lines for  million in  Mr Trump proceeded to polish it by fitting out its fleet of  planes with maple wood veneer and goldcolored lavatory fixtures He offered passengers free food coffee magazines and newspapersIll spend more money and Ill give the people more than they anticipate even he told The New York Times in  vowing with characteristic immodesty to create the best transportation system of any kind in the entire worldMr Trump brought bareknuckle tactics to the AvisHertz competition with his rival Pan Am Shuttle At one point he warned that Pan Am might not have the financial resources to maintain safe planes  a statement that violated the industrys informal code and drew protests from Mr Nobles who had run the Pan Am Shuttle before jumping over to Mr TrumpI said to Donald Look most people are uncomfortable flying Youre up in the air at  feet and the only thing between you and death is a piece of aluminum Mr Nobles recalled Anything you do to make flying seem more risky and less safe is bad for all of usFor a while Mr Trumps innovations fueled a lively competition between the two carriers But the economy in the Northeast ran out of steam in the fall of  and Iraqs invasion of Kuwait caused oil prices to spike the next summer Mr Trump looked for ways to economizeHe pressed Mr Nobles to cut the flight crews in the s from three to two His personal  had only two pilots he pointed out Mr Nobles said he explained to Mr Trump that the s used by the Trump Shuttle were configured for a pilot a copilot and a flight engineer The planes would require a costly redesign to be certified for only two pilots Mr Trump replied that he suspected Mr Nobles was trying to protect the pilots jobsIn December  USAir struck a deal with Mr Trumps banks to take over the Trump Shuttle Under the terms of the agreement Mr Trump was relieved of the bulk of the  million in loans he had guaranteed personally to buy the airline from Eastern Mr Trump has told friends he got out of the airline industry at the right time though the economics of the industry were in a free fall by the time Mr Trump unloaded the shuttleHes not going to be remembered in the annals of the airline industry said Richard Aboulafia an aviation analyst at the Teal Group He is known as the temporary caretaker of something that was heading into oblivion That doesnt make you an aviation industry executiveMr Aboulafia said the presidents pattern with aviation as in other areas had been to declare a crisis and then take credit for fixing itThe F was a disaster until he could take credit for cost savings he said Air Force One was a disaster until he got major cost savings from Boeing The Super Hornet was a terrible plane until he could take credit for putting it back into the defense budgetAfter selling the Trump Shuttle Mr Trumps involvement in aviation was mainly through his  which is equipped with a bigscreen entertainment system and karatgold fixtures The plane once owned by Microsofts cofounder Paul Allen became known as Trump Force One after Mr Trump used it to hopscotch between rallies during the  presidential campaignMr Trump was so fond of the  that he briefly considered using it instead of Air Force One after he took office That coincided with Mr Trumps bitter complaints about the cost of a plan to replace the two Boeing s that currently operate as Air Force One He also floated the prospect of naming his personal pilot John Dunkin to be the head of the FAAThose ideas have vanished like a jets contrails but Mr Trump remains opinionated about airplanes and the industryIn January  he tweeted Since taking office I have been very strict on Commercial Aviation Good news  it was just reported that there were Zero deaths in  the best and safest

without fighting age discrimination along with itBy Steve CavendishMr Cavendish is a Nashvillebased journalistSome of the most powerful ideas are simple onesWe believe that if you can see her you can be her reads the slogan of the SeeHer initiative a gender equity campaign led by the Association of National Advertisers Their mission to change the way women are depicted throughout the media by increasing diversity across criteria ranging from age to race to body typeIts a laudable goal and one thats been embraced by corporate giants like Ford Walmart and Microsoft who have all committed to examining how women are being portrayed in their advertising And in October Meredith a media company that owns both highprofile magazines like People Better Homes  Gardens and Martha Stewart Living as well as  television stations that reach approximately  million households became the first media corporation to sign on committing to do its part to help SeeHer shift the balance of how women are portrayed by  the th anniversary of the th Amendment which gave women the right to vote Meredith joining marked an interesting breakthrough for the campaign because as both a publisher and broadcaster with wide reach they not only buy ads in other media but also produce original media contentMeredith is also as it happens being sued for age discriminationIn  CBS affiliate KCTV in Kansas City fired news anchor Karen Fuller then  from the station and replaced her with a year old In Dec  NBC affiliate WSMV in Nashville let anchor Demetria Kalodimos then  go and replaced her with someone a decade younger Both women subsequently filed suitMs Fullers suit alleged that removing older women from highly visible roles has been a problem at Meredith stations with a set of seven female anchors in markets including Atlanta Phoenix and St Louis removed in a span of five years and replaced with younger women The average age of the anchors who lost their jobs was  while their replacements averaged  years In one case the difference was more than two decadesAs they were evaluating candidates Ms Fullers bosses at KCTV according to the suit sought a replacement with a hometown girl look and voiced concerns about how candidates would appear on camera in the years to come She can be cute and young but also able to dress up and be more serious and respectable  How will she age I wonder said the stations creative director in an email about one prospectThis is rarely a consideration for male anchors who are on average a decade older than their female counterparts at Meredith stations after ousting Ms Fuller KCTV named a yearold woman to pair with her yearold former coanchor After a federal judge rejected Merediths requests to dismiss the case the company settled the suit for an undisclosed amount before it could go to trial in DecemberMs Kalodimos removal was even more bewildering The face of WSMV in Nashville for three decades she is one of the most decorated reporters in the city and has won three medals from Investigative Reporters and Editors Ive known Ms Kalodimos for five years and watched her for most of her career Her departure was a farce She found out about her dismissal via a package left at the stations front desk after she had been out shooting an investigative piece on her day off In her suit Ms Kalodimos says she believes she incurred the ire of the station by acting as a witness in an age discrimination suit filed by four other WSMV employees The station disputes her claims in federal court filingsThese stations are hardly alone in showing people like Ms Kalodimos the door Aging in television newsrooms has always been a problem particularly for women For every Judy Woodruff or Andrea Mitchell who has remained on the air into her s many more hit the ceiling that Ms Fuller and Ms Kalodimos have found in spite of performance Famously Christine Craft another Kansas City anchor won  in  for being too old unattractive and not deferential enough to men In  Telemundo settled a suit brought by reporter Vicky Gutierrez who was laid off and then replaced by a substantially younger woman And in September investigative reporter Michele Gillen  filed suit for age discrimination accusing a CBS affiliate in Miami of barring her from highprofile assignments because of her age The station disputes Ms Gillens claimsThere is nothing new about older anchors feeling that theyre devalued in newsrooms said Al Tompkins a senior broadcast faculty member at The Poynter Institute Ive been around newsrooms for  years They always felt like My time is going to come when theyre not going to want me on the airLocal television presents a particularly tough challenge Ratings pressure is everpresent consultants are a constant and management turnover can be high  neither of the general managers who terminated Ms Fuller or Ms Kalodimos for instance is still at their station And yet the cultural influence of these stations for all that theyre viewed as an outdated medium remains real Almost  percent of Americans watch local TV news more than watch cable or broadcastWhich gets back to the problem of Meredith and SeeHerAn unappreciated aspect of sexism in the workplace is age discrimination and it operates in many places But one of the places where its most visible  where we can all SeeHer getting aged out  is in TV newsMeredith is not the only broadcaster who has faced discrimination claims But their decision to join the SeeHer campaign gives the company  a magazine publisher that reaches more female readers than any other  an opportunity to force its local broadcasters to face some longstanding problems in television news to take the lead in promoting all manner of image metrics including race body type and yes ageIn a statement Merediths senior vice president of human resources Dina Nathanson said the company categorically denies the charges raised in the Kalodimos lawsuit She also pointed to the companys outstanding track record regarding gender equity in the workplace  percent of its onair talent and  percent of its anchors are women she said and that the company also has more women in offair leadership roles than the industry averageQuite frankly we dont see the point of this oped piece as we are already a clear leader among media companies on the issue of gender equality and are actively expanding our efforts said Ms NathansonThats great and advancing gender equality in multiple forms is important work But it is not enough It is impossible to accurately reflect women in the media when women in the TV news business are punished for getting older Because if you cant SeeHer  well we know what happens then Its something Ms Kalodimos is feeling acutely right nowMy gender and my age stamped me with a bullseye I couldnt shed despite decades of dedication journalism awards public respect and popularity Ms Kalodimos told me At Meredith the message to women journalists is loud and clear Dont make trouble dont stick up for other women and whatever you do dont get oldSteve Cavendish is a Nashvillebased journalist and former editor of the Nashville Scene and Washington City

motherBy Doug WatlingMy mother Joyce grew up singing and tap dancing something that not many people know She studied piano and voice in her youth entered a university music program and emerged a classically trained soprano in nearconstant demand for concerts and recitals She made a couple of badly pressed records toured the southern states and performed a single show in New York City all by the time she was In  hard on the heels of that tour the Metropolitan Opera came calling Not surprisingly my mother turned down the audition stayed home in far away New Brunswick Canada and married my father She was always a pragmatistLike most postwar brides she took matrimony seriously My mother cooked and kept house but she was also true to herself Mom continued to sing And sing And sing She also acted in musicals Nancy in Oliver Kate in Kiss Me Kate joined the Gilbert and Sullivan Society ran an interview show for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation cofounded a community newspaper with my father played the organ for all manner of churches conducted a choir for  years  and daily religiously solved crosswordsThroughout my childhood Mom tore the crossword pages from the morning and afternoon newspapers that arrived at our house Articles lost their beginnings and ends and entire sections fell apart Crossword pages took over the house Most ended up strewn beside the living room couch alongside a china mug stained brown by coffee and teaMy mother was a lateafternoon and latenight solver She liked to camp out on the couch as dinner warmed up and tackle that days puzzles Mom preferred to solve undisturbed by family choral music was her company of choice In the evenings my parents and I gathered around our new color television My mother would balance a cup of coffee on a tray and complete the crosswords on her lap barely glancing at the TVI couldnt have cared less about crosswords until my midteens when Mom began soliciting my advice on popular culture clues My mother steeped in music theory and the classical repertoire claimed to have lost touch with current trends after Elvis I realize now that Mom was quite capable of deciphering the answers on her own Crosswords were simply her attempt to connect with her rebellious teenage sonYears later crossword clues on computer terminology left my mother baffled This was before the internet and technology clues were invitations to phone me in Toronto or in Halifax My mother would ring up and plead What in Gods name is Microsoft suite I would try to explain and secretly bless crosswords for giving my mother an excuse to callI was hooked on crosswords by the time I left home thanks to Mom On summer visits my mother and I would once again join forces at the family cottage Somehow crosswords became a natural unforced way to reestablish our relationship and pick up where wed left offDuring those summers I would wander up the lane early in the morning to collect the newspaper The rest of the day was fair game for the crossword  in between meals and swims and card games and berrypicking and reading and long long walks The news was secondary We had a radio and knew what was going on The crossword on the other hand was always different and fresh and kept the world at bayAt  pm or so my mother would quietly plop some potato chips in a bowl pour herself a tiny crystal glass of sherry and repair to the porch where we would tie up our crossword loose ends The sun would drop slowly across the lake and the world would seem just about rightAt the cottage my mother and I polished off the Monday and Tuesday crosswords by noon We werent lightningfast solvers Fridays and Saturdays were generally allday affairs We needed another challenge so I began going to town to pick up the Globe and Mail which always carried a cryptic crossword Cryptics were new to my mother and in no time she was hooked I wont soon forget those eureka moments when my mother and I would look at each other and shout Thats itEvery cryptic took us days to complete much to the annoyance of my wife She disliked crosswords in general but reserved a special disdain for cryptics Inevitably at some crisis point in every cryptic my mother and I would be gnashing our teeth My wife as lateral a thinker as ever walked would blurt out some nonsensical answer Mom and I would exchange Oh my God shes right looks then pretend it was all a fluke Not so my wife who insisted that her offhand solutions reaffirmed the absurdity of all puzzlesThose were the halcyon days Eventually cottage upkeep became too much On her own one September Mom faltered in the icy water She was rescued by a fellow cottager After she was relegated to home crosswords helped keep my mother afloat I wanted my mother to be well but discarded puzzles told another tale Early one morning I found her slumped over breakfast with a crossword by her side totally incoherentAs it turned out my mother had been suffering from a sneaky case of dementia It had fooled us all In her new assisted living apartment the signs became more and more clear The radio one of my mothers trademark habits fell silent Mom ignored the mysterious television remote and fought unsuccessfully to navigate the bathrooms bewildering array of switchesCrosswords remained the route back to Moms real self I extended her newspaper subscription My mother barely glanced at the headlines and yes ripped out the crosswords Muscle memory seemed to have taken over Mom kept the crosswords in unruly stacks scattered around her apartment an answer or two in each One day I tried to tidy up and recycle her puzzles and my mother had the first and only hissy fit of her lifeFinally I arrived one morning to find two caregivers hovering beside my mothers bed My mother was sprawled on the bedroom floor Over the next long weeks a familiar scenario played itself out broken hip surgery failed rehab palliative care and a long slow decline until my mother died at  am on a cold March

point between empires Then for nearly  years Triestes geopolitical star dimmed and its old world mishmash of central European cultures grew stale like an old strudel in one of its elegant cafesNow courtesy of a rising China Trieste appears ready to return to the center of a realigning worldThis week President Xi Jinping of China arrives in Rome for a state visit in which Italy is expected to become the first Group of  nation to participate in Chinas vast One Belt One Road infrastructure project The symbolism is striking  a powerful China drives a crack in the economic alliance that once dominated the globe and delivers a major blow to a Trump administration that has been critical of the Belt and Road InitiativeFor Italy the deal would open the country to greater Chinese infrastructure investment particularly in ports like Trieste Officials here say they expect Beijingbacked conglomerates such as the China Communications Construction Company to bid hundreds of millions of euros for infrastructure concessionsFor China having a toehold in one of Europes historic ports would bring favorable customs conditions a faster trade route to the heart of the Continent and direct access to railroads for moving its goods into the European UnionFundamentally whats happening is that the port of Trieste is returning to the logistical role for Europe that it had for the old AustroHungarian empire said Zeno DAgostino the president of the Trieste port authority whose office is sprinkled with gifts from Chinese delegations and a book about EuropeanChinese cultural relationsTo walk through Trieste is to witness how the city has already opened to China Chinese tourists shop for the citys trademark Illy coffee and take pictures with their Huawei phones of the

Far EastMost significant construction workers in scuba gear have been laying foundations near the site where a new pier is expected to become Chinas home in the industrial port In the years after World War II the Americans held great sway in Trieste and Washington has now sought so far unsuccessfully to stop Italys deal with Mr Xi characterizing the Belt and Road Initiative as an economic and potentially military threatWhile other members of the European Union including France and Germany have also expressed reservations about the deal with China supporters in Italy say that there is nothing to worry about and that the critics are merely upset that Trieste  and other Italian ports like Genoa and Palermo  are going to cut in on their business They reject comparisons to the port of Piraeus in Greece which China essentially bought and say Italian law makes such an acquisition or the laying of Chinese debt traps impossibleMichele Geraci an Italian economic development minister who is running the negotiations with Beijing said in an interview that Chinese ships carrying materials from home or its vast network of interests in Africa through the Suez Canal simply needed to get their goods to central European markets as quickly as possibleTrieste meets that requirement swiftly he saidItalian officials say their American counterparts initially seemed disinterested in the deal Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio the leader of the Five Star Movement has made several trips to China in recent months nearly signing the accord during a November visit to Beijing they said After the fact American diplomats began making their case but the Italians said the deal was noticeably not on the American radar during recent highlevel meetings in WashingtonBut this month Garrett Marquis spokesman for the American national security adviser John R Bolton sharply attacked the deal in a Twitter post and in several interviews while the National Security Councils official Twitter account also issued a reproach on March Endorsing BRI lends legitimacy to Chinas predatory approach to investment and will bring no benefits to the Italian people the tweet stated referring to the Belt and Road InitiativeThe Americans have also tried to pressure leaders of the nationalist League party which is part of the governing coalition in Italy This month Trump administration officials and separately the former White House official Stephen K Bannon met with party leaders Mr Bannon said that he had warned his Italian allies in the League against what he called Chinas British East India Company model of predatory capitalismAwakened to the growing Chinese influence American officials have had more success pushing Italy to avoid using the new G networks of the Chinese electronics giant Huawei which Washington warns could be used by Beijing to disrupt and spy on communications networks In recent days the Italians have excised any mention of technology and communications from the Belt and Road agreement people familiar with the negotiations saidIn Trieste city leaders are focused on the economic benefits to the portBeyond its convenient location the city on Monday celebrated the th anniversary of Emperor Charles VI of Austria declaring it a free port That status still confers special privileges with no customs charges or time limits on storage for goodsIf the deal goes through proponents say they envision Chinese companies working with Italian counterparts hiring local laborers to assemble imported goods before putting them on trains to the rest of Europe or on ships back to China If the amount of work and components used measure up to customs requirements those products could be labeled Made in ItalyBut some business leaders say that fully embracing the Belt and Road program would bring risks and could complicate efforts to bring other investment to TriesteVittorio Petrucco chairman of ICOP a construction company doing work in the port said he and a former Microsoft consultant in Trieste which has a vibrant research sector had begun exploring his dream of building an underwater data center that would cool the servers of American tech giantsI prefer to look West instead of East Mr Petrucco said of his project planned for an area near an old ironworks factory that looms above the pier envisioned for use by the Chinese He added that both projects would take years to build and worried that all the American opposition and controversy surrounding the Belt and Road agreement would poison the waters for his proposalIts sad he said but theres nothing I can do about itRoberto Dipiazza the mayor of Trieste said that the United States could scuttle the deal if it really wanted to He said that his city had much to gain from closer ties to China but that the Chinese had even more to gain from his ports deep harbors customs benefits and rail yardsWe will find a point of agreement between China and the US he said showing off a Make America Great Again cap signed by President Trump that he had received as a gift Italy he noted was caught in the middleSome of Triestes most entrenched political players think Italy is compromised by such a positionGiulio Camber a veteran lawmaker considered by many to be the political boss of Trieste said he no longer had any interests in the port and that his opposition to the deal was motivated by his distrust of what he called Chinas Communist dictatorshipAs light sliced in through the closed curtains of his office illuminating his cigarette smoke gilded furniture and oil paintings Mr Camber said the Chinese were behind many of the Turkish businesses exporting goods into the port Beijing he said would feast on the Italians just as they did on the Greeks before themThey are the weakest he said of the Mediterranean countriesMr Camber dismissed the local and national assurances about Chinese expansion saying that Beijing would easily outmaneuver officials in RomeIts like the

investors and journalists for failing to read corporate earnings reports from beginning to endFor one thing the quarterly and annual reports churned out by publicly traded companies are forbiddingly long Microsofts most recent annual report known as a K was  pages Apples was  pages Amazons was  pagesFor another their prose is often dreary and repetitious Filled with legal language aimed at satisfying securities regulators without alarming investors and driving down share prices many earnings reports seem designed to be mindnumbingly boringIts the financial figures within these pages that are critically important Is a company generating profits and cash is it growing is it borrowing too much or investing too little Answers to these questions are often revealed in the numbers but Ive always thought it best to avoid spending much time on the wordsThere is evidence that most other people have made the same judgment yet it turns out that weve been making a mistake The turgid language in these dull corporate reports is actually sprinkled with important clues about major problems  and there is a way to get an inkling about them without actually having to read every wordThose are the main insights of Lazy Prices a fascinating research paper featured in the November issue of The NBER Digest a publication of the National Bureau of Economic Research It found that corporate reports are indeed repetitious but when the language in the current text varies a great deal from previous versions it frequently signals trouble that will become evident several months laterThree economists  Lauren Cohen and Christopher Malloy of the Harvard Business School and Quoc Nguyen of DePaul University  downloaded every quarterly and annual corporate report of every publicly traded American company from  to They then sifted through thousands of reports using a text analysis program We filtered out the reports that made a lot of wording changes over the previous years version Mr Cohen said in an interview It turned out that when there are a lot of changes theres a good chance that something important is going on and most of the time its negativeAmong the reports that included many such changes the researchers found a high probability that the companies share prices would decline several months after the reports appearedTextual changes in the risk factors section were most likely to predict subsequent moves in share prices Corporate earnings reports are rigidly formatted to comply with Securities and Exchange Commission requirements and are divided into predictable sections When the researchers refined the analysis further differentiating between textual changes that were positive and negative the results were even more strikingThe overwhelming majority   percent  of reports with substantial wording changes were primarily negative in tone But the minority that contained primarily positive language generally correlated with increases in share prices laterThat brings up another important point The stock market rarely responded to the subtle hints in the reports immediately In fact it typically took several months for whatever good or bad news was embedded in the reports to be widely understood  and to move the stock marketThis delay means that there is a profit opportunity for those able to exploit it the researchers saidWhen they constructed a hypothetical portfolio that shorted  or bet against  the companies with primarily negative word changes in the reports while buying shares of the companies with positive changes the portfolio outperformed the stock market by  percentage points per yearWhat is perhaps most remarkable is that they selected these investments without actually reading any of the reports or analyzing the stocks or the companiesChanges to the Ks predict future earnings profitability future news announcements and even future firmlevel bankruptcies the researchers said That was the case even when the corporate reports contained no outright announcements about such mattersAs a result they said We find no announcement effect associated with these changes  with returns only accruing when the information is later revealed through news events or earnings  suggesting that investors are inattentive to these simple changes across the universe of public firmsInvestors are apparently still being inattentive An excellent Heard on The Street column in The Wall Street Journal in June  by Justin Lahart reported on an earlier version of the Lazy Prices findings In that column Mr Lahart said explicitly that investors might profit by following the researchers methods And in August the opensource Quantopian investing site created an algorithm replicating the researchers methods and found that the results remained robust A new model portfolio outperformed the marketIn other words word changes in corporate reports still appear to be signaling subsequent changes in stock prices and few if any people have noticed That suggests that scarcely anyone has been reading corporate reports thoroughly  and that scarcely anyone has read the Lazy Prices paper eitherTo be fair the clues unearthed by the researchers approach are fuzzy and imprecise at bestIn November for example I asked Professor Cohen how I might make practical use of his insightsHe suggested two things First always download the previous version of a corporate report as well as the current version so you can compare the language Focus on the differences from year to year Second focus on one section the risk factors sectionI did just that looking mainly at the latest Apple corporate report posted on its website on Nov  There was plenty of new language describing the risks that Apple faced  risks that Apple executives discussed in November and disclosed more directly in a letter to shareholders on Jan These risks included the possibility of an economic slowdown in a place like China the possibility of slowing iPhone sales the threat of a trade war and the potential impact of unfavorable foreign exchange rates All of these risks have actually materialized and Apple shares have sunk pulling down the overall stock marketBut based on the language changes in the corporate report alone was there a specific reason for investors to bid down Apple stock or for a journalist to conclude that Apple was in serious troubleI didnt think so at the time and I still dont The linguistic clues were another piece of evidence that needed to be evaluated and perhaps bolstered by other researchClues like that have real value though The Lazy Prices research will at the very least lead me to read these reports a little differently in the hope of using them to unearth deeper truths Whats more until the Lazy Prices research is widely understood it may be possible for some investors to profit from itFollow Jeff Sommer on Twitter jeffsommerAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byWhen the commercials come on during the game at least youll know Jason Bateman is trying to sell you something By Sheila MarikarMs Marikar is a Los Angelesbased writer On Sunday millions of Americans will hunker down in front of the nearest big screen to watch the Super Bowl and its roster of splashy celebritystudded advertisements For brands its a crucial stage In our extremely fragmented media landscape theres no better way to reach a crowdCBS is reportedly charging  million to  million for  seconds of commercial time during the game and to make that kind of investment worth it brands pour resources into formulating bits of theater that might get viewers talking recall Budweisers eyerollingly annoying Whassup guys and tear jerky Clydesdales The absurd premises advanced by this years roster of Super Bowl ads are set to include Jason Bateman operating an elevator brought to you by Hyundai Christina Applegate tooling around town with a backtalking batch of candy MMs and Chance the Rapper dancing in an airplane hangar with the Backstreet Boys DoritosTheyre fun theyre silly and theyre hyped almost as much as the game itself Theyre why plenty of nonfootball fans raising my hand watch the Super Bowl But above all theyre clearly ads which makes them seem almost quaint at a time when advertising has begun to take on much more subtle  and at times stealthy  formsA  survey by the Association of National Advertisers found that  percent of marketers partake in influencer marketing the practice of paying people with robust social media followings to promote a product and  percent of them plan to spend more on it in the next year Companies are increasingly targeting users of Instagram the app once dominated by photos of babies and brunches to hype their products And as influencer marketing and the social network itself have evolved the lines have blurred between sponsored ads in which a company pays Instagram to push an advertisement to users influencers tagging things that theyre paid to promote Kim Kardashian West posting a selfie with a flat tummy smoothie and regular folks shouting out brands they like just because like a friend tagging the design hotel where he stayed during a recent trip to Tokyo compelling me to book a room there when I went to JapanThe goal is to get the ads to be as relevant and interesting to you as a consumer as the content that youve elected to follow on your own said Vishal Shah Instagrams head of productBut the ads are not always obvious and the people pushing products on Instagram may not be as immediately recognizable as the stars of Super Bowl commercials Last year Johnson  Johnson tapped teenage Instagram users with around  followers each to promote its latest line of Clean  Clear products reasoning that these people would be seen as more trustworthy endorsers of the acnecombating collection of cleansers and creams than mainstream celebrities who hawk a variety of products They were after all doing things that other kids responded to authentically a Johnson  Johnson representative told AdAgeAmong companies with products to promote and Instagram influencers with themselves to promote authenticity has become a goal a thing that people try to reverse engineer either by turning the kid next door into a pitchman  in the case of Johnson  Johnson  or by posting what were supposed to believe are unfiltered accounts of their daily lives like the makeup guru who posts a selfie in her mussed but not messy bed claiming she woke up like thisIf youre trying to be authentic by definition youre not authentic  youre manufacturing your online persona said Arianna Margulis the artist behind the Instagrambased comic strip But Like Maybe its like Cathy for millennials and Generation Z Ms Margulis says she follows the guidelines laid out by the Federal Trade Commission and discloses when shes being paid for a post shes done advertisements for brands like Harpers Bazaar the dating app Hinge and Pizza Hut But those guidelines arent always clear and a frequently asked questions page on the FTCs website points to confusion around who qualifies as an influencer and what qualifies as an advertisementTake this sample question If I post a picture of myself to Instagram and tag the brand of dress Im wearing but dont say anything about the brand in my description of the picture is that an endorsement And even if it is an endorsement wouldnt my followers understand that I only tag the brands of my sponsors Short answer Tagging a brand is an endorsement and may require disclosure Dont assume that your followers know anythingMs Marguliss line of work has become so sought after that people who are not paid in money sneakers or makeup are claiming sponsorships from brands like Nike and Sephora in their posts so as to fake it til they make it as social media influencers Theyll caption a post sponsored even though theyre not sponsored to either impress their followers or to impress companies that they want to get paid by said Brian Braiker the editor in chief of the magazine AdAgeSo murky is the morass of whos hyping something because they genuinely like it and whos doing it to get paid that in  the Instagram account SwearBy was launched to help smart women find real and notsponsored recommendations for the best products around I first found out about SwearBy when a beauty editor I follow announced that she had  boxes of hydrating face masks lip balms and face cleansers from a luxury skin care brand to give away Wouldbe winners had to follow SwearBy follow her like her post and post a comment naming a product they swear by The post may not have been sponsored although I wondered who paid for the  boxes but it was an advertisement for many things SwearBy the luxury skin care brand and the editor whose opinion carried so much weight that she was given  boxes of stuff to give outTheres nothing wrong with noncelebrities trumpeting products because they like them or touting their accomplishments because want to get more work But there is something hollow and dystopian about opening an app to see people you like and instead seeing people you like try to sell products to you As Duncan Watts a sociologist and principal researcher at Microsoft Research put it Theres a problem when you try to mix friendship with economic transactions He compared it to how people in relationships dont pay for sex and you wouldnt normally tip a friend who invites you to their homeAll smart consumers question the veracity of ads like the ones that will appear during the Super Bowl  does anyone really think Chance and the Backstreet Boys chop it up over Flamin Hot chips But on social media we now have to question whether anything we see is actually authenticMeanwhile Instagram is making it easier to purchase products through the app Mr Shah intends for the network to become the worlds largest personalized mall Thanks to increasingly smart algorithms users will see more products theyre likely to like and be able to buy them with a couple of taps of the thumb At least on Super Bowl Sunday those who want to avoid being marketed to will know exactly when to get up and

any plan at allBoth Conservative and Labour members of Parliament keep voting down one plan after another looking for the perfect fix the painfree exit from the EU But there is none because you cant fix stupid The entire Brexit choice was presented to the public in  with utterly misleading simplicity It was sold with a pack of lies about both the size of the benefits and the ease of implementation and it continues to be pushed by Conservative hardliners who used to care about business but are now obsessed with restoring Britains sovereignty over any economic considerationsThey dont seem to be listening at all to people like Tom Enders CEO of the aerospace giant Airbus which employs more than  people in the UK with around  more local jobs connected to its supply chains Enders has warned the political leadership here that if the UK just crashes out of the EU in the coming weeks Airbus may be forced to make some potentially very harmful decisions about its operations in BritainPlease dont listen to the Brexiteers madness which asserts that because we have huge plants here we will not move  They are wrong he said And make no mistake there are plenty of countries out there who would love to build the wings for Airbus aircraftI understand the grievances of many of those who voted to leave the EU For starters they felt swamped by EU immigrants There are reportedly some  French citizens living in London which would make it one of the biggest French cities in the world I had a drink with a member of Parliament in the bar in the House of Commons on Tuesday and as we sat down he whispered to me that not a single person working in this whole building is BritishI also get the resentment of Brits at having regulations set by faceless EU bureaucrats in Brussels And I get their resentment at the globalized urban elites who those in the rural areas here believed looked down at them And I get the squeeze on middleclass wages here that gets blamed unfairly on the EU and immigrants the way President Trump blames Mexicans I get all of thatBut I also get what it means to be a leader in the st century And it sure doesnt mean asserting your sovereignty over all other considerations or breaking out of the giant EU market where the UK sends over  percent of its exports without a serious national discussion of the costs and benefitsWhat do the most effective leaders today have in common They wake up every morning and ask themselves the same questions What world am I living in What are the biggest trends in this world And how do I educate my citizens about this world and align my policies so more of my people can get the best out of these trends and cushion the worstSo what world are we living in For starters were living in a world that is becoming so interconnected  thanks to digitization the internet broadband mobile devices the cloud and soontobe G wireless transmissions  that we are becoming interdependent to an unprecedented degree In this world growth increasingly depends on the ability of yourself your community your town your factory your school and your country to be connected to more and more of the flows of knowledge and investment  and not just rely on stocks of stuffOver centuries notes John Hagel who currently coheads Deloittes Center for the Edge business has been organized around stocks of knowledge as the basis for value creation The key to creating economic value has been to acquire some proprietary knowledge stocks aggressively protect those knowledge stocks and then efficiently extract the economic value from those knowledge stocks and deliver them to the market The challenge in a more rapidly changing world is that knowledge stocks depreciate at an accelerating rate In this kind of world the key source of economic value shifts from stocks to flowsThe companies that will create the most economic value in the future Hagel says will be the ones that find ways to participate more effectively in a broader range of more diverse knowledge flows that can refresh knowledge stocks at an accelerating rateAnd yet Britain is ruled today by a party that wants to disconnect from a connected world The notion that the UK will suddenly get a great freetrade deal from Trump as soon as it quits the EU is ludicrous Trump believes in competitive nationalism and the very reason he is promoting the breakup of the EU is that he believes America can dominate the EUs individual economies much better than when they negotiate together as the single biggest market in the worldThe second thing the best leaders understand is that in a world of simultaneous accelerations in technology and globalization keeping your country as open as possible to as many flows as possible is advantageous for two reasons You get all the change signals first and have to respond to them and you attract the most highIQ risktakers who tend to be the people who start or advance new companiesIn the US who is the CEO of Microsoft Satya Nadella Who is the CEO of Google Sundar Pichai Who is the CEO of Adobe Shantanu Narayen Who is the CEO of Workday Aneel Bhusri Hello London The best talent wants to go to the most open systems  open both to immigrants and trade  because that is where the most opportunities are Britain is about to put up a big sign GO AWAYThe wisest leaders also understand that all the big problems today are global problems and they have only global solutions I am talking about climate change trade rules technology standards and preventing excesses and contagion in financial markets If your country wants to have a say in how those problems are solved  and your countrys name is not America Russia China or India  you need to be part of a wider coalition like the European Union The UK membership in the EU has given it an outsize voice in world affairsAnd theres just one more thing the best leaders know a little history Trump is fine with a world of competitive European nationalisms not a strong European Union So is Vladimir Putin So it seems are the Brexiteers How quickly theyve all forgotten that the EU and NATO were built to prevent the very competitive nationalism that ran riot in Europe in the th century and brought us two world warsSorry to be so despondent but I went to graduate school here on a Marshall scholarship from the British government was married here and started as a journalist on Fleet Street in London I like the place But this is not the reasonably competent British government I grew up with Its being led by a ship of fools  a Conservative Party bloc that is now radical in its obsession with leaving Europe and a Labour Party that has gone Marxist If the people here cant force their politicians to compromise with one another and with reality theres still a glimmer of hope that this might happen there is going to be a crackup of the British political system and some serious economic pain This is scaryThe Times is committed

Andrew Russell and Lee VinselDr Russell and Dr Vinsel study technologyOur modern existence depends on things we can take for granted Cars run on gas from any gas station the plugs for electrical devices fit into any socket and smartphones connect to anything equipped with Bluetooth All of these conveniences depend on technical standards the silent and often forgotten foundations of technological societiesThe objects that surround us were designed to comply with standards Consider the humble byinch concrete block the specifications of which are defined in the Masonry Societys Building Code Requirements and Specification for Masonry StructuresThis book distills centuries of knowledge about the size and thickness of blocks seismic design requirements and the use of materials like concrete glass and mortar Professionals worked through committees organized by the American Concrete Institute American Society of Civil Engineers and the Masonry Society from  to  to foster consensus around this single national standardThe number of technical standards that go into some products is astonishing and the complexity of the methods used to create these standards is perhaps even more remarkable A  study found that a laptop computer incorporates  standards Companies such as IBM and Microsoft created some of these standards  but only  percent of them The other  percent of the laptops standards were developed by private or nongovernmental organizations that facilitate collaboration and cooperation among technical experts These facts should prompt some reflection about the exercise of power in a technological society Amid concerns about the excesses of market power and government regulation nobody seems to worry much about the private groups of experts who created  percent of the laptops standards Standards created this way known as the voluntary consensus process are ubiquitous They range from technologies like electrical plugs lumber and concrete to rules and certifications for food safety and environmental sustainability to more personal matters such as definitions of health and diseaseThe basic irony of standards is the simple fact that there is no standard way to create a standard nor is there even a standard definition of standard There are however longstanding ways that industries and nations coordinate standardization efforts In the United States the system of voluntary consensus standards is coordinated by ANSI the American National Standards InstituteThe standardsdevelopment organizations accredited by ANSI follow a bottomup process It begins when someone proposes a draft standard which then goes through a period of public comment A panel of stakeholders and interested parties then seeks to resolve points of friction Eventually this process which often takes years results in a final published standard ANSI was first known as the American Engineering Standards Committee which was created to address rampant incompatibility throughout American industry It was eventually reconstituted in  and took on the name ANSI in  Its founders came from engineering organizations and departments of the federal government that all published their own standards which were of limited value because they varied from group to group The consequences could be catastrophic as with the  fire that destroyed much of downtown Baltimore Buildings could have been saved if fire departments from neighboring cities had hoses that fit Baltimores fire hydrantsThe Engineering Standards Committees solution to technical incompatibility was to get organized At its first meeting in  it created a process where people could work out the details of technical specifications and agree to carry them out The structure of the standardization panels balanced producers and consumers  that is makers and users of technologies  so that no single company could dictate the outcome This method incorporated advice from British engineers who had created a similar organization a decade earlier and reflected lessons from World War I where cooperation among engineers led to technological and humanitarian accomplishments During the war Herbert Hoover who was then head of the United States Food Administration coordinated farming and business interests as well as the automobile railroad and shipping industries to provide food for America and its alliesThe consensusdriven approach had two clear advantages over existing alternatives First a forum to bring all interested parties into alignment reduced duplication and wasted effort Second the absence of state coercion to enforce standards meant that engineers and executives had strong incentives to resolve conflicts before they published a standard lest they face government intervention down the road The success of their efforts would depend on the voluntary adoption of standards The consensus process was well suited for a society where technological and economic progress was within reach  all it needed to do was to find ways to cooperate This was no easy task The standards committees longtime secretary Paul Gough Agnew looked back wearily at the endless discussions that set the stage for the first meeting in  One of the groups founders the electrical engineer Comfort Adams observed Fear and jealousy as well as ignorance were the chief obstacles which had to be overcomeOver the past century standardization has expanded immensely Today private transnational organizations create and revise thousands of consensus standards every year Although the voluntary consensus method has been effective it has never been perfect For example consensus is often a euphemism Nasty disagreements can derail the process Companies that agree on standards one day turn around and sue one another the next In some industries companies can make fortunes by defying established standards  think of innovative products from Apple or bold designs from the leaders of the fashion industry Standardization also creates losers and it can be very costly to invest in the losing side of standards wars like VHS versus Betamax or Bluray versus HD DVDAccess to standards also poses challenges Since the consensusbuilding process is costly organizations like ANSI often try to cover expenses by selling or licensing access to standards documents For example the book of standards for concrete blocks and masonry structures costs  This business model strikes many critics as unjust since private standards can be built into regulations yet sometimes only citizens who pay can look at themThe American system of standardization is driven by industry but we should not lose sight of the crucial role played by government agencies The National Bureau of Standards now known as the National Institute of Standards and Technology contributed research and ideas to the standards committees efforts from the beginning And governments often mandate standards around air pollution and automotive and aviation safety because industry did not adopt them on a voluntary consensus basis Federal air pollution standards that led to the widespread adoption of the catalytic converter and reduced some automotive emissions by  percent worked through force not bottomup consensusStandards have always struggled with an image problem Critics worry that a standardized world is dull and mediocre a nightmare of conformity and Kafkaesque bureaucracy Yet the champions of standardization insist that standards create the foundations for a better world Albert Whitney who was the standards committees chairman from  to  argued that many accomplishments of civilization involved the fixation of advances The committees motto in the s declared Standardization is dynamic not static it means not to stand still but to move forward together In an age of breathless enthusiasm for the new and disruptive its worth remembering the mundane agreements embodied in the things around us Its very ordinariness and settledness of standards that enable us to survive and to move aheadAndrew Russell the dean of arts and sciences at the State University of New York Polytechnic Institute and Lee Vinsel an assistant

tweets criticize Facebook and Google but the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department is making life easier for potential monopolists in Silicon ValleyBy Matthew Buck and Sandeep VaheesanMr Buck and Mr Vaheesan work for the Open Markets InstituteAt his Senate confirmation hearing Attorney General William Barr signaled an interest in confronting the power of big tech corporations like Facebook and Google As Mr Barr put it a lot of people wonder how such huge behemoths that now exist in Silicon Valley have taken shape under the nose of the antitrust enforcers And since taking office President Trump has repeatedly attacked Americas biggest technology corporations especially Amazon Facebook and Google Among other accusations he has charged Amazon with ripping off the Post Office and Google with  censoring conservative users He recently criticized Facebook Google and Twitter for ridiculous bias in favor of Democrats By most appearances Mr Trump is a foe of big techMr Barr however will find that those huge behemoths will continue to dominate because in part the administrations chief antitrust enforcer is their champion On top of granting tech platforms huge windfalls in his tax reform law Mr Trump appointed a friend of big tech Makan Delrahim to lead the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice Mr Delrahim has consistently promoted the interests of the biggest tech companiesWhile we believe Mr Delrahim a veteran corporate defense lawyer and antitrust official in the George W Bush administration was correct on the merits in trying to stop the ATTTime Warner merger that action was an outlier In a Senate hearing in December he boasted that he strengthened the Justice Departments amicus brief program as a means of reshaping antitrust law In its briefs which represent the views of the federal government as an expert in antitrust law and are influential in court the department has supported legal interpretations that would make Amazon Google Facebook and other dominant firms more powerful On top of looking into possible procedural improprieties between the president and Mr Delrahim Congress should demand an explanation for  and put a stop to  Mr Delrahims undertheradar effort to revise antitrust lawIn the most prominent case Apple v Pepper the Supreme Court will decide any day now whether ordinary Americans can hold tech platforms accountable The Antitrust Division filed briefs siding with Apple Our organization the Open Markets Institute filed an amicus brief in support of Pepper In its briefs the Justice Department argued that iPhone users should not be able to sue Apple for monopolizing the sale of iPhone apps Although the text of federal law grants everyone consumers workers and businesses the right to sue antitrust violators for damages the Justice Department is seeking to restrict private citizens ability to hold corporate power to account In contrast a bipartisan coalition of  states filed a brief endorsing the right of all consumers to obtain compensation and be made wholeThe Justice Department took an even more radically promonopolist position in a lower court case In Viamedia v Comcast the Seventh Circuit in Chicago is now deciding whether Comcast which both operates and competes in the clearinghouse for TV advertisements in Chicago and Detroit illegally monopolized this clearinghouse when it blocked Viamedia an ad management company Through such refusals to deal monopolists can suppress emerging competition or extend their dominance into new marketsThe government advised the court to adopt the  ruling by Judge Neil Gorsuch then on the th Circuit in Novell v Microsoft which broadly insulates a monopolist from the charge that it improperly cut off rivals access to a good or service they need to compete Under Novell if someone sues a monopolist for refusing to deal with competitors the conduct is illegal only if the monopolist sacrificed profits in the process and that its sole effect was to hurt competition This standard would make stopping refusals to deal virtually impossibleThe Antitrust Divisions position in Viamedia is especially helpful to Google and Facebook whose core services are free to users Consider Facebooks  decision to cut off users friend lists from Vine a video streaming app launched by Twitter Thanks to Facebooks move users of Vine could not invite friends to join the app Under the standard endorsed by the Justice Department Facebook would be protected from legal liability for stifling Vine unless an antitrust enforcer could show that Facebook sacrificed profits in this predatory act Because Facebook does not charge users this would be a tall order for the government excluded rivals and injured consumersAlong with these promonopoly briefs the Antitrust Divisions leadership has publicly expressed almost uncritical admiration for technology giants Disregarding both congressional intent in enacting the antitrust laws and the latest evidence on the economic and political harms from corporate concentration our top antimonopoly enforcers have been fawning over monopolyMr Delrahim and his deputies routinely praise the biggest tech companies and adopt their legal rationalizations In a speech in Mexico City in November he asserted on the basis of little evidence that market power is a motivating factor for investment in a freemarket economy and disparaged rules to protect competitive markets as akin to breaking a mans leg to make him run faster Mr Delrahim recently hypothesized that large digital platforms have grown because they provide innovative and disruptive services that consumers seem to like and want to use and expressed nationalistic pride in the dominant tech platforms being American Contrary to these claims however actions by the European Commission and documents published by Britains Parliament indicate that the tech platforms have used abusive practices to maintain and extend their powerIn December Andrew Finch the Antitrust Divisions principal deputy assistant attorney general contended that consumers often benefit from concentration and dismissed calls to break up or regulate tech platforms as drasticThe division dresses up its actions in the rhetoric of humility In a June  address Barry Nigro a deputy assistant attorney general at the Antitrust Division said that when enforcing antitrust law First we should do no harm and warned we should be wary of trying to prescribe the correct path forwardYet as the Justice Departments top antitrust enforcers proclaim humility and practice restraint when it comes to monopolies they do not extend this courtesy to elected officials Cities and states seeking to structure markets through the democratic process can expect hectoring not humility from the departmentThe Justice Department has to the benefit of Uber and Lyft interfered with municipal efforts to improve the lives of ridehailing drivers These drivers on average earn less than the local minimum wage in many places In November  the Department of Justice as well as the Federal Trade Commission filed a brief against Seattles law granting collective bargaining rights to ridehailing driversThe Justice Department has also weighed in on the legality and wisdom of state rules on for example the practice of law In a statement of interest in a case challenging a Florida bars rule the Antitrust Division paid tribute to new competition from mobile platforms that can profoundly change an industry This type of freestanding policy lecture voices a hostility to democratic market structuring and is outside the divisions statutory duty to police corporate cartels mergers and monopoliesWhen trying to understand the Trump administrations position on tech monopolists ignore Mr Trumps tweets and look to what his antitrust enforcers do and say Mr Trumps antitrust chief is hindering the ability of federal state and local governments and the public to tame the power of tech giants Instead of this deference to corporate power and condescension to our elected representatives the department should be confronting monopolies in tech and elsewhere and respecting the policy

chemicals will be added to produce tiny white pellets containing carbon The pellets will then be heated to more than  degrees to form carbon dioxide gasIn one kind of plant the company hopes to build the captured carbon dioxide could be injected underground where it would be harmless unless some of it leaked back into the atmosphere Mr Oldham asserts that each such installation could eventually take as much carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere annually as  million treesIn another kind of facility captured carbon dioxide would be combined with hydrogen extracted from water to make synthetic fuel that can be processed into gasoline diesel or jet fuel The energy needed to produce hydrogen would come from wind turbines and solar panels to limit emissionsThe companys synthetic fuel would be more expensive than conventional gasoline Production costs could be about  a gallon according to Carbon Engineering compared with more than agallon average retail price in the United States But it could still be attractive to countries that spend tens of billions of dollars on crude imports like India and Japan Regulations taxing carbon could also make the fuel more attractiveThe company says its synthetic fuels could be used in standard car truck and plane engines and would cause less air pollution than traditional fuelsBurning Carbon Engineerings fuel would release carbon dioxide but it would not increase greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by much or at all because the process would be recycling carbon that was already in the air executives saidEarly investors in Carbon Engineering include the Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates and N Murray Edwards executive chairman of Canadian Natural Resources a big producer of oil sands a heavy oil that has a large carbon footprintOil and gas companies have to wonder about their future said Michael Webber an energy professor at the University of Texas at Austin They know that someday the energy mix will be different So there are a lot of motivations for this investmentOccidental wants to use the technology to find a sustainable supply of carbon dioxide that it can use to inject in its oil fields to increase pressure and extract more oil while also sequestering the carbon The company is already the largest injector in the industry but it now reinjects carbon that was found in natural underground deposits  providing little or no environmental benefit By recycling carbon taken from the air it hopes to bury as much carbon as its fuels emit or even more As an added benefit there is a federal tax credit for sequestering carbonEvery oil company should be striving to become carbon neutral said Vicki Hollub Occidentals chief executive Ultimately we think we can be carbon negative Addressing climate change is a turning point for the industryChevron is seeking to meet a different immediate need California requires refiners and other distributors to meet progressively declining targets of carbon in their fuels through  Chevron which is based in San Ramon Calif has two big refineries in the state that could use the synthetic fuelWe have a need for lowcarbon fuels said Barbara Burger president of Chevron Technology Ventures The world needs transportation fuels and the public desires them but they have an expectation that we lower the carbon content And this is one of the options to do thatBut ramping up the ambitious ideas put forward by Carbon Engineering and other companies into projects large enough to have an important environmental impact will take considerable investmentMr Oldham said one of his carbon capture and sequestration plants would remove one million tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere annually a small fraction of the more than  billion tons humanity emits in a year The sequestration process would cost roughly  per ton which in Occidentals model could be offset in part by the increased oil production it would enable The carbon could also be used to make cement and other building materialsBut in case of an acute global climate emergency governments would probably have to step in to hasten removal of carbon from the atmosphere Mr Oldham said the cost of capturing and sequestering all the carbon needed to stop climate change would require trillions of dollarsThe companys synthetic fuel could also struggle to find markets because of its costDavid Keith an applied physicist at Harvard who founded Carbon Engineering and sits on its board said the synthetic fuel would be most useful for trucks ships and planes while cars and other smaller vehicles would

twoAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byat warBy John IsmayThree hours after nightfall on Sept   the USS Wasp a United States Navy aircraft carrier slipped beneath the waves  miles southeast of Guadalcanal Hit by two or possibly three torpedoes from a Japanese submarine the crippled ship was abandoned then torpedoed by an American destroyer to send it to the bottom approximately  feet belowIn the early morning hours of Jan   researchers laid eyes on the Wasp for the first time in  years The news of that discovery and the story of the team who found the wreck was published on March  in a feature article by Ed Caesar in The Times MagazineFor more stories about the experiences and costs of war sign up for the weekly At War newsletterAboard a footlong research vessel called the Petrel originally built for servicing oil fields a group of explorers historians divers and submersible pilots have been combing the South Pacific for the graves of American warships like the Wasp since  Funded by Paul Allen a cofounder of Microsoft who died in October and who wanted to find these ships as a way to honor his fathers military service in World War II the ships stateoftheart technology allows for faster and more efficient searches than were possible even a decade agoDuring the Marine Corps fierce battle for Guadalcanal the Wasp was part of a convoy delivering reinforcements to the island While the Wasp was in transit the Japanese submarine I fired several torpedoes at the aircraft carrier in quick succession Navy officials are not completely sure if two or three of those torpedoes hit the Wasp Other torpedoes in that salvo hit the destroyer USS OBrien and the battleship USS North Carolina nearbyJapanese torpedoes of that era ran just below the surface and had large explosive warheads that detonated on contact with their target When hit multiple explosions rocked the Wasp and started fires that began to consume the ship from the inside outUnable to save the ship the Wasps crew abandoned the stillfloating aircraft carrier knowing that it would most likely sink on its own within hours To speed that process American Navy officers scuttled the carrier by firing torpedoes from a warship in their naval convoyMany underwater explorers rely on something called a sidescan sonar device Towed behind a ship it sends out acoustic waves to its left and right that bounce off the seafloor An umbilical cord connected to the device sends a stream of data back to the ship that researchers monitor for anomalies that could be ship remainsWhen Robert Ballard a reserve naval officer and oceanographer went looking for the Titanic in  he knew sidescan sonar would not be helpful because the seafloor in that part of the North Atlantic was littered with boulders deposited in the last ice age which would clutter the incoming data He towed a camera instead Rather than looking for the shipwreck itself he did something that revolutionized underwater searches He looked for the debris field ejected from Titanic as it sank  which would be a much larger target The strategy workedThe technology aboard the Petrel takes Ballards early work a step further It relies on a sensor  called an autonomous underwater vehicle or AUV  that propels and guides itself This device can dive as deep as  feet as it follows a preprogrammed route and then returns to the surface on its own Once it is craned back aboard crew members pull data from the vehicle that researchers can quickly analyzeAfter its seventh AUV run looking for the Wasp the Petrel team found the shipThe amount of seafloor the AUV takes in is immense On a typical run the uncrewed submarinelike device follows a track six miles long skimming just  feet above the seafloor while sending out lowfrequency sonar waves to its left and right In a single mission it can cover about  square nautical miles of seafloorOnce all the imagery is downloaded from the AUV and uploaded into the Petrels computers team members see a graphic representation of the entire search area and can quickly identify any promising targets If they believe they have found debris or the hull of the sunken ship they then return to the exact spot and send an uncrewed remotely operated vehicle outfitted with manipulator arms and highresolution cameras to examine the objectThe Petrel team was lucky that the Wasp went down in a relatively flat and muddy part of the ocean where things like sunken airplanes and ships clearly stand out along the seafloor Such areas are relatively rare in that part of ocean because of its proximity to the Pacifics Ring of Fire  a band of volcanoes both underwater and on land that spans the Earths crustPetrel crew members like Paul Mayer who pilots the ships remotely operated vehicle scour through records at the National Archives working with employees at the Naval History and Heritage Command in Washington who maintain a database of more than  shipwrecks and  sunken aircraft Ships logbooks surviving charts and witness testimonies all aid in deciding where to searchPaul Allens original goal was to find the USS Indianapolis a heavy cruiser sunk by a Japanese submarine during World War II While many of the ships crew members survived the torpedo attack hundreds died from exposure drowning or shark attacks while awaiting rescue Allens crew found the Indianapolis in August  Since Allens death from nonHodgkins lymphoma his team aboard the Petrel has continued its quest to find other sunken warships from the war in the PacificThe Navy has no intention to touch the wreck at all Its interest is in studying the Wasp and other wrecks the Petrel has found in part to assess the damage the ships suffered and to see what lessons can be applied to how the service builds ships in the futureThe Wasp is sitting upright on the bottom of the Pacific in pretty deep mud says Sam Cox a retired admiral who heads the Navys historical department The mud actually comes up to about where the water line was so you cant see where the actual torpedoes hitAccording to Cox the Wasp was one of the most important ships of the Pacific Fleet in the early days of the war  a time when the Navy had only a few operational aircraft carriers available to help stop the Imperial Japanese Navy When the Wasp was sunk in September  it left the USS Hornet as the sole operational carrier in the Pacific until repairs on the USS Enterprise were completed and the ship returned to actionThe Hornet was sunk not long after the Wasp during the Battle of Santa Cruz on Oct   The Petrel crew found it too on the same trip resting on the bottom about  miles northeast of GuadalcanalSome folks say Why do you want to talk about a wreck You know you lost that battle Cox says It has to do with the sacrifice the valor of US sailors These were at that time mostly professional sailors the draft had not been in effect for that longAccording to Cox illegal salvage operations in the Java Sea and the South China Sea have destroyed some British and Dutch ships from World War II that sank in relatively shallow water Their hulls were turned into scrap metal And American warships have not been immune  the wrecks of the submarine USS Perch and the destroyer USS Pope have disappeared sometime in the last two or three years The only good news is that neither one of them went down with any of their crewmen Cox says So it was a case of they salvaged US Navy property but we dont know who did itSitting in  feet of water the Wasp is not in danger of being illegally salvaged But Cox says he expects that the Navy will periodically visit the carrier and other known wrecks to ensure they remain untouchedOne ship Cox says is still at risk is the USS Houston a cruiser that sank on March   with about  crew members aboard The wreck sits only about  feet down in Indonesian territorial waters and the United States is trying to get the site designated as a maritime conservation zone

been flowing into a corner of the tech industry focused on the housing market And now there are startups to help landlords manage properties or homeowners manage sales or tenants manage their packagesBut hardly any of it touches the central problem of housing For many people it costs too muchNone of that investment nor the solutions that those companies are offering will fundamentally change the dynamic of the housing market in a way that increases housing affordability said Matt Hoffman the vice president for innovation at the national housing nonprofit Enterprise Community Partners surveying what venture capitalists have come to call proptechPolicymakers warn that the housing crisis isnt a problem technology can solve Yet its intriguing to think what might happen if investors threw money more directly at this goalMr Hoffman believes that the right ideas could help change the market And so Enterprise recently began to invest in earlystage tech startups itselfClara Brenner a managing partner at a venture capital firm the Urban Innovation Fund hears weekly from people hoping she will do the same When are you going to invest in a company they ask her that will solve the housing crisis or the homeless problemThis looking for a tech solution  I understand why people want it Ms Brenner said But she doesnt believe it exists The housing crisis is a policy problem she says one that Nimbyism zoning laws land use restrictions and tax policies have made worse She fears that the dream of a tech fix will distract voters and politicians from those culpritsTheyre waiting for some tech company to come in and sweep up this mess she said when in fact this is all of our messes and were going to have to deal with itThe existing startups that have attracted the most attention for their potential to improve affordability are the ones trying to revive the decadesold dream of prefab construction The California company Katerra has been valued at more than  billion by investors who see potential in wringing efficiencies from a construction industry that has had few productivity gains in decadesThe Seattlebased Blokable began delivering its first stackable units last year And Factory OS founded by a developer of affordable housing is now producing housing in a factory in Vallejo CalifI definitely think innovation in how we build has a significant role to getting to affordability said Carol Galante the faculty director of the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at the University of California Berkeley I can see it coming I see it happeningIt now costs as much as  per unit to build lowincome housing in the most expensive markets Savings in the cost of construction could help developers of such housing stretch subsidies further Cheaper construction could also change the math in markets where developers say its also not profitable to build middleclass housingBut Mr Hoffman is skeptical that construction tech can fundamentally change affordability marketrate developers have no incentive to pass those savings on to renters or home buyers he said And he shrugs at Dprinted houses Where am I going to put those houses he said nodding to the policy problems How long is it going to take me to find the land get through the local zoning the neighborhood planning processEnterprise is looking instead for companies that could affect how we consume finance and regulate housing Perhaps they could enable models between renting and ownership or squeeze new supply out of the housing that already exists This month Enterprise teamed up with a New Yorkbased venture capital firm MetaProp to pick and coinvest in companies MetaProps tagline Location Location InnovationTogether theyre looking not for feelgood stories but for viable businesses that could grow at Silicon Valley speed Those companies may not even have creating affordability as their goal But if that winds up being a result Enterprise will be contentWe believe that forprofit fastgrowing businesses  and we could be wrong about this  are going to have the biggest impact on this huge problem the fastest said Leila Collins a senior associate at MetaProp I dont have a lot of faith that there will be some huge policy change in the next three years that will make housing affordable in citiesPoint Digital Finance one company Enterprise has already invested in helps homeowners tap the equity in their homes in exchange for a share of the propertys future appreciation That service could help homeowners pay for constructing an accessory dwelling unit like a backyard inlaw cottage Housing experts say such smallscale units could add to the lowercost rental stock but traditional lenders often wont finance themHousing is an exceptionally knotty problem even if any one strand of it  making construction more efficient or equity more accessible or markets more transparent  sounds straightforwardThat has become clear with a Portland startup originally called NoAppFee Tyrone Poole started the company after his own eviction and stint of homelessness caused by medical debt Though an aid group gave him a years worth of rental assistance his eviction record meant he had trouble finding a landlord to accept it And he kept spending money on application fees each time a landlord rejected himMr Pooles first idea was to conduct background checks for renters and filter results to show them only the units that would accept them in view of credit income eviction or criminal histories He hoped this would help reduce homelessness and built the tool into a forprofit business providing the same service to wealthier tenants and more upscale landlordsBut he discovered that people kept applying for units they werent qualified for anyway The right matches on the platform were in the wrong neighborhood or the wrong size Most often people kept applying to homes where their incomes were too low to qualifyNow the company renamed OneApp Oregon is preparing more ambitious tools aimed at a different problem Incomes are too low Soon it will offer a cosigning service for tenants whose incomes dont qualify and a service matching tenants so that together their incomes would be enoughWere using software instead of development to create housing Mr Poole said Not actual new housing but housing thats newly accessible to peopleEven in that software cant solve the fundamental problem created in the gap between stagnating incomes and rising housing costs Mr Poole will be able to help a renter spending half his income on housing secure that housing But he cant change the reality that housing costs that muchThese larger forces shaping the market are beyond even what a  billion construction startup can disrupt or what a national nonprofit like Enterprise can bend Pull a thread in the housing market and it leads to the decline of good workingclass jobs or the federal governments longterm retreat from housing or the fundamental tension that Americans want housing to be both affordable and a good investment Its notable this month that as both Microsoft and the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative pledged major new housing investments neither proposed spending its money on tech fixes Both announced investment funds to help affordable housing developers And both plan to push for local policies that would make it easier to expand housingThat may be the most realistic route for tech startups to reshape the marketI dont blame them for not being able to solve the root cause said Molly Turner who lectures on urban innovation at Berkeleys Haas School of Business If anything I hope they make a ton of money and get a lot of clout and then help advocate for the policy changes that we needEmily Badger writes about cities and

power to monitor and suppress information on the internet drawing comparisons with Chinas muscular censorshipThe proposed changes have an authoritarian bent said one activistDetails The new rules would allow Indian officials to demand the removal of posts or videos from Facebook Twitter Google TikTok and other platforms that they deem libelous hateful deceptive or invasive of privacyInternet companies would also have to build new tools that would enable blockling unlawful information or content and would need to weaken privacy protections of messaging services like WhatsApp so that authorities can trace messages back to their original sendersWhats next Public comment on the proposal has ended so Prime Minister Narendra Modis government could implement the measures at any time

Shoshana Zuboff  pp PublicAffairs Canadian politicians dont attract much notice this side of the border but recently Ive been heeding the words of Charlie Angus A member of Canadas Parliament for the New Democratic Party Angus is a longtime punk rocker and activist with ties to the Catholic Worker movement hes also a sharp critic of the growing power of Big Tech In late November Angus attended a hearing in British Parliament in which representatives from nine countries took turns interrogating a Facebook vice president about the companys proliferating scandals an empty chair sat before a Mark Zuckerberg nameplate marking the chief executives absenceFor Angus fake news and databased manipulation  exemplified by the shadowy work of Cambridge Analytica whose voterprofiling scheme is often cited as an important factor in Donald Trumps  victory  were mere symptoms of a larger malady The problem is Facebook he declared The problem is the unprecedented economic control of every form of social discourse and communication It was one of Anguss colleagues the Canadian member of Parliament Bob Zimmer who may be the one who gave the problem a name Surveillance capitalism he said with its vast concentrations of data and influence over human life required new laws and new forms of regulationBoth Angus and Zimmer were right but before we can establish a firm legislative or regulatory agenda we have to learn what surveillance capitalism is as we come to terms with the novel form of economic and social power represented by Facebook Google and a handful of other tech behemoths privy to our every click and utterance Enter as a critical guide Shoshana Zuboff who has emerged as the leading explicator of surveillance capitalism A Harvard Business School professor emerita with decades of experience studying issues of labor and power in the digital economy Zuboff in  published a paper Big Other Surveillance Capitalism and the Prospects of an Information Civilization which has since become an essential source for anyone looking to reckon seriously with what she described as a distinct emerging economic logic Now she has followed up that paper with a doorstop of a book an intensively researched engagingly written chronicle of surveillance capitalisms origins and its deleterious prospects for our societyAccording to Zuboff surveillance capitalism distinguishes itself from its industrial forebear as a new economic order that claims human experience as a free source of raw material We are the resource to be mined the billiondollar profits of Facebook and Google are built on a general accounting of our lives and everyday behavior But surveillance capitalism is also many other things a parasitic economic logic  a rogue mutation of capitalism  a new collective order based on total certainty and an overthrow of the peoples sovereignty All this may sound a little heady like perhaps an overseasoned stew of pomo economic jargon but Zuboff will have you asking for another helping long before the books endSurveillance capitalism depends on the constant gathering of behavioral surplus or the data exhaust that we produce as part of the normal course of web browsing app use and digital consumption All of it is potentially revealing allowing companies to make sophisticated inferences about who we are what we want and what were likely to do As the economist Hal Varian noted in  Every action a user performs is considered a signal to be analyzed and fed back into the system That means that there is potentially no end to a surveillance capitalists extractive appetite which is why  in the name of more efficient services and relevant ads  companies are constantly pursuing new more granular data streams in our homes workplaces and bodies Unlike oil to which its often compared personal data is potentially limitless but its extraction and consumption may be just as toxic as were only beginning to understandUnder the regime of surveillance capitalism it is not enough simply to gather information about what people do Eventually you have to influence behavior beyond the simple suasion practiced by targeted ads Its not about showing someone the right ad you have to show it at the right place and time with the language and imagery calibrated for precise effect You have to lead people through the physical world making them show up at the sponsored popup store or vote for the preferred candidate Armed with a veritable realtime feed of a users thoughts and feelings companies are beginning to practice just this kind of coercion which is why you might see makeup ads before a Friday evening out or why inducements from a personal injury lawyer might pop up on your phone as you sit in a hospital waiting room When we want things  health information travel schedules a date  is also when we are most vulnerable when intimate data yield themselves for corporate capture The result as Zuboff notes is a perverse amalgam of empowerment inextricably layered with diminishment We seem ever more exposed to and dependent on surveillance capitalists our benevolent infolords but their operations are defined by opacity corporate secrecy and the scrim of technological authorityIn the face of all this Zuboff sees a disastrous overturning of the traditional capitalist order We are being pushed toward a society in which capitalism does not function as a means to inclusive economic or political institutions With statements like these Zuboff threatens to lose those readers who dont share her regard for a bygone halcyon era of industrial capitalism that produced what she calls traditional reciprocities defined by straightforward exchanges of money for goods and services which in turn bound people together in ostensibly healthy social economic and political arrangements Zuboffs analysis would benefit from more emphasis on the role of deregulation the declining power of organized labor and the gradual financialization of the economy With its ability to create boutique investment products that are several degrees removed from any tangible asset its finance that seems like the most obvious ideological forebear of surveillance capitalism which uses digitalization to render more of life as tradable commoditiesBut Zuboffs capacious book has room for minority opinions and other forms of dissent The Age of Surveillance Capitalism may lack a straightforward political program  Zuboff comes across as a liberal albeit not one who slots neatly on the leftright axis  but it is loaded with useful economic technological and anthropological analysis In this political vacuum Id recommend the work of Trebor Scholz a New School professor who has made a winning case for what he calls platform coops  nonprofit workerowned tech platforms that would lack the perverse incentives of surveillance capitalismWe should after all avoid a belief in tidy solutions Works of technology criticism are often expected to provide a few hundred pages of doomsaying before providing a concise final chapter in which the Gordian knot of our problems is neatly and improbably cut The Age of Surveillance Capitalism with its nearpage footprint is thankfully not that kind of book Light on prescriptivist notions Zuboff does propose a right to sanctuary based on universalist if ever more threatened humanitarian principles like the right to asylum But shes after something bigger providing a scaffolding of critical thinking from which to examine the great crises of the digital age Through her we learn that our friends to the north were indeed correct Facebook is the problem along with Google Microsoft Amazon et al This is the rare book that we should trust to lead us down the long hard road

architects and designers have been bringing nature into the workplace incorporating materials like wood and stone and strategically deploying plants and botanical artworkNow companies are inviting employees to step outside for a taste of the real thingEmployers with suburban campuses have long turned swaths of blank lawn into furnished outdoor areas where workers can meet with colleagues work alone or simply take a break from their computer screensNow developers and owners of urban office buildings are adding terraces and transforming oncebarren rooftops into parklike settings where workers can plant vegetables unfurl yoga mats or swing in a hammockTheres not a developer or forwardthinking building owner today that doesnt have this top of mind said Paul J Amrich a vice chairman for the New York area at CBRE a real estate services companyFueling this trend is growing awareness of the health and wellness benefits from contact with nature a concept known as biophilia Exposure to nature has been shown to lower levels of cortisol the human stress hormone as well as stimulate creativity Employers competing for the best workers are using outdoor amenities to show they care

said David R Greenbaum president of Vornados New York divisionNature aside outdoor work areas are a logical next step in the evolution of flexible offices Many companies already offer lounge areas and communal tables for employees to work without feeling chained to their desks A terrace or rooftop equipped with WiFi and electrical outlets can be another optionEmployees respond to additional places to touch down said John Mooz a senior managing director for the developer Hines who oversees projects in Houston and Austin TexHiness  Main a story office tower in downtown Houston has landscaped outdoor space off the th floor atop a podium that rises from the base of the tower The podium houses stores and indoor parking but instead of putting an outdoor parking lot on the roof as is common in this business district the developer hired OJB Landscape Architecture to add trees trellises and pergolasThe space has become a desirable asset for a lowerfloor office that might otherwise have been a hard sell because it did not offer superior views Mr Mooz saidUnited Airlines leased the th floor and the seven floors above it and Gensler which outfitted Uniteds offices furnished the terrace tooIts a great social gathering place said Gavin Molloy Uniteds vice president for corporate real estate adding that employees use it daily for relaxing eating lunch and meeting with coworkersLike many

according to Brett Hautop LinkedIns senior director for global design and buildOf course its one thing to introduce an outdoor work space at a sprawling lowrise campus its another to squeeze it into a

outdoor spaces in new projectsWhen Tavros Holdings Charney Construction  Development and  Oak Contracting began a mixeduse complex centered on the historic Dime Savings Bank building in the Williamsburg neighborhood in Brooklyn outdoor space was a must said Nicholas Silvers a founding partner of Tavros HoldingsTheir architect Fogarty Finger in New York added terraces to a fivestory structure for retailing and offices office tenants will furnish the terraces as they see fit Grain Collective will landscape the roof which tenants will share with renters in the complexs residential

hall as well as retail and office tenants According to renderings from the Future Green Studio in Brooklyn the perimeter of the roof will be planted with flowers and grasses interspersed with benches and picnic tablesSuch investments add significantly to construction costs according to developers architects and landscape architects Among other things roofs must be properly sealed and lightweight soils used to minimize added weight loadsBut according to Mr Amrich of CBRE a landlord can charge  to  percent more for a Manhattan office space with an outdoor areaTypically he said landlords do not

tougher times aheadBy Jack NicasDo not pity Timothy D Cook He has made hundreds of millions of dollars as Apples chief executive He is regarded as one of businesss best bosses and runs a company with a beloved brand and  billion in cash Even so he is hitting what could be the toughest time of his tenure in Apples corner office and his legacy as heir to Steve Jobs will be on the line Here are five reasonsThe signature innovation of Apples late cofounder Mr Jobs was the iPhone Mr Cooks has been his ability to crack the Chinese market That strategy delivered hundreds of millions of new customers and helped make Apple the first private company to surpass  trillion in market value by August last yearBut now it might be backfiring The Chinese economy is sputtering and the trade war between the United States and China isnt getting much better With most adults  even children  in the developed world now owning one if not two smartphones Apple has relied on China to keep growing On Wednesday Mr Cook announced a potential drop of  percent in sales in China Hong Kong and Taiwan in the most recent quarter A sharp falloff like that suggests that Chinese consumers are following a trend in other emerging markets like India and Indonesia where consumers have long passed over iPhones for cheaper almostasgood devices from Apples competitorsApples share price dropped nearly  percent on Thursday but bounced back about  percent on FridayPeople arent buying iPhones the way they used to With smartphones now in nearly every pocket in the developed world new customers are hard to come by So Apple has increasingly relied on enticing existing customers to toss their old iPhones for faster slimmer pricier successors The problem is many people arent Mr Cook said this week that customers were waiting longer to replace their iPhones with many instead swapping in new batteries to extend their life Apple fueled that trend when it cut the price of battery swaps to  from  in response to revelations that its software slowed down iPhones with old batteriesThat presents a dilemma for Mr Cook Apple wants iPhones to be durable and long lasting so consumers will see them as worthy investments Many now cost more than a refrigerator Apple also knows that the longer consumers use their iPhone the more they pay for apps and Apple services a rapidly growing and increasingly important part of Apples business But the ugly truth might be Longerlasting iPhones are bad for businessApples sophisticated supply chain is among the great wonders of modern business incorporating hundreds of suppliers in a complex web of factories and shippers to keep up with global demand for one of historys most popular products And Mr Cook who was Apples operations guru before he became chief executive is largely credited with its creationBut it soon might be in the cross hairs of President Trump Apple one of the quintessential American brands assembles most of its products in China  and Mr Trump has noticed He criticized Apple on the campaign trail saying hed force it to start making its products closer to home While president he has said Apple plans to build a lot of plants in the United States  even though it hasnt announced plans to do so Mr Cook hasnt publicly corrected himWhile Apple avoided an iPhone tax in the first rounds of tariffs it might not be so lucky if Mr Trump is looking for more products to target If that happens Apple will be in a pickle Its supply chain is entrenched in China and finding another country that can match Chinas scale and skill in the labor market will be difficult The iPhone is also already among the worlds most expensive phones Increasing the price to pay for tariffs would most likely scare away even more buyersCozying up to the president to spare Apple products from tariffs also risks angering Apples employees in liberal Silicon Valley  even some of its customers So far Mr Cook has walked a fine line holding cordial private meetings with Mr Trump while also publicly criticizing his policies without drawing the ire of the president or Apple employeesOn Friday speaking to reporters at the White House Rose Garden Mr Trump reiterated that he wanted Apple to move manufacturing to the United StatesDont forget this Apple makes their product in China he said I told Tim Cook who is a friend of mine and who I like a lot Make your product in the United States Build those big beautiful plants that go on for miles it seems Build those plants in the United StatesHe went on to say China not the United States gets the biggest benefit from Apple They build their product mostly in ChinaTwo months ago Mr Cook slipped a wonky announcement into Apples earnings call The company would no longer disclose how many iPhones Macs and iPads it sold The number of units sold in any day period is not necessarily representative of the underlying strength of our business he reasonedApple had reported the metric for years highlighting tremendous growth in iPhone sales But those sales have leveled off over the last two quarters In an earnings call at the end of January Mr Cook will probably tell investors that the iPhone business is slowing How much That will be up to people outside the company to figure out Investors were displeased  even before the surprise news about sales in China Apples shares have since dropped more than  percent shaving  billion off its market value The most valuable public company in the world not long ago is now worth less than longtime rivals Microsoft Amazon and Alphabet Googles parent companyMr Jobs presided over a historic run of innovation in his second tour at Apple from the iMac to the iPod to the iPhone to the iPad In his seven years as chief executive Mr Cook has announced the Apple Watch and AirPods which have done well but have been far from iPhonelike industry changersSo whats next That is Mr Cooks biggest challengeApple has been working on artificial intelligence and selfdriving car technology  but most industry insiders believe it is way behind competitors like Alphabet Then there is the world of digital health where Apple would face intense regulations and bureaucracy Or maybe Apple will try to build glasses that overlay a digital interface on what people see That technology called augmented reality faces enormous technical hurdles  as well as the challenge of getting people to wear a computer on their face Think of a hopefully stylish version of Googles oftmocked Google GlassWhatever he does Mr Cook faces enormous expectations It takes a lot to fuel growth at a company that had  billion in revenue in its last fiscal yearThe Apple Watch dominates the market for wearable technology and would be a smash hit for any other company For Apple Watches have been counted in the other products category in financial resultsBecause of an editing error an earlier version of this article quoted incorrectly from comments made by President Trump on

made his fortune with a timber investment fund he started in  and sold eight years later But he never forgot his difficult childhood in Portland Ore with alcoholic parents and a father who was in and out of prison twiceSo when he had the time and wherewithal to devote to philanthropy in  he said he chose to tackle a problem he knew about improving the lives of children at greatest risk  not the top students at underperforming schools but the struggling ones who faced multiple impediments to success That is the story behind Friends of the Children which began in Portland and is now in  cities with plans to be in  more by Our core model is to take the most atrisk or most vulnerable child Mr Campbell said If there are  kindergarten kids we ask for the eight most troubled most challenging onesThe organization has won plaudits from groups like the Annie E Casey Foundation a philanthropy for poor children and researchers at Stanford and the University of WashingtonThe organization has managed to address three persistent challenges that philanthropists at all levels face How can private money meaningfully influence a societal problem How can successes be replicated And how do you get other philanthropists to support what was essentially your ideaMr Campbell said he wanted to give a sense of stability to children who may not have it at home His organization hires a mentor or friend to work with just eight children who are selected in kindergarten and are expected to remain with the program until they finish high school The cost per child each year works out to about The friends are paid a wage equivalent to or slightly higher than teachers salaries in the first years of their careers And they spend four hours every week with each of their eight students  two hours in the classroom and two helping them in a variety of activities such as doing homework and going to museums and sporting events they couldnt affordFrom the start Friends of Children logged data for all of these activities to get a sense of what was working and what wasnt It found that the intensive interaction helped build trust increased the childrens positive social behavior and was more likely to keep the children out of troubleIn many cases the childrens relationship with their parent or caregiver improved A recent study by researchers at the University of Washington and Washington State University found that the paid mentor approach provided children and their caregivers with a consistency and continuity that was critical to the programs successBut the data wasnt always positive The selection of who got to be mentors made a difference They had to value education They also had to be empatheticOne person did a great interview but after first six or nine months he wasnt connecting with the children Mr Campbell said He eventually became a parole officerAfter the program had success in Portland it began to expand to other cities with a readymade offeringWhen we go to new cities as long as they keep the core were willing to let them experiment with it Mr Campbell said Its fidelity to the model versus learning and adapting over the past  yearsThe Los Angeles chapter for example is focused on atrisk children of people who grew up in the fostercare system The chapter in Austin Tex was the first to translate all the materials into Spanish and hired native Spanish speakers as mentors The one in Chicago focused on the problem of gang violenceWeve had different community solutions within the same program said Terri Sorensen chief executive of Friends of the ChildrenKim Starkey Jonker chief executive of King Philanthropies and a lecturer at Stanfords business school has written about Friends in her book Engine of Impact She said the organizations focus on one mentor for eight children helped it succeed and get results that could be replicatedFocus is so important she said Nonprofits stretch themselves too thinAt the same time Ms Jonker said the national organization knew what it could do well for all the chapters  centralized data collection marketing accounting and other back office work  and allowed chapters to adapt to their communitiesFrequently tensions tear apart nonprofits she saidThe national organization reached out to professionals who were already established in the cities where there was interest in starting a chapter The executive director of the Los Angeles chapter Thomas Lee had  years of experience in child welfare there before joining Friends last yearMr Lee was skeptical of the program at first he said but was won over by the small mentortochild ratio the competitive pay that would attract qualified candidates and the organizations ability to retain mentors for seven years on averageIts better not to have a mentor than to have one for a short time he said Its common for some kids to bounce around foster home to foster home six eight  times That doesnt help create the strategies for longterm success that wed wantJames Tyrrell  went through the Friends program in Portland and had the same mentor John Foster the entire time He credits it with helping him deal with the murder of his father when he was  his mothers leaving him with her parents and addiction problems in his familyIt was consistency with that one positive adult in my life said Mr Tyrrell a court clerk south of Portland If I didnt have him I dont know where Id beHe added that his mentor had told him You know where this path leads and you can go for it but why not try this one over here Thats what he did said Mr Tyrrell who graduated from college moved away from his family and now has a wife and two childrenDavid Shapiro chief executive of Mentor The National Mentoring Partnership and a board member of Friends said that Friends chose its mentors well but that massproducing those bonds was difficultIts much easier at a McDonalds to say Wear the uniform and cook the fries at  degrees Mr Shapiro said With humans its a lot more difficult to standardize things and every human service agency is trying to figure that out nowOne of the criticisms of Friends is how expensive it is to reach one child in a given year let alone over  years And getting other donors to give money to someone elses idea is also difficultFriends has succeeded with donors who are driven by data and measurable results It may also help that the charity focuses its marketing material on what it has achieved and aims to do not on Mr Campbells largessThe organization also requires every chapter to raise three years of operating expenses  about  million  before it can start work No more than  percent of that money can come from one person to ensure that the program has broad supportMost recently Friends received a multimilliondollar grant over several years from the basketball great Michael Jordan that will go toward chapters in Chicago and Charlotte NC It has received funding in Seattle and Los Angeles from the former Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer and his wife ConnieRachel Arnold a partner at the private equity firm Vista Equity Partners helped start a chapter in Austin Tex with her friend Nancy Pollard by raising  million from  familiesMost of the donors hadnt given to a program like this before Ms Arnold said We got donors on both sides of the political spectrum It had that broad appeal and data behind itSince  when the chapter started Ms Arnolds group has raised  millionIf Im going to invest my time and money into a program I want to see that impact she said It also really resonated she added because I know it to be true that it only takes one person to change a childs lifeAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byA racetrack veteran compares the Self Racing Cars contest in California to hotrod modders of old This event with its hackers tinkerers and engineers is just like thatBy Bradley BermanPhotographs and Video by Aaron WojackWILLOWS Calif  Faraz Khans allelectric Kia Soul is his workaday car but on a drizzly weekend last month he and his teammate Jose Rojas were hoping it would drive them to a racing milestoneSo they squeezed on safety helmets booted up their laptops and inched toward the west track of Thunderhill Raceway in rural Willows Poised behind the wheel at the starting line Mr Khan stared into a laptop balanced on his partners knees In theory this should work he said Although it might be an embarrassment The two men laughed off their nerves as Mr Rojas initiated the cars homegrown autonomous controlsMr Khan and Mr Rojas both software engineers have been using evenings and weekends since last fall to hack the Kia They are among a looseknit community of perhaps  independent hobbyistengineers who  for fun and the sake of learning  rip open vehicle dashboards and splice essential wires to turn cars into robots The bar is high You need to get a car and then you need to really mess with it Mr Khan said with another laugh Most people arent comfortable with thatThis mile serpentine course usually rumbles with Porsches Mazda roadsters and heaps of American muscle In late March however the paddock hummed with mildmannered hybrid and electric cars Several dozen gear heads of a different stripe were here for the fourth installment of Self Racing Cars  an annual opentrack event for autonomous vehicles to race against the clockThe auto industry is in the middle of its biggest technology shift in a century with untold fortunes to be made  eventually But for now the promise of selfdriving cars often outpaces the reality This competition in Northern California suggests that it might be easier to let the cars run before they can walk The racetrack strips away all of the distractions variables and traffic of street driving and lets the rubber meet the roadSelf Racing Cars is the brainchild of Joshua Schachter a Silicon Valley entrepreneur and an amateur racecar driver Mr Schachter hasnt hacked his personal vehicle but gets a kick out of turning everyday objects like shopping carts EtchaSketch toys and water droppers into improbable robotsA month before the event he explained that Self Racing Cars was an extension of his interests I want to see other peoples solutions to a problem he said And to learn about problems that I didnt know existedMr Khan and Mr Rojas named their project OpenCaret and they use laptops and Arduino boards  an opensource microcontroller platform  to trick the car into working as if it were being driven by a person Mr Khan mounted a  camera on the dashboard to provide visionTwo weeks before the race in an abandoned Sears parking lot near Mr Khans home they allowed me to drive from the passengers seat using a Microsoft Xbox controller It was a video game come to life Mr Khans foot hovered over the brake pedal in case my thumb steered off courseMr Schachter knows that automated driving is a dangerous challenge on real streets even for the big names His event boils it down Who can log the fastest lapTo transform the track into an engineering laboratory Mr Schachter enlisted the help of experienced racing officials When Joshua asked me to be a part it I didnt hesitate said Terry Geiser who over decades has overseen millions of miles of racing at Northern Californias famed motorsports venues like Laguna Seca and Sonoma Raceway Hes the track coordinator and safety engineer for Self Racing CarsIn  you couldnt buy a hot rod and take it to a drag strip said Mr Geiser a retired management consultant You had to build it yourself He explained the camaraderie shared by oldschool car guys  his generation favored British roadsters in the s  who compared notes about better ways to tune an engine or modify an exhaust system This event with its hackers tinkerers and engineers is just like that for me he saidOn their first run Mr Khans Kia Soul barely made it through the first of Thunderhills twists and turns before the steering wheel swung all the way right all the way left and back in a loop He pulled the plug and drove the Kia back to the paddockMr Geisers voice then boomed over the loudspeaker Humans youre up nextDuring long pauses in track activity while coders squash bugs the course is opened to vehicles driven by redblooded drivers Mr Schachter invited me for a ride in his brightorange  racingspec Mazda Miata Its entirely manual  no antilock brakes and definitely no Xbox controllersMr Schachter precisely maneuvered around the course flicking the gearshifter and slamming the brakes before corners The tail whipped around and we were on the straightaway approaching  miles an hour How could software and sensors ever compete against a drivers eyes hands and firing synapsesOn this day of intermittent rain and sun a fivefoot triangular patch of concrete coming off the courses third turn had a puddle With each lap Mr Schachter refined his approach to the wet spot adjusting his speed and steering into the skid You have to feel it with your hands he saidThree years ago at the first Self Racing Cars event Audi showed an autonomous sportssedan prototype Chris Urmson a former chief technology officer for Googles selfdriving car company which eventually became Waymo was on hand Other industry luminaries mingledBy contrast this years competition was more like a homebrew computer club Only four teams mostly small independent projects competedA Tesla Model X joined in It wasnt an official entrant but belongs to Andrew Navarro one of the halfdozen members of Team Soulless another competitor Mr Navarro is a systems engineer and a former Army National Guard aviation officer He now works at Polysync a company in Portland Ore that makes hardware and software to help companies digitally control steering brake and throttle controls for development and testing Polysync lent its silver Kia Niro hybrid to his teamMr Navarro is a big fan of Teslas Autopilot technology As far as vehicles that have lanekeeping and adaptive cruise control its the best around he said But hes quick to point out that a driver must monitor the Autopilot at all timesFor the first couple of turns the Model X SUV wouldnt let Mr Navarro engage Autopilot The vision system assisted by radar and ultrasonics is not designed for a track so the vehicle couldnt find the lane markings and other highway objects it expected to see Autopilot finally engaged but the vehicle got too close to the tracks edge and quitIf Teslas Autopilot couldnt make it there wasnt much hope for Mr Khan and Mr Rojas from OpenCaret the students from Team Soulless or Qibus a threeweekold company creating remote vehiclecontrol systems AEye an artificial perception outfit also tested its sensor technology at the trackBut lo and behold a red Lexus CT h hybrid hatchback fielded by Point One Navigation was zipping around the track on its own All teams must put an engineer behind the wheel ready to take over in a split secondAaron Nathan chief executive for Point One feels the pain of his competitors Three years ago Point One attended as a new company with four people Now it has  employees and is marketing its software to major automakersIn the beginning we came just to meet people and talk shop Mr Nathan said It was much more like a track day so people were not reserved like at a trade showMr Nathan and his cofounder Bryan Galusha both have advanced engineering degrees from Cornell The university participated in the s in the Darpa challenge an autonomousvehicle prize competition sponsored by the Defense Department Im very familiar with what it takes to build something that works at Darpa Mr Nathan said I feel like Self Racing Cars is the closest thing we have to that nowAutonomous technology faces many hurdles Point One focuses on a single critical element knowing precisely where the vehicle is on the road The cornerstone of its system is stationary GPS monitoring devices dispersed across the country Just one will cover a city the size of San Francisco The white boxes are about the size of a loaf of bread and have an antenna attached They analyze errors in satellite communications caused by atmospheric interference  and beam the corrections to the vehicle via a cell signal The technology can pinpoint a cars location down to half a tires worth of precision It works even in tunnels and other locations that traditional GPS cant reach We do a lot of math Mr Nathan saidTo plot the Lexus fastest racing line Mr Galusha the companys chief operating officer and an amateur racer first drove his  Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution at Thunderhill West Point One precisely recorded the Mitsubishis line This route was then transferred to the Lexus allowing it to race around the track at up to  mphTwo years ago the company managed a lap in  minutes  seconds After sitting out last year Point One returned last month with a performance of  minutes  seconds an event record That was only  seconds slower than Mr Galushas fastest lap in the Lexus The companys navigation algorithms performed reliably for  nearly identical laps over the weekendPoint One was the only team this year to complete an autonomous lap But the advantage of its technology would disappear with multiple cars racing at once Mr Schachter is considering that propositionThe essence of racing is dealing with a changing situation he said I was thinking next year about throwing a tire into the trackAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byTwitter borrows most of its best ideas from users Except the idea to set our feeds on fireBy John HerrmanThe most generous interpretation of Twitters history is that its a company that has learned a lot from the way people use its product After early users started reposting each others tweets accompanied with an RT label Twitter built retweets After a user proposed using a pound sign to create groups and people starting doing it Twitter incorporated that too Twitter didnt have a smartphone app until developers proved with their own apps that people really wanted one After one of those developers had the bright idea to let people pull down on their feeds to refresh them Twitter bought his app and got his pulldowntorefresh patent too Before sponsored tweets users sold their own posts to advertisers When Twitter launched as a service for sharing status updates it didnt even have repliesA less charitable interpretation of Twitters history is that its product is broken and perpetually deficient and that its users to whom it already owes a great deal are forced to come up with solutions of their own in order to enjoy the value that Twitter still offers somehow seemingly despite itself Those users are then left to watch Twitter implement sleek but selfserving versions of those features allowing a visionless company to succeed further than it already has There are of course some changes for which Twitter users have hopelessly yearned for years editing tweets banning Nazis But there is one missing feature that users and developers have created multiple times over that Twitter has not yet stolen or borrowed Its one the company has hardly acknowledged despite its embrace by millions of users Twitter wont help people delete their own tweetsTwitter does not share how many of it users massdelete posts but numbers provided by some of the most popular services that do that suggest its far from a fringe activity The creators of Twitter Archive Eraser an application for Microsoft Windows that gives users fine control over which posts they want to delete claim to have more than  users who have deleted more than  billion tweets Tweet Deleter a webbased service says more than  million people have used its webbased service to delete more than  million posts And the creator of TweetDelete which is perhaps the best known of these services says his app has been used by more than  million unique people  and that  million people now use the service to delete their tweets on an ongoing basis Richard West  created TweetDelete in  It wasnt his first Twitteradjacent project he had previously created Isgd a service for shortening links to keep them from using up Twitters character limit which was bought by the British cloud hosting firm Memset Twitter eventually created its own URL shortener The idea behind TweetDelete he said largely originated with Memsets cofounder Kate CraigWood She wanted a service to automatically purge old tweets from her own Twitter account for privacy reasons Mr West said Its still providing a very valuable service as Twitters solution of allowing users to manually delete tweets one by one wasnt great in  and certainly looks poor now given all thats happened in the privacy arena since then Mr West now operates the service independently and plans to release a new version soonTo the extent there has been public discussion about tweet deletion it has mostly centered on public controversies A spokesperson for Twitter Archive Eraser mentioned a spike in interest following the  firing of the director James Gunn from the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise after an organized campaign by mostly rightwing Twitter users to flag a series of offensive jokes he had made years before Some people involved in that campaign also professed a belief that similar tactics digging up old posts and feigning offense in order to get an enemy fired  had previously been used against them and that theirs was a campaign of revenge Last month Mr Gunn was reinstated as director of the third Guardians film This view on the story of deletion however privileges the anxieties of the already powerful In this telling its about welloff people being brought low again the fear that their pasts could be used to undo their futures and most of all that what they used to get away with has become a liability It fails to account for the millions of other deleters with no film franchise to loseSome of these people are surely ashamed of things theyve said on Twitter or at least fearful that someone else will think they should be But for many tweet deleters getting rid of old posts is a practical matter a replacement for simple and obvious Twitter privacy features that simply do not exist For one user it may be akin to updating a Facebook profile or brushing up a LinkedIn page for another it takes into account the demands of a new job for another deletion may be necessary to travel safely Twitter has stubbornly refused to address widespread harassment on its platform and tweet deletion offers a way to mitigate it in some forms That is probably the mostdemanded feature if you can call it that that users be able to use the service without being confronted with targeted abuse The Twitter Archive Eraser app is like Twitter most popular in the United States but according to its creators has also gained traction in Saudi Arabia where Twitter once seen as a tool of liberation has been embraced by the government as a tool for surveillance and targeted repression There are even more obvious reasons to think that Twitters users even those who arent subjected to targeted abuse deserve more control over how their content is found and consumed There is for example the concept of time A user who joined Twitter in middle school might now be in the work force Another who signed up at  around when Twitter launched in  would next year be old enough to run for president James Zeigler an indigent defense lawyer and tweet deleter in Washington DC explained via Twitter direct message its not so much that I perceive there to be that much risk associated with preserving my tweets but rather that I perceive there to be almost no benefit to it such that deleting them seems to make more sense than not Or put another way as Twitter user Saysay Olvido halfjoked recently I delete tweets because Im not the same person I was min ago She did not say personConsider the life of a tweet posted ten years ago After a short and probably uneventful time in a small spotlight it would have drifted down followers feeds and its posters own timeline as if never to be seen again There was no easy way to find or view old tweets even your own Nearly everything about the experience of using Twitter then implied that it was a rolling conversation disappearing behind its users In  the company gave users a tool to download their own posts as an archive Few users bothered But it was a sudden reminder that nothing on the platform was actually disappearing that the way a service seems to work may bear little relation to how it actually works and that the context of old posts is often as important as their contents not so much in the funny at the time sense as in the sense that Twitter was at the time a completely different machineThen in  Twitter made every public tweet ever posted searchable by anyone This was a feature that many users had demanded It was not however accompanied by commensurate new privacy controls Billions of messages that had been technically public but effectively private were instantly made accessible to anyone friend foe authority figure or online passerbyThose who had been using Twitter for years suddenly found themselves on a very different service They could search and mine their own old tweets to try to make sense of conversations they had a decade ago and they could eliminate them one by one They could make their entire accounts private making it harder for potential followers to find or talk with them They could delete their accounts entirely Or they could grant full access to their accounts to one of a growing number of Tweet deletion programs and wipe their accounts clean a fresh start corresponding with Twitters unilateral choice to turn its service from a conversation platform into a search engine That is also not deletion ideal Tweet deletion applications require unfettered access to Twitter accounts leaving users in the position of having to trust that the developers are doing what they say they will and nothing more And while tweet deletion can be empowering to people victimized by or on the platform it can also help thwart Twitters own tools and tactics for dealing with bad actors It may be unrealistic to expect a social network built on targeted advertising to let its users delete the very content against which it advertises and through which it understands its targets Please note we do not advise using massdeletion programs Twitters documentation tells users Tweet deletion apps use Twitters official developer platform and could be shut down at the companys pleasure Facebook for example does not let developers create such programs but does let users make old posts invisible The company suggests an unwieldy and narrow alternative If youre looking to get a fresh start on your Twitter account without losing your username the best way to do this is to create another account with a temporary username and then switch the username between your current account and the new account Asked if Twitter had taken note of the millions of people expressing interest in having greater control over their privacy or perhaps simply in vaporizing their past Twitter selves the company declined to share specific plans We know that people who use Twitter are interested in more efficient ways to manage archive or delete their Tweets and we are thinking about ways we can meet these needs said Twitter spokesperson Nicholas Pacilio Twitter noticed when people starting using image hosting services to share pictures so it changed to let them upload images directly When Twitter bumped its character limit from  to  characters CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted Proud of how thoughtful the team has been in solving a real problem people have when trying to tweet Ultimately the platform seems to be most observant when its users come up with ideas that help people use Twitter more  when we present or solve problems in a way that aligns with the companys business But tweet deleters are asking for something Twitter may not be so willing to give them a way to be less engagedJohn Herrman covers tech and media for the Times Magazine and was one

other cities are turning to a bot to imitate women selling sex to men looking to buy it Its a new tool in the drive to break up trafficking rings By Tina RosenbergMs Rosenberg is a cofounder of the Solutions Journalism Network which supports rigorous reporting about responses to social problemsSecond of two articlesA man texts an online ad for sexHe gets a text back Hi Papi Would u like to go on a date Theres a conversation what hed like the woman to do when and where to meet how much he will payAfter a few minutes the texts stop Its not unexpected  women offering commercial sex usually text with several potential buyers at once So the man too usually texts several women at onceWhat he doesnt expect is this He is texting not with a woman but with a computer program a piece of artificial intelligence that has taught itself to talk like a sex workerHe doesnt expect the text a few days later with a picture of a man sitting in jail and this message This is the New York Police Department Your response to an online ad for prostitution has been logged Offering to pay or paying someone for sexual conduct is a crime and punishable by incarceration up to  years The NYPD posts hundreds of decoy advertisements that are indistinguishable from the real thing People who show up in response to our ads are likely to get arrestedHe doesnt know which ad he texted triggered the message He doesnt know what could happen next But he knows the police have his number in every senseYoure not anonymous said Lt Christopher Sharpe who runs the departments Human Trafficking Team We may have the ability to find out who you are and what social media you like to use We are considering engaging people on their social mediaThe hardcore people are still going to show up and we will get this person Lieutenant Sharpe continued But plenty of people are on the fence If they think they can get away with it without any harm they may try to show up Our segment is really the fencesitters If they get this message weve knocked them out of the market One guy responded I cant stop thinking about everything I can lose My fianc my job my friends I have something to lose in thisLast week I wrote about the efforts of Truckers Against Trafficking to encourage commercial drivers to spot trafficking and call a national hotline if they see the signs Sex trafficking is a huge lucrative industry Its global and local  in ordinary American towns Helping the victims and putting trafficking rings out of business is lifesaving work But by itself that cant end trafficking If its successful the reduction in supply could even make sex trafficking more lucrativeIf the money is still there to make sex traffickers will find another victim said Robert Beiser founder of Seattle Against Slavery a yearold organization that recently introduced a different chatbot called Freedom Signal Thats why disrupting buyers is so important We dont want this thing to be an endless hamster wheelTargeting buyers is not new Police departments have long put undercover female officers onto the street and arrested their wouldbe customers The Human Trafficking team still does this It also investigates leads about sex trafficking Lieutenant Sharpe said his unit runs about  such cases each year the average age of victims found was under  In one case a single person was controlling  womenThe raids also make the chatbots more effective Buyers need to feel a credible risk said Rob Spectre the founder and chief executive of childsafeai which built the vice departments chatbot If no one got arrested no buyer would be deterredThe new chatbots are safer and cheaper than inperson operations and they are always on the job They can deter far more buyers than undercover operations can  before they buy sex Lieutenant Sharpe said chatbots were  percent more effective than full operationsThe New York police wait several days to send deterrence messages so that men wont know which phone number was the decoy The perception for the buyer has to be that any ad could be the ad that sends him to jail Mr Spectre saidWhile prostitution is still illegal almost everywhere in the United States the police are increasingly arresting only buyers For people engaged in prostitution the most progressive law enforcement agencies offer social services such as shelter job training and substance abuse treatment Even if they havent been forced into it they have still chosen a dangerous and unpleasant vocation as the best of their bad options  which means they need more options The New York police still make arrests for prostitution but the numbers have dropped substantially and most of those arrested go to special diversion courts that give people suspended sentences to receive services like counseling and drug treatment instead of jailThis approach is much better than treating people in prostitution as criminals But there is a debate about whether to legalize all of it Criminalization makes the most marginalized even more vulnerable to exploitation according to RJ Thompson managing director of the Sex Workers Project at the Urban Justice Center We should take it out of the shadows and treat it as work There is trafficking in the restaurant business as well Mr Thompson said but no one argues we shouldnt eat outHe said that current law enforcement practices to fight sex trafficking end up making life harder for prostitutes in general Conflating prostitution and sex trafficking results in actual policies and legislation that impact workers in very negative ways in the guise of antitrafficking laws he saidA  study of the experiences of  countries found that legalizing prostitution  buying as well as selling sex  does make life healthier and safer for prostitutes and encourages buyers to prefer legal prostitutes over illegal ones who are more likely to be trafficked But that same study also found that legalization increased human trafficking because the demand for commercial sex increased greatlyThe New York Police Department started using its decoy chatbot in January  The Cook County Sheriffs Office in the Chicago area uses a childsafeai chatbot as well Six other cities use it intermittently as part of a national twiceyearly campaign to go after buyers of sexFreedom Signals developer Seattle Against Slavery is still mostly volunteer the tech team for example has one paid employee and a lot of volunteers with day jobs at Amazon or Microsoft Freedom Signal asks partner cities to cover its costs and many can using federal antitrafficking grants But if a city cant pay Mr Beiser will provide it free He said that  cities are using it including the Cook County and Los Angeles County sheriffs and Bostons policeIn its early days Freedom Signal placed ads that popped up when someone typed in the usual terms of a search for sex online Some ads warned of the harm that buying sex can cause Others offered men help in quitting a behavior harmful to them and their familiesThen Mr Beiser realized that online ads could make it easy to reach people in prostitution  after all they had published their phone numbers Freedom Signal began sending mass texts to the numbers In the text a trafficking survivor introduces herself and says I was in the life and now I help people find housing and counseling Are you interested in talking moreIt was incredibly effective   times more effective than the street outreach efforts we were doing in the past Mr Beiser said It can be dangerous for a woman to have that conversation on the street Maybe a pimp or trafficker is watching them he said But if we send them a text they can respond back and delete it They can have a semianonymous conversation and dont have to look anyone in the eyeHe said that depending on the city Freedom Signal gets responses from between  and  percent of the numbers texted He asks cities that use its buyer deterrence chatbot to also send these texts offering services  as long as the city has services availableThe New York Police Department has sent sex buyers thousands of deterrence messages About one out of five recipients write back Mr Spectre said They are shook he said Some are genuinely penitent I will certainly take it to heart Its not happening again A lot of people are angry Theres a lot of very explicit reaction And a lot of sorry it wasnt me  the number of people that appear to be loaning their phone to complete strangers is really highOne measure of whether the project is effective is whether buyers are caught a second time Only about  percent are Lieutenant Sharpe said and that number has been declining over the course of the year That could mean theyre being more careful or theyre outside the online marketplace or theyre out of the game Mr Spectre said But it is a possible indication its effective at reducing the buyingMr Beiser said Freedom Signal did internal tests of its effectiveness by not sending deterrence messages to some buyers Those who got the messages were  to  percent less likely to be caught again than those who didntMany repeat buyers hang out on hobby boards  the equivalent of Yelp for commercial sex  where men discuss and rate providers Lieutenant Sharpe said that his team members also hang out in these forums one strategy is to post many reviews of a decoy number to drive it to the top of the listThe deterrence messages that work best according to Mr Spectre warn men of the possible consequences they can face like arrest and significant fines Talking about the possibility that the woman is trafficked or a minor isnt as effective He said that in thousands of text chats the New York police have seen only  men ask the womans ageFreedom Signal has one chatbot that mentions that she is   and men went there anyway Mr Beiser said that the usual rate of completing a conversation  agreeing on a specific sex act and price  is  to  percent The underage bots rate is  to  percent Men told the

fundsThese days some managers are offering ETFs as tools for specialization at the expense of diversification carving up the stock market into ever thinner slices for investors eager to find other next big thingsETFs have evolved from covering only broad indexes such as the SP  to sectors like energy and health care industries like homebuilding and gold mining and lately to subsets of industries  niches within niches  often in ultracool areas like robotics cybersecurity and video gaming that capture investors imaginations and then their moneyWhile investment advisers occasionally use thematic funds when managing assets for their clients they typically encourage small investors to avoid the practice no matter how enticing it might be to try to find the next Amazon Netflix or Google before it becomes a technological colossusWe would prefer that someone build a portfolio around more diversified funds said Jason Browne chief investment strategist of the FundX Investment Group a firm that manages fund portfolios for highnetworth individuals He warned If youre an average investor you will probably look back and think this is something you were sold and not something thoughtfully invested in thats aligned with your longterm goalsLike Mr Browne Christopher Cordaro chief investment officer of RegentAtlantic a Morristown NJ financialplanning firm said he sees more fund marketing than fund management at work with narrowly focused ETFsIt sort of reminds me of The Graduate when the guy takes Benjamin aside and says Ive got one word plastics Mr Cordaro said Providers of these funds are looking for things that sound good to people then they give them an itch theyll want to scratchSam Masucci chief executive of the ETF Managers Group which manages about  billion across  thematic portfolios said funds dedicated to such narrow market segments are especially dependent on investor demand and are introduced in areas experiencing a surge in popularityHis companys thematic funds are a mix of actively managed and passively managed portfolios In addition to cybersecurity and gaming funds they cover some highly focused even obscure industries including mobile payments and drone technology And for anyone worried that all that cuttingedge technology will make human beings too efficient and productive the company also offers the Alternative Harvest fund which invests in companies involved in marijuana productionAnyone interested in these areas despite admonitions like Mr Brownes has several alternatives to choose fromA recent report on thematic ETFs by Todd Rosenbluth director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA Research highlighted two gaming funds  VanEck Vectors Video Gaming and eSports and ETFMG Video Game Tech  and two that invest in cybersecurity ETFMG Prime Cyber Security and First Trust Nasdaq CybersecurityThe report also mentioned four that cover the burgeoning field of robotics ROBO Global Robotics and Automation Index Global X Robotics and Artificial Intelligence First Trust Nasdaq Artificial Intelligence and Robotics and iShares Robotics and Artificial IntelligenceThe performance of many of them last year illustrates the perils of owning an idea that would seem to have a lot of promise but so far has not delivered on it The SP  fell  percent last year and the Nasdaq Composite Index a benchmark for technology stocks lost  percent The ETFMG gaming fund lagged both indexes badly losing  percent while the VanEck gaming fund was down  percent just since its introduction in midOctoberThe cybersecurity funds did much better ETFMG Prime Security rose  percent in  and the First Trust fund eked out a  percent gainAs for the robotics portfolios their returns have been awful None of the four came close to matching the Nasdaq index Losses last year ranged between  percent and  percentBecause interest in these areas tends to come and go Mr Browne uses thematic ETFs to carry out shortterm asset allocation decisions Haim Israel head of thematic investing at Bank of America Merrill Lynch by contrast views several technologies covered by the ETFs as longterm opportunitiesThe business and investment prospects associated with themes like Big Data artificial intelligence privacy and cyberthreats the report said will be helped by a techceleration resulting from the introduction of socalled G technology featuring much faster data transmission rates The rollout of G will bring about the fastest transformation in human history Mr Israel predicted The reduced time it will take to transmit data will help the spread of all sorts of technologies like gaming or selfdriving cars he saidMr Israels analysis and outlook are plausible  for the world as it is today and for various technologies as they have developed so far As for five years from now who knows Change often radical and unforeseeable is a hallmark of the sector making most forecasts speculative at best That is one of the main complaints that investment advisers have with thematic ETFsWeve been around long enough to see a lot of the next big thing said Leon LaBrecque chief executive of LJPR Financial Advisors in Troy Mich Remember Blockbuster or Boston Chicken Anyone remember the first search engine New tech becomes old techFor investors interested in taking a shot with thematic ETFs advisers suggest using risk capital and then only small amounts of itMr Masucci views thematic ETFs as superior alternatives to buying individual stocks These ETFs are a tax efficient liquid transparent way to give that exposure without relying on advisers ability to pick stocks he saidBut Mr Cordaro pointed to a conundrum that anyone contemplating investing in thematic ETFs faces Because they can be riskier you wouldnt want them to be too much of your portfolio no more than  percent he said The paradox is thats not going to move the needle that much Youre not going to make much money on itIf you still want to try to move the needle he advises doing it with funds that emphasize smaller younger businesses that are pure plays in a particular niche and that dont fill their portfolios with established companies that only dabble in fledgling technologyMr Rosenbluth noted in his report for instance that the VanEck and ETFMG gaming funds both hold the gaming stocks Activision and Electronic Arts but only the ETFMG fund owns the larger more diversified tech stocks Apple and Microsoft By contrast the ETFMG cybersecurity portfolio is more skewed toward smaller software companies than First Trust Nasdaq Cybersecurity while the latter holds more in big defense companies like Raytheon than the ETFMG fund doesAs for the robotics funds the two with portfolios published on thirdparty sites like Morningstars ROBO Global Robotics and Global X Robotics each own big companies like Nvidia and Intuitive Surgical and smaller ones like Helix Energy SolutionsIn the end the most effective way to invest in the next big thing may be to avoid trying to do it through thematic ETFs at allWhy even go for that ride is the question Mr Browne said When you own a diversified fund whatever drives the economy is going to be in your portfolio It doesnt rely on your or my predictions of what thats going to beMr LaBrecque recommended a similarly broad simple approachWe can buy the SP  and get the new FANGs a reference to Facebook Amazon Netflix and Google and the next acronym of choice he said And we can get the companies that make all the stuff people buy on Amazon and the cars people drive to the store to buy the food to eat while they watch Netflix And when the next thing comes along we can own that as wellAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy David StreitfeldSAN JOSE Calif  Silicon Valley ended  somewhere it had never been embattledLawmakers across the political spectrum say Big Tech for so long the exalted embodiment of American genius has too much power Once seen as a force for making our lives better and our brains smarter tech is now accused of inflaming radicalizing dumbing down and squeezing the masses Tech company stocks have been pummeled from their highs Regulation looms Even tech executives are calling for itIn the face of such a sustained assault this might be a good moment for Big Tech to lie low It could devote some of its mountains of cash  Apple alone has  billion in the bank  to genuine good works and allay widespread fears it wants to control your data and your destinyThat is not the path the companies are takingThe tech companies are not flinching said Bob Staedler a Silicon Valley consultant Nothing has hit them on the nose hard enough to tell them to cut back Instead they are expanding Theyre going around the country acquiring the best human capital so they can create the next whizbang thingThere is so much of life that remains undisrupted The companies are competing to own the cloud  to become in essence the internets landlord They have designs on cities Google made a deal in  to reimagine a chunk of waterfront Toronto from the ground up Amazon is reworking the definition of community from the inside as warehouses in rural areas provide the urban middle class with everything they want to stay home all weekendThese changes are only beginning to redefine society When every home has an Amazon Echo Google Home an Apple HomePod or some other smart speaker the companies are already signaling all human and metaphysical needs will be fulfilled For those who insist on venturing out there will be driverless cars operated by Big Tech And the companies are plunging further into artificial intelligence with consequences unclear even to themTo accomplish all this Big Tech needs hundreds of thousands of new employees which means it needs somewhere to put them This isnt a matter of reconfiguring a floor or two at corporate headquarters It means building new campuses around the countryBig Techs push into New York City and the Washington area has been well documented in recent months with Google bulking up in the first and Amazon planning satellite offices in both But even in its backyard of Silicon Valley which is a mess of traffic congestion and housing prices that have attained levels even wellpaid engineers can scarcely afford there is a boom that if anything is acceleratingAnyone who wants to believe Big Tech is chastened should visit a section of San Jose just west of downtown a jumble of carwashes and autobody shops with a sprinkling of modern apartments On a short street there is a house nearly a century old a tiny thing with only one bath Google bought it and another house last month in a package deal for  million according to county documents reviewed by The Mercury NewsMultiply that real estate transaction by dozens big parcels and small totaling hundreds of millions of dollars to date Google is planning very long term here The buses light rail Caltrain and Amtrak trains that converge on the Diridon Station transit center will give the company an opportunity to embed mass transit into its growth The eventual result will be a new Google campus of eight million square feet with offices for  workers a figure that is more than the companys total employment in But Diridon Station is just a part of Googles Silicon Valley expansion A week before the company got the two houses it bought a squarefoot building in Palo Alto Calif for  millionFacebook keeps growing too In the spring it leased one million square feet in the Silicon Valley community of Sunnyvale for its fastgrowing community operations team which deals with safety and security issues confronting Facebook users And it will soon move this year into  square feet in a San Francisco tower making it the thirdbiggest tech tenant in the city after Salesforce and UberIn total Googles employment increased  percent in the last year Facebooks work force rose by  percent in that time to  and it is advertising  additional jobsAmazons head count tripled over the last three years thanks to its warehouses and the acquisition of Whole Foods It is only the second company in the United States to employ more than  people  and that is not counting its contractorsThe expansion underlines the dizzying truth of Big Tech It is barely getting startedFor all intents and purposes were only  years into a  or year process of moving from analog to digital said Tim Bajarin a longtime tech consultant to companies including Apple IBM and Microsoft The image of Silicon Valley as Nirvana has certainly taken a hit but the reality is that we the consumers are constantly voting for themThats evident in how robust Big Techs businesses remain Last March the research firm eMarketer said Facebook including its less controversial photosharing site Instagram would earn  billion this year from digital ads in the United States In September it raised that forecast to  billionEMarketer also revised up its forecasts of Googles digital ad revenues in the United States for   and  The third big digital advertising recipient is Amazon which is far behind the leaders but gaining ground fastThe contradiction is becoming increasingly obvious One important way Big Tech serves its customers is by tracking their movements and purchases which is beginning to unnerve at least some of us In a Pew Research Center survey in June  percent of adult Facebook users said they had taken a break of several weeks from the site But even as we say we trust tech less we invite it deeper into our livesApple Amazon Facebook and Alphabet Googles parent company together generated  billion in revenue in the third quarter of  alone  up  percent from a year earlier when the four companies hauled in  billionMuch as people are now wary or even unhappy with the outsized power held by Facebook Google Amazon etc they are simultaneously quite dependent on the services they provide said David Autor an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyBig Tech needs to be regulated many are beginning to argue and yet there are worries about giving that power to the governmentThe government doesnt have a good clue said Mr Bajarin the consultant Theyre not even asking the kind of questions that would drive to regulationWhich leaves regulation up to the companies themselves always a dubious propositionFor Facebook to have a better year in  it needs to be more upfront and transparent said Debra Aho Williamson an analyst at eMarketer This was also the advice Facebook got for  to little availAll this could change if the antitech mood continues to swell or the economy hits a really rough patch On the other hand the last recession tended to work in Big Techs favor by giving smaller competitors even more to worry aboutDuring the  financial crisis Amazons North American media sales increased  percent Borders one of its biggest bookselling competitors saw revenue drop  percent reported a record loss and was soon defunctWith so little to really worry about Big Tech is planning for a future far beyond any presentday turmoil Google which has  job openings says it is too early to say what the thousands of Diridon employees will do But Jonathan Taplin director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California has a good idea everythingTheyre in the transportation business the medical business every business said Mr Taplin a frequent critic of how Big Tech took over a decentralized independent internet There is no aspect of your life that they will not be involved inFollow David Streitfeld on Twitter DavidStreitfeldAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byLet us help you start your dayBy Alisha Haridasani GuptaWant to

Eduardo PorterPHOENIX  Its hard to miss the dogged technological ambition pervading this sprawling desert metropolisTheres Intels  billion sevennanometer chip plant going up in Chandler In Scottsdale Axon the maker of the Taser is hungrily snatching talent from Silicon Valley as it embraces automation to keep up with growing demand Startups in fields as varied as autonomous drones and blockchain are flocking to the area drawn in large part by light regulation and tax incentives Arizona State University is furiously churning out engineers And yet for all its success in drawing and nurturing firms on the technological frontier Phoenix cannot escape the uncomfortable pattern taking shape across the American economy Despite all its shiny new hightech businesses the vast majority of new jobs are in workaday service industries like health care hospitality retail and building services where pay is mediocreThe forecast of an America where robots do all the work while humans live off some yettobeinvented welfare program may be a Silicon Valley pipe dream But automation is changing the nature of work flushing workers without a college degree out of productive industries like manufacturing and hightech services and into tasks with meager wages and no prospect for advancementAutomation is splitting the American labor force into two worlds There is a small island of highly educated professionals making good wages at corporations like Intel or Boeing which reap hundreds of thousands of dollars in profit per employee That island sits in the middle of a sea of less educated workers who are stuck at businesses like hotels restaurants and nursing homes that generate much smaller profits per employee and stay viable primarily by keeping wages lowEven economists are reassessing their belief that technological progress lifts all boats and are beginning to worry about the new configuration of work Recent research has concluded that robots are reducing the demand for workers and weighing down wages which have been rising more slowly than the productivity of workers Some economists have concluded that the use of robots explains the decline in the share of national income going into workers paychecks over the last three decadesBecause it pushes workers to the less productive parts of the economy automation also helps explain one of the economys thorniest paradoxes Despite the spread of information technology robots and artificial intelligence breakthroughs overall productivity growth remains sluggishThe view that we should not worry about any of these things and follow technology to wherever it will go is insane said Daron Acemoglu an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of TechnologySemiconductor companies like Intel or NXP are among the most successful in the Phoenix area From  to  the productivity of workers in such firms  a measure of the dollar value of their production  grew by about  percent per year according to an analysis by Mark Muro and Jacob Whiton of the Brookings Institution Pay is great  a week on average according to government statisticsBut the industry doesnt generate that many jobs In  the semiconductor and related devices industry employed  people in the Phoenix area about  fewer than three decades ago We automate the pieces that can be automated said Paul Hart a senior vice president running the radiofrequency power business at NXPs plant in Chandler The work force grows but we need AI and automation to increase the throughputAxon which makes the Taser as well as body cameras used by police forces is also automating whatever it can Today robots make four times as many Taser cartridges as  workers once did less than  years ago said Bill Denzer Axons vice president for manufacturing Workers jobs were saved because the company brought other manufacturing work back from MexicoThe same is true across the hightech landscape Aircraft manufacturing employed  people in  compared to  in  Computer systems design services employed  people in  up from  in Most of the growth in the Phoenixarea job market since  has come in lowproductivity industries like health care

look on the other side of the economy where productivity is low Building services like janitors and gardeners employed nearly  people in the area in  and health care and social services accounted for  workers Restaurants and other eateries employed  workers  more than at the trough of the recession in  They made less than  a weekThe biggest single employer in town is Banner Health which has about  workers throughout a vast network that includes hospitals outpatient clinics and home health aides Though it employs highpaid doctors it relies on an army of lower paid orderlies and technicians A nursing assistant in Phoenix makes  a year on average A home health aide makes  While Banner invests heavily in technology the machines do not generally reduce demand for workers There are not huge opportunities to increase productivity but technology has a significant impact on quality said Banners chief operating officer Becky KuhnThe  most productive industries in Phoenix  where productivity ranges from  to  million per worker according to Mr Muros and Mr Whitons analysis  employed only  people in   more than in  Employment in the  industries with the lowest productivity where it tops out at  per worker grew  times as much over the period to The same is true across the national economy Jobs grow in health care social assistance accommodation food services building administration and waste services Not only are some of the tasks tough to automate employers have little financial incentive to replace lowwage workers with machinesOn the other end of the spectrum the employment footprint of highly productive industries like finance manufacturing information services and wholesale trade has shrunk over the last  yearsEconomists have a hard time getting their heads around this Steeped in the belief that technology inevitably leads to better jobs and higher pay they long resisted the notion that the Luddites of the th century who famously thrashed the weaving machines that were taking their jobs might have had a point In the standard economic canon the proposition that you can increase productivity and harm labor is bunkum Mr Acemoglu saidBy reducing prices and improving quality technology was expected to raise demand which would require more jobs Whats more economists thought more productive workers would have higher incomes This would create demand for new unheardof things that somebody would have to makeTo prove their case economists pointed confidently to one of the greatest technological leaps of the last few hundred years when the rural economy gave way to the industrial eraIn  agriculture employed  million Americans By  tractors combines and other equipment had flushed  million people out of the sector But as farm labor declined the industrial economy added jobs even faster What happened As the new farm machines boosted food production and made produce cheaper demand for agricultural products grew And farmers used their higher incomes to purchase newfangled industrial goodsThe new industries were highly productive and also subject to furious technological advancement Weavers lost their jobs to automated looms secretaries lost their jobs to Microsoft Windows But each new spin of the technological wheel from plastic toys to televisions to computers yielded higher incomes for workers and more sophisticated products and services for them to buySomething different is going on in our current technological revolution In a new study David Autor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Anna Salomons of Utrecht University found that over the last  years jobs have fallen in every single industry that introduced technologies to enhance productivity The only reason employment didnt fall across the entire economy is that other industries with less productivity growth picked up the slack The challenge is not the quantity of jobs they wrote The challenge is the quality of jobs available to low and mediumskill workersAdair Turner a senior fellow at the Institute for New Economic Thinking in London argues that the economy today resembles what would have happened if farmers had spent their extra income from the use of tractors and combines on domestic servants Productivity in domestic work doesnt grow quickly As more and more workers were bumped out of agriculture into servitude productivity growth across the economy would have stagnatedUntil a few years ago I didnt think this was a very complicated subject The Luddites were wrong and the believers in technology and technological progress were right Lawrence Summers a former Treasury secretary and presidential economic adviser said in a lecture at the National Bureau of Economic Research five years ago Im not so completely certain nowThe growing awareness of robots impact on the working class raises anew a very old question Could automation go too far Mr Acemoglu and Pascual Restrepo of Boston University argue that businesses are not even reaping large rewards for the money they are spending to replace their workers with machinesBut the cost of automation to workers and society could be substantial It may well be that Mr Summers said some categories of labor will not be able to earn a subsistence income And this could exacerbate social ills from workers dropping out of jobs and getting hooked on painkillers to mass incarceration and families falling apartSilicon Valleys dream of an economy without workers may be implausible But an economy where most people toil exclusively in the lowliest of jobs might be little betterEduardo

prosecutor told the WaPo that moneylaundering charges are one of the most powerful weapons that the Justice Department can wield in court and can lead to much longer sentences than simpler fraud

invited them to stayChina which has invested billions in Venezuela urged all sides to resolve their political differences Russia warned the US not to intervene in Venezuelas domestic affairs and Mexico has notably held back on recognizing Mr GuaidBackground Venezuelas government has overseen the neartotal collapse of its economy Heres a primer on how the country got to this dire situationWhat

preference for the GOP with just  percent designated as Democrats For executives to be counted as either two thirds of their donations had to go to candidates affiliated with one partyAbout a quarter were considered neutral The report doesnt disclose who was in each category but its authors told Andrew that Tim Cook of Apple was neutral having donated to both Hillary Clinton and Paul Ryan over the yearsThe disparity was narrower in some sectors Tech and internet companies had somewhat more Democraticleaning CEOs And female leaders were nearly evenly split between the GOP Democrats and neutral territoryBut the Republicans are quieter The study found that there was a statistically significant association between a company having a Republican CEO and less disclosure of political

sides of the Pacific Ana Swanson and Keith Bradsher of the NYT writeWhat America could get The deal would require Beijing to make big purchases of American agricultural and energy goods and to lower some barriers that prevent American companies from operating in China The potential agreement would expand markets for American financial services firms and farmers in part by requiring that China buy large amounts of energy and farm goods like liquid natural gas and soybeans The Trump administration has also been pushing China to accept an enforcement mechanism that would enable the United States to quickly reinstate tariffs if Beijing fails to live up to specific promisesAnd China In return the United States would most likely drop its tariffs on at least  billion of the  billion worth of Chinese imports currently subject to American levies Beijing is also pushing for the elimination of all of the Trump tariffs a person with knowledge of the negotiations saidBut early details indicate it would do little to substantively change the way China has long done business and would not force Beijing to curtail cyber theft or the subsidies that the administration complains create an uneven playing field for American companies The language aimed at Chinas discrimination against foreign companies like its antimonopoly law or standardsetting processes is probably too vague to be enforceable according to an unidentified source The pact also doesnt alter Chinas tight restrictions on data and many of the big purchases that Beijing is promising would occur over a number of years

celebrated And as in years past brands paid millions of dollars this year for the opportunity to make consumers laugh cry and reach for their walletsThe advertisers for Super Bowl LIII seemed determined to steer clear of controversy for a second year after politically tinged spots stole the show in Instead they offered commercials that championed women looked to the future and also inspired nostalgia for the s  accompanied of course by a parade of celebrities Cameos included Serena Williams Jason Bateman Cardi B and the Backstreet Boys There was a surprise mashup between Bud Light and HBOs Game of Thrones and Burger King relied on vintage footage of Andy Warhol eating a Whopper for its Super Bowl momentFollow along with live updates and analysis from MercedesBenz StadiumIt seems like theres an awful lot of humor and light appeals and that for advertisers its somewhat of a playitsafe year said Charles R Taylor a professor of marketing at the Villanova University School of Business Were not hearing about anything crossing over in politicsWendy Clark the chief executive of the agency DDB Worldwide said that it was hard for ads to break through during a quiet game describing the array as something of a mishmashI kind of look at some of these and think some of them are just fine ads  Im just not sure theyre Super Bowl ads Ms Clark said People have perhaps forgotten that yes youve got all these eyes and attention but there is still competition for people being around you and talking to you and food and drink and the game itselfThe talk about trouble for the TV business has never extended to the Super Bowl where the average cost of a second spot climbed to a cool  million last year according to Kantar Media It is roughly the same this year That figure rose by  percent in the previous decade while the average rate for other primetime ads fell by  percent according to the firm More than  million people were expected to watch the CBS telecastBud Light ran two spots that got people talking both featuring its medieval cast of charactersOne began with a joust and allowed Game of Thrones characters including a dragon to hijack the spot ultimately advertising both Bud Light and the final season of the muchloved HBO show which starts on April  Ultimately fans might be thirstier for the show than the beer The spot tapped into the same show enthusiasm that Doritos harnessed last year with an ad that featured Morgan Freeman and Peter DinklageIf you look at Bud Light theyve been in this medieval world so its smart on their part to try to get at the love of Game of Thrones said Liz Taylor chief creative officer of the agency FCBs Chicago office But its an uncommon type of collaboration she saidMs Clark of DDB said No one saw that coming as a Game of Thrones ad and I thought it was a fantastic and very brave pairupThe agency Droga which collaborated with Bud Lights agency WiedenKennedy said that more than  people from the shows crew worked on the ad That included David Nutter who has directed several of notable Game of Thrones episodes The agencies sought to mimic the unexpected twists from the show by killing off the Bud KnightChris Spadaccini HBOs head of marketing said the network was looking for a partner that would be willing to make a bold sacrifice for the throneEarlier Bud Light ran a commercial that showed its characters receiving a shipment of corn syrup supposedly meant for either Miller Lite or Coors Light MillerCoors quickly responded saying that none of its products contain any high fructose corn syrup and that a number of AnheuserBusch items do The National Corn Growers Association also expressed disappointment with the company on TwitterIt was interesting they went for a broad brand play there and actually attacked their competitors said Jon Haber cofounder of the ad agency Giant Spoon They did it in a funny and cute way The aim seemed to be to put that little seed of doubt in there for consumers in stores who are deciding between the three brands he saidPepsi and Coke have done it to each other for years Mr Haber said of the jab Its a triedandtrue traditionTurboTax ran a spot featuring a disconcerting character named RoboChild who was told that he could not work at the company when he grew up Walmart showed an array of futuristic cars from movies and TV shows to promote online ordering and pickup Ads for Mercedes and Pringles used voice assistants and robots appeared in an ad for Michelob UltraIts finally the Super Bowl where the message is more about the future than anything else said Mr Haber of Giant Spoon Everyones showing their digital transformation capabilitiesMs Taylor of FCB said Thats kind of the cultural moment that people are tapping into  AI and robots and techDerek Rucker a professor of marketing at Northwestern Universitys Kellogg School of Management said that as advertisers played it safe regarding political messages they seemed to be relying on technology as a way to safely incorporate modern culture into their commercialsThat theme is very present  I cant remember a Super Bowl that did it at this level he said That could go handinhand  where people want to be creative but dont want to be in any dangerous territoryMs Taylor was left feeling slightly underwhelmedLast year the ads were really fun and took the pulse of the country and brands used their media time to bring a sense of hope and inspiration she said Thats what Im missing so farMicrosoft aired a tearjerker in the second half with a spot that showcased a group of children with physical limitations talking about how they love gaming and are able to play video games through Xbox adaptive controllers No matter how your body is or how fast you are you can play one of the boys said in an online version of the spotTech giants loomed large That includes Amazon which had a Super Bowl ad for the fourth timeAmazon showed a trailer for a new show called Hanna on its Prime streaming service and another ad for its Alexa devices The latter included celebrities like Harrison Ford Forest Whitaker and the Broad City stars Ilana Glazer and Abbi JacobsonAmazon which ran its first Super Bowl ad in  has become a big presence as its overall marketing spending has increased Last year the company was one of the games five biggest advertisers for the first time

companies like General Motors Verizon and LOralTheir presence makes a lot of sense to me Professor Rucker said Their target is probably a massive portion of everyone watchingOn a somewhat related note The Washington Post made a lastminute decision to run a spot  a first for the newspaper The ad which ran in the fourth quarter and was narrated by Tom Hanks highlighted reporters work and the importance of press freedom Fred Ryan the newspapers publisher said in a statementIt showed images of journalists from several news organizations including CNN and Fox News and referred to the death of Jamal Khashoggi the Saudi dissident journalist who wrote for the newspaper before he was killed in October It closed with the papers motto Democracy Dies in Darkness The Post is owned by Jeff Bezos

featured the tennis star Serena Williams urging women to make the first move in all areas of their lives Toyotas commercial chronicled the unexpected path of a football player named Antoinette Harris and compared her journey to one of its vehicles which it said will shatter perceptionsThe female empowerment theme this year is very real Professor Taylor said That doesnt mean its overwhelming  theres still more ads with male lead characters and still more male celebrities  but I think its narrowed a little bitI havent seen any ads that objectify women which is awesome said Margaret Johnson chief creative officer of the agency Goodby Silverstein  PartnersOver all the gap is narrowing she said Were moving in the right directionAdvertisers largely seemed to be avoiding anything remotely controversial  perhaps seeking to learn from years pastLast year Ram trucks faced criticism  after it used a sermon by the Rev Dr Martin Luther King Jr as the voiceover for its Super Bowl ad The timing didnt help considering one story line last season was about NFL players who sat or knelt during the national anthem to draw attention to racial oppression and police brutality against black AmericansTwo years ago after the presidential election Airbnb and  Lumber ran spots that were viewed as responses to President Trumps stance on immigrationThis year advertisers sought to tie themselves to social causes Budweiser for example highlighted its efforts in renewable energy in a spot that featured a charming dog the beverage companys Clydesdales and the Bob Dylan song Blowin in

that Washington wants Beijing to adopt a policy that would keep the value of Chinas currency stable More on that from Bloomberg citing unidentified sources While the precise wording remains unresolved a pledge of yuan stability has been discussed in multiple rounds of talks in recent months and both sides have tentatively agreed it will be part of the framework of any final deal The Trump administration has been clear in its talks with Beijing that any attempt to depreciate the yuan  a strategy aimed at offsetting existing US duties on Chinese imports  would be met with more or higher American tariffs But currency stability may be at odds with other policies A US request for Beijing to keep the yuan from depreciating is also potentially difficult to square with Trump and past US administrations calls for China to adopt more marketdriven reforms and complaints that Beijing manipulates its currency to gain a trade advantageThere are other contentious issues The FT rated the chances of success of several critical issues being discussed this week from stronger protections of intellectual property rights likely to happen to the cessation of hacking much less likelyAnd any deal would need enforcement measures CNBC reports that unidentified officials from the US Chamber of Commerce believe a deal would be meaningless if there arent mechanisms such as automatic tariff

emerging as the use of artificial intelligence accelerates across industries Here are some excerpts They have been edited and condensedSam AltmanCofounder and chairman of Open AI president of Y CombinatorOne of the things that surprises me most about sort of the criticism of the tech industry right now is a belief that tech should be the one to decide what you can and cant say and how these algorithms work And that to me sounds very bad I think Im totally cool with for example restrictions on free speech where its hurting people And I think weve always had you know I cant yell Fire in this room So theres always been free speech with an asteriskBut the idea that these companies who are not accountable to us or elected by us should get to decide sort of the new safeguards of society that seems like the wrong way to do it And I think we should let our  flawed as they may be  democratically elected and enforced institutions update the rules for the world The world has changed a lot Tech has changed the world a lot in a very short time And its going to change it much moreEvan SpiegelCofounder and chief executive Snap IncFor example just like a newspaper page there really wasnt a personalized version of the internet  years ago There was just one page that everyone got  the same Yahoo home page or something like that And so this idea that the internet could be personalized by your friends was a huge breakthroughBut this also came with some side effects Because the content that is distributed by your friends from all over the internet and thats voted on by your friends in terms of likes and comments sometimes that means that  because were human beings and we click on things that are outrageous or offensive sometimes  things that are negative actually spread faster and further than things that are positiveAnd so we very quickly saw media start to change to fit this new distribution mechanism that was based on what your friends were sharing So I think if we look at the evolution of social media now people are thinking through sort of the ramifications of a lot of whats happened as a result of that new wave distributing content But I certainly think theres a lot of opportunity to sort of coursecorrect hereJohn DonovanChief executive ATT CommunicationsWe paused for a period of time before we went into deployment on robotics process automation machine learning to step back and build the Ten Commandments And we came back with I think a view that was a humancentric set of policiesAnd that is that everything in our business Every outcome is owned by a human being No one can say an algorithm did it or a machine did it So everything that is launched algorithmically robotically is owned by a human being A machine cant control a machine without a process thats involvedThese are like children algorithms If you change jobs you have to turn over to the new person that algorithm Everything thats put in has to have a rewind button We have a PhD in psychology who makes sure that they have a red button they can press when they feel like manipulation is happening in any way shape or formSo we put a structure and a process in place to make sure that what we do programmatically what we do algorithmically and what we do with a machine doesnt change the fundamentals of our accountability within the businessSebastian ThrunChief executive Kitty HawkI look at AI as a tool very much like a shovel or a kitchen knife And when it comes to ethics I think theres ethical ways to use a kitchen knife and theres unethical ways to use a kitchen knife and theyve been around foreverWhat really is AI I think thats what people are somewhat divided on I think its something very very simple First of all we talk about AI we talk about machine learning we dont talk about real intelligence And machine learning is an innovation in computersComputers are dumb To make computers do the right thing in the past someone had to write down just an elaborate kitchen recipe of every possible step that the computer should do And the computer would blindly follow those rules The innovation in machine learning is that now instead of giving a computer these rules you can give it examplesAnd the computer follows its own rules from those examples So computer programming has become easier as a result Children can now program computers by just giving examples The implications in my opinion are groundbreaking for societyKent WalkerSenior vice president global affairs and chief legal officer GoogleThe tech sector has always had lots of different regulations from privacy to copyright to safe harbors and the like Were fans of regulation when its smart regulationAnd what do I mean by that So regulation that starts out with a really crisp definition of whats the problem youre trying to solve That is then narrowly tailored to solve that problem and minimize blowback and side effects And then third a thoughtful analysis of how what the second and third implications of those rules might beWhen you apply that to artificial intelligence I think its most likely that we will start with the applications Its rare that you regulate basic research because theres so much risk of deterring innovation that could be really incredibly productive along the lines that Sebastian was talking aboutBut as you get into applications  whether its financial services or health care or agricultural productivity  we already have a thoughtful series of laws and rules around that and it would be natural to expand those into the issues that are raised by AIDeep NisharSenior managing partner SoftBank Vision FundSo you start at a national level and say What should the newage curriculum look like I started my work career in the heartland of

people behind youWell then companies should be training us to do similar things and retraining us My fathers generation you had one profession one job Our generation you have perhaps one or two professions multiple jobs Our childrens generation is going to have multiple professions multiple jobs Thats the reality You know we can keep fighting that reality but its here to stayAdena

all sorts of really fun projects over the summer where people have tangible work product at the end of it that we actually then deploy inside our shopAnd its a very different way of bringing in I would say deep intelligence and intellectual curiosity and energy and a new way of thinking and working that then you can kind of integrate into the organization And they developed their mastery by

more people to choose not to workBrad SmithPresident MicrosoftOne thing we have said is that we will provide our technology to democratically elected governments that broadly focus on the protection of human rightsWe will do that because we want these governments to have access to technology We believe they need to have access to technology But we also recognize that there are important ethical issues that will arise and we will use our voice as a corporate citizen to not just actively  but proactively  engage on the issues of the dayBut where we dont think that technology companies are rightly in the business of regulating democratically elected governments we think democratically elected governments should be in the business of regulating technology companies  not the other way aroundAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byGood Sunday morning Was this email forwarded to you Sign up hereThe week of the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum is a fire hose of news Headlines predictions sightings and tidbits that months and years later are recognized as the flash point for much larger shifts and trends can often get overlookedTo help you sort through it all weve put together this crib sheet of everything that we think was important that happened here in Davos Yes Im writing this from Davos on my way homeBefore we get into the substance a couple of observationsThe World Economic Forum has traditionally brought together the worlds top political and business leaders But this year the political leaders were largely absent  remaining in their home countries to handle crises largely of their own making President Trump with the shutdown and Prime Minister Theresa May with BrexitThe surprise guest this year was Tim Cook Apples chief executive making his first appearance it may be an indication of Apples increasing dependence on foreign markets for growthThe topic du jour besides the shutdown was a debate over where the global economy was headed Chief executives professed confidence that their earnings would continue apace while economists and investors talked about the prospect of a recession in  And others like Ray Dalio  and Seth Klarman who did not attend but whose annual letter was a constant talking point  worried about social unrest Interestingly Dr Doom  Nouriel Roubini  was actually upbeatA Chinese chief executive described his countrys economy as ugly  he used that world repeatedly  suggesting that the underlying foundation there was more fragile than most economists acknowledge That could lead to weakness in China spreading to the rest of the world And the general sense is that while the US and China may reach a trade dtente we might be headed for a decadeslong economic cold warLarry Finks letter and the concept of ESG shorthand for environmental social and governance got a lot of discussion this year  it felt like it might be a tipping point in the dialogue European companies are still more interested in ESG than US companies but it feels like a trend that isnt going away TPGs Rise Fund started a new company Y Analytics to measure ESG Bono a board member of Rise was on hand to talk about impact investing and to support his Red brand which he started a decade ago in Davos DealBook broke that story at the time as well as his One franchise Matt Damon was in town to raise money for his waterorg which is turning into a quite successful story side note Mr Damon had to borrow a suit because his bag got lost by Swiss Air Jane Goodall was also in Davos  and let me say that she is as nice as she is important Even the Vatican sent a delegation to talk about conscious and inclusive capitalismAnd Rebecca Blumenstein the deputy managing editor of The New York Times interviewed Bill Gates on Twitter about his work around the globeTodays DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in Davos Switzerland Stephen Grocer in New York and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in ParisThe soap opera of tariff negotiations has riveted economists and executives Will Beijing keep its promises Will Washington cooperateBut the real drama is not about trade but about technology many in Davos have said The brewing conflict could affect generations and disrupt the world order according to Fred Kempe the chief executive of the think tank Atlantic Council He wroteThe growing danger is that the tech race could become the primary battleground in a struggle between democracy and autocracy  and between China and the US The dangers of a technological Cold War a zerosum contest for global dominance that ultimately separates Chinese and US tech sectors from each other and divides up the world are increasingWhats the worry The billionaire George Soros said that artificial intelligence when in the hands of authoritarian regimes was a mortal threat to the world He cited China which is developing a social credit system that would use personal data to judge an individuals trustworthiness as an example President Xi Jinping could eventually have total control over the people making him the most dangerous opponent of open societies Mr Soros saidWhat do the Chinese think The technology industry relies heavily on global interactions and is probably suffering the most right now said Ken Hu the deputy chairman of Huawei The Chinese telecommunications company has been accused by multiple nations including the US of violating trade rules Other players such as the Chinese stateowned oil and gas company Sinopec say they expect Chinese companies to scale back foreign investment  steps already taken by Alibaba and by GAC Motor Last year nearly  percent of Chinese CEOs considered the US to be the most important foreign market this year only  percent feel the same according to one survey published this past weekHope for resolution Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said via video link that Washington was willing to play nice with Beijing if China pledged to protect intellectual property At a dinner in Davos a top Chinese regulator heard complaints from international business leaders about the ownership structure of stateowned enterprises and about the Made in China  effort which aims to take the lead in industries such as artificial intelligence and roboticsBut China wants its space Vice President Wang Qishan said in a speech that it is imperative to respect national sovereignty and refrain from seeking technological hegemony He addedWe need to respect the independent choices of model of technology management and of public policies made by countries and their right to participating in the global technological governance system as equalsA recession may not be coming this year but neither is a boom Greg Ip of the WSJ writesThe International Monetary Fund downgraded its  forecast for global growth to  percent Thats a respectable number he writes but the world is struggling to sustain even that muted paceThe reason The world cannot tolerate interest rates as high as it once did The neutral interest rate  one that is high enough to contain inflation yet low enough to avoid recession  is much lower than beforeThe underlying cause As aging workers retire and birthrates drop the labor force has grown more slowly Productivity has also eked out smaller gains than in the pastThe upshot Central banks need to proceed carefully because a little fiscal tightening goes a long wayMore on the global economy Ray Dalio founder and chairman of the hedge fund Bridgewater said he foresaw slower growth rates in the US and Europe France is sticking to a  percent economic growth forecast for  the French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said Christine Lagarde the managing director of the IMF warned against an overreliance on central banks urging countries to strengthen their economies through fiscal and structural changes In the absence of world leaders the atmosphere was downbeatAlexandria OcasioCortez wasnt in Davos this week It just felt like she wasThe New York representatives proposal to impose a  percent tax rate on income above  million came up frequently among the uberwealthy in attendanceIn those elite circles filled with people whose fortunes have soared in recent years the idea was not popularMichael Dell the billionaire founder of Dell Technologies is not a fan for one Scott Minerd the chief investment officer of Guggenheim Partners said the concept was scary Glenn Hutchins the chairman of North Island and a cofounder of Silver Lake Partners suggested that it was an attempt to score political points and that it would probably be unsuccessful Ken Moelis the chief executive of the investment bank Moelis  Company said it would be disastrous for the economyStephen Schwarzman the billionaire chief executive of Blackstone said he was wildly enthusiastic about Ms OcasioCortezs pitch He was being sarcasticBut as the economy slows and  election talk surges taxing the rich is a topic that will most likely continue to surface Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts a Democratic candidate for president proposed a socalled ultramillionaire tax this week on the  wealthiest families in the country including President TrumpsStill top earners would probably figure out how to sidestep such rules Mr Minerd saidThe political pendulum is swinging The conservatives found out theyre being held hostage by the extreme right Now the Democrats are going to find out theyre being held hostage by the extreme leftGlobalization had some powerful defenders in Davos with world leaders imploring delegates not to abandon postwar principles of international integrationSeveral took jabs at the absent President Trump without mentioning him by name criticizing his America First foreign policy and his habit of provoking trade disputes The vice president of China Wang Qishan whose own country has been accused of running roughshod over foreign competitors and global business rules nonetheless condemned practices of the strong bullying the weak and selfclaimed supremacyCarrie Lam the chief executive of Hong Kong said that certain countries were drifting from the multilateral framework of the past few decadesIf that is no longer the mainstream we could be in trouble she saidChancellor Angela Merkel of Germany who leads a country that is deeply reliant on international trade and increasingly surrounded by neighbors confronted by protectionist tendencies urged Western powers to act against the fragmentation of the international architectureShe said that global organizations such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank should be reformed and that countries should embrace compromise She addedI think we should understand our national interest in a way that we think about the interests of others and from that create winwin situations that are the precondition for multilateralismShinzo Abe the prime minister of Japan pledged his countrys support for the free open and rulesbased international order He called on forum participants to rebuild trust toward the system for international tradeWorld leaders called for more regulation Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan said his country would push for a new international system for the oversight of data useHis proposal was echoed by others The South African president Cyril Ramaphosa said African Union leaders would discuss greater oversight of the tech sector at a meeting early next month Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany cited a need for the European Union to have a common digital market Vice President Wang Qishan of China also said that more international cooperation in regulating the market was requiredTalk focused on global governance data privacy and the impact of artificial intelligence but there was no consensus on what approach to take Some official sessions tried to put a positive spin on the effects of technological advances but the optimism seemed out of step with public concern about the disruptive effect on privacy and politicsTech leaders make the rounds On his first trip to the forum Tim Cook the Apple chief executive met with world leaders including President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil and Dubais crown prince Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid alMaktoum Sheryl Sandberg the chief operating officer of Facebook acknowledged that her company needed to earn back the trust of the public Microsofts chief executive Satya Nadella said that as facial recognition technology grew he would welcome regulation that will help the marketplace not be a race to the bottomEnvironmental issues took center stage with world leaders and celebrities weighing in and new partnerships being formed One of the biggest initiatives announced at the forum was an alternative recycling platform called Loop which seeks to change the way consumers buy brandname productsThe concept The project revives the milkman concept in which products are delivered in reusable containers that are returned to the manufacturerThe partners Some of the largest consumer goods companies  including Danone Mars Petcare Mondelez International Nestl PepsiCo Procter  Gamble and Unilever  are working together on the project as a way to limit wasteThe pitchman Tom Szaky founder and chief executive of the recycling company TerraCycle headed to Davos two years ago to meet with the leaders of packaged goods companies and push his big ideaClimate concerns dominated much of the discussion elsewhere at the gathering In an interview with Prince William the naturalist David Attenborough took world leaders to task for waiting too long to address climate change Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand joined the chorus urging her global counterparts to think about the role they play in addressing climate change while Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan called for action on the issue The singer Bono poked fun at sustainable development goals saying The SDGs it does sound like a sexually transmitted disease doesnt it An expected drop in private jet traffic to Davos this year could be a sign that participants are taking the environmental impact of their travel more seriously Greta

parties that drew celebrities like Matt Damon and Wyclef Jean CNBC The Bank of England is ready for Brexit and is disillusioned with Bitcoin said its governor Mark Carney Bloomberg Hundreds of protesters some waving signs that read Let them eat money complained that the elite participants at Davos cared more about the bottom line than about the state of the world APAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Erin GriffithOn a sunny Saturday morning in New York a few months ago a group of  startup founders gathered in the dank basement of a Lower East Side bar They scribbled notes at long tables sipping coffee and LaCroix while a stack of pizza boxes emanated the odor of hot garlic One by one they gave testimonials taking aim at something nearly sacred in the technology industry venture capitalJosh Haas the cofounder of Bubble a softwarewriting startup told the group that he and venture capitalists were pretty much totally on different wavelengths about the trajectory of his businessSeph Skerritt the founder of Proper Cloth a clothing company said that the hype around raising money was a trap They try to make you feel inferior if youre not playing that game he saidThe event had been organized by Frank Denbow  a fixture of New Yorks tech scene and the founder of Tshirt startup Inkaio to bring together startup founders who have begun to question the investment framework that has supercharged their field By encouraging companies to expand too quickly Mr Denbow said venture capital can make them accelerate straight into the groundThe VC business model on which much of the modern tech industry was built is simple Startups raise piles of money from investors and then use the cash to grow aggressively  faster than the competition faster than regulators faster than most normal businesses would consider sane Larger and larger rounds of funding followThe end goal is to sell or go public producing astonishing returns for early investors The setup has spawned household names like Facebook Google and Uber as well as hundreds of other socalled unicorn companies valued at more than  billionBut for every unicorn there are countless other startups that grew too fast burned through investors money and died  possibly unnecessarily Startup business plans are designed for the rosiest possible outcome and the money intensifies both successes and failures Social media is littered with tales of companies that withered under the pressure of hypergrowth were crushed by socalled toxic VCs or were forced to raise too much venture capital  something known as the foie gras effectNow a counter movement led by entrepreneurs who are jaded by the traditional playbook is rejecting that model While still a small part of the startup community these founders have become more vocal in the last year as they connect venture capitalists insatiable appetite for growth to the tech industrys myriad crisesWould Facebooks leadership have ignored warning signs of Russian election meddling or allowed its platform to incite racial violence if it hadnt in its early days prized moving fast and breaking things Would Uber have engaged in dubious regulatory and legal strategies if it hadnt prioritized expansion over all else Would the tech industry be struggling with gender and race discrimination if the investors funding it were a little less homogeneousThe tool of venture capital is so specific to a tiny tiny fraction of companies We cant let ourselves be fooled into thinking thats the story of the future of American entrepreneurship said Mara Zepeda a yearold entrepreneur who in  helped start an advocacy organization called Zebras Unite Its members include startup founders investors and foundations focused on encouraging a more ethical industry with greater gender and racial diversity The group now has  chapters and  members around the worldThe more we believe that myth the more we overlook tremendous opportunities Ms Zepeda said in an interviewSome of the groups are rejecting venture capital because theyve been excluded from the traditional VC networks Aniyia Williams who started the nonprofit Black  Brown Founders said a venturefunded system that encourages many failures for every one success is particularly unfair to black latinx and women founders who are rarely afforded the opportunity to fail period Members of these organizations she added see more value when whole groups in their communities thrive rather than ventures winnertakeall modelOther founders have decided the expectations that come with accepting venture capital arent worth it Venture investing is a highstakes game in which companies are typically either wild successes or near total failuresBig problems have occurred when you have founders who have unwillingly or unknowingly signed on for an outcome they didnt know they were signing on for said Josh Kopelman a venture investor at First Round Capital an early backer of Uber Warby Parker and RingHe said he was happy that companies were embracing alternatives to venture capital I sell jet fuel he said and some people dont want to build a jetRight now that jet fuel seems unlimited Venture capital investments into United Statesbased companies ballooned to  billion in  the highest level since  according to CB Insights a data provider And the investments have expanded beyond software and hardware into anything that is techadjacent  dog walking health care coffee shops farming electric toothbrushesBut people like Sandra Oh Lin the chief executive of KiwiCo a seller of childrens activity kits say that more money isnt necessary Ms Oh Lin raised a little over  million in venture funding between  and  but she is now rebuffing offers of more just as her company has hit on a product people want  the very moment when investors would love to pour more gas on the fire KiwiCo is profitable and had nearly  million in sales in  a  percent increase over the prior year Ms Oh Lin saidWe are aggressive about growth but we are not a company that chases growth at all costs Ms Oh Lin said We want to build a company that lastsEntrepreneurs are even finding ways to undo money they took from venture capital funds Wistia a video software company used debt to buy out its investors last summer declaring a desire to pursue sustainable profitable growth Buffer a social mediafocused software company used its profits to do the same in August Afterward Joel Gascoigne its cofounder and chief executive received more than  emails from other founders who were inspired  or jealousThe VC path forces you into this binary outcome of acquisition or IPO or pretty much bust Mr Gascoigne said People are starting to question thatVenture capital wasnt always the default way to grow a company But in the last decade its gospel of technological disruption has infiltrated every corner of the business world Oldline companies from Campbell Soup to General Electric started venture operations and accelerator programs to foster innovation Sprint and UBS hired WeWork to make their offices more startuplikeAt the same time startup culture  hoodies and all  entered the mainstream on the back of celebrity investors like Ashton Kutcher TV shows like Shark Tank and movies like The Social Network Few questioned the Silicon Valley model for creating the next Google Facebook or UberThose who tried to buck the conventional method experienced harsh tradeoffs Bank loans are typically small and banks are reluctant to lend money to software companies which have no hard assets to use as collateral Founders who eschew venture capital often wind up leaning on their life savings or credit cardsJessica Rovello and Kenny Rosenblatt the entrepreneurs behind Arkadium a gaming startup founded in  initially avoided raising venture money It took four years before the business earned enough to pay them a salary The sacrifices were very real and very intense Ms Rovello said Nevertheless the business grew steadily and profitably to  employeesBy  though as investors poured capital into some rivals the lure of easy money became too tempting to pass up and the company raised  million Tensions ensued as Arkadiums investors expected the company to continue raising money with the goal of selling or going public Ms Rovello wanted to keep running the company profitably growing revenue at  percent per year and developing a new product that could take years to pay offIn September Arkadium used its profits to buy out the investors allowing the company to remain independent and grow on its own terms Ms Rovello said she had no regrets about stepping off the venturefunded pathIf your end game is having a business that you love and continuing to thrive and making careers for people she said then Im winningIn September Tyler Tringas a yearold entrepreneur based in Rio announced plans to offer a different kind of startup financing in the form of equity investments that companies can repay as a percent of their profits Mr Tringas said his firm Earnest Capital will have  million to invest in  to  companies per yearHundreds of emails have poured in since the announcement Mr Tringas said in an interview Theyre almost entirely from people who assumed there was no form of capital that matched any version of their expectations he saidEarnest Capital joins a growing list of firms including Lighter Capital Purpose Ventures TinySeed Village Capital Sheeo XXcelerate Fund and Indievc that offer founders different ways to obtain money Many use variations of revenue or profitbased loans Those loans though are often available only to companies that already have a product to sell and an incoming cash streamOther companies are inspired by the investor buyouts executed by Buffer Wistia and Arkadium and are asking investors to agree to similar deals  at potentially lower returns on their investments  in the futureIndievc based in Salt Lake City and part of the investment firm OReilly AlphaTech Ventures offers startups the option to buy back the firms shares as a portion of their total sales That caps the firms return at three times its investment In the typical venture capital model the earnings for a homerun deal are limitlessWhen Indievc started three years ago it saw two or three applications a week mostly from venture capital rejects Now it gets as many as  applications a week mostly from companies that could raise venture capital but dont want to said Bryce Roberts the firms founderWe think there is going to be a tsunami of entrepreneurs who have experienced the onesizefitsall venture model and want to cherrypick the pieces of it that work for them Mr Roberts saidSome venture capitalists have applauded the shift their style of highrisk investing is not right for many companies In a recent blog post Founder Collective a firm that has invested in Uber and BuzzFeed praised Mr Robertss offerings while warning founders of the dangers of traditional funding Venture capital isnt bad but it is dangerous the post reads The firm created ominous warning labels and brochures to send to its companiesPrivately some venture capitalists have bemoaned the way theyre locked into rigid investment mandates with perverse incentives We heard from many investors who said I cant say this publicly but Im in the machine and I know its broken and I know there is a better way Ms Zepeda saidOthers have dismissed the trend according to Mr Roberts Its amazing how thinskinned and threatened VCs tend to be around people who question their model he saidEven if venture capitalists ignore the companies rejecting their model some of their investors  endowments pension funds and mutual funds  are exploring ways to participate The tech industrys year of bad headlines has inspired some soulsearchingI think we should as investors take seriously our role in driving some of these destabilizing forces in society said Rukaiyah Adams chief investment officer at Meyer Memorial Trust an investor in venture capital funds and nonprofits As one of the controllers of capital Im raising my hand and saying Wait a minute lets really think about thisStill the new growth models represent a tiny percentage of the broader startup funding market And venture capitalists continue to aggressively pitch their wares  even to companies that arent interestedNotion a collaboration software company based in San Francisco has just nine employees and close to one million users many of whom pay  a month The company is handily profitable Aside from a small seed round in  it has avoided outside fundingVenture capitalists desperate to get a piece of the company have dug up Notions office address and sent its founders cookie dough dog treats and physical letters company executives said Every few months a new investor inevitably shows up unannounced at Notions gateNotions ambitions are big  the company

What happens when people who have trouble fitting into a traditional workplace get one designed just for them
What happens when people who have trouble fitting into a traditional workplace get one designed just for themBy SUSAN DOMINUSBefore Ben Hirasuna showed up for the first job interview of his life he went for weeks at a time without leaving his parents home in Santa Monica Outside sun poured down inside he looked at the top of his forearm and noticed it was every bit as pale as its underside To say Hirasuna is shy is to say the ocean is big  it captures nothing of the vastness of the feeling He managed to attend college at Arizona State for just over a year but returned home for good in November  For a few months he took some classes at a local community college but eventually his routine gave way to solitude at home During the day he slept at night he rose to battle the enemy in futuristic cities and pastel landscapes on his PC or tinkered on another monitor with any of the codes Java Perl Rust C and C he taught himself in high school Finally last November his parents insisted that he get a job  any job at the bakery down the street or at McDonalds if it came to thatHirasuna could not imagine a worse hell than a job in customer service which would require he sensed a more cheerful public face than he could possibly muster He remembered that in September he went to an innovation fair at his old high school and met the head of a technology consulting business called Auticon which specializes in hiring people who are like Hirasuna on the autism spectrum He made an appointment with a recruiter at the office and in early January he forced himself to make the minute drive to Auticons office two blocks from the beach After going upstairs to the right floor he stood outside the door of the office stymied by what to do nextGiven a few hours Hirasuna could usually make sense of whatever computer code someone threw at him but this particular script was elusive Did he open the door and barge right in It seemed kind of rude Hirasuna said Like Hey here I am A mass of soft pale brown curls surrounds his head cloudlike As he recalled this moment of indecision he reached up and pulled on a strand of hair a few times It was like my brain threw the blue screen of death on me he recalled Was he supposed to wait right there for someone to open the door What if they were busy with another appointment at that moment and he interrupted or even ruined it Hesitating in the hall he feared he would just stand there forever blowing what seemed like such a good opportunity  to do work he might actually like  in a disastrous moment of total selfconflagration his head exploding with uncertainty And then it happened Someone opened the doorOffices for plenty of people can occasionally be overwhelming crowded with feelings too big for cubicles too personal for a professional setting A higherup checks a watch midconversation a comment in a meeting is talked over someone and someone else go to lunch Doubts flourish under fluorescent lights that expose every slight every interpersonal hurdleAnd then there are people like Hirasuna who are on the autism spectrum people who feel bombarded by those same clues and cues all the while knowing they are unreliable interpreters of their meaning For some people with autism socializing is an elaborate game with more exceptions than rules so that any small decision  hover outside the bosss office dont hover  poses an insurmountable challenge Guesswork is prevalent misapprehension the norm When it is hard to read the room so to speak it does morph into anxiety over time said Grey Patton a yearold employee on the spectrum who graduated from the University of California Riverside last spring and who like Hirasuna started working at Auticon in January Its moving in the dark without a flashlightThe challenges of navigating the social complexities of a workplace is one reason unemployment even among collegeeducated people with autism appears to be disproportionately high No good national data exist but various small studies suggest the problem of joblessness is chronic says Paul Shattuck a professor of public health at Drexel University who studies autism outcomes Anxiety commonly experienced in people with autism can make typical workplace competition unbearable one Auticon employee in a BBC report compared his experience at his last job to the television show Survivor The interview process alone is a sociability test that many people with autism are destined to fail or inclined to avoid altogether Some members of the autism community prefer to be described as autistic Others including those I interviewed at Auticon preferred to be described as on the spectrum or as a person with autism Just dont call me late for dinner said one who did not have a preferenceMajor technology businesses like Microsoft and SAP have made significant efforts over the past several years to hire more people with strong cognitive skills who are on the spectrum recognizing that they represent untapped potential in the job market Humanresource departments have modified interview processes trained staff to accommodate certain sensitivities to sounds or disruptions and helped coworkers and managers adjust to those colleagues needs for example closer supervision Auticon goes one step further it is an office where people who have autism are a majority Employees on the spectrum do not make up a pod within a company instead they define the predominant cultureMany businesses that recruit people with autism specialize like Auticon in quality assurance which is like a poultryinspection service for software Is the login working on the home page What happens if someone rightclicks on this other link The work can be rote and entrylevel or require more skilled analysts to write scripts that test that software automatically essentially to see if I can break it as Hirasuna put itIn  around the same time technology companies first started expanding their hiring of people with autism Gray Benoist a father of two sons on the spectrum plotted out a business for the express purpose of securing his childrens future He knew they were smart and capable he also knew as he put it that they present themselves in ways that may not be corporateAmerica kinds of ways He moved his family from St Louis where he had been the chief financial officer of an industrialproduct business and started over in Santa Monica to create a software qualityassurance business that expanded its offerings over time With a few partners he founded MindSpark as a California benefit corporation a type of forprofit business It is founded on the radical proposition that social purpose and employee wellbeing are as essential to their mission as profit Within five years the business was thriving with two offices one in Culver City and the other in Santa Monica The company had about  employees ranging from entrylevel trainees to skilled automation analysts all of whom were on the spectrum as well as about seven neurotypical managers and administrators With time says Rebecca Beam Auticons president the company hopes to promote current analysts into more managerial roles breaking down that division In  Auticon a German company based in Munich a business also devoted to employing people on the spectrum acquired Benoists startupThe name MindSpark nicely matched the feelgood ingenuity of the business Auticon on the other hand summons the image of an army of automatons defined by their diagnoses and marketed to deliver maximum software efficiency Auticons marketing material names pattern recognition and uncompromised honesty as valued skill sets in autistic people In fact research is mixed on whether people with autism actually do excel at visual pattern recognition relative to peers of equivalent IQ and the range of talents and honesty is highly individual Selling autism as a brand likely perpetuates some generalizations  even stereotypes  in the name of overcoming bias a complicated compromise if a strategic oneA business full of people who are on the autism spectrum provides its own kinds of managerial and interpersonal challenges but to be the norm in an office rather than an exception is an unqualified relief for many of Auticons employees Hirasuna noticed the difference in the first week of work when he was writing an email to his manager I realized after the first day Oh yeah I dont have to read this over for nuance and all that stuff he said In college he hated emailing his professors because he agonized over whether his tone was too forceful or too presumptuous or too inarticulate At Auticon he said he felt a release in simply writing an email reading it over for typos and sending it out What was the worst his boss was going to think if he sent out a tonedeaf email Thats autism Hirasuna said with a big comedic shrug OK  thats what we expectedOne morning in late January at a daily status meeting at Auticons Culver City office Mirzat Musayaf a manager gathered a group of four software analysts in the conference room to find out where things stood on a project for a major client As the meeting began Kayla  one of the more outgoing members of the office and an informal leader rocked gently back and forth at the conference table She asked that only her first name be used Kayla was not offended when Musayaf whose workstation is across from her own first placed another computer monitor next to her first one so her frequent movement would not distract him Oh it drives my husband crazy too she assured him But it helps me concentrate Bill Gates is also known to rock during meetings a  Fortune article noted that some of his employees when engaging in intense conversation did the same as if emulating his movementMusayafs agenda that day included addressing any mistakes that had been made over the past week Kayla believed a colleague who was also sitting at the table had digressed from instructions directing analysts to notate a certain task in a specific way As the conversation turned to that issue the colleague started wringing his hands His lower jaw jutted out and he gritted his teeth He asked a question then smiled with vindication upon hearing the answer OK he said then leaned in and pointed a finger at Kayla she was at fault for this issue he explained not him The issue was minor his reaction stark and defensive no selfconscious joke or neutral professionalism defanged his point It was a classic office dynamic playing out in raw unedited formLater in an email to me Kayla wrote that although she could see how someone neurotypical might interpret his reaction as hostile she as someone also on the spectrum did not I knew that he was showing no anger or malice toward me she wrote We understand and respect each otherMusayaf interpreted the moment of tension in the meeting as essentially harmless he understood the colleagues strong reaction as a symptom of anxiety rather than an unlikable character trait Musayaf like the other managers known as leads had received a few threehour training sessions on how to work with people on the spectrum but he was hardly an expert that he was drawn to the work at Auticon despite other options suggested to the people who hired him that he would be sensitive enough to manage his team wellMusayaf could see that even after the conversation had moved on Kaylas colleague was still distressed Musayaf stopped the discussion to make a point Look he said there is no correct way or incorrect He explained gently that his only objective was to keep the project on track The colleague visibly relaxedA culture of acceptance occasionally conflicts with a training environment intended to prepare the staff for the possibility of working in a more typical office Rebecca Beam a longtime tech recruiter who became president of Auticon when the company acquired MindSpark last year sensed early on that many Auticon employees felt uneasy when she stopped by their desks in the morning with a big hello Many of them were uncomfortable with small talk they had no interest in rehashing their weekends or looking at pictures of Ziggy Beams terrier mix but Beam saw a morning greeting as the bare minimum of office socializing a nicety they might as well endure if only for practiceBefore working for the company Beam had no personal connection to someone with autism but believes all individuals deserve work worthy of their talents She joined the advisory board of MindSpark at its founding and relied on her longstanding business contacts to bring in major clients like Fox and Warner Brothers But before she was put in charge of Auticons United States business in June  she hadnt known the staff well enough to realize as she eventually did that every decision no matter how small matteredIn her first weeks on the job Beam made what turned out to be a bold move She gave the Santa Monica office a small makeover trying to brighten it with some new furniture for the front entryway a smattering of succulents some framed posters of illustrated animals Over a weekend she also had a wall once white painted grayThat Monday Max Gadson a yearold analyst who has been with the company for two years arrived at the office and stopped short taking in all this newness He knew something was happening  they had been told to clear their desks  but no one knew exactly what No one said anything about the wall being painted much less that it would be gray and here it was Monday and now boom Gray wall Gadson does not have obsessivecompulsive disorder but he imagined that this feeling was a bit like that the sense that something was out of order He did not understand why the wall color had changed and sought out his supervisor to talk it throughAnother coworker Gray Benoist Jr the son of MindSparks founder who is  took issue with a new patterned chair now placed in the entry area The chair would later prove popular  some staff members avoid the small couch opposite the chair for fear someone will sit too close to them  but certainly in the beginning Beam could tell some employees were out of sorts One analyst asked why she insisted on placing succulents in the Culver City office when as he sees it they were so clearly superfluous On another occasion she moved a young mans desk without consulting him and he temporarily quit For most of Beams staff she realized over time there is no such thing as a pleasant surprise unless its pizzaPeople with my type of disorder its not that we dont have emotion Gadson said Its that we have too much emotion We cant push that stuff backBeam as she started to understand the offices workings gave a lot of thought in her first month to the size of a couch she was buying for a conference room in Culver City until the question was no longer about a couch and more about a culture She knew that if she bought one that was long employees would sleep on it and not just doze sitting with their eyes closed but stretch out and slumber deeply Many of her employees have poor sleep habits some are on medication that can affect their sleep Around half of adults with autism also have a mental diagnosis of a psychiatric condition like anxiety or depression according to a  Kaiser Permanente study of  people on the autism spectrum Would Auticon going forward be a place where you could regularly lie down and nap during lunch in the conference room so long as you made it back to your desk on time Or was it going to be a place where that was considered inappropriate In the end Beam decided to lean into the workplace as an accommodating space She bought the big couch At lunch someone is usually napping on it even when other employees are playing PingPong on the conference table their jackets strewn across it for a netAccommodations that would seem unusual at another office seem perfectly reasonable to the employees at Auticon At the Culver City office overhead lights bothered one or two colleagues so much that everyone agreed to work without artificial lights so that often by the end of the day they are all working in pitch darkness rectangles of soft bright light from their computers illuminating their faces Absences in general are not encouraged but they are accepted as a cost of doing business with a population that often experiences depression Managers adjust within reason to their employees boundaries rather than the other way around such as when employees suffering from gastrointestinal problems  a littleunderstood but common issue for some people on the spectrum  call in to explain in great detail why they wont be coming in that day Another employee had disappeared without notice for several days and his managers were afraid for his safety You know some employers would say to someone like that Im done Beam said But Im going to work with that person and work with that person because I see the potentialBeam frequently checks in with Emily Gale a behavior analyst who consults for Auticon and specializes in autism in the workplace Gale in one instance came in to help resolve an issue with an employee who always said he understood the feedback he was getting on a given task but never actually executed it successfully It was clear that the analyst was getting so anxious  I could see it  that he wasnt able to process what it was he was being told she said He was rubbing his hands on his knees rocking repeating back words without seeming to grasp the context Ultimately they worked out a system in which the lead would ask fewer openended questions to confirm that the employee understood and the analyst instead of being expected to express any uncertainty or confusion during the conversation would ask followup questions by email or Slack The lead also provided a written cheat sheet with instructions rather than having the staff member take notes while listening The lead reported to Gale the following week that he had a better sense of what the analyst did and did not understand and could therefore address itSome Auticon employees have skills that would likely earn them higher pay were they employed at a big company in the United States But Auticon invests heavily in their training and offers the kind of bespoke workplace systems that allow for their success even for analysts in entrylevel jobs It employs analysts with advanced degrees from top universities and people who failed to make it through college people whose minds work at high operating speed and some with shortterm memory challenges and some with both Somehow the balance of talents and abilities keeps the operation afloatI kind of like it here Hirasuna said a month into his job He was learning new programming skills he wouldnt have acquired on his own He felt the strain of leaving the house every day but also he had to admit some relief As workplaces go this one was relatively painless They accept me as I amAt the Culver City Auticon office one evening in January several employees took turns playing Super Smash Brothers Ultimate in the conference room during a staff party while a software analyst sat silently unmoving unspeaking watching for the duration of the twohour gathering another played alone at his desk on an Xbox One he had brought with himIn the middle of the main room several colleagues and Beam were competing in a brainy board game called Scrutineyes a sophisticated version of I Spy in which competitors name objects on the board that start with a certain letter Horus said one competitor named Will Collett  recognizing the halffalcon halfman image of the Egyptian god He spotted a medieval weapon Halberd Before he worked at Auticon Colletts previous jobs were selling vacuum cleaners door to door and then working at a fastfood restaurant which refused to promote him for reasons he is still not sure he graspsA few feet from that game Grey Patton sat on a small bench near the door Patton sweetfaced and floppyhaired his forehead showing a sheen of perspiration from the stress of the party needed to sit somewhat apart to stay calm in an office full of people talking and moving in unpredictable directions and playing video games at high volume As a college student he said he attended a party  once It felt really claustrophobic he said I was like OK I think Ive had enough He had come to this party mostly for the pepperoni pizza which he was now eating in peace Patton could at least be fairly sure at Auticon that no one would pressure him to join the fun or even wonder why he did notThe night of the party Auticon employees could see if they walked along an outdoor corridor on the way to the bathroom another office across a courtyard Its conference room was brightly lit and crowded with about  welldressed employees The office was the corporate headquarters of a fastcasual vegetarianrestaurant business and its employees looked well suited to the work  fit tan but not too tan as if they had all chosen just the right amount of SPF One person was usually talking at a time everyone else looked listless The darker it got outside and the longer the meeting lasted the more tempting it was for someone walking by to stare into the bright room The office space looked like a diorama of the worlds worst meeting  interminable held at the end of the day in a toosmall harshly lit roomThe next evening the same people seemed to have gathered for yet another meeting in that same bright room In the Auticon office across the way the room was at  silent and dark so dark you actually might want a flashlight to move across it Earlier in the day the room though quiet practically vibrated with an intense sense of collective focus by early evening that concentration was giving way to a more meditative energy Kayla interrupted the silence with a burst of laughter She had been telling her colleague  the one who had bristled in the meeting  that her son had used small metal numbers to post the number representing pi up to  digits on the back of her car The colleague sent a message on Slack I prefer this number  The note made her laugh even though she wasnt sure what it meant Its the square root of  he told her She burst out laughing againThe conversation turned to the meeting happening across the courtyard which seemed to have struck a few people the same way with a feeling of sympathy They had to execute tasks at Auticon but they did not have to perform charm to fake engagement at an intolerably endless meeting Dont they look miserable Beam said Kayla was indignant You know that at least some of them are introverts she said This seemed like unnatural torture to her what those employers were doing It was almost as if they didnt think their employees had feelingsSusan Dominus is a staff writer for the magazine She last wrote about the psychologist Walter MischelFeb  Feb  Feb  Feb  Feb  Feb

comedy Generally the music And the comedyWhich may be why most of the best musicals of the last decade  Fun Home Hamilton The Bands Visit  have been serious indeed The art of being funny on the beat is mostly a lost oneBut David Yazbek the songwriter behind the musical comedies Dirty Rotten Scoundrels and The Full Monty maintains the magic Even his score for The Bands Visit mostly drenched in melancholy has moments of lyrical hilarity Lets just say marrow and pharaoh never thought of rhyming until he insistedThats the top reason among several I have high hopes for the stage version of Tootsie arriving at the Marquis Theater on March  Based on the  movie about an actor whose stalled career revives only when he pretends to be a woman it offers both the size and sentiment a musical comedy in any era needs for liftoff JESSE GREENOKLAHOMA Whats likely to be the freshest most revolutionary musical on Broadway this season is more than threequarters of a century old Its title is Oklahoma and yes thats the same Rodgers and Hammerstein show about farmers cowhands and frontier love that was first seen in New York in  But the director Daniel Fishs revitalizing interpretation scheduled to open at the Circle in the Square Theater on April  asks theatergoers to look at a deeply familiar classic through the eyes of the st centuryThe songs dialogue and characters remain almost entirely the same But as it demonstrated during its soldout run at St Anns Warehouse in Brooklyn last year Mr Fishs version finds provocative depths of darkness amid the prairie sunshine BEN BRANTLEYINK The British actor Bertie Carvel who wore a dress for his Tonynominated role as the terrifying schoolmistress Miss Trunchbull in the musical Matilda six years ago is switching to neatly tailored trousers for his return to Broadway But dont expect him to be any less intimidating In James Grahams Ink which opens in April at the Samuel J Friedman Theater Mr Carvel will be portraying one Rupert Murdoch And in this London hit about the tabloidization of British journalism directed by Rupert Goold any similarities between Mr Carvels character and a certain Australianborn media mogul are definitely not coincidental BEN BRANTLEYWHAT THE CONSTITUTION MEANS TO ME Heidi Schrecks play about invisible women and the th Amendment was electrifyingly topical when it ran Off Broadway last year amid the national outcry over the Supreme Court nomination of Brett KavanaughSadly or fortuitously What the Constitution Means to Me is even more urgent as it moves to Broadway where performances begin on March  Its take on abortion as a protected liberty and a personal turning point comes smack up against nowJustice Kavanaugh who signaled in one of his first opinions a willingness to reverse Roe v WadeBut the play is deeper than its timeliness suggests Though it uses the idea of debate as a touchstone  and ends deliciously with a live one  its really about how we come to question our most bedrock assumptions about the world If that makes seeing it almost a civic duty duty has rarely been so pleasurable JESSE GREENTHE LEHMAN TRILOGY Three Bavarianborn brothers who first set foot on American soil more than  years ago are returning to New York next month accompanied by a centuriesspanning brood of their descendants Their names are Henry Emanuel and Mayer and they  and their seemingly countless kin  will be reincarnated at the Park Avenue Armory in Stefano Massinis The Lehman Trilogy an epic tale of financial rise and ruin directed by Sam MendesThis threehoursplus production features what is surely the largest cast of characters of any play in town Yet they are embodied by a mere three seemingly inexhaustible actors with the power to multiply themselves like amoebas Simon Russell Beale Ben Miles and Adam Godley Though the story they tell  which begins and ends with the worldrocking bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc in   is one of entropy the play in which they appear promises to be a resounding testament to the regenerative powers of theaterAs befits a sprawling globegirdling story of historic transformation The Lehman Brothers has an intricate multinational pedigree Mr Massinis chronicle of a dynasty begun by emigrants to the United States began life as an Italian radio play before making its stage debut in Paris in French in  Its Italian premiere was at the fabled Piccolo Teatro in Milan two years later when it ran a whopping five hoursBen Powers Englishlanguage adaptation opened at the National Theater in London last summer overseen by Mr Mendes the very busy stage and film director whose gripping production of Jez Butterworths The Ferryman is a current hit on Broadway Mr Power pared Mr Massinis trilogy to a sleek and unexpectedly lyrical three hours not counting two intermissions to be performed almost entirely by three actors on an elegant but nearly empty rotating set by the everinventive Es DevlinOtherwise empty is hardly a word to be applied to this interpretation as I can attest from seeing it at the National last July Mr Beale Mr Miles and Mr Godley fill the stage to repletion as they assume the varied forms of the dynastyfounding Henry Emanuel and Mayer  and all subsequent generations of LehmansAnd their friends lovers spouses customers rivals ad infinitum with a variety that continually astonishes Unlike investors who lost their fortunes on Wall Street a decade ago no one who leaves this encounter with the brothers Lehman is likely to walk away feeling poor BEN BRANTLEYMARYS SEACOLE Born in  to a free Jamaican mother and a Scottish father Mary Seacole grew up to become an international businesswoman and freelance nurse crossing paths with soldiers royalty and Florence NightingaleThat would be more than enough material for a straightahead biodrama  but not it seems for the always surprising and formally ingenious Jackie Sibblies Drury whose Fairview was one of last years best plays In the deliberately plural Marys Seacole playing through March  at LCTs Claire Tow Theater everyone in the sixwoman cast is a Mary  or a Merry a Miriam a Mamie or the likeThe indispensable Quincy Tyler Bernstine appears as the historical Mrs Seacole in this production directed by Lileana BlainCruz The others whose characters cross continents and time help raise a central question of nursing even now Who takes care of the people who take care of others JESSE GREENWHITE NOISE No American playwright has contributed more to the churning and everevolving conversation about race in these United and divided States than SuzanLori Parks This prodigiously imaginative writer who won a Pulitzer Prize for TopdogUnderdog has addressed the toxic legacy of slavery in a rich assortment of theatrical forms and languages from the surrealism of her early The America Play to the Homeric chronicle Father Comes Home From the WarsNow Ms Parks is focusing her gaze on interracial friendships in the st century with the resonantly titled White Noise which begins previews next month at her longtime home the Public Theater Oskar Eustis the Publics artistic director oversees a fourmember cast led by Daveed Diggs the original Marquis de Lafayette in Hamilton as an AfricanAmerican man forced to reconsider the depth and danger of the gap between black and white BEN BRANTLEYMRS MURRAYS MENAGERIE Im not sure anyone could have imagined a duller setting for a play than a high school faculty meeting yet in Miles for Mary the theatrical collective called the Mad Ones turned the banality of the break room into a hilarious and ultimately galvanizing Off Broadway hitAs if to top themselves the Mad Ones return this spring with Mrs Murrays Menagerie set in a the s at b a focus group for c a childrens television show That is all we know and all we need to knowExcept that the Ars Nova production which begins performances on March  at the Greenwich House Theater features a cast of expertly lighttouch farceurs under the direction of Lila Neugebauer who made Miles for Mary so moving behind the laughs If this is banality lets have more JESSE GREENTHE RING The Metropolitan Operas hightech lowenergy production of Wagners fouropera Ring which returns for three cycles this spring has been notable mostly for its snafus At its first performance  Das Rheingold back in   the sets massive array of seesaws malfunctioned near the end spoiling the gods climactic ascent across a rainbow bridgeAnother time the Microsoft Windows logo flashed across the stage instead of the sophisticated projections that distinguish the cycles many locales One performance of Die Walkre that was being broadcast live to cinemas worldwide was delayed nearly an hour because the Machine as it became known wouldnt cooperate And thats not counting the loud creaks and whirs that accompanied its every moveBut while the Met claims that the costly Machine  conceived by the productions director Robert Lepage  has been tamed the technical troubles always struck me as distractions from the real problem All of Mr Lepages spending and innovation resulted in a cycle that was dull and out of touch with Wagners intricately drawn characters and plotThe singers seemed genuinely undirected lost in front of the sets imposing mass the production team was scrambling to make the effects work but it appeared that relatively little attention had been given to the acting There were no discernible relationships charted onstage no drama no attempt to transmit  let alone interpret for our time  complex themes of power sacrifice and societal collapseIndeed though the set design meant that some singers spent long stretches in a kind of trough the effects while wonky may have been the best part At the beginning of Das Rheingold bathed in blue light the  enormous planks levitated in silence Wagners long low E flat began Then like the music the machine began undulating  first slowly then faster It truly was the river RhineThe opening storm of Die Walkre similarly came to life We were in a sky full of dark rushing clouds then in the middle of a forest during a snowstorm then inside a hut glowing with firelight It was sweeping and evocativeA production crowded with visual stimulation in which the singers seemed to be left to their own devices This Ring reminded me more than it probably intended to of the Mets hyperrealistic Franco Zeffirelli spectacles of the s Like Mr Lepage Mr Zeffirelli creates grand spaces in which stick figures are moved around The shows ignite when you have compelling performers and sink when you dontThis revival  which Peter Gelb the Mets general manger is mounting after many thought the Machine last seen in  would be mothballed for good  does indeed have some compelling casting Christine Goerke as Brnnhilde promises more vocal confidence than Deborah Voigt had when the production was new Greer Grimsley and Michael Volle will each make a capable articulate Wotan Philippe Jordan returns to the Met for the first time since  to conductThings may well go more smoothly this time around But will this yet be a Wagner we can believe in

RUSSONELLOMERCE CUNNINGHAM Merce Cunningham that marvel of a choreographer understood that dancing meant different things to different people In the book Merce Cunningham Fifty Years he is quoted as saying What to some is splendid entertainment to others is merely tedium and fidgets what to some seems barren to others is the very essence of the heroicHis entire career was a heroic act of vision and persistence One of the most revered and revolutionary choreographers of the th century Cunningham was a rule breaker who collaborated deeply with many artists including his life partner the composer John Cage Their experiments involved allowing music and dance to exist separately as well as introducing the concept of chance as a creative deviceIn  the year of his centennial Cunningham  who died at  in   is being celebrated all over the world with performances workshops talks screenings and moreThe ideas are still very much alive and relevant and exciting and creative Ken Tabachnick the executive director of the Merce Cunningham Trust said Every time I see something again Im just amazed at how relevant it is It could have been made yesterdayThat is one of the important points that Mr Tabachnick and Trevor Carlson  a trustee and the producer of the Trusts celebration of the centennial  hope to impart with the multitentacled celebration Events continue all year and are updated on the Trusts website but one highlight is just around the corner Night of  Solos A Centennial Event on April  Cunninghams birthdayThree cities  London at the Barbican New York at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and Los Angeles at the Center for the Art of Performance at UCLA  will stage Events the name that Cunningham gave to performances that featured fragments of works from his repertory Events date to Were looking to continue Merces tradition of doing things that hadnt been done before Mr Carlson said We wanted to make the largest Event ever madeIn the spirit of the new none of the performers  including the New York City Ballet principal Sara Mearns the Martha Graham dancer PeiJu ChienPott and the choreographers Kyle Abraham and Vicky Shick  are former Cunningham dancers Those dancers are involved however in staging the solos Cunninghams company according to his wishes disbanded after his death and a legacy tourWe wanted to signal that the Cunningham legacy has a future for people who never experienced Cunningham Mr Tabachnick said So youll see ballet dancers youll see dancers who are not classically or rigorously trained youll see younger dancers and older dancers And that is to show the diversity and breadth of the possibilities for the legacyEvents are piling up and include a Cunningham celebration at the Joyce Theater April  featuring Compagnie CNDCAngersRobert Swinston Ballet West and the Washington Ballet Amid the excitement Mr Carlson has a problem Its a good oneIts wild but Im afraid we might have to expand the amount of time of the centennial in order to include everyone who wants to be included he said I think were going to see ourselves extending to what would have been Merces st birthday GIA KOURLASDANCE THEATER OF HARLEM Dance Theater of Harlem has never been just another ballet troupe It was created in  as a hopeful reaction to hopecrushing circumstances The assassination of the Rev Dr Martin Luther King Jr was among the spurs to action but the principal problem in need of addressing was longstanding and continuing the dearth of opportunities for ballet dancers who were not white You cant do this these dancers were told by the world in many ways Dance Theater of Harlem told them they could and then proved it to the worldThe survival of this institution for  years deserves a big celebration With the death of its trailblazing founding director Arthur Mitchell in September the anniversary festivities have also become memorials In recent decades the company has valiantly struggled with diminished funds and its New York season at City Center April   isnt as grand as one might wish Such signatures pieces as Agon Firebird and Creole Giselle return only in excerpts But its appropriate that one of Mr Mitchells works Tones is being revived and Robert Garland the troupes underrecognized resident choreographer is presenting a premiere However these turn out the occasion is major BRIAN SEIBERTPAM TANOWITZ When Emma Portner known for her video dances withdrew from a New York City Ballet commission the company turned to Pam Tanowitz The circumstances are hardly ideal but heres a oneword reaction FinallyMs Tanowitz whose new ballet will be unveiled at the companys spring gala on May  has been making dances since  Celebrated for her ability to mix classical and contemporary vocabulary within a framework of formal structures she will expand a piece set to Bartoks String Quartet No  that she created during a choreographic workshop at American Ballet Theater in Its not the prolific Ms Tanowitzs only new dance this season In April she presents a work at the Martha Graham Dance Company another commission from Paul Taylor American Modern Dance will have its premiere at the Orchestra of St Lukes Bach Festival in June the same month she presents a new work for her company and the City Ballet dancers Sara Mearns and Taylor Stanley at the Lower Manhattan Cultural Councils River to River FestivalAnd on March  she will land in Cleveland to stage a sitespecific work at Pilgrim Congregational Church for her company along with local dancers Recital  five small dances for Cleveland is an experiment Shes looking at ways to reimagine her repertory GIA KOURLASLIGIA LEWIS Every so often New Yorkers catch a glimpse of the choreographer Ligia Lewis who spends much of her time in Berlin Her brief visits which in

written directly to my little son and I am thrilled to know that you can read it all by yourself If you miss some of the words I am sure it will be because I do not write very plainly Mother will help you in that case I am sureI was certainly glad to hear your voice over the longdistance telephone It sounded as though I were right in the living room with you You sounded as though you missed your daddy very much I miss you too more than anyone will ever know It is too bad this war could not have been delayed a few more years so that I could grow up again with you and do with you all the things I planned to do when you were old enough to go to schoolI thought how nice it would be for me to come home early in the afternoon and play ball with you and go mountainclimbing and see the trees and brooks and learn all about woodcraft hunting fishing swimming and things like that I suppose we must be brave and put these things off for a little whileWhen you are a little bigger you will know why your daddy is not home so much any more You know we have a big country and we have ideals as to how people should live and enjoy the riches of it and how each is born with equal rights to life freedom and the pursuit of happiness Unfortunately there are some countries in the world where they dont have these ideals where a boy cannot grow up to be what he wants to be with no limits on his opportunities to be a great man such as a great priest statesman doctor soldier business man etcBecause there are people and countries who want to change our nation its ideals forms of government and

love and devotion for Mother and youYour daddyOn the afternoon of Sept  the Wasp was in the Coral Sea escorting a convoy of United States Marines bound for Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands when it was hit by torpedoes fired at close range by a Japanese submarine Explosions immediately rocked the ship Many men were killed instantly The ships magazines and fuel stores detonated like bombs The hangar deck where most of the planes were stored was soon entirely ablaze At the same time water rushed into the breaches in the ships hull and the Wasp lurched  degrees to its starboard side like a boxer buckling at the knee after a body shotThe commanding officer of the Wasp Capt Forrest P Sherman swung the ship around so that the flames and smoke blew toward the ocean rather than across the deck but it made no difference More than  feet of his ship from the bow to the central island containing the bridge was subsumed by an uncontrollable inferno Within minutes the Wasp had become a vision of hellHalf an hour after the strikes Sherman realized the situation was hopeless He made the order to abandon ship The worstinjured were loaded onto rafts Many other survivors simply jumped into the flaming waters around the ship with only life preservers flotsam or mattresses to keep them afloatSign up for the weekly At War newsletter to receive stories about duty conflict and consequenceFive hours after the Wasp was hit it was irreparably damaged but still drifting with the current The USS Lansdowne was ordered to scuttle the carrier with a volley of torpedoes The Wasp slipped below the surface at    pm  then sank through more than two and a half miles of water to the bottom where it has remained ever since a giant carcass surrounded by miles of desert in the permanent midnight of the deep ocean floor In total  men on the Wasp were deemed killed or missing on Sept   One of them was John SheaOn Jan  of this year a research vessel called the Petrel set out from Honiara on Guadalcanal to find the Wasp To locate a shipwreck  even a foot aircraft carrier  its essential to have an accurate idea of where to start looking The ocean is vast You need to find the haystack before you can find the needle In the Second World War before the advent of satellites a ships position was plotted using traditional opensea techniques There was celestial navigation  using a sextant to navigate by the sun and the stars  and dead reckoning the estimation of current position based on time speed and bearing In dead reckoning a tiny miscalculation of one variable over a great distance can lead to a large error in final position A navigators skill was particularly tested when his ship was under fire or sinking As a result separate reports from naval battles of the era can show the same vessel in positions more than  nautical miles apartThe ocean is also frighteningly deep Much of the bottom of the Coral Sea where the Wasp went down lies between  and  meters in what is known as the abyssal zone a lightless realm characterized by frigid water temperatures scant animal life and crushing atmospheric pressure Below  meters in the oceanic trenches the deepest part of the ocean is known as the hadal zone it is truly the underworldIt can be hard to grasp the profundity of the abyss You could imagine its depth as being between eight and  Freedom Towers stacked one on top of another or at the higher end of the range one Denali But even thinking about the distance to the ocean floor in terms of height is ultimately unhelpful because to imagine skyscrapers or mountains is to imagine them made visible by light and the sea is entirely dark below about  meters While I was on board the Petrel the concept that I found most vivid and unsettling was the idea of sinking time When the crew dropped a transponder fitted with a pound weight from the deck of the Petrel it took more than an hour to reach the bottomA result of this profound inaccessibility is that scientists know the surface of Mars in greater detail than they do the abyssal plains of the ocean which cover more than  percent of the earths surface An international project called Seabed  aims to recruit enough vessels to conduct a full bathymetric survey of all the worlds oceans within  years  a laudable if wildly ambitious task The oceans cover  million square miles At present less than  percent of the ocean floor has been adequately mappedThe Petrel is perhaps the bestequipped and certainly the most successful private vessel on Earth for finding deepwater wrecks A foot North Sea oilandgasmaintenance vessel bought in  and retrofitted for wreck hunting it is a strange but beautiful ship Its the Petrels height that strikes you first The ship is steered from a bridge on the seventh deck more than  feet above the waterline with degree windows that lend it the feel of an aircraftcontrol tower or an aerie The ships most precious assets are housed several decks below the bridge They include an autonomous underwater vehicle or AUV an underwater drone that looks like a fat yellow torpedo The AUV uses sidescan sonar to look for anomalies on the seafloor The Petrel also houses a remotely operated vehicle or ROV a fourton square submersible robot that looks like a futuristic elevator car which is fitted with powerful lamps highdefinition cameras and hydraulic arms and is connected to the Petrel by a meter umbilical cord on a winchThe Petrel owes its existence and success to Paul Allen the multibillionaire who founded Microsoft with Bill Gates and who died in October at age  after a recurrence of nonHodgkins lymphoma For Allen underwater exploration and World War II history were abiding interests Allens lavishly appointed foot yacht the Octopus had its own submarine and ROV which he used for subsea exploration But after a few notable successes  including the discovery in  of the wreck of the largest battleship ever built the Japanese Musashi  Allen decided he wanted his own separate research vessel that wouldnt stop exploring every time he wanted to use the Octopus for the Cannes Film Festival or for New Years in St Barts Allen bought the Petrel paid for its renovation salaried its crew and sourced its rare and expensive underwaterresearch tools The investment has paid off abundantly In the two years since it became a dedicated wreck hunter the Petrel has discovered among many other ships the remains of the USS Lexington and USS Juneau as well as perhaps the most infamous American warship of all time the USS Indianapolis which sank with tremendous loss of life in The vessel itself is worth  million the AUV and the ROV cost around  million each the crew is highly skilled and could easily be employed in oil and gas or other fields To fill the Petrels fuel tank from empty costs  Chartering the Petrel fully crewed as the United States Navy has done when American aircraft have been lost at sea costs about  a day But to Allen at least its expense was trifling In  he pledged to give away more than half his wealth That goal proved impossible within his lifetime His investment portfolio grew faster than he could spend it Allen bought superyachts estates and sports teams that barely dented his pile He collected vintage planes guitars and cars He threw Gatsbyesque parties He started a minor space program He also gave  billion away in the fields of education health care science and the arts and appeared on The Chronicle of Philanthropys list of the  most generous Americans  years in a row Nevertheless he was worth more at the time of his death  billion than he was in   billion Allens portfolio of business and philanthropic interests  including the Petrel  is now being managed by his sister Jody and the senior management of his company VulcanWhen the Petrel sailed from Honiara there were  people on board including a photographer for this magazine and me Most of the crew were maritime  that is they attended to the continued smooth and safe running of the ship itself A separate exploration team consisting of  highly caffeinated British and American engineers and programmers was dedicated to the subsea mission This group was called ATU which stands for all things underwater Leading the expedition was Robert Kraft a former Army medic and civilian submarine pilot who bore more than a passing resemblance to a The Fugitiveera Harrison Ford and who was known to his colleagues as Hollywood RobKraft had allotted  days to search for the Wasp after which the Petrel would change course to look for another sunken American carrier In theory this was plenty of time Searching one oceanfloor grid of about  square miles with the AUV took about  hours If the sortie yielded no clues it was possible to reprogram and relaunch the probe in a few hours Roughly speaking the AUV could complete a new mission every  to  hours When you deducted the time it took to travel to and from the rough spot in the ocean where the Wasp was believed to have sunk  a little less than three days in total  that gave the crew something like  opportunities to find the wreck But deepsea exploration rarely runs smoothly Time is always lost for equipment repair and recalibration bad weather and other unforeseeable delays It seemed most likely that the Petrel might have no more than a dozen attempts to find the Wasp As in a game of Battleship Kraft had to call his shots with careThe Wasps navigator was a yearold officer named Lt Cmdr John F Greenslade When lookouts spotted the Japanese torpedoes coming toward the Wasp Greenslade was in the chart house his maps spread before him He heard the shout Torpedoes on the starboard bow and immediately went outside where he watched as two of them disappeared out of sight and thundered into the Wasps flank just forward of where he stoodThe blast forced Greenslade back inside the chart house His formerly tidy office had become a shambles Greenslade gathered his maps and ran forward to the bridge along with several other officers Debris from explosions slammed against the windows and superstructure Within minutes Greenslade and his fellow officers evacuated the bridge  which by now was roasting hot  and moved to the back of the ship They did so just in time The bridge structure was soon completely wrecked by a huge explosion Both the fiveinch magazines and the thousandpound bombs were housed directly underneath the central island Evidently one or both of these stores had detonatedWhat happened to Greenslade over the next few hours is difficult to piece together In the account he later wrote for the official action report he neglects to narrate what must have been a harrowing escape noting only that he was rescued by the USS Lansdowne But Sherman the commanding officer on the Wasp mentions Greenslade as having helped wounded and helpless men into life rafts before abandoning ship From the reports it can be assumed that  like many other senior officers on the Wasp including Sherman  Greenslade swam In fact as I later discovered from Greenslades grandson the navigator spent several hours in the ocean without a life preserver having given his own to a fellow sailor who was not a strong swimmer When Greenslade was rescued by the Lansdowne he watched as its commanding officer scuttled the Wasp Evidently Greenslade had stowed his charts somewhere waterproof his final report offers startlingly precise coordinates for the ships position as it sankOn board the Petrel during the first afternoon of the mission Kraft agonized over how much to trust Greenslades positions He needed a sounding board The deputy leader of ATU was a wry yearold Californian named Paul Mayer bald except for a fringe of gray hair who was known to his colleagues as Pops Mayer has a background in commercial diving and submersibles but he has also become ATUs historical researcher When on dry land he spends weeks in the National Archives in College Park Md pulling naval records to pinpoint the most likely place a potential target sank Mayer then plots the various positions noted in the official records onto a Google Earth map On the Petrel Mayer and Kraft scour the data and original documents in meetings known by both men as Speculation ClubAs the Petrel sailed eastward from Honiara along a stretch known as Iron Bottom Sound for the concentration of World War II shipwrecks in its relatively shallow waters Speculation Club convened in Krafts windowless office on the second deck Kraft and Mayer discussed the Wasps complicated final movements When it was hit at around  the Wasp was traveling southeast It was then abandoned between  and  From that point on the Wasp became what is known as a dead ship floating without power Speculation Club believed that the current pushed the moribund Wasp west and northwest at a speed of just over one knot for around four hours Then came the Lansdownes scuttling torpedoes after which the Wasp finally sankMayer and Kraft worked on the supposition that ships sink straight down with little variation for current After I left the Petrel I asked a lecturer in ship technology at Britannia Royal Naval College about this question He told me that  in deep water at least  a vessel could behave like an aerofoil especially when picking up speed and might move a significant distance off the vertical when sinking But he also said the process was complex dynamic and based on so many unknown factors including air pockets buoyancy and the asymmetrical nature of the damage that caused the ship to sink In other words even if you knew that ships tracked away from the point of sinking while underwater it wouldnt change much about how you looked for a wreckBesides Greenslades reckoning several nearby American ships gave estimates of the Wasps final position at  These data points spanned around  miles The question was whom to trust Kraft was skeptical about how much credence to give Greenslades reckoning not least because the Lansdownes own navigator had marked his map  miles south of the spot Greenslade noted Youd think Kraft said birds of a feather hed at least go chat to the navigator on the LansdowneThere were often long periods of silence at Speculation Club This was one such time Both men sat with their feet up on desks hands cradled trying to imagine the mindset of a World War II navigator who in one afternoon and evening had watched friends die seen his ship destroyed swum with sharks and still found time to note down the Wasps final longitude and latitudeEventually Mayer spoke He was thinking about how many other data points seemed to roughly tally with Greenslades and how the only outlier on the Google Earth map was the spot recorded by the Lansdownes navigator Theres no way shes down there he said tapping his finger on the spot at the southern end of the map where the Lansdownes navigator said the Wasp sankIve heard that from you before Kraft said Both men laughedThe Petrel had invited a special guest for this mission an amiable retired twostar admiral named Sam Cox who now leads the Naval History and Heritage Command in Washington Cox is interested in the cataloging and preservation of United States Navy wrecks some of which  at least in shallower waters  are at risk of being damaged by bounty hunters or raised by salvage firms who chase value in large supplies of metal Cox told me that the wrecks of United States warships were the Navys equivalent of the Arlington National Cemetery and should be accorded similar respect But he was also a walking encyclopedia on naval history and a distinct help in interpreting the original documents used by the Petrel to find lost shipsAt one point during Speculation Club Cox stopped by Krafts office and Mayer asked him which position he trusted more Wasps or LansdownesOh I think Id trust the navigator on a carrier over a navigator on a destroyer Cox said More experienceSoon after the decision was made Kraft put a yellow pin where he wanted the AUV to begin its first mission near Greenslades spot The Petrel was just out of sight of land and still more than a days sailing away from the yellow icon on the Google Earth mapAt a little after  pm on Jan  we were on site and the AUV was primed for its first mission The Petrel rolled in a threemeter swell The ocean was inky and purplish here Pink squid jumped near the surface in the light the ship cast into the water Giant tuna swam off the sternKraft watched on the aft deck as the fat yellow drone was rolled out of its hangar on a cradle A white light blinked on its fin One of the ATU team  a jovial shavenheaded Englishman named Scott Matthews  operated a crane fixed to the port side of the deck which lifted the vehicle up and into the water The AUV is designed to be slightly buoyant In order to save battery life a weight is affixed to its nose so that it dives At a preprogrammed depth in this case  meters the AUV is instructed to detach the weight at which point it engages its propeller and spirals the remaining couple hundred meters to the bottom If the vehicle aborts for any reason a notuncommon occurrence it also detaches its weight and rises to the surfaceThe team peered over the port side as the yellow drone dived beneath the ship its blinking light growing fainter then disappearing Id been reading Shermans report of the Wasps sinking that day Three torpedoes were sighted close aboard approaching the captain wrote Almost immediately the ship received three hits Watching the AUV barrel underneath the hull of the Petrel I couldnt help but perceive a plangent echo of events  years ago in this very patch of oceanThe crew however had more pressing concerns In the online room  the nerve center of ATUs operations which was furnished with three dozen screens  a monitor tracking the AUV showed that the vehicle had aborted dropped its weight and was returning to the surface The reasons it does so are sometimes never fully understood even by the most experienced ATU members It was accepted that any number of factors  including an obstacle sensed by the AUVs forwardfacing sonar a loss of battery or a programming malfunction  could cause the drone to abort One member of ATU told me not to try to understand because its all witchcraft He added Send stuff down to   meters a few times and stuffs going to go wrongA twoman team was dispatched in a Zodiac inflatable to fetch the recalcitrant drone where it bobbed flashing at the surface more than  yards away from the Petrel in an increasingly swollen sea a risky operation especially at night Once the AUV had been affixed to the Zodiac by carabiner and then towed back to the Petrel hauled on board and reprogrammed it was sent down again at a little before  pm This time it appeared to dive I went to bed I woke up a few hours later to the news that the AUV had aborted at midnight The crew worked all night to reprogram herKraft now faced another tough decision The weather was worsening and the swell had risen to a maximum of five meters Thats a big sea In my cabin on the sixth deck I felt as if I might be pitched clean out of my bunk Kraft could easily send the AUV down in this weather but retrieving it with the Zodiac might put his crew  and the drone  at risk Kraft made the call All operations were delayed until the ocean flattened outThat didnt happen until more than a day later an hour or so after breakfast on Jan  when the AUV was sent down again At that point the Petrel was about  nautical miles southeast of Honiara We hadnt seen another ship in two days When the Zodiac was dispatched to retrieve the surfaced AUV it was  the next morning The humidity was stifling Seabirds flew over the Petrel fish thronged the water and two or three oceanic whitetip sharks circled near the ZodiacThe drone was returned to its cradle on deck a wire plugged into its side and its data retrieved  a process that took around  minutes The team convened in the online room to watch as the results of the dive came in Eric Brager  a bearish dryly comic AUV expert from New York  had explained what I would be looking at when I saw the sonar data visualized on screen It would be rows of what looked like a mown Kansas wheat field If the seabed were perfectly flat the sonar image would be featureless If there were rocky hills or obstructions youd see a shadow  known as a holiday  behind the outcrop What the crew was looking for were items inexplicable by geology In the case of a debris field the anomalies would look like a collection of shiny flecks In the case of a whole preserved shipwreck the sonar would show what looked like a toy ship dropped in a sandboxKraft peered at the screens as the results came in Mostly the sonar image showed a flat uninterrupted desert But scrolling through one line of data something caught Krafts eye in the southeast portion of the image shiny flecksHello expletive Dolly he said rising slightly from his chair Thats debrisIn the next few minutes the team would identify two distinct patches of debris a few hundred yards apart from each other It was  am Kraft seemed as excited as a puppy Thats a wreck he said at one point before walking the comment back Certainly the debris looked like a promising clue The biggest patch was within three miles of where Greenslade the Wasps navigator said the ship went down Kraft asked his team to run a new search south of where the debris fields had been located It seemed very likely he thought that the Wasp itself would be there right at the end of the debris trailWhen the AUV was pulled out of the water after its next mission at around  pm the online room filled Mayer and Kraft hovered by the screens There was always an air of anticipation when the sonar data came in Mayer told me that the moment was like opening your gifts on Christmas morning Youre waiting to unwrap your presents and see if you got socks or something you really wantedIt was socks The AUV found a little more debris in the new grid but no ship Mayer and Kraft spent a while thinking about where to go next They had used two of their Battleship shotsThis was the first mission since Paul Allens death and the crew felt his absence On previous missions Kraft emailed his billionaire boss at least once a day to update him Allen did not give praise lightly The highest honor Kraft could hope to receive from his boss was an email with two words in caps VERY COOL But there was no uncertainty regarding how much Allen loved the Petrel He liked to watch via a remote feed when his team dived with the ROV at a new site There was never any doubt an ATU member told me halfjoking We were in the entertainment business with an audience of oneIn August  when the Petrels ROV dived to  meters on what the ATU assumed to be the wreck of the Indianapolis Allen watched the feed from a suite at CenturyLink Field where the NFL team he owned the Seattle Seahawks was beating the Minnesota Vikings in a preseason game The only other live feed was provided for Allens friend Steven Spielberg in Los Angeles a distinctly postmodern arrangement It had been Robert Shaws boozeaddled speech about the hundreds of American sailors from the Indianapolis eaten by tiger sharks with lifeless eyes in Spielbergs Jaws that helped to fix the story of the Indy in the American psyche as the quintessential naval nightmare According to those who knew Allen finding a significant wreck lit him up like Times SquareThe work of the Petrel was more than entertainment for Allen however His father fought in World War II and he had become increasingly interested in the history of the conflict The discoveries were a way he said to honor all those who served our country Under the Sunken Military Craft Act the wrecks of American warships on the bottom of the ocean are designated sovereign United States territory Cox told me that the Navys Underwater Archaeology Branch maintains a database of all known and bestestimate locations of lost United States Navy craft When a wreck is found the precise location is added to that database but never made public  because the Navy has no interest in encouraging exploration on these sites The Navy will however try to contact veterans and survivors groups associated with a ship in order to break the news of the discovery to themTwo days passed The crew ate mountains of food three times a day A few of them fished off the aft deck at shifts end Sometimes but not often they hit the trim room to exercise The AUV only completed one successful mission  west of the first grid  and came back with nothing but mown wheat fields Another mission was aborted Four shots gone Speculation Club met more frequently as Kraft and Mayer tried to understand the mistake in their theories The Wasp was traveling southeast it was hit by the Japanese torpedoes it was abandoned it floated with the current westnorthwest it was scuttled by the Lansdowne it sank But if all those things were true then the AUV should have found it already What had they missed It was a perpetual intrigue to Kraft and Mayer that facts faithfully recorded in deck logs and official reports could prove so misleading After the last fruitless sonar search Kraft was in the online room with his eyes fixed on a monitor when he said to nobody in particular the elusive Wasp There was I thought some tenderness in itThen came a setback A crew member became ill with severe abdominal pains Nobody on board wanted to take any risks the Petrel steamed back to Honiara the nearest port to seek medical help The journey was  hours one way The importance of finding a shipwreck paled Nevertheless the prospects for the mission now looked bad In the bestcase scenario in which the crew member was successfully and swiftly treated wed lose four days of the expedition Four Battleship shots It was only at the moment when the mission seemed bound to fail  at least within the time I would be on board  that I realized how invested I had become in the Petrels finding the Wasp It wasnt only a sense of narrative closure I sought although that was a part of it I had by now read widely on the Wasps history and was gripped by its stories and characters There was David McCampbell who survived the sinking by jumping into the water and who subsequently became the most successful Navy fighter ace of the entire war There was Benedict Semmes Jr who later became a vice admiral Semmes saw an eightfoot shark circling his group of survivors as they swam toward the USS Duncan but decided not to tell anybody lest he cause a panic A wise decision The shark left his group alone There was the indelible vision of the Wasps air officer Michael Kernodle who was in the water when he looked back at the carrier and realized that he could see all the way through the ship from side to sideWhat caused this large hole I do not know but it must have been the result of a terrific explosion Kernodle later wroteAnd then there was John Shea and the letter to his son which made my eyes brim every time I read it The action reports on the sinking of the Wasp mention Shea in the most glowing terms As assistant air officer he would have been in a high part of the central island called the primary fly tower when the torpedoes hit overseeing the takeoff and landing of the ships aircraft As soon as the explosions started Shea rushed down a ladder and toward the danger grabbing firefighting gear as he went The mains had been knocked out in the torpedo strikes meaning there was no water pressure in the hoses Shea did what he could with chemical retardants He was last seen on the port walkway leading out another hose when an enormous explosion in the account of one witness blew steel plating  feet above the deck Some of the men were blown into the air the officer wrote and I did not see them againIt wasnt just Sheas heroism that bit me The more I learned about him the more I was drawn in Shea was a tall lean redheaded softspoken Irish Catholic from Cambridge Mass and a career naval officer with the body of an athlete but the reflective manner of a poet At Boston College where he was an outstanding undergraduate scholar he had written verse competed on the debating team and played varsity football A reporter on the Wasp wrote that his freckled nose was dented from personal combat After college he waited years to marry his sweetheart Elizabeth because of some ill feeling between his family and hers John and Elizabeths son Jack was an only child and a late blessingWhen the news reached home that Shea was missing presumed dead two of his four sisters both Boston publicschool teachers remembered the letter their brother had sent to his son and read it to their gradeschool classes The school system then decided to publish it in a pamphlet Soon the text became a national sensation The Dear Jackie letter was reprinted in The Boston Globe which called it an inspiring memorial to American youth Life magazine followed as did many other papers Long before Shea was declared legally dead on Sept    a year and a day after the Wasp was sunk  the story of the letter grew bigger than the story of the Wasp itselfJack Shea died in  at the age of  a father of three and a grandfather of nine having enjoyed a happy career as a teacher of Latin and Greek at Boston College Throughout his adult life he oscillated between pride in his fathers legacy and unease about the strange and unbidden attention the Dear Jackie letter had brought him From time to time people would ask him about the letter and he would answer their questions as politely as he could before moving the conversation on The tale of the Wasp however would never leave him alone Especially toward the end of his life Jack Shea often wondered exactly what had become of his father and the aircraft carrier on which he servedI am the father of two young children  including a bookish yearold boy who hid a handwritten note in my luggage saying how much he would miss me while I was on the ship Thanks  for the note and card John Shea had told Jackie Write me very often and tell me everything But I also felt a deeper connection to the Shea story When I was  my own father a pilot who spent much of his career in the British Navy was killed in a helicopter accident My father was  when he died Shea was  It was hard for me to read the Dear Jackie letter with all its vulnerability and oldfashioned mantoboy wisdom and not feel a flare of anguished kinshipI realized of course that the Wasps stories existed whether the wreck was found or not But the physical artifact itself now seemed important because it might allow these narratives to be reawakened Anybody interested in the history of World War I infantry battles can tread the same Flanders and Picardy fields as the young men who fought in their millions there and empathize with their experience I have done so myself There is no better recruiting sergeant for pacifism than a walking tour of the Western Front But the surface of the ocean holds no landmarks To understand or memorialize the sailors battle experience you must dive deepThe sick crew member was treated swiftly The pain it turned out was not a harbinger of a serious ailment We returned to the search site as fast as the Petrel could motor  which was  knots or about the speed of the fastest meter runners On Jan  the AUVs data showed nothing but wheat fields On Jan  it came up empty againOn this second occasion it was  am when the drone was retrieved and three sharks circled the Zodiac A young ATU member  a heavily bearded Englishman named Pat Travis  leaned out to clip the drone to the hook on the crane when a sixfoot oceanic whitetip glided in between his boat and the AUV Had Travis wanted to he could have stroked the sharks dorsal fin as it swam by It was a genuinely hairraising moment but one quickly dismissed by the crew They now had a technical problem to solve The drone they noticed was letting in waterAs the ATU team fixed the problem Kraft used the delay wisely He chose to dive with the ROV on the big debris fields they had found on the first grid a week earlier He was still hoping for more clues Mayer teased him saying the robot would find a sign saying Wasp  m this way Kraft had the grace to laughThe remote submersible is a remarkable piece of equipment The Petrel sends  volts and  amps of electricity down the umbilical cord to the ROV as well as instructions that operate its thrusters The mother ship receives crystalline images from the subs nine cameras Through this technological devilry two pilots sitting in what look like gaming chairs in the online room fly the ROV to the bottom of the ocean inspecting the abyssal surrounds as easily as if they were looking through the glass at the aquariumWhen the pilots dived on the debris field what they found was ghostly On the bottom of the ocean among mesh iron railings and shell casings were dozens of helmets The find caused more headscratching from Kraft and Mayer It seemed quite unlikely that whatever they had found was evidence of one of the Wasps two major traumas the Japanese strike or the American volley that scuttled the shipIt doesnt seem like a major event but it is spread over a wide area so whatever happened it happened to a ship that was moving fast Kraft saidA new theory began to formulate in Krafts mind that wouldnt reach full expression until hed sent down the AUV again and seen more lines of wheat fields The debris they had found wasnt from the Wasp If he was right every single data point they had on their map was wrong by at least  miles But Kraft could see no other possible explanation His team had now run six search grids  around  square miles  and had come up empty The exact coordinates recorded by a dozen United States navigators didnt matter now They were all in Krafts opinion worthlessCox was more measured in his analysis It doesnt give you a whole load of confidence in American openocean navigation he said to a rueful smile from others in the online roomKraft however was on the cusp of a breakthrough If the coordinates were wrong and the debris hadnt in fact come from the Wasp it was most likely to have been a result of torpedo strikes on two other ships in the convoy The Japanese submarine had in fact fired six torpedoes in the volley that fatally wounded the Wasp One passed the Wasp but went on to hit the USS OBrien compromising it so much that it sank a month later Another struck the USS North Carolina forcing it back to Pearl Harbor for repairs Both were significant events but not as traumatic as the attack on the Wasp All that mattered to Kraft now was where the Wasp had been in relation to the OBrien and the North Carolina Mayer found a sketch and Cox found a photograph Each seemed to confirm that the Wasp had been southwest of the OBrien and the North Carolina when it was hitWell if thats true then it pushes everything further south Kraft saidHe eyed the map again There was an empty unsearched square in the southwest at least  miles from any navigators estimate of where the Wasp went under He tapped on it with his finger All the clues push me over here he saidMayer was silent He could see his friend was onto something and he didnt want to disturb his train of thought The new theory made perfect sense of the nagging but inchoate feeling that Mayer had wrestled with ever since the AUV found the first debris site and Kraft had momentarily declared victory Speculation Club had been misinterpreting the clues the ocean floor was sending them Indeed even before Kraft sent the drone down again to scan the new grid there was a general sense of intellectual accomplishment in the online roomWhen the AUV reemerged from the deep it was around  am on Jan  Id been away since the end of December It was nearly time to catch a flight home We were still more than a days sailing from the nearest airport There might not be another chance for an AUV mission after this oneThe sonar information was spooled onto the screens of the online room We all peered at the monitors Sitting in the middle of the grid unmistakably was a toy ship dropped in a sandboxThere she is Kraft saidNobody spoke for what seemed like a while Somebody in the room cried Those seconds felt complicated emotionally The Petrels purpose is to find wrecks and this moment was the purest distillation of that imperative but there was no immediate celebration Part of the sobriety was that the sound waves drawing the outline of the ship represented the lives of  people whose stories  over the past days and weeks  we had come to know In my mind at least there was also a fleeting thin and unexpected sliver of regret which I still cant fully explain the pang of watching a hunter standing over a shot stagEventually Kraft broke the quiet Nailed it he saidHours later the Petrels ROV dived lights blaring on the Wasp It was accompanied until around  meters by two of the sharks who now followed us wherever we went The ROV took more than an hour to descend to  meters where the Wasp lay It spent the next halfday or so inspecting the wreck from one end to the other with only the occasional slowmoving deepsea creature interrupting the viewThe fire and explosions that had wounded the Wasp were evident everywhere Whole sections of deck were missing In one spot forward of the central island it looked as if the ship had been cleaved like a log The bridge was marked with charred flame lines The funnel had sheared off But the cold deep water and the lack of light had preserved the wreck remarkably well My overriding impression was how small it seemed for a carrier that had housed more than  sailors and dozens of airplanes There had been so much life contained within that rusting hulkScattered around the wreck of the Wasp were airplanes Dauntlesses Wildcats and Avengers in various states of destruction Even before the Wasp sank according to the captains report the planes on both the flight and hangar decks were thrown high in the air by explosions and were badly damaged A trip to the bottom of the ocean had not improved their condition And then there was the ghostly sight of dozens of helmets lying in the siltBy the time we returned to Honiara days later Coxs colleagues in the Navy had been officially informed of the Wasps discovery and her location noted Otherwise it was left alone The process of contacting the families of men who had served on the ship began I called the family of Commander Shea myselfJack Shea married a woman named Claudette with whom he had three children John Laura and Christine Over the period of about a week I spoke to all four of Jack Sheas immediate family to tell them about the Wasp It was strange news to deliver The facts about their grandfather were not changed by the discovery and yet something had changed They were all thrilled that a crew had taken the time and effort to locate the ship Laura a social worker reacted to the news surprisingly emotionally John a network engineer was happy there was new information to bolster his understanding of the conflict in which his grandfather served Claudette told me that her husband would have been shocked amazed  and sad of course to relive his childhood memories The exact site of the Wasp Claudette told me was a puzzle that Jack always hoped would be solvedWhen I spoke to Christine Commander Sheas youngest grandchild  a teacher in a public school  she told me she felt some regret because she knew how much the news would have meant to her father But she also found the discovery thrilling in part because it would mean that a new generation of people would have a chance to read her grandfathers letter In a polarized America she told me its values sang outTheres a strong sense of living a good life Christine said Theres nothing in that letter about making a lot of moneyChristine also told me about what Commander Sheas example had meant to her father whom she described as a humble man who did not crave the limelight that sometimes shined on him because of the letter She said that Jack Shea had lived within the value system his father adumbrated in that short text almost to the item His had been in every sense a good life  albeit one touched by tragedy In a strange way the discovery of the Wasp had brought closure to this complicated episode in the Shea history The whole family she said had believed that the Wasps last resting place would remain unknowable Now all these years later the mystery had been put to restTo not be missing forever Christine said That seems importantSeveral days after I spoke to the family about the discovery of the Wasp Jack Sheas widow Claudette wrote me an email She told me that the news had encouraged her to revisit the Shea family history She found herself researching her husbands papers There she discovered a note written by John Shea as a boy The text was undated but the childish scrawl suggested it would have been written in the earliest years of the th century when Teddy Roosevelt was president nobody had yet driven a Ford Model T and an aircraft carrier was a distant futuristic instrument of warWhen I am a man I am going to be a soldier because I like to fight for my country it read I like to march and ride on horse back and go on shipsEd Caesar is a writer in Manchester England and the
