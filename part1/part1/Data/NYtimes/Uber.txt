We’ll try to translate them for you.By Michael J. de la MercedIt’s a timeworn tradition for technology companies to resort to an array of jargon and technical terms to describe their operations — especially if they’re not making a profit.There’s WeWork’s “community-adjusted Ebitda,” which strips out expenses like taxes and marketing. Or you may have forgotten about “adjusted consolidated segment operating income,” also known as “Acsoi” (pronounced ACK-soy), which Groupon briefly used in the run-up to its initial public offering. (To critics, such measures sometimes equate to “earnings without all the bad stuff.”)[Uber is losing $1.8 billion a year, its I.P.O. filing reveals.]Uber is no exception, deploying a number of metrics in its newly filed prospectus to describe how well its core business is doing, despite running a $1.8 billion loss last year. If you’re unfamiliar with them, here’s a glossary to help you out.“The total dollar value, including any applicable taxes, tolls and fees, of ride-sharing and new mobility rides, Uber Eats meal deliveries and amounts paid by shippers for Uber Freight shipments, in each case without any adjustment for consumer discounts and refunds, driver and restaurant earnings, and driver incentives.”It’s the total dollar amount that Uber gets from every ride, meal delivery or freight shipment, before the delivery person gets a cut and other costs are excluded.Uber had $49.8 billion in gross bookings last year, up 45 percent from 2017.But the company warned that its average gross bookings per trip would go down as it expanded lower-priced offerings like Uber Pool, scooters and “auto rickshaws.” “Core platform consists primarily of ride-sharing and Uber Eats.”That was easy.“Core platform adjusted net revenue as a percentage of core platform gross bookings.”It’s basically a measure of revenue. Subtract driver or restaurant pay and incentives from gross bookings to get “core platform net revenue.” Divide that by gross bookings.It’s a number that will fluctuate a lot, depending on the size of Uber’s driver incentives at any given point. The bigger the incentives that the company doles out to persuade drivers to use its platform, the worse that take rate gets.Last year, the company reported a 20 percent take rate for its core business. That breaks down a little bit more: Ride hailing had a 22 percent take rate, while Uber Eats had a 10 percent rate.“Core platform contribution profit (loss) as a percentage of core platform adjusted net revenue.” Consider it a jargon-laden way of describing Uber’s profit margins from every ride-hailing trip or Uber Eats delivery. Start with core platform net revenue, then strip out costs like marketing and research-and-development costs. Take the resulting number, which is “core platform contribution profit (loss)” and divide it by core platform net revenue. The company said it had a 9 percent core platform contribution margin last year, compared with 0 percent in 2017. “The number of unique consumers who completed a ride-sharing or new mobility ride or received an Uber Eats meal on our platform at least once in a given month, averaged over each month in the quarter.”It’s the number of individual users who either book a ride (via a car, a scooter or an electric bike) or order a meal through the Uber app at least once a month. It’s equivalent to the “monthly active user” metric used by social media companies like Facebook.Uber reported 91 million M.A.P.C.s as of Dec. 31, up 34 percent from 2017.Michael de la Merced joined The Times as a reporter in April 2006, covering Wall Street and finance. Among his main coverage areas are mergers and acquisitions, bankruptcies and the private equity industry.  @m_delamerced • Facebook AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Michael J. de la Merced and Kate CongerUber gave the first sign of how big its highly anticipated initial public offering might be, telling some investors that its stock sale might value it at up to $100 billion, people briefed on the matter said.The number, which is below a $120 billion valuation that had been floated by investment bankers, highlights the size of the ride-hailing colossus as it prepares to embark on its market debut, the biggest in recent years. Its shares are expected to begin trading on the public markets next month.The revelation follows the I.P.O. last month of Uber’s main North American competitor, Lyft, whose shares have since dropped more than 15 percent from their offering price. Another Silicon Valley darling, the digital pin board Pinterest, this week set pricing expectations for its own market debut below its last private fund-raising round.The moves raise questions about investor appetite for prominent but unprofitable technology companies, with a slew of them — including the messaging company Slack and the home fitness company Peloton — also aiming to list their shares this year.Some of the most valuable tech start-ups are preparing to go public, and the I.P.O.s promise to generate big paydays for employees and investors.“It’s the Lyft effect,” said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital who manages an I.P.O. fund. “This is what Uber should try very hard to avoid — it should not have a stock that breaks its I.P.O. price.”Uber’s potential $100 billion valuation was earlier reported by Reuters and The Wall Street Journal.Uber is expected to publish its public offering prospectus on Thursday, giving investors a closer look into its businesses. That document will not provide any information on the offering’s potential price, but the company recently disclosed its latest thinking about its own valuation to some investors.In a notice to holders of some of its convertible bonds last week, Uber said that its stock could be valued at $48 to $55 a share, said the people briefed on the situation, who asked not to be identified because the details were confidential. That would translate into a valuation of about $90 billion to $100 billion for the company, factoring in the roughly $10 billion that it expects to raise.The people briefed on the matter cautioned that the I.P.O. process was continuing and that it was too early to determine what Uber’s valuation would ultimately be. The company’s underwriters, led by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, could still raise the price of the shares — and therefore its valuation — in the coming weeks if there is enough interest from prospective shareholders.Even at $90 billion to $100 billion, Uber would be valued well above the $76 billion it was appraised at in its most recent fund-raising in August. Investment bankers last year reckoned the company could fetch a valuation of as much as $120 billion in the public markets.At $90 billion to $100 billion, Uber would be one of the largest American tech companies to go public in recent years. Its debut would be rivaled only by Facebook, which went public at $104 billion in 2012. Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant, was the largest initial offering, at $168 billion in 2014. Lyft, by contrast, has a market capitalization of about $17 billion.In recent weeks, brokers who sell shares on behalf of employees and early investors have offered Uber stock to buyers at the $80 billion to $100 billion valuation range, according to two people familiar with them. These sales, on what is known as the secondary market, mean sellers can lock in their returns without waiting for the I.P.O. lockup period to end, while avoiding uncertainty about how the stock will trade. In 2017, some of Uber’s early investors and employees sold portions of their stock to SoftBank as part of the Japanese conglomerate’s $7 billion investment in the company.Although Uber’s debut is hotly anticipated, the company remains unprofitable. The ride-hailing service has released some of its quarterly earnings figures publicly, even though it was not obligated to do so as a private company. In February, Uber said it lost $842 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 on revenue of $3 billion.How the company will get to a point where it makes more money than it loses is likely to be a key question when Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber’s chief executive, meets with investors to sell shares in the coming weeks. Mr. Khosrowshahi has pulled back from some markets where Uber was losing money, such as Southeast Asia. But he is also continuing to spend as the company expands into businesses such as food delivery and long-haul trucking.Mr. Khosrowshahi has previously emphasized the importance of Uber’s business being able to generate cash. He has also said that the company does not need to be making money before going public, but that it must be able to show a path to profits.“You need to demonstrate a very clear road to profitability,” Mr. Khosrowshahi said at the Fortune Brainstorm conference in July.Follow Michael J. de la Merced and Kate Conger on Twitter: @m_delamerced and @kateconger.Erin Griffith contributed reporting from San Francisco.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byin her wordsA South Carolina student was murdered after getting into a car she mistook for her Uber, underscoring the safety risks of ride-hailing apps.

Let me know what you think at dearmaya@nytimes.com.“It has to be automatic, like putting on a seatbelt. You have to ask, ‘What’s my name?’”Marci Josephson, whose daughter Samantha was found murdered hours after she got into a car that she mistook for her Uber#WhatsMyName.That hashtag has been gaining ground on Twitter, part of a safety campaign started by University of South Carolina students, who are grappling with the murder of a fellow student. They’re imploring riders of Uber and Lyft to ask their drivers, “What’s my name?” before getting into a vehicle.The effort is in response to the death of Samantha Josephson, 21, who apparently got into a car she believed was her Uber in a busy downtown area of Columbia, S.C., late last month. Her body was found in the woods 70 miles away, and a 24-year-old man was quickly arrested on charges of kidnapping and murder. On Monday, Josephson’s parents introduced the website Whatsmyname.org to “educate the world on ride-share safety and the simple precautions one can take to ensure no other family has to suffer this unspeakable tragedy.”A week after the attack, three women who say they were raped by men posing as Uber drivers filed a lawsuit against the ride-hailing app, claiming that Uber knew fake drivers were targeting women but did not warn its customers. [READ MORE: They Thought It Was Their Uber. But the Driver Was a Predator.]Across the country, at least two dozen women have been attacked in recent years after making a mistake similar to Josephson’s. (In Connecticut, a man was recently arraigned on charges that he kidnapped and raped two women who thought he was their driver. In Chicago, prosecutors said a man who posed as an Uber driver sexually assaulted five women.) And a 2018 CNN report found that 103 Uber drivers and 18 Lyft drivers had been accused of sexual assault or abuse. Uber and Lyft have been criticized for not sufficiently evaluating their drivers and not prioritizing passenger safety, prompting some cities to place temporary bans or restrictions on the services. Both companies say passenger safety is their top priority and have stood by their background-check processes.After the attack on Josephson, Uber re-upped its public safety awareness campaign called “Check Your Ride,” first introduced in 2017, urging users to take certain precautions: Match the license plate, car make and model to what the app displays, and check the driver’s photograph before getting in. Of course, as critics put it: The onus should not be on women to vigilantly create safe spaces for themselves — and yet often it is.Here are a few safety tips I always abide by.______Ask the driver’s name. In addition to asking the driver for your name, ask your driver for his or her name and look closely to make sure the photo on the app matches. If the driver’s phone is mounted on the dashboard, look to see if it’s displaying your name.______Share your status. Share your trip details with friends through the sharing option on the app. By adding your destination and sharing through a text, others can watch your ride, in real time, on a map. Uber and Via monitor drivers’ routes, sending alerts to their staff if the cars go off course. ______Match the light. Some Uber and Lyft vehicles have illuminated windshield icons called Beacon and Amp that change color to match a hue on a passenger’s app. If this is available to you, make sure the color matches. Lawmakers in South Carolina have proposed a law, named for Samantha Josephson, that would require it in all such vehicles.[READ MORE: Taking Uber?

He listened to customer service calls, including one in which an Uber driver said he had raped a passenger. And the company began auditing past complaints to determine whether it had evidence of old assaults.Nearly 16 months later, the work is far from over. “This is a hugely underreported set of situations,” Mr. West, 53, said. “Those numbers, as we continue to count them, they actually might go up.”Since Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber’s chief executive, brought in Mr. West to help turn around the ride-hailing company and professionalize it, the attorney has swept aside many of its highest-profile legal woes. While Uber is still dealing with hundreds of legal cases, Mr. West settled a tabloid-worthy trade secrets lawsuit last year by Alphabet’s self-driving car business, Waymo, and negotiated a multistate settlement over a vast 2016 data breach.But the sexual assault transparency report, which Mr. West plans to release this year, underlines just how much more work Uber needs to do — and how thorny the challenge can be to navigate.“He is very upfront about the fact that it’s not going to be pretty,” Tammy Albarran, Uber’s deputy general counsel, said of Mr. West and the transparency report.The work is especially important as Uber gears up for a highly anticipated initial public offering. Lyft, Uber’s main rival in the United States, made its offering prospectus public on Friday and is likely to begin trading on the stock market next month.Uber, which may go public at a $120 billion valuation, would dwarf Lyft. But to pull off a successful offering, the company must reduce its legal exposure and show that it has revamped its culture and cares about the safety of passengers.Mr. West, a former Justice Department official and the brother-in-law of Senator Kamala Harris, the California Democrat who is running for president, said he was hitching his reputation to Uber and its changes.“I had a reputation that I was also putting on the table, right?” he said in a recent interview.A native of the Bay Area, Mr. West graduated from Harvard University and Stanford Law School. He rose to prominence as an assistant attorney general in the Obama administration, during which he urged the Justice Department to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act and worked to reduce the number of detainees in the military prison at Guantánamo Bay.In 2014, he became general counsel of PepsiCo, where, he said, he learned how to operate in a Fortune 50 company. Then in 2017, Mr. Khosrowshahi came calling.At the time, Uber was reeling from the ouster of Travis Kalanick as chief executive and the aftermath of an investigation into its workplace, amid other issues. Mr. Khosrowshahi was tapped to stabilize the company and eventually take it public. Over several dinners in New York, he pitched Mr. West on the idea of turning Uber into a more self-critical company.Uber needed someone with “a great amount of negotiation prowess and relationships,” Mr. Khosrowshahi said. “He’s got both.”Mr. West jumped ship. “There was nothing I was going to do that was going to fundamentally change the trajectory” of PepsiCo, he said.At Uber, Mr. West began rebuilding the legal department with several former Justice Department colleagues. He also confronted some urgent legal problems. They included a trial in early 2018 to defend the company against allegations that it had stolen trade secrets from Waymo in the race to build self-driving cars.The weekend before the trial started that February, Mr. West met with Waymo’s lawyers to settle the case. The conversation ended in an impasse.After the trial opened, embarrassing revelations about Uber quickly tumbled out. Mr. West said that he had texted Kevin Vosen, Waymo’s general counsel, from the courtroom and that the two had met during breaks to keep trying for a settlement. Waymo declined to comment on Mr. Vosen’s conversations with Mr. West.Four days after the trial began, the two sides struck a deal. Uber agreed to provide Waymo, which had sought $1 billion in damages, with 0.34 percent of its stock, valued then at $245 million, as well as the right to inspect Uber’s self-driving technology.At the same time, Mr. West worked to placate investigators who were digging into the 2016 data breach, which Uber had kept secret and which had prompted numerous state lawsuits for violation of data breach notification laws. Mr. West said he had kept in frequent contact with Lisa Madigan, who was the Illinois attorney general, to hash out a settlement. The two had worked together while he was at the Justice Department.Ms. Madigan said that being friends with Mr. West “in some ways makes it easier” to negotiate. “We both know the law, we both know the problem, and we both know there needs to be a resolution,” she said.In September, Mr. West and Ms. Madigan agreed that Uber would pay $148 million to all 50 states to settle the data breach investigation.Mr. West also worked with Mr. Khosrowshahi to change Uber’s culture. Last year, Mr. West helped Uber settle a $10 million pay discrimination lawsuit by three former female employees. And he helped settle a lawsuit by nine women who had been raped, kidnapped, assaulted or harassed by drivers. The company declined to disclose the terms of the deal.Eric H. Holder Jr., the former attorney general, who led an inquiry into Uber’s workplace in 2017 and is friends with Mr. West, said of the company: “They still have work to do, but made really significant progress in a short period of time.”Some of the work today revolves around the sexual assault transparency report. Uber is now training its customer service representatives to sort incidents into 21 categories. The process is complex; for instance, Uber considers a touch between a person’s thighs to be sexual, while a touch on other areas of the thigh is not.Because the company operates in 64 countries, the training must also be localized. That is tricky because of varied cultural norms — a kiss on the cheek might be a common greeting in Europe but would be unexpected in the United States, Mr. West noted.“There are these differing concepts and views about what can be considered intimate, or sexual, or appropriate or inappropriate,” he said.How long Mr. West will stay at Uber is unclear; he has already faced questions internally about whether he will leave to join Ms. Harris’s presidential campaign. Mr. West is married to Maya Harris, Senator Harris’s sister and campaign chairwoman. He also co-led Ms. Harris’s transition team after she was elected to the Senate in 2016.Ms. Harris’s office did not respond to requests for comment.When asked if he would return to government, Mr. West demurred and said a presidential victory for Ms. Harris would most likely prevent him from working in the administration because he was a relative.“It would depend on a lot of things, not the least of which is: What would I be going back for?” he said.An earlier version of this article misstated the number and nature of 2017 incidents reviewed by Uber and the National Sexual Violence Resource Center. The review involves 212 incidents, not 221. They involved different types of sexual misconduct; they did not all involve sexual assault.Follow Kate Conger on Twitter: @kateconger.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Stephen GrocerGet the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________Uber and Lyft have competed for riders and drivers across North America. They raced each other to go public. They even filed paperwork for their initial public offerings with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the same day late last year.Now that Lyft is publicly traded and Uber’s own initial public offering is approaching, they’re also going to be competing for stock investors.[Uber is losing $1.8 billion a year, its I.P.O. filing reveals.]By most measures, Uber is much bigger and has a more diverse revenue stream.It is the world’s biggest ride-sharing company, with operations in 63 countries. Its revenue comes not just from ride-sharing but from Uber Eats, its food delivery business, as well as from its trucking business and bike and scooter sharing. By comparison, Lyft operates in the United States and Canada and generates almost all its revenue from its ride-hailing service.Lyft, though, appears to be growing more quickly.Here are four charts, based on company filings, that show how the two companies stack up.Bookings are the revenue generated from rides. Lyft excludes taxes, tolls and tips, while Uber excludes tips. Uber’s bookings include what it charges for its food delivery service and other businesses.Not surprisingly, then, Lyft’s bookings are significantly lower that Uber’s, but they are growing faster.Lyft’s bookings surpassed $8 billion in 2018, 76 percent more than the previous year. Uber increased its bookings to $50 billion last year, up 45 percent from 2017.At Lyft and Uber, revenue is the portion of bookings that goes to the companies — or, essentially, bookings minus what the drivers were paid.Revenue at both companies increased quickly in 2018, though faster at Lyft.Last year, Lyft’s revenue more than doubled from the previous year, to $2.16 billion. That was still far less than what its rival generated last year. Uber’s revenue hit $11.3 billion, a 43 percent increase.Perhaps worrisome for potential investors, Uber’s revenue growth slowed as last year progressed. In the third and fourth quarters, Uber’s revenue increased 38 percent and 25 percent from a year earlier. Lyft’s revenue for those quarters rose 93 percent and 94 percent.Both companies are racking up big losses. In this case, Lyft’s faster pace is not a good thing.Lyft reported a loss of $911 million last year, up from $688 million in 2017. Uber earned $997 million last year, much better than its $4 billion loss in 2017, but that profit included income from the sale of some assets. After backing out those one-time items, Uber lost $1.8 billion last year.The ride-hailing business is inherently expensive. Both Lyft and Uber are spending heavily to recruit drivers and attract riders. They are also making big investments in new businesses such as autonomous driving and bike sharing.Lyft might be expanding its revenue faster than Uber, but it’s also increasing its spending at a rapid clip to catch up to its competitor.Lyft’s total costs and expenses were $3.1 billion in 2018, up 77 percent from $1.8 billion in 2017. Uber’s topped $14 billion last year, a 19 percent increase from 2017.An earlier version of a chart with this article made an incorrect comparison between the annual losses of Uber and Lyft for 2018. In the case of Uber, the chart showed the company’s losses excluding certain items. In the case of Lyft, the chart showed the company’s net losses. For consistency, the chart been revised to show Lyft’s losses excluding certain items.Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Kate CongerSAN FRANCISCO — Uber on Monday settled a long-running legal battle with drivers in California and Massachusetts who wanted the ride-hailing company to recognize them as employees, agreeing to pay the drivers $20 million but not changing their status as independent contractors.As part of the settlement, Uber said, it will also change the way it removes drivers from the service by making the process more transparent. It published a policy that describes how it deactivates drivers and said it would institute an appeals mechanism, as well as classes to teach drivers how to improve ride quality.The settlement defuses a potentially thorny issue as Uber prepares to go public. Uber, which confidentially filed for an initial public offering in December, is expected to be one of the largest tech offerings in recent years and could be valued at as much as $120 billion. In a move intended to appease drivers and acknowledge their role in building the company, Uber plans to offer them the chance to buy shares at its I.P.O.In a statement, an Uber spokesman said the company had “changed a lot” since the lawsuit was filed in 2013. He added, “We’re pleased to reach a settlement on this matter, and we’ll continue working hard to improve the quality, security and dignity of independent work.”Shannon Liss-Riordan, an attorney for the drivers, said in a statement that the settlement was “substantial.”“We estimate these drivers will receive approximately 37 cents per mile for the miles they have driven for Uber,” she said.How its drivers are classified has long been a point of contention for the San Francisco-based company. As independent contractors, drivers do not get health care or other benefits from Uber, which saves the company money. Uber has said that drivers gain other perks instead, particularly flexible schedules.The issue has incited considerable debate and, increasingly, legal action. Uber and other ride-hailing firms have faced class-action lawsuits about drivers’ employment classification. And states such as California have weighed in, largely finding that drivers can be classified as freelancers.The suit has a long history. After it was filed in 2013, Uber settled it in 2016, offering the drivers $84 million with an additional payment due after its I.P.O. of up to $16 million.But the agreement was thrown out by a federal judge who said it was unfair to drivers. In September, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that Uber could force drivers into private arbitration rather than resolve their claims in a public lawsuit. Some drivers are now pursuing the arbitration option, Ms. Liss-Riordan said.Follow Kate Conger on Twitter: @kateconger.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byThe death of a college student who got into a car she mistook for an Uber has emphasized the need to use caution when hailing a ride.By Adeel Hassan“What’s my name?” That’s what students and administrators at the University of South Carolina are urging people to ask before they get into a car, to be sure it’s the one they called via a ride-sharing app. The public safety campaign follows the death of Samantha Josephson, a 21-year-old student who was killed last weekend after getting into a car she mistook for her Uber, the police said. Across the country, at least two dozen women have been attacked in recent years after making a similar mistake. [Read about women being attacked by men posing as drivers.]Asking that simple question — “What’s my name?” — would help keep riders safe, advocates said. Here are more tips for what you can do, according to law enforcement officials and ride-share companies:After booking a ride, a confirmation text should include the license plate number and a description of the car. It is critical to know what you are getting.Depending on the tier of service you choose, Uber could send anything from a basic four-door sedan to a black sport-utility vehicle that is commercially registered and insured. A vehicle that is not what you expect is one of the more obvious giveaways that there might be a problem. Any discrepancy is a red flag, and riders should not get into the car. That confirmation message from the ride-share app should also include a photo of your driver, so check to be sure they match. Always ask the driver their name and make sure that it also lines up. Share your trip details with a friend, relative or a group through the sharing option available on the app. By adding your destination and sharing through a text, others can watch your ride, in real time, on a map. The “Trusted Contacts” feature allows you to select up to five friends or family members with whom you can share your whereabouts for every ride.Uber and Via monitor drivers’ routes, sending alerts to their staff if the cars go off course. Riders with Lyft can also share the route and estimated time of arrival by tapping Send ETA.Uber and Lyft also offer glowing dashboard lights called the Beacon and Amp that change color to match a hue on a passenger’s app. But the lights are in limited distribution and not available to all drivers. Lawmakers in South Carolina have proposed a law, named for Ms. Josephson, that would require all ride-share drivers to display a lighted sign. If you suspect danger, or if you have an emergency, call 911 immediately. Uber also provides an in-app emergency button to connect riders directly to 911. It can be reached through a section of the app called the Safety Center.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Mike Isaac and Kate CongerSAN FRANCISCO — Uber, the ride-hailing service that has upended transportation around the world, took a major step toward the largest initial public offering in years when it officially unveiled its finances in a prospectus on Thursday.The offering, which could value Uber at around $100 billion, is expected to reverberate through global financial markets and to solidify the company’s position as one of the most consequential technology firms of the past decade. The share sale would be the biggest since the Alibaba Group of China began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 2014, and would peg Uber’s value at more than four times that of United Airlines’ parent and double that of FedEx.But the prospectus renewed questions about how sustainable Uber’s business actually is. The company said in the filing that it lost $1.8 billion in 2018, excluding certain transactions, on revenue of $11.3 billion. And the prospectus also showed that its rocket-ship trajectory for revenue growth was beginning to slow.Uber’s archrival in North America, Lyft, went public last month at a valuation of $24 billion. But Lyft, which is also deeply unprofitable, fell below its offering price in its second day of trading as investors questioned whether it could make money. This week, Pinterest, the digital pin board company that also is losing money, set a price range for its public offering that values it below that of its last private market peg.[Comparing Uber and Lyft, in four charts.]One potentially major concern for Uber is that it does not appear set to turn a profit in the near future. In the United States, the company is burning cash as it battles Lyft, cutting prices for passengers and spending to recruit drivers. In other parts of the world, Uber also provides discounts to riders and incentives to drivers as competitors like Ola fight for market share. And the company is investing heavily in businesses like food delivery and scooters.“We will not shy away from making short-term financial sacrifices where we see clear long-term benefits,” Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber’s chief executive, wrote in a letter accompanying the prospectus.To lessen the surprise of its losses when it did finally go public, Uber has disclosed its quarterly results for two years even though, as a privately held company, it was not obligated to do so. Still, the prospectus invites new scrutiny.[Here is a glossary to help make sense of Uber’s jargon.]Uber did not disclose in the filing the valuation it is seeking from public investors; it was last valued at $76 billion in the private market. Its offering is being led by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. The company’s shares are set to begin trading next month on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol UBER.In its filing, Uber said it made a profit of $997 million in 2018, largely from selling parts of its business in places like Southeast Asia and Russia. Excluding those gains, plus other items, Uber lost $1.8 billion for the year. In 2017, its net loss totaled $4 billion.Revenue growth also slowed. In 2018, its revenue rose 42 percent to $11.3 billion from a year earlier. But revenue in 2017 had more than doubled from 2016. Uber revealed in the prospectus that it is heavily dependent on just five cities for nearly a quarter of its total bookings: Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, London and São Paulo, Brazil.Its number of monthly users, who turn to Uber for not only rides but also services like food delivery, was 91 million in 2018, up 34 percent from a year earlier. But user growth, which had risen 51 percent in 2017, also slowed.At the same time, Uber’s spending continues to rise, reaching $14.3 billion last year, up 19 percent from 2017.While revenue growth in its ride-hailing business slowed, its food delivery service, Uber Eats, is soaring. Revenue from Uber Eats nearly tripled to $1.5 billion in 2018 from $587 million a year earlier.Some of the most valuable tech start-ups are preparing to go public, and the I.P.O.s promise to generate big paydays for employees and investors.Founded by Garrett Camp and Travis Kalanick in 2009, Uber began as an on-demand black car service for wealthy clients, riding the wave of mobile-technology innovation that followed Apple’s introduction of the iPhone in 2007. Mr. Camp conceived of the service, initially called UberCab, because of the difficulties he had hailing a taxi in San Francisco.Silicon Valley tech workers were quick to embrace Uber, but it wasn’t until around 2013 that the service took off more broadly. That year, Uber introduced UberX, a low-cost ride-sharing service that allowed anyone with a car and a license to drive for the company on a freelance basis. UberX was a hit, and the company expanded rapidly elsewhere, often by flouting local and state transportation laws.Under the leadership of Mr. Kalanick, who was chief executive, Uber also increased its footprint internationally. It now operates in more than 63 countries and 700 cities around the world. Uber completes more than 15 million trips a day.Amid its explosive growth, the company stumbled in 2017 when a series of legal and ethical scandals resulted in a boardroom coup that led to Mr. Kalanick’s ouster. After trying to regain power for months, Mr. Kalanick has since moved on to a new start-up, City Storage Systems, which is focused largely on real estate.Uber acknowledged the toll of what unfolded in 2017 in its prospectus. The company said it lost hundreds of thousands of users in just a few days during a #DeleteUber social media campaign that year. It said it still suffered from a perception that Uber is a toxic place to work. And the company continues to deal with investigations by the Justice Department and foreign government agencies over its past business practices.Since late 2017, Uber has been led by Mr. Khosrowshahi, a former chief executive of Expedia. The company has expanded beyond its original ride-hailing mission and is experimenting with scooters, bike-sharing and other alternative forms of transportation. It has also invested in Uber Eats and is beefing up Uber Freight, its long-haul-trucking division.“What began as ‘tap a button, get a ride,’ has become something much more profound,” Mr. Khosrowshahi said in his letters.The company has tried stemming some of its losses, including by selling some of its businesses in China, Russia and Southeast Asia. It recently acquired Careem, its primary rival in the Middle East, for $3.1 billion, partly to help ease a fierce price competition in the region. It has also sought new investment from the Japanese telecommunications conglomerate SoftBank to support its development of autonomous vehicles.Uber has also had to answer persistent questions about the status of its drivers, who as independent contractors are ineligible for employee benefits like health care. That saves Uber money.The company said in its prospectus that the possibility it may someday be forced to recognize its drivers as employees was an existential threat to its business. “Any such reclassification would require us to fundamentally change our business model,” Uber said.More than 60,000 drivers have filed or told Uber that they intend to file arbitration cases against the company, claiming that they were misclassified as independent contractors, the company said.The company said in its filing that it intended to award cash bonuses to more than 1.1 million drivers in the United States. The bonuses range from as little as $100 up to $10,000, based on how many trips the driver has completed. Drivers will be able to use the bonuses to purchase Uber stock at its I.P.O. price.The biggest winners from Uber’s public offering will be its founders and early investors, who own large chunks of company stock. According to the prospectus, the biggest shareholders are SoftBank, which owns 16 percent of Uber; the venture capital firm Benchmark, which owns 11 percent; Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, which owns 5 percent; Alphabet, which owns 5 percent; and Mr. Kalanick, who owns 9 percent.Eric Paley, a managing partner at Founder Collective, a venture firm that invested in Uber in 2010, said the company would inspire the next generation of entrepreneurs to change any industry.“Uber was started in the depths of the financial crisis, catered to a then-non-existent market, and still, in the space of a decade, has changed the way cities work across the globe,” he said.Follow Mike Isaac and Kate Conger on Twitter: @MikeIsaac and @kateconger.Michael J. de la Merced and Erin Griffith contributed reporting.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byGood Friday. (Want this by email? Sign up here.)Uber published the prospectus yesterday for its long-awaited I.P.O., revealing the full scale of its ride-hailing empire — and potential warning signs for what is expected to be the biggest market debut in years.The main revelations:• $1.8 billion in losses last year, excluding gains from selling parts of its businesses in Southeast Asia and Russia.• $11.3 billion in overall revenue.• 91 million monthly users, including services like food delivery and shared scooter and bike rentals.• Its biggest shareholders include SoftBank of Japan and its co-founder and former C.E.O., Travis Kalanick.Growth is slowing. In 2018, revenue rose 42 percent from a year earlier. It had doubled the year before. And revenue from ride-hailing, its biggest business,  was roughly flat for the last six months of 2018. Growth in monthly users also appears to be slowing.That could be a concern for investors who had hoped Uber would maintain a meteoric growth rate. A potential $100 billion valuation may be lower than expectations, but Lex points out that it’s still a rich number.More: How Uber stacks up against Lyft. What Uber’s metrics like “core platform contribution margin” actually mean. And Uber executives stand to make huge bonuses from a big I.P.O. — its drivers, not so much.Chevron said this morning that it planned to acquire Anadarko, the oil and gas producer, in what would be one of the biggest deals in the industry in years.• Under the terms of the deal, Chevron would pay $65 a share in stock and cash. That is 39 percent above where Anadarko’s stock closed yesterday.• Including Anadarko’s debt, the transaction is valued at $50 billion.• Anadarko would give Chevron a huge presence in the Permian Basin in West Texas, one of the most valuable oil-producing areas in the U.S. It would also strengthen Chevron’s liquid natural gas reserves.If completed, the deal would be Chevron’s biggest since its $36 billion takeover of Texaco, which closed in 2001.The deal comes as oil prices have risen over the past six weeks after a reduction in supply by OPEC members. Futures for West Texas Intermediate crude reached $64.19 per barrel this morning, up 61 cents from their last closing price, according to Reuters.In Amazon’s annual letter to its shareholders, Jeff Bezos shared insights about the financial performance of his e-commerce behemoth.“Third-party sellers are kicking our first-party butt. Badly,” Mr. Bezos wrote. Third-party sales on Amazon increased to $160 billion in 2018 from $100 million in 1999 — a compound annual growth rate of 52 percent. Amazon’s first-party sales rose to $117 billion from $1.6 billion in the same period, a growth rate of 25 percent.Growth in Amazon’s total merchandise sales is slowing, according to calculations by Shira Ovide of Bloomberg Opinion. She writes that the company sold $300 billion worth of merchandise in 2018, up 19 percent from the previous year. But annual increases for that metric were 24 percent for 2017 and 27 percent for 2016.“It’s unfair to expect Amazon to grow like a start-up forever. But it’s not insignificant that this slowdown has come even as Amazon has attempted to flex more muscle in newer categories,” Ms. Ovide writes. “It doesn’t seem like a coincidence that this comes as its legacy retail competitors finally seem to have awakened and adapted to the e-commerce era.”More: Mr. Bezos also dared retail rivals to raise their minimum wages. A Walmart executive shot back by asking Amazon to pay taxes.Four Republican senators said that they would not back Mr. Cain should President Trump nominate him as a Fed governor. That’s probably enough opposition to stop him from joining the central bank.“If I had to vote today, I would vote no,” Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said yesterday, joining Mitt Romney of Utah, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Cory Gardner of Colorado in opposing Mr. Cain. They appear to have concerns about his qualifications and partisanship.Because Republicans hold only 53 Senate seats, a confirmation would require support from Democrats. That seems unlikely, given Mr. Cain’s frequent attacks on opposition lawmakers.It’s unclear whether Mr. Trump’s other pick for the Fed, the economics commentator Stephen Moore, will fare better. Mr. Moore has been embarrassed by revelations of tax problems, but Jim Tankersley of the NYT reports that he may win wider support from Senate Republicans.Mr. Trump’s efforts to politicize the Fed continue to outrage commentators. The Economist is worried that “the Fed will become a political weapon, and that America will move closer to becoming a nation where the welfare of the ruling party trumps that of the country as a whole.”As part of trade negotiations with America, China has offered new concessions on access in the cloud-computing sector for U.S. tech companies, the WSJ reports.• China is “proposing to issue more licenses that businesses need to operate data centers and to lift the 50 percent equity cap that limits ownership for certain foreign cloud-service providers,” according to unidentified sources.• “Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and others have invested millions of dollars or more to provide cloud services in China, but are hampered by regulations. Better access would potentially allow them to enlarge their presence.”• “Questions still remain over the details of the latest Chinese proposal, the people said, such as how quickly the equity caps would be removed, and whether the removal would be confined to certain geographical areas, such as a free-trade zone.”Both Washington and Beijing are offering a final round of concessions, hoping they will lead to an agreement. President Trump said last week that he expected to reach a deal within the next four weeks.The owner of The National Enquirer may have found a potential buyer: Ron Burkle, the supermarket mogul, the NYT reports.Mr. Burkle is known for buying distressed companies, having made his fortune through buying and merging supermarket chains like Ralphs and Jurgensen’s. He’s also known for hobnobbing with celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio and Madonna.He’s also a big donor to the Democratic Party, and was close to President Bill Clinton. That would make his owning The Enquirer, the tabloid favored by Mr. Trump, unusual. (He is also friends with Mr. Trump.)But leaks of the Enquirer talks may scuttle a deal. After the NYT reported on the discussions, a spokesman for Mr. Burkle’s private equity firm said that the investor wasn’t in talks to buy the publication. The NYT reports that Mr. Burkle’s team felt “used” by American Media Inc., the tabloid’s current owner.The WikiLeaks founder was arrested yesterday in London to face a charge in the U.S. of conspiring to hack into a Pentagon computer network in 2010, the NYT reports.• “The Ecuadorean government suspended the citizenship it had granted Mr. Assange and evicted him on Thursday, clearing the way for his arrest.”• “At a court hearing, a judge swiftly found him guilty of jumping bail, and he was detained partly in connection with an American extradition warrant.”• “Mr. Assange indicated that he would fight extradition, and legal experts said that process could take years. He is likely to argue that the case is politically motivated.”The events brought to a head issues about press freedom. Mr. Assange’s work with WikiLeaks — obtaining and publishing information that officials would prefer be kept secret — are hard to legally distinguish from journalism. Some fear that journalists could be treated in a similar way.Mr. Assange was indicted on a charge of hacking, not publishing secrets. But people who are worried about press freedom shouldn’t necessarily rest easy, Charlie Savage of the NYT writes.More: President Trump once claimed to “love WikiLeaks.” Yesterday, he said: “I know nothing about WikiLeaks. It’s not my thing.”The dust has settled on the agreement to delay Britain’s withdrawal from the E.U. for at least six months. But reactions to the situation have been mixed.Business are unhappy. For many larger companies, Brexit has already happened. But “businesses of all sizes are still pleading for Parliament to give them clarity before the economy slows,” Amie Tsang of the NYT writes.Economists are pleased. The I.M.F.’s managing director, Christine Lagarde, said that the new Brexit date meant that Britain would avoid — for now — the “terrible outcome” of a no-deal departure. The Bank of England governor, Mark Carney, said the delay would make a no-deal exit less disruptive.And Prime Minister Theresa May is pushing on. She has “renewed her effort to push through her Brexit deal with the aid of the opposition Labour Party, in a desperate bid to avoid holding European parliamentary elections in a month’s time,” according to the FT.Bob Iger said yesterday that he would retire as Walt Disney’s C.E.O. in 2021.Jamie Forese, the head of Citigroup’s investment bank and a potential successor to Mike Corbat as C.E.O., is stepping down.Google’s chief diversity officer, Danielle Brown, is leaving to become the human resources chief at Gusto.Maryanne Trump Barry, a federal appellate judge in Philadelphia and the sister of President Trump, has retired amid a civil misconduct investigation.Blackstone has appointed Kelly Ayotte, a former Republican senator for New Hampshire, to its board.Deals• J.

Peter Ashlock is not one of them, although he has toiled for the ride-hailing company almost since the beginning.Mr. Ashlock, who will be 71 next week, has racked up more than 25,000 trips as an Uber driver since 2012. His Nissan Altima has 218,000 miles on it — nearly the distance to the moon. His passengers rate him 4.93 out of five stars. His favorite review: “Dude drove like a cabdriver.”While he is an integral part of Uber’s success, Mr. Ashlock is barely getting by. His 2018 tax return will show an adjusted gross income in the neighborhood of $40,000, better than 2016 and 2017. But he has maxed out his $3,200 credit limit at the local Midas car-repair shop and needs to come up with $5,000 to pay his taxes. He has Social Security but no savings to buy a new car that will let him keep working.Silicon Valley has always been a lottery where immense wealth is secured by a few while everyone else must hope for better luck some other time. Rarely, however, has the disparity been on such stark display as with Uber. Its stock market value is expected to be about $100 billion, which would make it one of the richest Silicon Valley public offerings of all time.[Uber is losing $1.8 billion a year, its I.P.O. filing reveals.]Among those with something to celebrate: Uber’s founders, the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank, the elite venture capitalists Benchmark and Google’s GV, Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund and the mutual fund giant Fidelity. Some have already cashed in. Travis Kalanick, Uber’s co-founder and chief executive until he was forced out after a series of scandals, reaped $1.4 billion by selling fewer than a third of his shares to private investors in 2017.As independent contractors, drivers are not eligible for employee benefits like paid vacations or stock options. Uber said Thursday that it would offer bonuses of $100 to $10,000 to long-serving drivers. Its chief competitor, Lyft, did the same when it went public in March.Some of the most valuable tech start-ups are preparing to go public, and the I.P.O.s promise to generate big paydays for employees and investors.Mr. Ashlock, who lives with his wife, Daphne, in a rented house in the rural community of Cotati, 50 miles north of San Francisco, will take as much as he can get. But don’t call it a triumph.“Ever see W. C. Fields in ‘The Bank Dick’?” he asked. “He catches a robber and retrieves the stolen $25,000, so the president of the bank gives him a hearty hand clasp and a beautiful illustrated calendar advertising the bank. It’s trivial.”Mr. Ashlock illustrates the hollow promise of the so-called gig economy, which billed itself as being superior to the usual manager-employee relationship. It promised to harness the power of technology to liberate the struggling millions.“Uber is a new way of working: It’s about people having the freedom to start and stop work when they want, at the push of a button,” Mr. Kalanick said in 2016.The old-style taxi companies were an ideal villain. Taxi drivers, Uber proclaimed, were oppressed workers. In a 2014 press release, it said cabdrivers were required to spend “over $40,000 per year just to lease their taxi, so that wealthy taxi company owners can reap the benefits of drivers having no other option to make a living.”Being an Uber driver, by contrast, was “sustainable and profitable,” the company said. Drivers were described as entrepreneurs with a median income of $74,000 in San Francisco and $90,000 in New York. A Denver cabby who switched to Uber was quoted: “I feel emancipated.”The Federal Trade Commission found the claims to be false advertising, and the company agreed to a $20 million settlement.Mr. Ashlock spent a decade as a San Francisco cabdriver in the 1970s and 1980s as he sought to make a living as an artist. He recalls taking home about $500 a week, equivalent to $1,500 now. He bought gas for the cab but did not have to worry about repairs or upkeep.In 2018, working mostly for Uber and a small amount for Lyft, he drove and drove and drove. That produced gross receipts of $88,661. The companies took $20,000 in commissions and fees. He can deduct $30,000 on his taxes for gas and depreciation. A small class-action settlement and Social Security helped his bottom line, but payments on an old student loan hurt it.The more Mr. Ashlock drives, the faster his car depreciates, but it also speeds closer the moment when he will need to spend $23,000 he doesn’t have on a new Altima. He’s driving to pay his car-repair bills — $5,000 in the last six months, plus new tires.“That was Uber’s big innovation — make the drivers absorb the overhead,” he said.“It’s your classic rat race,” said Michael Reich, an expert on the economics of ride-sharing and a co-chairman of the Center on Wage and Employment Dynamics at the University of California, Berkeley. “You get deeper into a hole over time.”Getting out poses its own problems. In a country that values the young and cheap, Mr. Ashlock has few other options to make a living.“I am rather at Uber’s mercy,” he said.Driving for Uber is not a profession that lends itself to fame, but Mr. Ashlock has achieved more than any of his three million peers around the world. He has been quoted extensively, becoming one of ride-sharing’s public faces by presenting a driver’s point of view.He is not an activist. There was a recent strike by drivers in Los Angeles. Mr. Ashlock didn’t even hear about it. When he gets really mad at Uber, his rebellion goes only as far as driving for Lyft. That’s what he did for much of 2017. His adjusted gross income that year was $22,378.His wife, a retired horse trainer who has problems with her health, is not an agitator, either. “I am numb to the whole subject of driving,” she said.On a recent Wednesday, Mr. Ashlock packed a corned beef sandwich, carrots, some C4 energy powder mixed with water, and a Kirkland Extra Strength Energy Shot. At 4:23 p.m., he set off for San Francisco, where the rides are.He was on a Quest. This is Uber-speak for goals the company offers. If he completed 60 trips by Friday morning, for instance, he would get a $30 bonus. An additional 20 trips would yield a further $10. Uber needs drivers out on the streets — if riders have to wait, they might take their own car.If Mr. Ashlock does not choose a Quest, he is assigned one. For full-time drivers, the goals can be lucrative if undependable: Nearly a quarter of Mr. Ashlock’s take-home pay from Uber last year was in the form of incentives. This one, however, was too small to bother with. “Thirty dollars,” he said, “is like ‘I don’t care.’”A few minutes after 3 a.m., Mr. Ashlock was home again. According to Uber, he had made 25 trips in nine hours. He earned $200 in rides after Uber’s commission, plus $11 in tips and a $13 promotional bonus.That’s nearly $25 an hour, which sounds impressive. But it cost $47 to fill up the Altima with gas. And he was actually working longer than he was on the clock. After he dropped off his last passenger and turned off the Uber app, it was 65 miles back to his house.He and his wife used to live in Crockett, which is 20 miles closer to San Francisco, but were evicted when their place was sold two years ago. Their Cotati home, a former farm building, is a bargain for the pricey Bay Area at $1,400 a month. There is lots of room to make art but little natural light.Mr. Ashlock is unsentimental about the cab companies of the past. He knew three cabbies who were murdered. Drivers are safer now, since a credit card is needed to establish an account and get a ride. And they serve people and neighborhoods they never served before.But vomiting is up. Before, he could choose not to pick up 22-year-olds who seemed to have had too much to drink; now he must commit to riders before he sees them. A few times a year, passengers hurl in the back seat.Impersonality is up, too. For Uber to be worth $100 billion, it cannot afford to have lots of humans dealing with the drivers. On a recent Saturday night, just as he was winding down a week with 120 trips, Mr. Ashlock got an email from Uber.“Hi Peter,” it said. “A rider mentioned that an argument on a recent trip with you made them feel uncomfortable.”Which rider? When? What did Mr. Ashlock supposedly say? No details were provided. At other times, Uber’s attempts to be chummy can be grating. In a review of Mr. Ashlock’s March, it observed: “You drove the most at night. You must be quite the night owl.”Uber and Lyft are the first two Silicon Valley companies to go public that rely on millions of low-paid workers. That bothered an anonymous Uber employee, who recently wrote on Medium that “we need to do right by our drivers” and called for an end to “exploitative labor practices imposed on a systemically disempowered work force.”Uber declined to comment, citing the pre-I.P.O. quiet period.On days off, Mr. Ashlock works on his art. He has created mixed-media heads of loved ones, as well as of public figures who irritate him. Mr. Kalanick was an inevitable choice.The entrepreneur’s hair is made of shredded currency, painstakingly glued on a strip at a time. A Yellow Cab is crashing into his left cheek. There is a tattoo of Ayn Rand, the high prophet of selfishness, on his neck.“The sculpture makes me smile,” Mr. Ashlock said. “It’s the only thing about Uber that does.”Follow David Streitfeld on Twitter: @DavidStreitfeld.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Emma G. Fitzsimmons and Ashley Southall[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]A 27-year-old Uber driver was fatally stabbed in the Bronx on Saturday night in a vivid reminder of the perils of the job, the police and driver groups said.The driver, Ganiou Gandonou, was found shortly after 9 p.m. seated inside a black Toyota Camry with stab wounds to his neck and torso, the police said. The police are looking for the attacker and investigating whether Mr. Gandonou’s death began as a robbery.On Sunday evening, the police released video of a “person of interest” wanted in the killing. The man fled the scene on foot and was last seen walking northbound on Co-op City Boulevard wearing dark clothing, the police said.The police did not say if the “person of interest” was a passenger. The driver was working at the time, but the police did not say whether he was completing a trip when he was stabbed.Mr. Gandonou drove for Uber and had received his for-hire vehicle license in January 2017, according to the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission.He left home around 7 p.m. on Saturday to work a shift picking up passengers, but he never came home, his wife said in an interview with News 12. He had a 2-year-old son.“My husband doesn’t deserve this,” she said. “I don’t know how my life’s going to be without him.”Driving a taxi or for-hire vehicle has long been a dangerous job. In the early 1990s, dozens of livery drivers were killed on the job in a single year and many more were assaulted or robbed.An Uber spokesman, Grant Klinzman, called Mr. Gandonou’s death “a horribly tragic incident,” adding, “our hearts go out to the grieving family.”“We stand ready to work with law enforcement to assist their investigation in any way possible,” Mr. Klinzman said in a statement.On Sunday, a driver group offered a $3,000 reward for information leading to an arrest in the killing.“We call on anyone who may have witnessed the attack to contact the police so that the culprit may be brought to justice,” the group, the Independent Drivers Guild, said in a statement.Violence and threats are part of being a professional driver, said Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance.“Knowing how to protect yourself from crime is as critical to a driver as knowing the names of streets and avenues,” Ms. Desai said. “It’s a part of their day-to-day life behind the wheel.”Mr. Gandonou was taken from the car, which was found on the Hutchinson River Parkway East, to Jacobi Medical Center, where he died. His vehicle and driver’s license were in good standing, according to the taxi commission.A 68-year-old Uber driver died in 2017 after he was hit in the head with a hockey stick by a pedestrian during a dispute in Manhattan, the police said. A man was arrested, but the charges were later dropped.In 2014, two livery drivers were killed in the Bronx in the span of a month, prompting concerns over driver safety. The taxi commission requires most taxis and for-hire vehicles to have stickers in back seats reminding passengers that assaulting a driver is punishable by up to 25 years in prison.On Sunday, the taxi commission offered condolences to Mr. Gandonou’s family.“We hope there is swift justice for the for-hire vehicle driver that was killed this weekend,” the commission said in a statement, “and that the perpetrator is quickly apprehended.”Ashley Southall contributed reporting.Follow Emma G. Fitzsimmons on Twitter: @emmagf.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Kate Conger and Mike IsaacSAN FRANCISCO — Technology companies rarely make money before they go public. Twitter was unprofitable when it listed on the stock market. So were Snap, Spotify and SurveyMonkey.For Uber, the question as the ride-hailing giant prepares for a public offering is even bigger than whether it can make money. That’s because the company, the most prominent tech start-up of its generation, will set the bar for other well-known tech companies like Slack and Lyft as they also stampede toward the stock market this year.So far, Uber is not doing itself any favors on profits.The company reported on Friday that it had narrowed its net loss in the fourth quarter of 2018 from a year earlier. But excluding certain one-time items, including the sale of some of its businesses, Uber’s losses for the quarter rose 88 percent from the previous year, to $842 million.The losses were a result of Uber’s increasing its spending as it tries to outmuscle competitors, many of which have intensified their efforts to add riders and drivers. Uber has responded by offering bigger incentives and more promotions to fend off rivals like DoorDash, Lyft and other ride-hailing and food-delivery services.Uber made its financial disclosure as it hurtles toward what is set to be one of the biggest-ever public offerings by a tech company. A transportation colossus, Uber was privately valued at more than $70 billion last year, and proposals from investment bankers suggest that it could be worth as much as $120 billion after going public. The share sale will create enormous windfalls for Uber’s many investors, and for its founders and early employees.As a private company, Uber is not required to disclose financial results. But it has regularly done so over the past two years to inform investors about its business, and perhaps to keep the depth of its losses from coming as a surprise later.The latest set of figures, probably Uber’s last as a private company, will be closely scrutinized. Many investors initially give young and fast-growing tech start-ups a pass for losing money, but questions about whether such companies can ultimately be profitable eventually catch up with them. Investors criticized Twitter for racking up losses before it finally began to make money last year, and they have pushed down Snap’s share price since its public offering, partly because the company is still deeply unprofitable.In a statement, Uber’s chief financial officer, Nelson Chai, did not address the company’s losses. He said Uber had “maintained category leadership” in its ride-hailing business, and he noted other bright spots, including the company’s freight-management business and nascent e-bike and scooter program.Uber has a long history of spending large sums of money. Ride-hailing is inherently an expensive business that requires companies to expand into new markets for growth, pay to recruit drivers and lower prices to grab business away from competitors.Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber’s chief executive, has been under pressure to pare its losses, and the company has pulled out of money-losing markets like Russia and Southeast Asia.Some of the company’s losses have been overshadowed by its explosive growth. In 2018, Uber increased its total bookings — what it charges customers for rides and food delivery — to $50 billion, up 45 percent from 2017. Net revenue was $11.3 billion, a 43 percent increase.The company’s net revenue for last year’s fourth quarter was $3 billion, a 25 percent increase from a year earlier, and its gross bookings jumped 37 percent, to $14.2 billion. The company has $6.4 billion in cash, and its net loss was $865 million.But Uber’s profit margins have declined as it cut prices to match competitors and spent money on expanding its food-delivery business, Uber Eats. The margins are also smaller on Uber Eats orders because the company pays commissions to restaurants as well as delivery drivers.Uber’s self-driving car program, which will probably not yield revenue for years, continues to burn cash. The company returned its autonomous vehicles to public roads in December after a 10-month hiatus, which was prompted when one of its vehicles  fatally struck a pedestrian in Arizona.Follow Mike Isaac and Kate Conger on Twitter: @mikeisaac and @kateconger.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Mihir ZaveriArizona prosecutors said Tuesday that they had not found evidence to charge Uber with a crime in connection with an accident in which one of its autonomous cars hit and killed a pedestrian in Tempe a year ago.On March 18, 2018, a Volvo sport utility vehicle, one of several self-driving vehicles that Uber was testing, was traveling about 40 miles per hour when it hit Elaine Herzberg, 49, as she was walking her bicycle across the street at night, the authorities said.While the car was in autonomous mode, a safety driver was sitting in the driver’s seat.The Yavapai County Attorney’s Office, which reviewed the case, said in a letter dated Monday that there was “no basis for criminal liability for the Uber corporation.”But it added that investigators should look into what the safety driver “would or should have seen that night given the vehicle’s speed, lighting conditions, and other relevant factors.”The Yavapai County Attorney’s Office said an investigation into the case was continuing.In June, the Tempe Police Department released a report that said the safety driver was streaming the television show “The Voice” on her phone in the minutes leading up to the crash, The Arizona Republic reported.Uber declined to comment Tuesday, as did the Tempe police. The Yavapai County Attorney’s Office did not answer further questions about how it reached its decision.The March 2018 crash is believed to be the first pedestrian death resulting from self-driving technology, and many wondered how prosecutors would approach a criminal investigation.The crash raised questions about the safety of the technology as well as the comprehensiveness of the rules governing it. Few such federal or state rules exist.“It’s not very well trod at all,” said Frank Douma, a research scholar at the University of Minnesota’s Center for Transportation Studies. “To my knowledge, there is not any sort of real bright-line statement about who’s liable when.”Mr. Douma said prosecutors’ announcement Tuesday tracked with how typically people, and not car manufacturers, are held responsible for crimes they commit behind the wheel. But, as autonomous vehicles become more sophisticated, he said, such cases raise questions about that way of thinking.“Is this driver, or was this driver, behaving in any way different than what most drivers are going to be behaving like when the car is doing this much driving?” he said. “It’s a very conventional way of thinking to say we can expect and we should expect people to sit and monitor technology that is otherwise doing all the decision-making.”The Yavapai County Attorney’s Office did its review at the request of the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office, which had a potential conflict of interest in the case because of an earlier partnership with Uber in a safety campaign. The Maricopa County Attorney’s Office did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.The New York Times reported last March that Uber’s autonomous cars in Arizona struggled to meet the company’s expectations and required drivers to intervene more frequently than those of the company’s competitors.Uber suspended testing of self-driving vehicles after the crash. In December, the vehicles returned to public roads, though at reduced speeds and in less-challenging environments.In a preliminary report about the crash released in May, the National Transportation Safety Board said the Uber car’s computer system had spotted Ms. Herzberg six seconds before impact, but classified Ms. Herzberg, who was not in a crosswalk, first as an unrecognized object, then as another vehicle and finally as a bicycle.The Uber car, equipped with Uber’s sensing technology, comes with an automatic emergency braking system from the manufacturer.But Uber had disabled that function as well as other safety features to “reduce the potential for erratic vehicle behavior,” according to the report, putting the onus on the safety driver to intervene.The agency said Uber’s safety driver grabbed the steering wheel to swerve at the last second but did not start braking until after impact.The Republic reported last March that family members of Ms. Herzberg had “resolved” a case against Uber. The Republic said that the family was represented by the law firm Bellah Perez, which said Tuesday that it could not comment on whether the firm had been involved in the case.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Kate CongerSAN FRANCISCO — When Uber and Lyft go public this year, their founders, top executives and investors are set to reap billions of dollars in new wealth.But one group that helped build up the ride-hailing companies will miss out on most of the rewards: their drivers.That’s because while Uber’s and Lyft’s full-time employees and investors own company stock that they can convert into cash after the initial public offerings, the millions of drivers who ferry passengers around for the services are independent contractors. That has made them ineligible for stock grants — and bystanders to the coming I.P.O. bonanza.Now Uber and Lyft, facing the growing inequity between its stockholders and its drivers, are pursuing measures to address the gap. Both intend to set up programs to give cash to some drivers, enabling them to buy company stock at the time of the I.P.O., according to two people who have been briefed on the plans. The drivers can also keep the cash as a bonus, said the people, who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak publicly.The programs will not give drivers a major share of Uber’s and Lyft’s stock. Lyft plans to give $1,000 each to drivers who have completed 10,000 rides for the service; those who have done 20,000 rides will receive $10,000, one of the people said. Uber is still mulling its cash program and payout amounts, but they will also be tiered, another person said.Some in Silicon Valley greeted the move as an awakening by Uber and Lyft. Eric Ries, author of the start-up world’s bible, “The Lean Startup,” and chief executive of LTSE, a new stock exchange, said the move hinted at these companies’ priorities.“The next generation of companies understand their obligation to share power and prosperity with the community that made them successful,” he said. “It’s no longer optional.”But many Uber and Lyft drivers had a different view. Don Creery, an Uber and Lyft driver who previously worked on a campaign in Seattle to win collective-bargaining rights for ride-hailing drivers, called the programs a “token gesture.”“I think we would probably rather get what we wanted all along, which is a fair rate of pay and make enough money to buy stock in companies that might actually be valuable,” Mr. Creery said. Still, he gave the companies credit for “certainly acknowledging us.”Bhairavi Desai, executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, an organization that represents taxi and ride-hail drivers, called the efforts by Lyft and Uber “a slap in the face,” especially since the companies “are going to go public on the sweat of the drivers.”The issue is galling to many drivers because the public offerings of Uber and Lyft are set to mint a new class of billionaires out of an elite group of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and investors. Uber is estimated to go public at a valuation of as much as $120 billion, and one of its founders, Travis Kalanick, has already become a billionaire by selling some of his company stock to private investors. Lyft, which is likely to unveil its initial public offering prospectus on Friday, was last valued in the private market at just over $15 billion.Drivers, who have long been at the heart of the ride-hailing business, have made attempts to change their status with Uber and Lyft so that they can be classified as full-time employees. Becoming full-time employees would also give them access to health care benefits and other perks.But the companies have successfully beaten back these efforts. In California, Uber and Lyft have fended off lawsuits that aimed to win employee status for drivers. In New York, Lyft recently sued to overturn new legislation that would give drivers a minimum hourly wage of about $17.Uber and Lyft declined to comment on drivers’ reception of the programs. The cash programs were earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal.Uber has tried to improve its relationship with drivers over the past 18 months, allowing them to accept tips for the first time starting in 2017. In October, Uber asked in a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission to be allowed to grant equity to drivers even though they are not employees. Uber did not hear back from the S.E.C., one of the people said.Ultimately, the cash programs would not give drivers the opportunity to earn money from stock in the same way that employees do, said Mary Russell, a lawyer and founder of Stock Option Counsel, a firm that consults with employees on stock compensation.“It doesn’t seem like a meaningful change to their compensation, in my view,” she said. “It’s more a thank-you for the past and a one-time event.”Follow Kate Conger on Twitter: @kateconger.Erin Griffith contributed reporting.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Emma G. Fitzsimmons[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]After New York City and Amazon went to war over a new campus in Queens, the city is heading into battle with another tech giant: Uber.Mayor Bill de Blasio approved a yearlong cap on Uber vehicles last summer, making New York the first major American city to rein in the booming ride-hail company. Now Mr. de Blasio wants to extend the cap, prompting Uber to sue the city last week to overturn the law.Uber has fiercely opposed the cap, arguing that it hurts New Yorkers who rely on the app, especially outside Manhattan where there are fewer transit options. The lawsuit called the city’s regulatory approach “unfortunate, irresponsible and irrational.”Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat with presidential ambitions, responded by saying the city’s new rules — both the cap and a measure to raise wages for drivers — were needed.“No legal challenge changes the fact that Uber made congestion on our roads worse and paid their drivers less than a living wage,” said Seth Stein, a spokesman for the mayor. “The city’s new laws aim to change that.”Like many other cities across the world, New York is struggling to respond to the explosive growth of the ride-hailing industry. The influx of vehicles has raised concerns about street congestion, working conditions for drivers, the decimation of the yellow cab industry and the siphoning of riders from public transit.The lawsuit comes at a critical moment for Uber and its main competitor, Lyft, as both companies rush to go public. Uber, which could be valued as high as $120 billion, is likely to be one of the biggest-ever public offerings by a tech company.The two ride-hail companies have bristled over new regulations in New York, Uber’s largest market in the United States. Lyft recently sued to stop the rules aimed at raising driver pay.Uber and Lyft are also battling each other to dominate New York’s thriving bike markets. Lyft bought Motivate, the company that operates CitiBike, the city’s popular bike-share program. Uber bought another bike company called Jump and began offering electric bikes in the Bronx and Staten Island.Uber supports the driver pay rules, but argued that the cap hurts drivers who want to join its app.“It is disappointing to see the de Blasio administration remain singularly focused on a cap that evidence suggests is doing nothing to relieve congestion while preventing thousands of New Yorkers from earning a living wage,” Josh Gold, a spokesman for Uber, said in a statement.Some business leaders worry that Amazon’s decision to abandon its deal with New York could hurt the city’s image as a tech hub.But Nicole Gelinas, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, said the struggle with Uber is not a tech issue — it’s about worsening street traffic.“We’re not really afraid of being branded anti-tech,” Ms. Gelinas said. “In the long term, our problem is how do we deal with all of this growth — and not the risk that we’re going to drive away that growth with a little bit of rhetoric and a little regulation.”Mr. de Blasio has a bitter history with Uber. When the mayor first proposed a cap in 2015, Uber launched an aggressive attack, introducing a “de Blasio view” in the company’s app to blame him for long wait times. Uber won the debate and became shorthand in his administration for an embarrassing defeat.But Uber was on the defensive last year when the cap idea was revived by Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker. Uber’s reputation had been harmed by accusations of gender discrimination and other scandals. It hired a new chief executive and a new leader for New York to try to improve its image.The number of for-hire vehicles in the city has surged to more than 100,000 vehicles, from about 60,000 in 2015. But while Uber and other companies are flourishing, many of their drivers are not. About 40 percent of drivers have incomes so low that they qualify for Medicaid and about 18 percent qualify for food stamps, according to a study by prominent economists last year.The cap was expected to last a year while the city studied the proliferation of ride-hail trips. At the end of that period, the city’s taxi commission would review the number of vehicle licenses and decide on how they would be regulated.Last month, Mr. de Blasio said in a radio interview that he wanted to "put ongoing caps in place on the for-hire vehicles.” Officials at City Hall confirmed that the mayor was considering extending the cap.Uber’s lawsuit argues that it was not legal for the city to delegate the power to cap vehicles to the taxi commission. If Uber cannot meet growing rider demand, the lawsuit says that could hurt the state’s efforts to raise money for the subway through new fees on ride-hail trips.The lawsuit, filed in state supreme court in Manhattan, questions the city’s motives: “This is less a ‘study’ and more a ‘post hoc rationalization’ of a remedy the city appears to have already selected.”Lyft also opposes a permanent cap. “Any extension of this misguided policy would do even more significant, long-term damage to drivers and riders,” Lyft said in a statement.The City Council is proud of the new regulations imposed on the ride-hailing industry and had the authority to approve them, said Jacob Tugendrajch, a spokesman for Mr. Johnson. The speaker, his office said, wants the taxi commission to make a decision about any future limits on vehicles based on data from its study.The city’s taxi commissioner, Meera Joshi, recently announced that she was stepping down in March. Her successor will have a powerful role in determining the industry’s future.In a separate lawsuit, Lyft challenged the city’s rules to raise driver wages to more than $17 an hour. Lyft claims the rules give Uber an unfair advantage because it judges companies differently based on their “utilization rate,” or how often drivers have a passenger in their car versus driving around empty.The approach gives “the largest company with the biggest market share a built-in and perpetual advantage over companies with lower utilizations,” Lyft’s lawsuit said.Lyft has sold itself as the more ethical ride-hail option. But the lawsuit hurt its image among some riders like Brad Lander, a councilman from Brooklyn, who said he deleted the app.After facing harsh criticism, Lyft announced that it would comply with the new pay rules while its legal case proceeded.Uber and Lyft say they care about public policy, but the lawsuits show their first priority is self interest, said Bruce Schaller, a former city transportation official who has closely studied the industry. The companies face a difficult challenge of balancing both profits and their public image. In this case, Mr. Schaller said, Uber chose to protect its bottom line.“Uber in particular has been playing super nice since its change in management a year ago and particularly as they get closer to the I.P.O.,” he said. “Suing the biggest city in the country isn’t playing super nice.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Kate CongerSAN FRANCISCO — Uber plans to buy Careem, its largest rival in the Middle East, the American ride-hailing company announced on Tuesday, giving it a strong foothold in the region ahead of its expected public offering.The deal, valued at $3.1 billion, will need regulatory approval and may not be completed until next year.Uber’s public offering, expected next month, could reach a valuation of up to $120 billion, rivaling the 2012 listing of Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce giant. But Uber has remained unprofitable, burning cash on subsidies for its riders and drivers in an effort to undercut its competition. In the final quarter of 2018, the company lost $865 million on revenue of $3 billion.By taking over its main competition in the Middle East, Uber could cut its losses there. The deal with Careem will also give it access to some countries, like Iraq, Palestine and Morocco, where it does not operate.Uber will pay $1.4 billion in cash and $1.7 billion in convertible notes. Careem will continue to operate under its own brand and remain somewhat independent of Uber. Both companies will continue to offer rides, but may test certain features on one platform before introducing them on the other.The deal is a break from Uber’s approach in some other regions. Uber has sold majority stakes of its businesses in Russia, China and Southeast Asia to local competitors after deciding to avoid price wars in those areas. Those deals briefly put Uber in the black for the first time in the company’s history.“With a proven ability to develop innovative local solutions, Careem has played a key role in shaping the future of urban mobility across the Middle East, becoming one of the most successful start-ups in the region,” Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber’s chief executive, said in a statement.Careem was founded in 2012 as a corporate car service but eventually adopted a ride-hailing model similar to Uber’s. The company is based in Dubai and operates in 15 countries, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia. It recently expanded into food delivery and payments, seeking to establish itself as a one-stop shop for consumers. Private investors valued the company at about $2 billion last year.But Uber’s deal could raise privacy concerns. As the company planned its expansion in Egypt in 2017, government officials there asked it to provide real-time access to users’ location data. Uber declined, arguing that it had never provided real-time access to governments, but Careem was more open to cooperating with the government.In 2018, hackers stole personal data for 14 million users from Careem. To address these concerns, Careem’s security and legal teams will report directly to Uber, according to a person familiar with the deal. The person would speak only on the condition of anonymity ahead of Uber’s public offering.Mr. Khosrowshahi said in an email to employees that both Uber and Careem would benefit from operating independently.“This framework has the advantage of letting us build new products and try new ideas across not one but two strong brands, with strong operators within each,” Mr. Khosrowshahi wrote. Over time, Uber and Careem will integrate some elements of the other’s products, he added.Careem will be guided by its own board, with two members from Careem and three from Uber.“The mobility and broader internet opportunity in the region is massive and untapped, and has the potential to leapfrog our region into the digital future,” Mudassir Sheikha, Careem’s co-founder and chief executive, said in a statement.Follow Kate Conger on Twitter: @kateconger.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Mike Isaac, Kate Conger and Erin GriffithSAN FRANCISCO — Uber is in talks to sell a stake in its self-driving technologies unit to SoftBank and other investors for as much as $1 billion, as the ride-hailing company prepares to go public, according to four people with knowledge of the matter.The talks are still underway and may not result in an investment, said the people, who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Apart from SoftBank, the investor consortium includes an automaker, they added.Under the terms of the proposed deal, investors would purchase from a pool of Uber stock specifically earmarked for the self-driving technologies unit. Uber would maintain majority control of the self-driving arm and would use the investment to fund its research and development. The deal would value the self-driving business at $5 billion to $10 billion, the people said.Uber filed confidentially to go public in December in what would be one of the largest tech initial public offerings of recent years. The company, based in San Francisco, could hit a valuation of $120 billion when it reaches the stock market.But Uber is under scrutiny for its losses — its net loss was $842 million in the fourth quarter — and self-driving technologies are expensive. A $1 billion infusion could ease worries about how costly it is to develop autonomous cars.The proposed investment was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal.Uber has for years invested heavily in self-driving cars, which it has said will eventually become a primary mode of transportation, replacing its human drivers. But its autonomous unit, formed in 2014, loses between $100 million and $200 million each quarter. Its fleet of vehicles was also grounded for nine months last year after one of the autonomous cars struck and killed a pedestrian in Arizona. In the past, Uber has considered spinning off the unit as a separate entity.Uber Freight, the company’s long-haul trucking business, also has a separate valuation based on pools of equity specifically earmarked for the unit. As part of an agreement with employees, the company rewarded them with equity in Uber Freight as a stand-alone business late last year.SoftBank is already a major investor in Uber after it acquired about 17.5 percent of the ride-hailing firm’s stock last year at a significant discount. In addition to Uber, SoftBank has poured money into ride-hailing companies such as Ola in India and Grab in Southeast Asia.SoftBank has also invested in businesses focused on autonomous vehicles. In mid-2018, the firm invested $2.25 billion in GM Cruise Holdings, a division of General Motors. Structuring Cruise as a separate entity made it possible for General Motors to isolate the losses from its autonomous division.In August, Toyota invested $500 million in Uber. The move was meant to let Uber put its self-driving technology in Toyota vehicles.“Toyota constantly reviews and considers various options for investment, but we do not have anything to announce about a further investment in Uber at this time,” a Toyota spokeswoman said on Wednesday.Follow Mike Isaac, Kate Conger and Erin Griffith on Twitter: @MikeIsaac, @kateconger and @eringriffith.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Reuters(Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc's initial public offering (IPO) filing on Thursday will draw inevitable comparisons to its smaller ride-hailing rival Lyft Inc, which completed its initial public listing last month.Following Lyft's poor stock market performance of late, investors will be scrutinizing Uber's financial results and projections closely.Not only is Uber much larger than Lyft, but it is also more complex, with operations that go beyond its core ride-hailing business and extend into areas such as food delivery and freight transit. The following are four key financial metrics which investors will be watching for: REVENUEUber is a much larger company than Lyft, with operations in markets ranging from the United States to Latin America to North Africa. Lyft operates entirely in North America.Uber also has a broader array of business lines, including a food delivery service and a platform for commercial freight. As a result, Uber clocks much higher revenues than Lyft. Uber reported net revenues of $11.4 billion in 2018. That is in comparison to $2.2 billion for Lyft during the same year. If one considers revenue growth, however, Uber may take a back seat to Lyft. Lyft has been rapidly gaining market share relative to its larger rival, meaning that its revenue growth has been outpacing Uber's. Lyft's revenue more than doubled between 2017 and 2018, from just over $1 billion to more than $2.1 billion. Uber's, meanwhile, grew 43 percent, to $11.4 billion. ADJUSTED EBITDAThis common measure of profitability will look similar to Lyft's in one major respect: both Uber and Lyft are loss-making companies. Uber reported an adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) loss of $1.8 billion in 2018, compared to around $950 million for Lyft. But expect Uber to argue to investors that its scale will give it a significant advantage in terms of profitability over the long run, allowing it to more effectively hold down costs. It will also likely point out that its year-over-year losses are down, from $2.2 billion in 2017. Lyft's ticked up over the same timeframe. CONTRIBUTION MARGINThis lesser-known financial metric will likely play a big role in Uber's pitch to investors. It is designed to show whether Uber's operations in individual markets are profitable on a standalone basis by ignoring company-wide costs like marketing or technology investment. Expect Uber to make a case that positive contribution margins in many of its markets mean that, fundamentally, its business model works. Uber has a different method of calculating contribution margin than Lyft, so the two companies' figures cannot be directly compared, a person familiar with the matter said.MONTHLY ACTIVE USERSUber generates more rides than Lyft in large part due to its wider, global presence. Lyft had 18.6 million monthly active riders as of the fourth quarter of 2018.  (Reporting by Carl O'Donnell in New York, editing by G Crosse)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressSAN FRANCISCO — The Latest on Uber revealing its finances ahead of its initial public offering (all times local):2:45 p.m.Uber is forging ahead with its initial public offering of stock while the government authorities and regulators investigate whether the company broke any laws while building the world's largest ride-hailing service.The San Francisco company disclosed the legal cloud hanging over it Thursday as part of documents setting the stage for its stock market debut.Among other things, Uber revealed the U.S. Justice Department is conducting a criminal investigation into a yearlong cover-up of a massive computer break-in during 2016 that heisted personal information belonging to millions of passengers and drivers.Other inquiries are looking into Uber's use of duplicitous software to dupe government regulators.The probes are among the many risks that investors must weigh as they mull whether to jump into one of the biggest IPOs in years.___2:30 p.m.Travis Kalanick, the former CEO who resigned in 2017 under pressure from the board, is one of Uber's largest shareholders, owning nearly 9% of the ride-hailing company's stock. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, owns 5% of the company, even as it competes with Uber on self-driving technology. Alphabet also owns roughly 5% of Uber rival Lyft's stock.Cayman, a subsidiary of Softbank, is Uber's largest shareholder with 16%. Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the managing director of Saudi Arabia's public investment fund, is listed as holding 5.4%.___1:50 p.m.Uber is providing a look under the hood of its business in the lead-up to its hotly anticipated debut on the stock market.Documents released Thursday offered the most detailed view of the world's largest ride-hailing service since its inception a decade ago. The unveiling comes four months after Uber took its first step toward its initial public offering with a confidential filing.The breakdown shows Uber has been generating the robust revenue growth that entices investors, but also racked up nearly $8 billion in losses since its inception.Uber's revenue totaled $11.3 billion in 2018, a 42% increase from $7.9 billion in 2017.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressNEW YORK — While shoppers are getting everything from morning coffee to complete work wardrobes delivered to their homes, some businesses are working with ride-hailing company Uber to entice customers back through their doors.Uber launched a voucher program Tuesday enabling companies like Westfield Mall and TGI Fridays to offer free or discounted Uber rides to customers.It's a way for retailers to counter declining foot traffic heightened by the growth of online shopping.Restaurants that deliver food through Uber Eats are also participating. Getting diners inside a restaurant instead of delivering food to homes makes customers more likely to buy desserts or alcohol.Uber's Brittany Wray says customers today are demanding convenience, and vouchers enable brands to offer consumers more choices and a better customer experience.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byShiny new app, same old propaganda.By Audrey Jiajia LiMs. Li is a freelance journalist.If there’s one thing we know for certain about China in 2019, it’s that people there love their apps. They use WeChat to talk with friends; they spend hours battling virtual enemies on PUBG; they binge-watch short videos on Douyin. And so why shouldn’t the Communist Party get in on the action?Xuexi Qiangguo — “study and make the nation great” — has become ubiquitous in China, an instant messenger, news aggregator and social network all in one introduced by the Publicity Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party in January. The first and second characters in the name, when combined — xuexi — mean “study/learn”; the same character, xi, also happens to be the character in President Xi Jinping’s surname. The app’s name, thus, can also be read as “study Xi and make the nation great.” And the Chinese are doing so, by the tens of millions.As of late March, Xuexi Qiangguo had been downloaded over 73 million times on Huawei’s app store. It’s also currently the most-downloaded app on Apple’s Chinese app store, which is hard to reconcile with its average rating of just 2.7 stars out of five, until you take into account that all government and state-owned-enterprise employees, along with tens of millions of party members, have been “encouraged” to use it and, sometimes, to compete with one another for the highest score.I wanted to experience Xuexi Qiangguo for myself — to see whether the shiny new technological gloss of an app could fundamentally transform the drudgery of daily ideological study. So last month I downloaded it and signed on. Suddenly there I was, immediately connected to my friends and colleagues. In the weeks since, I’ve been receiving several notifications a day; they include news coverage of Mr. Xi’s activities, a “golden quote of the day” from our president, “red patriotic songs” for me to listen to and links to online courses on traditional Chinese cultural heritage.But it wasn’t enough to simply sign on every once in a while or to click on some notifications. To do well on Xuexi Qiangguo requires a serious time commitment; those under peer pressure to use the app are typically expected to score two or three dozen points a day, and sometimes more. “Thirty points per day would only put me at the bottom among the members of the party branch I belong to,” one user on Weibo, China’s equivalent of Twitter, told me. “My colleagues are so passionate about competing,” the user said, that they felt under pressure to earn the daily maximum of 66 points a day “to make sure I don’t get left behind.” (Late last month, after complaints from users who said they had to spend hours each day using the app, the government revised the ranking function so that users could no longer see one another’s scores, and revised down the daily cap to 52 points.)In my first few weeks, I’d been getting a few points for just logging in, along with occasional peak-hour login bonuses. Reading articles on it and watching videos brought in another couple of points. But to really score highly, I needed to take the quizzes — to answer questions on Mr. Xi’s speeches and works. That was where the real points were: If I correctly answered all the quiz questions, I could earn 24 points total.And the questions were easy. The first one I encountered: “(Blank) is contemporary China’s Marxism, the 21st century’s Marxism, the guidance for our Party and our people to achieve the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, a proven, practically great, powerful ideological weapon, and must be persisted in and developed consistently over a long term.” The answer? “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era,” of course. What else?Another question looked trickier at first glance: “Sticking to the Party’s overall leadership and coordination among different sectors, to build up a system with the Party’s full leadership role, and guarantee that the Party’s leadership is carried out in domains such as (blank), (blank), and (blank)”. Luckily, it was multiple choice. Among the answers were (A) Reforming, development and maintaining stability; (B) Domestic politics, foreign policy and defense; and (C) Governing the Party, the nation and the military. The answer was all of the above; the party is omnipotent, our leader in all arenas.I gave up after about half an hour, earning a measly nine points. “Post your point of view and collect one point,” the app prompted. Why not? I thought, and moved into the comment section, only to be greeted with instructions like “only valid points of view will be awarded points” and “good comments will be prioritized for display.” In the digital age, with increasingly powerful technology at their disposal, China’s propaganda authorities have developed quite a few high-tech tools aimed at spreading their message among tech-savvy youngsters and grooming so-called red millennials. Earlier this year, a seven-episode cartoon program about Karl Marx was streamed on the popular video site Bilibili. Last month, the state news agency Xinhua put out an English-language rap video praising the country’s accomplishments ahead of the “two sessions” — China’s annual parliamentary meetings.[As technology advances, will it continue to blur the lines between public and private? Sign up for Charlie Warzel’s limited-run newsletter to explore what's at stake and what you can do about it.]Developed by the tech giant Alibaba, Xuexi Qiangguo has a certain polish to it. And it comes with some additional perks: Users can redeem their study points in businesses across the country for gifts like pastries, tablets, restaurant discounts and even free sightseeing tickets.But no matter how fancy the new products look on the surface, at their core they remain the mandatory study of ideologically correct materials and the demonstration of allegiance to the central government. The minute I entered the quiz section, memories of my middle school years in Chinese classrooms came flooding back: the grandiose language, the endless repetition, the fixed answers, the publicly displayed class rankings — the collective memories of Chinese students across several generations.

Here are how the two companies compare on key metrics from Uber's filing: REVENUEUber had $11.3 billion in 2018 vs Lyft $2.2 billion. Uber's growth has been slowing relative to Lyft due to scandals and aggressive discounting by Lyft.Lyft’s revenue more than doubled between 2017 and 2018 while Uber's grew around 42 percent.MARKET SHAREUber has lost market share but remains the leader.Uber has 65 percent share in North America while Lyft says it has 39 percent in the United States. ADJUSTED EBITDABoth Uber and Lyft lose money though Uber has trimmed its losses in recent years. Uber's adjusted loss before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization was just over $1.8 billion in 2018 compared to $2.6 billion in 2017. Lyft lost $950 million in 2018 on the same basis.MONTHLY ACTIVE USERSUber has 91 million monthly active users compared to Lyft's 18.6 million.Uber's number includes customers of additional services beyond ride sharing. (The story corrects in Revenue section, corrects revenue growth rate for Uber) (Reporting by Carl O'Donnell; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressSAN FRANCISCO — Uber is providing a look under the hood of its business in the lead-up to its hotly anticipated debut on the stock market, revealing strong growth but an ongoing struggle to overcome huge losses and repair its reputation.Documents released Thursday offered the most detailed view of the world's largest ride-hailing service since its inception a decade ago.The massive filing shows Uber has been generating the robust revenue growth that entices investors, but also racked up nearly $8 billion in losses over its 10 years in existence, which mirrors the same trend challenging Lyft, Uber's main rival in the U.S.Uber's revenue totaled $11.3 billion in 2018, a 42% increase from $7.9 billion in 2017, and a giant leap from $495 million in 2014.The company posted a profit of $997 million last year, but that doesn't mean its ride-hailing service suddenly started to make money — far from it. The positive result stemmed from a windfall that Uber generated from the sale of its operations in Russia and Southeast Asia. The company said it sustained an operating loss of $3 billion.The San Francisco company also disclosed a legal cloud hanging over its head as government authorities and regulators investigate whether the company broke any laws.Among other things, Uber revealed the U.S. Justice Department is conducting a criminal investigation into a yearlong cover-up of a massive computer break-in during 2016 that heisted personal information belonging to millions of passengers and drivers.The probes are among the many risks that investors must weigh as they mull whether to jump into one of the biggest IPOs in years.Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi acknowledged the self-inflicted wounds that damaged the ride-hailing service's reputation while trying to make the case that the company has rehabilitated itself since he took over 18 months ago.He struck his note of contrition and optimism in a letter included in the federal documents."Some of the attributes that made Uber a wildly successful startup — a fierce sense of entrepreneurialism, our willingness to take risks that others might not, and that famous Uber hustle — led to missteps along the way," Khosrowshahi wrote, closing his letter by assuring he will run Uber with integrity.Reaching profitability has proven to be a challenge for both Uber and Lyft. Paying drivers is a huge expense, and Uber's fierce competition with Lyft for customers has led both companies to offer rides below cost. Drivers for both companies complain about declining earnings, and they can easily switch between platforms, making it difficult for either company to further reduce driver costs and keep fares cheap for passengers.Uber said it plans to give bonuses to qualified drivers and is setting aside an undisclosed portion of its stock for drivers to buy.Its unprofitable history may force Uber to eventually raise its ride-hailing prices unless it can reduce its costs by shifting to driverless cars or expand into other markets and lines of business.But Uber's operating losses declined from $4 billion in 2017 to $3 billion in 2018, indicating it could be heading in the right direction."They're showing that they're capable of controlling their costs, which has been a concern of ride sharing companies in general," said SharesPost analyst Alejandro Ortiz. "That's a sign that will be looked on favorably in the next few weeks."Lyft beat Uber to the stock market last month with an IPO that raised $2.3 billion, but its shares have been backsliding after an early run-up. Lyft's stock currently is hovering around $61, down from its IPO price of $72.The rocky start may have prompted Uber to tamp down its IPO ambitions. The company is expected to try to raise roughly $10 billion and seeks a market value of $90 billion to $100 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal. That's below earlier estimates of $120 billion.The investment bankers handling Uber's IPO are expected to reveal a pricing range for Uber's shares later this month. That will come before executives head out on a so-called road show designed to drum up interest in the IPO among institutional investors who will be given the first opportunity to buy the stock before it begins trading on the New York Stock Exchange next month.In the end, Uber is widely expected to be the biggest technology IPO since Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group went public in 2014. And it's likely to be the largest among U.S. tech companies since Facebook took its bow on Wall Street seven years ago at a time when most people hadn't ever considered using an app on their smartphone to summon a ride from strangers driving their own cars.Uber launched in 2009 as UberCab, a black car service where customers could hail professional drivers with a few taps on a smartphone. It shortened its name to Uber in 2010, distancing itself from the taxicab industry, which has criticized the company for operating under less regulation than the traditional taxi industry.The company operates in 65 countries and has completed 10 billion trips worldwide.Uber is also expanding in other markets such as freight while offering other ways to get around with shared scooters and bikes. Its fast-growing food delivery business, which spans 500 cities globally, doubled its revenue to $757 million in 2018 from $367 million in 2017.But Uber faces challenges that Lyft doesn't because of a series of damaging revelations that sullied its reputation among consumers. The setbacks have included rampant internal sexual harassment and allegations it stole self-driving car technology.The blowback from the problems helped Lyft pick up ground in the U.S. — something Uber acknowledged in its filing — and led to the ouster of Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick as CEO in 2017. Now it will be up to Kalanick's successor, Khosrowshahi, to persuade investors that Uber has cleaned up its act and merits a market value higher than Ford Motor and General Motors combined.Kalanick is one of Uber's largest shareholders, owning nearly 9% of the company's stock.Uber has been investing substantially in self-driving vehicles, which could be critical to reducing driver costs and achieving profitability. It launched its first self-driving test vehicle in 2016 and its self-driving car division has more than 1,000 employees, and it has built more than 250 self-driving cars so far.But it suspended testing when one of its self-driving vehicles struck and killed a pedestrian in Arizona last year. The company resumed testing self-driving vehicles in Pittsburgh in December.In its federal filing, Uber warned of the fierce competition it faces on that front from rivals such as Tesla and Google's Waymo, who it said could introduce autonomous vehicles earlier than Uber. The company also warned that potential future regulations or increases in insurance costs could impact the autonomous vehicle business.Alphabet, the parent company of Google, owns 5% of Uber, even as it competes with Uber on self-driving technology. Alphabet also owns roughly 5% of Lyft's stock.__Bussewitz reported from New York. Marcy Gordon contributed from Washington, D.C.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersNEW YORK — Uber Technologies Inc has 91 million users, but growth is slowing and it may never make a profit, the ride-hailing company said on Thursday in its IPO filing.The document gave the first comprehensive financial picture of the decade-old company which was started after its founders struggled to get a cab on a snowy night and has changed the way much of the world travels. The S-1 filing underscores Uber's rapid growth in the last three years but also how a string of public scandals and increased competition from rivals have weighed on its plans to attract and retain riders. The disclosure also highlighted how far Uber remains from turning a profit, with the company cautioning it expects operating expenses to "increase significantly in the foreseeable future" and it "may not achieve profitability." Uber lost $3.03 billion in 2018 from operations.The filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission revealed Uber had 91 million average monthly active users on its platforms, including for ride-hailing and Uber Eats, at the end of 2018. This is up 33.8 percent from 2017, but growth slowed from 51 percent a year earlier.Uber had not disclosed the latest user numbers before, and the figure indicates the scale of the business. Although its user base includes customers of other services and ride-sharing, the number is nearly five times the 18.6 million announced by rival Lyft Inc. Uber in 2018 had $11.3 billion revenue, up around 42 percent over 2017, but below the 106 percent growth the prior year. Uber set a placeholder amount of $1 billion but did not specify the size of the IPO. Reuters reported this week that Uber plans to sell around $10 billion worth of stock at a valuation of between $90 billion and $100 billion. Investment bankers had previously told Uber it could be worth as much as $120 billion. Uber would be the largest initial public offering since that of Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd in 2014, which raised $25 billion. Although Uber is no longer targeting a $120 billion valuation in the IPO, some stock bonuses to Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi and other company executives are only triggered when that valuation is reached. Uber will follow Lyft in going public. Shares in its smaller rival closed at $61.01 on Thursday, 15 percent below its IPO price set late last month, a development which has sent a chilling signal for other tech start-ups looking to go public. After making the public filing, Uber will begin a series of investor presentations, called a roadshow, which Reuters has reported will start the week of April 29. The company is on track to price its IPO and begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange in early May.ADVERSE EVENTSUber faces questions over how it will navigate any transition toward self-driving vehicles, a technology seen as potentially dramatically lowering costs but which could also disrupt its business model.Last year, the ride-hailing giant settled a legal dispute over trade secrets with Alphabet Inc's Waymo self-driving vehicle unit.Waymo, in its lawsuit, had said one of its former engineers who became chief of Uber's self-driving car project took with him thousands of confidential documents.Uber revealed in the filing it could have to pay a license fee to Waymo or face a substantial delay to the development of its self-driving technology if the initial assessment of its technology by an independent expert is confirmed.The expert, installed as part of Uber's settlement with Waymo, has identified on an interim basis certain functions in Uber's autonomous vehicle software that "are problematic and other functions that are not," Uber said.A Waymo spokesperson said: "This review is on-going and we will continue to take the necessary steps to ensure our confidential information is not being used by Uber."One advantage Uber will likely seek to play up to investors is that it is the largest player in many of the markets in which it operates. Analysts consider building scale crucial for Uber's business model to become profitable. In addition to answering questions about Uber's finances, CEO Khosrowshahi will be tasked with convincing investors that he has successfully changed the culture and business practices after a series of embarrassing scandals over the last two years.Those have included sexual harassment allegations, a massive data breach that was concealed from regulators, use of illicit software to evade authorities and allegations of bribery overseas. Khosrowshahi joined Uber in 2017 to replace company co-founder Travis Kalanick who was ousted as CEO. Uber said in its filing its ridehailing position in the United States and Canada was "significantly impacted by adverse publicity events" and that its position in many markets has been threatened by discounts from other ride-hailing companies.A #DeleteUber campaign surged on social media in 2017 after a public relations crisis, which Uber said in its filing meant hundreds of thousands of consumers stopped using its platform within days. Uber said its market share fell in most regions last year, although the rate of decline has slowed. The company claims more than 65 percent market share in the United States and Canada, versus Lyft's stated 39 percent in the United States. Uber is reserving some shares in the IPO for drivers who have completed 2,500 trips among other criteria.

Dalton, terrorized the Kalamazoo area on Feb. 20, 2016, when he drove wildly through the city and its suburbs, shooting people outside a car dealership, a Cracker Barrel restaurant and a townhouse complex. Over a period of hours, he gave Uber customers rides between the seemingly random shootings. The gunfire rattled Western Michigan and raised questions about Uber’s screening of its drivers at a time when the ride-hailing service was expanding into smaller cities.“It helps with community healing, some closure,” said Mayor Bobby Hopewell of Kalamazoo. “It’s a heinous incident.”Mr. Dalton, who was arrested the night of the shootings, initially pleaded not guilty and appeared to be headed to trial until his last-minute plea. Last year, Mr. Dalton won a case in the Michigan Court of Appeals that barred prosecutors from using incriminating statements made to police officers. Mr. Dalton had spoken to officers shortly after the shootings.Jury questioning in the case was to begin Monday, with the trial expected to last two weeks. But, with families of the shooting victims gathered in the gallery on Monday morning, Mr. Dalton changed course. His lawyer, Eusebio Solis, withdrew plans to use an insanity defense, and Mr. Dalton, shackled around his waist and wearing a dress shirt with an unbuttoned collar, stood at the front of the courtroom and pleaded guilty to every charge, including six counts of murder.Some people in the courtroom gallery wept as officials read the names of the victims, and Mr. Dalton answered “yes” to questions about killing each of them“I’ve wanted this for quite a while,” Mr. Dalton told the judge when asked whether he understood his pleas.Mr. Dalton will face a mandatory term of life in prison without the possibility of parole on the murder charges when he is sentenced next month. Mr. Solis said he had advised his client against pleading guilty.Mr. Solis said plea discussions had been ongoing for months, but that prosecutors dropped no charges and showed no support for a lighter sentence.Mr. Dalton’s plea left many questions unanswered about his motive in the rampage. His victims included a retired English teacher, a former state worker, a father and son shopping for cars and a teenage girl who was pronounced dead but ended up surviving.Mr. Hopewell said the shootings had faded from daily conversation in Kalamazoo over the years, but remained imprinted on the city’s consciousness. He said people still remembered the fears during the manhunt, “Wondering what’s going to happen next? Where is this person?”The attack, which drew national news attention to Kalamazoo, was denounced by then-President Barack Obama as another instance of large-scale gun violence. “I’ve got to assume all of you are just as tired as I am of seeing this stuff happen in your states,” Mr. Obama said.The shooting also brought unflattering attention to Uber, whose officials at the time defended their background check process. Mr. Dalton, who had been an Uber driver for only days or weeks, had no serious criminal record.“No background check process would have made a difference in this case because this person didn’t have a criminal history,” said Joe Sullivan, the company’s chief security officer, in 2016.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersLOS ANGELES — Uber Technologies Inc's restaurant delivery business has grown revenue to $1.5 billion in just three years, the company disclosed in its IPO filing on Thursday, dwarfing the revenue of its profitable, and already public, rival Grubhub Inc.Uber also spelled out the struggle its food delivery business faces: "Cumulative payments to drivers for Uber Eats deliveries historically have exceeded the cumulative delivery fees paid by consumers," it said. Uber Eats, and its rivals DoorDash and Postmates - who are also candidates for initial public offerings (IPOs) - are offering discounts and incentives to diners and restaurants in a race to grab the biggest piece of online restaurant delivery sales that investment firm William Blair & Co expects to grow to $62 billion in 2022 from around $25 billion today.Uber said its "take rate" - or the percentage of revenue it keeps from each restaurant order - declined to 10 percent after it charged high-volume restaurant partners lower fees in competitive markets like the United States and India. "What you like to see is take rates going up not down," said Wedbush Securities analyst Ygal Arounian, who noted that fast-food giant McDonald's Corp is a key Uber Eats partner. Research firm Edison Trends said Uber Eats does more deliveries than its U.S. rivals, including Grubhub, but that the dollar value of each transaction is the lowest of the bunch at $26.20. That makes it harder to turn a profit in an industry where customers, restaurants and drivers bounce between delivery services. Raising prices is not an option. "Consumers, as convenience-minded as they are, are still pretty price sensitive," said Jesse Reyes, chief executive of J-Curve Advisors, who advises venture capital and private equity funds. Grubhub had established the beginnings of a profitability roadmap for the industry - even as some experts worry that it is losing share to its fast-growing Silicon Valley rivals. The Chicago-based company merged with rival Seamless before its April 2014 IPO and since has made more than a half-dozen other purchases, including Yelp Inc's Eat24, campus delivery firm Tapingo Ltd and LevelUP, which manages digital ordering, payments and loyalty programs. It booked 2018 net income of $78.5 million on revenue of $1 billion. Grubhub's U.S. restaurant partners pay an average commission rate of 20 percent. Diners are charged nothing or up to a few dollars for deliveries, spokeswoman Katie Norris said. The company also forged an exclusive partnership with KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut owner Yum Brands Inc, which took a $200 million stake in the Grubhub. Experts say there will be more consolidation and failures as delivery firms look for ways to break away from the pack. "It's early days in this space and there is a lot that will shake out in the next couple of years," said Wedbush Securities analyst Arounian.  (Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; additional reporting by Nivedita Balu and Shariq Kahn in Bengaluru; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Reuters(Reuters) - Uber Technologies Inc may face a cooler reception from investors than expected when it prices its initial public offering next month since smaller U.S. ride-hailing rival Lyft Inc's aggressive stock launch and subsequent fall. Lyft's IPO priced at the top end of its upwardly revised range last month, assigning it a valuation of more than $24 billion in an offering that raised $2.34 billion. But the stock has languished since debuting on the Nasdaq on March 29, as concerns about the startup's potential for profitability have become more prominent. Lyft shares ended on Wednesday down 11 percent at $60.12, well below their $72 IPO price. Lyft was the first in a string of technology IPOs expected this year, including food delivery service Postmates and smart exercise bike Peleton. Lyft's poor stock performance bodes ill for these IPOs, especially for companies like Uber with no profits to show. "There's no discernable way these companies are valued. What you're really buying into is the long-term ability of the company to capture lots of sales and hopefully get profitable at some point," said Brian Hamilton, founder of data firm Sageworks. "I'm sure that the Lyft debut is going to affect both Uber and Pinterest," Hamilton added. Uber filed for its IPO in December with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission during the same week as Lyft. But it let Lyft go first with its offering, partly because it was working on a new private fundraising round for its autonomous driving unit.Uber is now paying the price of going second. It is planning to seek a valuation between $90 billion and $100 billion, short of the $120 billion investment bankers previously told the company it could be worth in an IPO, Reuters reported on Tuesday. Image sharing app Pinterest Inc this week also set the terms for its IPO which would value the company at up to $11.3 billion, below its latest fundraising round which valued it at $12 billion in 2017. Prior to Lyft going public, Pinterest had been weighing a valuation at or near the last fundraising round, according to a source familiar with the matter. Pinterest declined to comment. Uber is expected to make its detailed financial results public on Thursday. It lost $3.3 billion last year, excluding one-off gains, while Lyft lost $911 million for 2018. Pinterest also lost $62.97 million in 2018.Uber declined to comment. GETTING GREEDYInvestors and analysts said technology unicorn IPOs are losing their luster, not just because more investors are asking tough questions about their prospects, but because the startups overestimated pent-up demand for their offerings."Lyft wanted to be first... and it got to a point where they got so aggressive with their pricing and they got kind of greedy," said Catherine McCarthy, an Allianz Global Investors research analyst. The pressure to become profitable will ratchet up once these companies become public, said Jordan Stuart, a portfolio manager for Federated Kaufmann funds who often purchases companies' stock in the IPO."The pace of change is happening so quickly that you have to show that you can become profitable quickly," Stuart said. "Some of these companies could go away tomorrow because it's just an app on my phone and I can find another one in a second to get to work or have food delivered."

She recalled asking the driver: Are you waiting for Liz? Yeah, he responded. Get in.She had done it countless times. But that night in July 2018, as the man veered off course toward a deserted parking lot, as he cranked up the radio and ignored her questions, as her real driver called her wondering where she was, Ms. Suarez said she realized with horror: This was not an Uber.“That’s when he said, ‘Give me your wallet, give me your phone, give me everything you have,’” Ms. Suarez, 28, said.On busy streets outside bars or clubs, people often hop into a car without a second thought. But the killing of Samantha Josephson, a 21-year-old college student in South Carolina who was stabbed to death after getting into a car she mistook for her Uber last weekend, has brought national attention to a rash of kidnappings, sexual assaults and robberies carried out largely against young women by assailants posing as ride-share drivers.There have been at least two dozen such attacks in the past few years, according to a tally of publicly reported cases, including instances where suspects have been charged with attacking multiple women. In Connecticut, a man was arraigned last week on charges that he kidnapped and raped two women who believed he was their ride-share driver. In Chicago, prosecutors said a man who posed as an Uber driver sexually assaulted five women, climbing into the back seat and pinning them down.These attacks turn a simple mix-up into a nightmare, showing how easily bad actors can exploit the vulnerabilities of a ride-sharing culture that so many people trust to get them home safe.[Tips for staying safe when getting into a ride-share vehicle.]The drivers troll nightclubs and bars late at night to find people scanning the dark for their ride, according to law enforcement descriptions of the assaults. They wave to passengers and say, “I’m your driver.” Some even hang ride-share decals in their windows.The attacks represent a tiny fraction of the millions of uneventful rides that Americans hail every day. But Ms. Josephson’s murder has forced ride-sharing companies to address renewed safety concerns, led to legislative proposals and public efforts to reduce future attacks, and prompted passengers across the country to weigh the risks of climbing into a stranger’s back seat.“It could be any one of us,” said Kate Lewis, a junior at the University of South Carolina, where Ms. Josephson had been a senior about to head to law school.[Have you had a scary experience with what you thought was a ride-share driver? Please share your experiences in the comments.]State lawmakers in South Carolina have proposed a law named for Ms. Josephson that would require all ride-share drivers to display a lighted sign from their company. Her father, Seymour Josephson, has become an outspoken advocate for stronger safety measures, saying at a vigil this week, “I don’t want anyone else to go through it as a parent.”At the University of South Carolina, students have started a new safety campaign that urges riders to ask, “What’s my name?” to ensure they are talking to their actual ride-share drivers before getting into a car.Students described the campaign as one constructive action they could take amid a week of stunned grief and candlelit vigils, after the police announced on Saturday that they had found Ms. Josephson’s body in the woods 70 miles away. She had last been seen at 2 a.m. Friday in a busy downtown neighborhood in Columbia, S.C., getting into a black Chevrolet Impala.The security footage of those moments is haunting: As Ms. Josephson gets into the back seat, there are people everywhere, tapping on their phones, hugging one another’s shoulders, enjoying the night.The police charged Nathaniel David Rowland, 24, with kidnapping and killing Ms. Josephson. They said they had found Ms. Josephson’s blood and her cellphone in Mr. Rowland’s car, along with bleach and cleaning supplies. The child-safety locks had been engaged.Mr. Rowland has not entered a plea, and his lawyer declined to comment. He was not an Uber driver, the company said.“Everyone at Uber is devastated to hear about this unspeakable crime,” Grant Klinzman, a company spokesman, said in an email. “We spoke with the University of South Carolina president and will be partnering with the university to raise awareness on college campuses nationwide about this incredibly important issue.”Uber sent a message to its users on Thursday advising them to match the license plate, car make and model and to check the driver’s photograph before taking a ride.In the wake of reports of Ms. Josephson’s death, Carla Westlund, 30, thought once again about the night in 2017 when she was raped in Los Angeles by a man she mistakenly thought was her Uber driver. She said she fell asleep in the back seat of the car and woke to him beating her head against the seat.“He had an Uber sticker,” she said. “He was pretending to be an Uber driver.”After three hours in his car, Ms. Westlund said she was able to convince the man to let her go outside her boyfriend’s house, and she immediately reported the attack and went to the hospital. Ms. Westlund said she felt re-victimized by reporting the crime — a common complaint from sexual-assault survivors. She said that she had given additional details of the attack as she remembered more with each retelling, but that the officers had characterized this as changing her story.“I felt like I was definitely being treated like I did something wrong,” she said. She now volunteers with PAVE, a nonprofit that works to end sexual violence.In February 2018, Nicolas Morales was arrested and charged with raping her and six other women by posing as a ride-share driver. He pleaded not guilty and has a preliminary hearing scheduled for April 8.Uber and Lyft have been criticized in the past for not adequately vetting their drivers or doing enough to ensure passenger safety, which has led to temporary bans or restrictions on the services in some cities. A 2018 CNN report found that 103 Uber drivers and 18 Lyft drivers had been accused of sexual assault or abuse. The companies conduct background checks and say passenger safety is their top priority.Uber said it has worked with law enforcement since 2017 to teach riders how to avoid impostors. Last year, it added a panic button that lets riders tap their screens and dial 911 directly from the app.Uber and Lyft also distribute glowing dashboard lights in some markets called the Beacon and Amp that change color to match a hue on a passenger’s app. The lights are in limited distribution and not available to all drivers.Harry Campbell, a driver for Uber and Lyft who hosts a podcast called The Rideshare Guy, said it was common for people to hop into the wrong car in the crush outside bars, airports, games or concerts, where hundreds of people are jostling for their cars.“These sorts of mistakes are happening all the time,” Mr. Campbell said. “But there are some bad actors who realize this and take advantage.”It is not hard to fake, safety experts and law enforcement authorities said.Knockoff decals and light-up signs saying “Uber” and “Lyft” are easy to buy from major online retailers. Impostors trawl night spots when people have often been drinking and are particularly vulnerable, as they part with friends for the evening and search the dark for an unfamiliar car.“They’re taking advantage of an individual who’s intoxicated and doesn’t have all their senses. They’re going to overlook little warning signs,” said Lt. Harrison Daniel of the Athens-Clarke County Police in Georgia, where a man was charged with posing as an Uber driver and raping a college student last year.Identifying the attackers can also be difficult. Unlike actual ride-share drivers, they do not register their personal details in a ride-hailing service’s database, so police have to pull security footage, look for witnesses and search the streets for cars matching a suspect’s vehicle.The driver who abducted and robbed Ms. Suarez in an empty parking lot behind a grocery store early that morning in July 2018 still has not been arrested, though police said the investigation was active.Ms. Suarez escaped by jumping out of his moving car. She cracked her skull and broke her wrist and ankle. When she reported the attack, she said the police had seemed leery of her story and asked her about how she was dressed and what she had been doing out at 4 a.m.She decided to speak out about the attack, posting photos of her injuries on social media and talking to a local television station. Some people responded by saying she was “crying wolf” and was to blame for getting into the wrong car.Ms. Suarez said she believed that the man who attacked her was not there by coincidence that night.“He was waiting for the right person,” she said. “He knew exactly what time to be out there. I think he’d done it in the past, and he’ll continue to do it. Because he’s still out there.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressSAN MATEO, Calif. — Police in Northern California say an Uber driver has been arrested for trying to break into the home of a passenger he had dropped off at the San Francisco airport and then burglarizing a nearby home.The San Mateo Police Department said Monday officers arrested 38-year-old Jackie Wilson Friday at his home in Rancho Cordova.Officials say surveillance video shows Gordon trying to break into his passenger's San Mateo home but giving up after an alarm sounds.Police say Gordon then went to another home a few blocks away and was caught on video burglarizing it.The department says Wilson was arrested at his home, where detectives found some of the stuff stolen from the San Mateo home.Gordon faces burglary and attempted burglary charges.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported bywith interestPlus, The National Enquirer is for sale, and Elon Musk must make nice with the S.E.C.By Charlotte CowlesWant this column in your inbox?

Uber’s widely anticipated initial public offering, on track for early May, is said to aim for a valuation of $90 billion to $100 billion. That’s significantly lower than the $120 billion that many investors had expected, although it would still be the largest I.P.O. since 2014. Why the falling numbers? For one thing, the ride-sharing company lost $1.8 billion last year, and its growth is slowing.

The publication came under scrutiny for helping Mr. Trump’s political rise by buying the rights to a story from a Playboy model who said she had an affair with him and then never publishing it — a tabloid practice known as catch-and-kill. The Enquirer is now under federal investigation for claims that it threatened Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, with “extortion and blackmail” after exposing details about his extramarital affair. Just what no one wanted: Six more months of Brexit drama. European Union leaders agreed on Wednesday to extend Britain’s withdrawal deadline — again — this time to Oct. 31. Now, British lawmakers will have more time to argue over their long-overdue departure plan, which they’ve already had three years to discuss. While they haggle, businesses will continue to plan for the worst until Brexit trade policies are settled, compromising the country’s economic growth. On the upside, Britain did not crash out of the bloc on Friday without a deal, which could have wreaked economic havoc. But is the extension just prolonging the inevitable? APRIL 14-20Thursday is the deadline for Tesla’s chief executive, Elon Musk, and the Securities and Exchange Commission to work out their differences on Mr. Musk’s Twitter practices. A federal judge in New York has asked both parties to submit a joint letter with clear guidelines about Mr. Musk’s tweets — namely, when Mr. Musk must get approval from a Tesla lawyer before posting. The S.E.C. sought more oversight of Mr. Musk’s communications after he tweeted erroneous information about Tesla more than once, first about taking the company private and later about its production numbers. (Presumably, he will be allowed to keep tweeting about cheese-related flatulence and multicolored squirrels whenever he pleases, as he recently did.) A jury will get to decide whether Apple owes money to the chip manufacturer Qualcomm, which might sound dull if not for the cast of tech stars involved. Apple’s chief executive, Tim Cook, and Steve Mollenkopf, his counterpart at Qualcomm, are both expected to take the stand at the trial, which begins in San Diego this week. Top brass from other technology companies, like the manufacturing giant Foxconn, are also expected to testify. The showdown is a culmination of a two-year global fight between tech giants, with Qualcomm seeking back payment for chips used in iPhones and Apple disputing Qualcomm’s claims to certain technology. More big banks will release their first-quarter earnings this coming week, and the results may be stronger than expected if JPMorgan’s report on Friday was any indication. Analysts had lowered their projections for bank profits in recent months for a mix of reasons, including the slowing economy and the Federal Reserve’s changing stance on interest rates. Banks’ performances are often seen as a litmus test for overall economic health, and the latest numbers may offer clues to how much we should be worried about a recession — or whether we’re overly paranoid. Disney unveiled plans to take on Netflix with its own streaming service, which will cost $7 a month when it becomes available on Nov. 12. In other news, J. Crew is considering a spinoff of its smaller, fast-growing brand Madewell to raise some much-needed cash. Speaking of crunches, Boeing still has no timetable for getting its grounded 737 Max jets back in the air, and the costs of fixing the planes — and convincing regulators, airlines and passengers that they’re safe to fly — are starting to pile up.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersBUENOS AIRES — Thousands of taxi drivers snarled traffic in the center of Buenos Aires on Thursday to protest the threat to their business from Uber, in the latest reminder of the headaches the ride-hailing platform faces worldwide as it prepares to go public.With blaring horns, members of Argentina's powerful taxi unions drove their yellow-and-black cabs or marched through the capital at the start of a planned two days of protests.Uber plans to make its initial public offering registration public later on Thursday, Reuters reported earlier this week. People familiar with the matter said it will seek to sell around $10 billion worth of stock, which would make it one of the largest tech IPOs of all time.The Buenos Aires protest underscores frustration among the city's taxi drivers, who charge that Uber undercuts them on price, helping steal away consumers with competitive fares.In Latin America as in other regions, Uber faces regulatory hurdles where it often operates in a legal grey area. It also must contend with rivals, including Chinese ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing, and pressure to cut driver subsidies to bolster profits."I see the biggest threats outside of competition being from regulation and a potential backlash against Uber as payouts to drivers continue to fall," said Nathan Lustig, managing partner of Magma Partners, a Latin America-based venture capital fund. Argentina's capital lacks a specific regulatory framework for Uber, but the firm maintains it obeys the country's laws and pays taxes, and wants cities to pass ride-hailing regulations.Uber faces similar issues in neighboring Chile.The company says other Latin American markets, including Mexico City in Mexico, Rio de Janeiro and San Pablo in Brazil, and La Paz in Bolivia, have passed laws in its favor enabling the use of apps for transporting passengers.UBER HUNTERSLawmakers in Buenos Aires have largely sided with domestic taxi drivers, most of whom are unionized, who say Uber has an unfair competitive advantage because of its lower prices.To counter this, the city government has levied fines and thrown up obstacles, such as an injunction by a judge that disallowed the use of some Argentine credit cards in Uber transactions in Buenos Aires. Still, Argentina has been the fastest-growing market in the world for Uber since it started operating there in 2016, despite the country's recession, company data reviewed by Reuters shows.That success has angered the city's taxi unions, who claim demand for taxis has been cut in half since Uber's arrival. Taxi drivers protesting on Thursday carried signs calling Uber illegal and its customers "corrupt". Uber drivers have been the target of violent attacks by so-called "caza Ubers" or "Uber hunters." It is common in Buenos Aires for Uber drivers to ask passengers to sit in the front seat to avoid drawing attention from local taxi drivers. Other protesters also blamed the authorities for not creating jobs."The big problem is that this government, by leaving people unemployed, continues to shrink the labor market and more people look to Uber as a job," Enrique Gutierrez, 56, a taxi driver for 35 years, told Reuters as he protested."So yes, we say Uber is illegal, do something about Uber. But also do something about unemployment that is fueling Uber."Uber said it supports regulations that expand the benefits of its technology. "The response and the choice of the people is clear," the company said in a statement to Reuters.On Wednesday, an Uber passenger was killed in a traffic accident in greater Buenos Aires. The company said in a statement it had activated its accident insurance protocols, which are available to all rides requested through its app. (Reporting by Cassandra Garrison; additional reporting by Miguel Lo Bianco; editing by Adam Jourdan, Bernadette Baum and Sonya Hepinstall)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Noam ScheiberIt was a potentially sweeping proposal from a Texas regulator: Companies that use a “digital network” to dispatch workers the way Uber does could label them contractors rather than employees.The proposal, made in December, was a turning point in a campaign that has played out in legislatures and courts in numerous states, and even in Washington, as Uber and other gig-economy companies have risen to prominence in recent years.Lobbyists involved in this state-by-state effort have worked behind the scenes to provide rule makers with a template. Hanging in the balance could be billions of dollars in costs, and even fundamental business models, as more gig companies move toward public stock offerings.When such companies are able to classify workers as contractors, they don’t have to contribute to unemployment insurance or workers’ compensation, or heed minimum-wage and overtime laws. Industry officials estimate that a work force of employees costs companies 20 to 30 percent more than a work force of contractors — a sum worth many hundreds of millions of dollars per year to Uber.Worker advocacy groups say the goal is to chip away at classification rules in enough places to create pressure for a broad exemption nationally.What is notable about the Texas initiative, which would apply only to unemployment insurance, is that it emerged not from a democratically elected body but from an opaque bureaucracy. There were no hearings where outsiders were questioned, no meaningful floor debates — just a few perfunctory statements at public meetings and a 30-day comment period before the agency could issue a final proposal.“This whole thing caught us by surprise,” said Jose Garza, executive director of the Workers Defense Project, a nonprofit group in Texas that helps workers fight wage theft and misclassification.For weeks, the impetus for the rule was unclear. A spokeswoman for the agency, the Texas Workforce Commission, publicly denied that it relied on “outside sources” when drafting proposals.But that narrative abruptly changed in early March when Mr. Garza’s group obtained a set of emails from the commission through a public records request. The documents, which The Texas Observer has also reported on, suggest an ambitious new phase of the campaign by gig-economy companies to solve their worker-classification problem.Emails involving one commissioner and her staff show extensive communications with lobbyists working with Tusk Ventures, a venture-capital and political-strategy firm. Tusk, in turn, was retained by Handy, a company that dispatches workers, Uber-style, to perform household chores like cleaning and repairs. The strategy firm’s founder, Bradley Tusk, was once a top political consultant for Uber and remains a large shareholder who could cash out millions in equity when Uber goes public this year.Tusk Ventures appears to have been the primary author of the Texas proposal. Large portions of the draft released by the Workforce Commission mirrored a proposal that the lobbyist forwarded to the agency one year earlier. Lisa Givens, the agency spokeswoman, said she had been unaware of the correspondence when she previously commented.And Texas is not the only place where Tusk has appealed to regulatory agencies rather than legislatures to cement gig workers’ status as contractors. According to the emails, the firm has pursued similar efforts in other states, like Illinois.Asked in an interview about the strategy of working through regulators, Mr. Tusk said, “If we believe this is the right policy, our job is to get it through, and that can be the most efficient venue.”He foreshadowed the plan in a book he published in September. “We’re working multiple angles to get this done federally,” he wrote. “And we’re working on legislation and rules in 13 more states, too.”Different state and federal laws define employment somewhat differently, but most focus on factors like whether managers exert significant control over workers, and whether the work is central to a company’s business.Uber, Lyft and Handy argue that their workers should be considered contractors because the workers decide when, where and how long they work. The companies say they are experimenting with ideas, like benefits, to improve workers’ economic security.But skeptics argue that the companies exert control through ratings that elicit certain behavior, like treating passengers courteously, and by barring drivers who cancel too many rides. Uber and Lyft also determine pay rates for drivers, something independent contractors typically decide.In recent years, courts and state and federal agencies have disagreed on this question. But there’s little debate that if courts and regulators classified large numbers of gig workers as employees, the move would be highly disruptive to companies that depend on them. Lyft, in its recent filing for an initial public offering, told prospective investors that being forced to classify drivers as employees “may require us to significantly alter our existing business model” and warned of potential “monetary exposure.”About five years ago, the gig companies began to head off this prospect. In the legislation that Uber and Lyft backed to legalize their business, they often sought provisions indicating that ride-hailing drivers are contractors. About 25 states have enacted such provisions, known as carve-outs.In other states, Uber and Lyft worked with a broader group of companies to have most gig workers who are dispatched through digital platforms, not just drivers, classified as contractors.“Let me be clear,” an Uber lobbyist announced in 2016, before an Arizona Senate committee considering such a bill. “Companies like GrubHub, Handy, Lyft, Postmates, Thumbtack, YourMechanic, TaskRabbit,” she said, were all “involved with drafting this legislation and putting it forward in over 10 states.” The measure passed soon after.One consequence of these industrywide measures is that they could affect far more than current gig workers. According to Maya Pinto of the National Employment Law Project, a nonprofit worker-advocacy group that has just published a report on the topic, the broader measures encourage companies to reclassify employees as contractors. Any business that dispatches employees — such as plumbers or electricians or nannies — could deem them contractors by using a digital interface to coordinate the work and meeting a few other criteria, Ms. Pinto said.Marla Kanemitsu of Tusk Ventures, who has helped to write such measures, said the motivation for the bills wasn’t just to preserve the contractor status of Handy’s workers, but also to allow companies to provide benefits, like health care and retirement-savings vehicles, that might otherwise suggest an employment relationship.“Providing benefits was always the driving force for this,” Ms. Kanemitsu said.In the first six months of 2018, six states passed bills broadly carving out gig workers from employment laws and effectively classifying them as contractors. Mr. Tusk’s book referred to these states as the “low-hanging fruit of Kentucky, Iowa, Tennessee, Indiana and Utah (and medium-hanging fruit like Florida).”But in other states, the fruit stood at a considerably higher altitude: The efforts came up short in Colorado, Georgia, North Carolina and California.Colorado, with a large technology sector, was perhaps the most instructive example. The state was the first to pass legislation legalizing ride-hailing companies like Uber, and a local lobbying firm involved in that effort helped spearhead this one, too. It received more than $80,000 in 2018 from Uber and Handy, according to lobbying disclosures compiled by the National Employment Law Project. The carve-out bill glided through the Republican-led Senate on a bipartisan vote last March, but it ran into resistance in the Democratic-controlled House.Legislatures, it was becoming clear, could be a political quagmire, even in states that appeared welcoming. And the urgency was increasing. Handy would be acquired by a public company in the fall of 2018. Uber planned to go public in 2019. The status of its drivers remained unresolved in all four states where the broader legislation had failed.Around the same time, however, Mr. Tusk’s firm was field-testing an alternative approach.In December 2017, Jerry Valdez, an Austin lobbyist working for Handy, contacted an assistant to one of the three commissioners on the Texas Workforce Commission.Like most lobbyists, Mr. Valdez and his colleagues assumed a posture of extreme solicitousness. They provided detailed responses to questions from the commissioner, Ruth Hughs, and her staff — like how such proposals might comport with federal law.“I am sure it will be informative regarding the matters discussed,” Ms. Hughs’s senior legal counsel replied in one email.Rarely were the lobbyists more helpful than in devising the rule itself, which would effectively expand to all gig workers an exemption that the state had already passed for ride-hailing drivers.Mr. Valdez forwarded Ms. Hughs’s assistant a draft, with the subject line “Handy proposal,” one year before the commission released its own proposal.Of the nine criteria that the Handy draft laid out for classifying gig workers as contractors, the commission adopted seven almost verbatim, then added two. The commission also hewed closely to Handy’s definition of a “marketplace platform” and “marketplace contractor,” terms of art for “company” and “worker.”Mr. Tusk, whose firm stopped working for Handy after Handy was acquired last year, said there were many advantages to lobbying state agencies for a rule change: “You’re not tied to the legislative calendar. If the head of a committee in the State Assembly doesn’t like it because they have some business owner in their district, you don’t have as much of a problem anymore.”A Handy spokesman said: “Our work in all states — including Texas — has always been conducted through appropriate channels and motivated by a desire for constructive solutions.”The process behind the Texas regulation, the final version of which will be discussed at a public meeting before the commission can approve it, appeared to stand in marked contrast to the very public debate in Colorado. Advocates on all sides there continued discussing ways to address the employment status of gig workers long after the legislation failed last spring.Labor officials, policy experts and even a representative from Uber attended a meeting hosted by a Denver think tank on how to protect gig workers from being exploited.“There’s been a commitment to figure out a true stakeholder process,” said Dennis Dougherty, executive director of the state’s labor federation.But not everybody appeared interested in an open debate. In June, when an aide to Commissioner Hughs asked the Tusk lobbyists if there were other states where regulators, rather than elected legislators, were addressing the contractor issue, one state they listed was particularly intriguing.“We are also in discussions,” a Tusk official wrote, “with Colorado.”Follow Noam Scheiber on Twitter: @noamscheiber.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersLONDON — Uber will add an additional pound to the cost of journeys in central London from next week after the city's transport authority said private hire taxi operators will no longer be exempt from the congestion charge. Most drivers entering London's central zone, spanning King's Cross in the north, the City in the east, the Imperial War Museum in the south and Buckingham Palace in the west, pay 11.50 pounds Monday to Friday during the day.Private hire firms had been exempt from the charge but regulator Transport for London (TfL) is seeking to cut the number of vehicles on the British capital city's roads, which has surged partly due to burgeoning taxi apps.TfL said in December that private hire taxi operators such as Uber and Addison Lee would have to pay the levy from April 8."To help ease the impact on driver earnings, Uber trips that start, finish or pass within that Zone will include a 1-pound Central London Fee," said Uber.

And the $60.12 close was 16.5 percent below Lyft's final IPO price of $72 and even under the low end of its initial price target range of $62 to $68.Reuters reported late Tuesday that rival Uber would seek to sell around $10 billion worth of stock in an IPO, and file the offering with regulators as soon as Thursday. Uber declined to comment for the report which cited unnamed people familiar with the matter."It's not a coincidence that the day before Uber was expected to make a filing that investors are immediately contrasting it to Lyft and Lyft looks less attractive," said Matt Moscardi, analyst at MSCI in Boston.For example, heavy betting by short sellers against Lyft may be leaving investors anxious about Lyft's valuation, Moscardi said.It could also work in Uber's favor that it is now expected to seek a valuation of $90 billion to $100 billion, below the $120 billion investment bankers previously told the company it could be worth, according to the Reuters report. Uber may also have better name recognition, said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh. "It could be that people are anticipating the Uber IPO. When you go somewhere do you Lyft? Uber has become a verb."After the close of trading on Wednesday, Lyft announced that it would release financial results for its first fiscal quarter ended March 31 after the market closes on May 7.

She had to get ready for work. Or, for what passed for work on this gray morning a month into the shutdown.On any other Thursday morning, Ms. Kelley, 51, would have been settling into her desk at the federal Bureau of Land Management’s offices in downtown Milwaukee, ensconced by office plants and the security of a federal job that Ms. Kelley believed would always provide for her and her family.But now, her office is her car. And until the government reopens, her only source of income is driving for Uber, one of a galaxy of improvised jobs and side hustles that have turned unpaid federal employees across the country into unlikely entrants into America’s gig economy.Across the country, idled federal workers and contractors are taking up last-resort jobs with ride-hailing services and delivery apps. They are flooding school districts with applications to become substitute teachers. They are taking babysitting gigs, working shifts at local gyms and auditioning for yoga-instructor slots.“It’s almost as if I’m starting over again from a teenager,” said Felicia Thompson, who started delivering takeout dinners and groceries after being furloughed last month from her public affairs job with the Department of Agriculture.Ms. Thompson, who lives in Upper Marlboro, Md., said she had two children in college, a father in the hospital with pneumonia and little savings to get by. She said she was considering paying a penalty to raid $13,000 from her retirement account to pay her mortgage, debts and other bills for a few more months.Federal workers, many of them highly educated, are limited in the type of work they can take as they wait out the shutdown. Anything connected to an employee’s area of expertise is unlikely to be allowed under federal rules, which require approval for jobs that could conflict with government work. And as the Trump administration forces thousands of furloughed employees back to work without pay, some said that job-hunting seemed pointless.[Read more about the shutdown’s uneven toll on Americans.]“Who’s going to hire me not knowing how long I’m going to stick around?” David Arvelo, a Food and Drug Administration employee and local union official in Dallas.Even the search for temp work was costing money that people did not have. In Cadillac, Mich., Debra-Ann Brabazon, a furloughed Forest Service worker, said she was paying $100 to get fingerprinted and background-checked so she could get certified as a substitute teacher. She was down to eating one meal a day. She didn’t have $100 to spare.When a friend posted that she was looking for child care, Ms. Brabazon said she leapt to volunteer in exchange for grocery money.“I was a nanny in college,” she said. “I am falling back on everything I’ve learned about how to survive.”Ms. Kelley was just trying to earn enough to buy fresh fruits and pull-up diapers for her granddaughter Avery, who is legally in her care. As she began her day as an Uber driver, she tucked Avery’s car seat into the trunk, swept up the half-eaten Cheerios the girl had sprinkled across the back seat and then propped her phone on the dashboard. She gave the Uber screen a tired smile to verify her identity, and a map popped up: “Finding Trips.”“We kind of just sit here till one comes up,” she said.An hour later, around 9:30 a.m., it felt like not a single one of the Milwaukee area’s two million residents needed a ride. Her phone showed her total haul so far: $0.00.“A lot of it is sitting and waiting,” Ms. Kelley said.On her best days driving since the shutdown began, she could make $50 or more. It was not nearly enough to replace the $1,100 she took home every two weeks from the federal government. But it was enough to help pay for car insurance, gas and the February payment on her bronze SUV. Just being out helped shake off the sadness of another morning of jobless limbo.“It gets me out of the house. It gives me a routine,” she said. “I need to function. I can’t just sit and wallow in my bed all day. I’ve got to get up.”As she headed downtown to look for riders, Ms. Kelley said she was better off than many workers — living with a roommate helped her save on her bills. But she had no savings and said that if the government did not reopen by the month’s end, she would start looking for other full-time work.She said she had always been proud of her ability to take care of things, how she raised two daughters as a single mother while she was working full-time and getting a bachelor’s in health care administration. But on Jan. 10, worried about next month’s bills, she set up a GoFundMe page, joining more than 2,000 other federal workers using the site to seek help during the shutdown.Through her windshield, she could see office workers huddling together for smoke breaks and clumped around conference tables in glassy ground-floor offices. She turned onto Van Buren Street, and there was her building where she did payroll and maintained the office equipment at a desk overlooking a parking lot.“But it’s a window. I love it,” she said. “I so want to go to the office.”She parked outside the Milwaukee Intermodal Station, hoping to snag someone getting off a train and cut the engine to save on gas. On slow days, she said she knits or reads until her phone pings with a ride.Finally, it did.“It’s only been two hours,” she said.A young man in a suit hopped in, and they drove 0.9 miles to his office at the accounting firm PWC.$3.37.After a month without work, time was starting to mush together into one long stretch. Was today Wednesday? she wondered. No. She was sleeping only four hours some nights, and said the psychological toll of the shutdown was growing. She had long since given up watching the nightly news (“too depressing”), and said she avoided talking about bills and money in front of Avery.She blamed President Trump for the shutdown, and scoffed when he said he could relate to what federal workers were going through.“You don’t,” she said.Four hours into the day, her injured right knee was starting to flare up — a sign that if she didn’t stop driving soon, she would not be able to walk without a burning pain. She had gotten just one ride, earned less than $4.“We’ll make a way,” she said. “We’ll figure it out.”Some of her co-workers were getting together that afternoon at a Middle Eastern restaurant that was offering free lunches to federal workers, so Ms. Kelley drove over. Squeezed into a booth, they talked about canceled vacations, dreading their mortgage payments and which colleagues were struggling the most.As they were leaving, one woman mentioned that she was heading to a cocktail party that evening, because there would be free food.Ms. Kelley looked up: “If you need an Uber driver, call me.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Chris Stanford(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning,We’re covering the aftermath of the arrest of the WikiLeaks founder, a flurry of news from outer space, and Uber’s coming public offering. And it’s Friday, so there’s a new news quiz.The indictment against the WikiLeaks founder that was unsealed on Thursday makes no mention of his website’s role in Russia’s interference in the 2016 election, so it remains unclear whether his arrest will answer lingering questions.Among them is what, if anything, Mr. Assange knew about Guccifer 2.0, a hacker whom U.S. officials have identified as a front for Russian operatives.Mr. Assange, bearded and bedraggled, was dragged from the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, where he had been sheltered since 2012. He was charged in the U.S. with conspiring to hack into a Pentagon computer network, as part of the process that brought WikiLeaks a trove of classified U.S. material in 2010. The narrow indictment was a relief to some of those who feared a case against Mr. Assange could undermine press freedoms. We explained those concerns.Closer look: From his beginnings as a teenage hacker in Australia, Mr. Assange has been a deeply divisive figure. Two of our reporters traced his history.What’s next: Mr. Assange indicated that he would fight extradition, and legal experts said that the process could take years. He is likely to argue that the case is politically motivated.President Omar Hassan al-Bashir lost his 30-year grip on the country on Thursday, after months of street demonstrations.But protesters’ jubilation was tempered by uncertainty about what might replace Mr. al-Bashir, 75. The military said it would lead a two-year transition, with Sudan’s Constitution suspended.Background: Mr. al-Bashir had long played up his humble origins, but even for an autocrat, he had a low reputation in the West. The International Criminal Court has accused him of playing “an essential role” in the genocide in the western region of Darfur in the 2000s. Military officials said today that they had no intention of extraditing Mr. al-Bashir and that he would be tried in Sudan.Quotable: “He’s like the spider at the center of the web — he could pick up on the smallest tremor, then deftly use his personalized political retail skills to manage the politics of the army,” one Sudan expert said.Scott Kelly, who spent 340 days on the International Space Station, experienced genetic mutations and declines in cognitive test scores. NASA reported the findings on Thursday, offering a hint at how space travel affects the body.Mr. Kelly’s twin brother, Mark, himself a former astronaut, underwent identical tests on Earth to provide a comparison. Here are four takeaways from the study.Yesterday: An Israeli moon lander appeared to have crashed. It would have been the first private spacecraft to reach the lunar surface. Separately, SpaceX successfully launched its Falcon Heavy rocket, now the most powerful in the world, for the second time. Another angle: Capturing the first image of a black hole required the work of more than 200 researchers. About 40 were women, and one, Katie Bouman, became a face for the project.Before what’s expected to be the largest initial public offering in years, the ride-hailing service said on Thursday that it had lost $1.8 billion last year, renewing questions about the sustainability of its business.

Baker in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Erin GriffithSAN FRANCISCO — Riley Newman, a former head of data science at Airbnb, set out in mid-2017 to raise a venture capital fund that would invest in a multitude of tech trends.But he quickly realized that potential investors were not interested in that kind of fund. Instead, all they wanted to hear about were his former Airbnb colleagues and whether they might start their own companies.“It was, ‘Yeah, all that stuff is fine, but Airbnb, right?’” Mr. Newman, 36, said. “Airbnb was where we had a competitive edge on the market.”So Mr. Newman and his partners at Wave Capital adjusted their pitch: They said they were creating a fund to invest specifically in Airbnb employees who were planning to leave the company to become entrepreneurs. It worked. He and his partners quickly secured $55 million and now are preparing to make a flood of investments after the $31 billion home rental start-up goes public sometime in the next year and employees cash out their shares.“We know they are planning to start companies,” Mr. Newman said of Airbnb employees, adding that in the last week alone he had heard from four who left to pursue their entrepreneurial dreams.Everyone else in Silicon Valley seems to know it, too. As Lyft, Pinterest, Postmates, Slack and Uber — among some of this decade’s most prominent start-ups — get ready to list on the stock market, investors are preparing to write checks to a new generation of companies created by their workers.It’s part of Silicon Valley’s often-incestuous circle of life. The start-up world projects a meritocratic image, but in reality, it is a small, tightknit club where success typically hinges on whom you know.In this model, employees of tech start-ups frequently leave the companies once they have been enriched by their firms’ initial public offerings. Then networks of alumni from these companies — called mafias — support their peers’ new businesses with hiring, advice and money.The cycle goes back to at least the 1950s, when Fairchild Semiconductor, one of Silicon Valley’s earliest successes, was started by a group of disgruntled Shockley Semiconductor employees called the Traitorous Eight.Decades later, early employees of PayPal, known as the PayPal Mafia, are more famous for their successes after leaving the company — many of which they collaborated on with one another — than for their initial breakthrough in digital payments. The group includes Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, as well as the creators of YouTube, Yelp and LinkedIn.Silicon Valley is now anticipating new mafias connected to Uber, Airbnb and their brethren after the companies go public.“It’s going to trigger a massive explosion in entrepreneurship,” said Howard Lindzon, an entrepreneur in Phoenix who invests in five to 10 venture capital funds a year. He said he particularly wanted to put money into funds with connections to the Uber and Airbnb networks.Venture capital firms are already hiring former employees from Uber and other I.P.O.-ready companies to get a foothold in their networks. Some of the fiercest recruiting has been of Uber executives, with venture firms including Sequoia Capital, GV, Javelin Venture Partners and Redpoint Ventures all adding former employees from the ride-hailing firm to their ranks.One recruit was Andrew Chen, who worked at Uber as head of rider growth and left the company last year. He has since joined the venture firm Andreessen Horowitz as a general partner and hosts quarterly dinners for Uber alumni turned founders.Mr. Chen, 36, estimates that two dozen venture-backed start-ups have come out of Uber so far. Andreessen Horowitz has recently invested in two, which have not been announced.“Those are the prime start-up investing opportunities,” Mr. Chen said.The problem is that venture firms might create a brain drain from the likes of Airbnb and Uber if they keep luring the companies’ workers to start new companies. Talent, after all, is a precious commodity in Silicon Valley.Jonathan Golden, who worked as a director of product at Airbnb and who joined the venture firm NEA last year, said Airbnb was fine with his plans to invest in former employees. He said he had discussed his intentions with Airbnb’s chief executive, Brian Chesky, before he left the company in 2017.“I’m not actively trying to have people leave Airbnb,” Mr. Golden said. “But if someone is going to leave, I want to be supportive of them, and Brian is supportive of them as well.”Nick Papas, an Airbnb spokesman, said, “We’re always sad when talented people move on, but it’s been great to watch so many of our former colleagues succeed.”Uber declined to comment.In February, Annie Kadavy, a former Uber executive who is now a venture capitalist at Redpoint, announced an investment in Ike, a self-driving truck company created by — who else? — ex-Uber employees.Ms. Kadavy, 33, who left Uber last year, said her network of former ride-hailing colleagues would help her find and vet deals. In addition, it would help find talent to bring to other start-ups that Redpoint has invested in.“If you’re a person leaving a company, who are you going to ask about what company to join next?” she said. “Your friend who works at a venture firm, because their job is to have a point of view on a bunch of different businesses.”In February 2018, Dan Hill and Michelle Rittenhouse, longtime Airbnb employees, felt the entrepreneurial itch and quit. They had a general idea to start a company that would make it easier for people to donate to charity, but not much else.The details didn’t matter to Wave Capital, which wanted to invest in them. “These are people we know can build great products,” said Mr. Newman. “They know us, they trust us. We know them, we trust them.”Within a few weeks of leaving Airbnb, Mr. Hill and Ms. Rittenhouse had secured $2 million — including from Wave Capital — for Alma, their newly formed company focused on philanthropy.Entrepreneurs typically make dozens of pitches over several months to raise financing. But Mr. Hill said the relatively quick fund-raising for his start-up was not a surprise.“We already had a strong relationship,” he said. “So when we pitched the idea for Alma and our initial plans, it was an easier conversation.”It’s a common story among former employees of hot start-ups. Andrew Chapin, who previously worked at Uber, also said it wasn’t hard to round up $3.75 million last October for Basis, his new mental health start-up, thanks to his reputation among the Uber crowd.“When you look at V.C., there is a lot of pattern matching and trying to act on that, so if you worked at Uber, you must be O.K.,” Mr. Chapin, 31, said. “I didn’t have to do a lot of pitching.”It helps that many of his former colleagues are now millionaires, having cashed out their shares in private stock sales.A syndicate of several hundred former Uber employees are even investing in start-ups together. Josh Mohrer and William Barnes, early Uber employees who left in 2017, said they used a private email list to manage the syndicate’s deal selection, adding a few new people to the list each week as they “graduate” from the company. The group has backed around a dozen start-ups at a pace of around one a month, they said.To stay on top of all the new companies emerging from Uber, Mr. Mohrer and Mr. Barnes said, they have organized reunions of former employees in cities around the world, using a Facebook group with more than 1,000 members.The pair also plan to raise an investment fund dedicated to backing Uber alumni under the banner of Moving Capital, according to three people familiar with the project, who asked to remain anonymous because the details are private.How will Silicon Valley’s new mafias be different from those in the past?The Uber and Airbnb networks are part of a generation that pioneered the on-demand “gig economy” and everything that came with it. That means many fought real-world policy issues in cities, as opposed to primarily dealing with the digital world.“There are just not that many places to find people who have seen that kind of scale,” said Ryan Graves, Uber’s former senior vice president of global operations and a member of the company’s board.Each city that Uber, Airbnb, Lyft or Postmates expanded into created a new set of operational, regulatory and business challenges. Regulators balked. Rival business operators resisted. Neighbors protested. And people abused the platforms, over and over.Uber managers ran each city like a mini-start-up. “If you were the general manager of San Francisco or of Atlanta, you were the C.E.O. of your region,” Mr. Chen said. “It led to a really entrepreneurial approach from everyone.”The thorniest challenge for Uber alumni may be showing that they have learned from the company’s ugly 2017, when its toxic culture of harassment, discrimination and ethical lapses was exposed.Blaine Light, a former Uber employee, said he had taken the importance of creating an inclusive culture to heart. Half of the employees at Qwick, a 20-person start-up in Phoenix that he joined as a co-founder in 2018, are women, and the staff includes a mix of races, backgrounds and sexual orientations. Mr. Light said he emphasized a culture of humility.“Uber people, in general, are looking to take what we’ve learned and make something better this time,” he said.An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misspelled the given name of one of Wave Capital’s partners.

Raquel Urtasun, who is chief scientist at Uber Advanced Technologies Group (ATG) and heads the group's unit in Toronto, spoke about the challenges for self-driving development at a Reuters Newsmaker https://www.reuters.com/newsmakers event in New York. "Self-driving cars are going to be in our lives. The question of when is not clear yet," Urtasun said. "To have it at scale is going to take a long time."The more cautious tone marks a change from three years ago, when Uber embraced aggressive tactics to turbocharge its autonomous vehicle development in a bid to get more robot taxis on the street driving more miles. The company had been seen as an industry leader in the technology until one of its autonomous SUVs killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona, in March last year.Urtasun's comments fall in line with the rest of the self-driving industry, which after much hype and bold promises has tempered expectations and pushed out timelines for deployment. The extreme technical challenges of building cars that can predict human behavior and respond appropriately proved greater than even some of the industry's brightest minds had anticipated.The progress of Uber's self-driving car unit is in the spotlight as the company prepares to kick off its initial public offering this year. Uber, whose losses before taxes, depreciation and other expenses were $1.8 billion last year, has at times spent close to $200 million in a single quarter on its self-driving unit, sources told Reuters.Uber, last valued at $76 billion in the private market, is seeking a valuation as high as $120 billion in its IPO and may kick off its investor roadshow before the end of April, Reuters has reported."It is true that when you go to an IPO, there is much more of a look into your finances," said Urtasun. "That being said, again because Uber understands that self-driving cars at scale is not something that's going to happen tomorrow, they understand the need for the science." Urtasun declined to offer any guidance on what mix of human-driven cars and autonomous cars Uber will have in the next 10 years, citing too many uncertainties in the industry."What is clear is that in a 10-year timeframe there will be a mix of both (self-driving and human-controlled cars)," she said. UBER SEEKING PARTNERSThe business of building self-driving cars is extraordinarily expensive and the timeframe to payoff is increasingly uncertain. However, some consider Uber's ability to successfully navigate the transition to autonomous vehicles as crucial to the company's long-term financial prospects. By removing drivers and adding automation, Uber will be able to pocket the full fare that passengers pay and create more efficient routes to move around people and packages.Uber opened ATG in Toronto in 2017 and named Urtasun, who is also an associate professor at the University of Toronto, as head of the Toronto organization. Uber said last year it would invest more than $150 million in Toronto to grow its self-driving car operations, open an engineering hub and expand its work in artificial intelligence. After the fatal Arizona crash, Uber removed its autonomous cars from the road, laid off hundreds of test drivers and shuttered operations in Arizona, its testing hub. Uber resumed very limited testing on public roads in Pittsburgh in December. Uber has recently taken a more collaborative approach, inviting General Motor Co's self-driving car unit Cruise and Alphabet Inc's Waymo to put their cars on Uber's ride-hailing network. Urtasun said on Monday that Uber encouraged every self-driving company to add their cars to the Uber network. "We've been very, very open that we would like every other company to be in our (autonomous vehicle) network," said Urtasun. A group of investors led by SoftBank Group Corp and Toyota Motor Corp are in talks to invest $1 billion or more into Uber's self-driving vehicle unit, Reuters reported last month.Toyota previously invested $500 million to jointly develop self-driving cars with Uber.

Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning,We’re introducing a new format. Let us know what you think at briefing@nytimes.com.We start today with signs of a trade deal between the U.S. and China, a crash report that casts doubt on Boeing’s guidance, and the rise of anti-Semitism in Europe and the U.S. President Trump met China’s special envoy at the White House but stopped short of announcing a final trade deal, saying it may take another four weeks or more to secure an “epic” trade agreement.Before the meeting, Mr. Trump said the U.S. and China were headed toward an agreement that might be “the biggest deal ever made.” There had also been hints that a summit meeting would be announced between Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping. None was.The talks are expected to continue for weeks.Points of contention: Mr. Trump’s advisers prefer to keep tariffs in place as long as possible, an arrangement the Chinese oppose. The U.S. also wants more foreign intellectual property protections.Boeing dismissed concerns about a powerful new anti-stall system on the 737 Max for months, saying pilots could avoid problems by following a checklist. Now, preliminary findings in a new crash report from Ethiopian investigators cast doubt on whether Boeing’s guidance was enough. Investigators found that pilots in the Ethiopian Airlines crash in March initially followed Boeing’s safety procedures, but were unable to regain control.Boeing’s chief executive acknowledged the role of MCAS, the anti-stall software, in the crash. “It’s our responsibility to eliminate this risk,” he said. “We own it and we know how to do it.” In the cockpit: The steps that pilots took included shutting off the electricity that allows the automated software to push the plane’s nose down, and taking manual control of the jet. They then tried to right the plane, with the captain telling his co-pilot three times to “pull up.”A centuries-old prejudice has become a section of today’s political Venn diagram, where the far right can intersect with parts of the far left, Europe’s radical Islamist fringe and even politicians from America’s two main parties.Polling suggests that anti-Semitic attitudes may be no more widespread than in the past, particularly in Western Europe. But bigots have seemingly become more brazen, creating a climate that has made anti-Semitism far more permissible and dangerous.It’s being used for political ends by ideologies that otherwise would have little overlap. That fusion is new, and dangerous, experts say.Scope: In 2018, France reported a 74 percent spike in anti-Semitic incidents compared with the previous year, with more than 500 attacks. In Germany, violent anti-Semitic attacks — there were 62 — rose by 60 percent over the same period. Many of us who summon an Uber or similar ride-shares via apps hop into the car without a second thought.But the killing of a South Carolina student last weekend has brought national attention to a rash of kidnappings, sexual assaults and robberies carried out largely against young women by assailants posing as ride-share drivers.There have been at least two dozen such attacks in the past few years, according to a tally of publicly reported cases, including instances in which suspects have been charged with attacking multiple women.The attacks show how bad actors can exploit the vulnerabilities of a ride-sharing culture that so many people trust to get them home safely.How to stay safe: Ask the driver, “What’s my name?” Check the license plate, make and model of the car. Share your trip details with a friend. You can find more ways to stay safe in our guide. The opposition Congress party has put out the first concrete policy proposal of the campaign. A caution: Trying to impose a Western prism on the elections could lead you astray.The Congress “manifesto” covers issues including social and environmental. One standout: a minimum income plan that would guarantee 72,000 rupees a year, about $1,000, to India’s poorest 20 percent.It sounds like a classic left-wing response to five years of market deregulation and austerity under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party, right?Wrong. Sure, in 2014, Mr. Modi campaigned on a promise to help business and cut back bloated government, but he rolled out his own version of a handout in February: a payment of 6,000 rupees, or about $85, for farmers, along with other sweeteners.“When it comes to the economy” in India, observed Milan Vaishnav, a South Asia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, “almost all parties are clustered around the center left.”With so many Indians still relatively poor, he said, swinging too far toward fiscal conservatism would be political suicide.So if and when the B.J.P. puts out its own policy proposal, the economic ideas may not be all that different from the Congress party’s. — Alisha Haridasani GuptaSend us feedback or questions here.Yemen: The U.S. House gave final passage to a resolution to end U.S. military assistance for the war in Yemen, sending the bipartisan rebuke of President Trump to his desk for a promised veto.France: The assault of a transgender woman during a demonstration in Paris has prompted outrage and debate about transphobic attitudes in the country. The woman, Julia, said her attackers were “simply ignorant people, who do not understand our situation.”Belgium: Prime Minister Charles Michel apologized for the kidnapping, segregation, deportation and forced adoption of thousands of children born to mixed-race couples during its colonial rule of Burundi, Congo and Rwanda. Another Brexit mess: Just a week before Britain faces a potentially chaotic departure from the European Union, a leak in Parliament sent a torrent of water into the press gallery and derailed a debate in the House of Commons. Whales: Russia is preparing to release an unprecedented number of whales, seized to keep them from being exported to Chinese marine parks. A hundred have been kept in watery pens until the plan for their release could be developed.Science: The ancient ancestors of seals lived and walked on land. Now, scientists have a few more clues about how seals first took the evolutionary dive into the oceans more than 30 million years ago.What we’re reading: This short story in The New Yorker, recommended by Gillian Wong, our editor specializing in China coverage. She writes, “Te-Ping Chen, a Wall Street Journal reporter until recently based in Beijing, imagines a pair of Chinese twins in the internet era whose lives take them in vastly different directions.”Cook: End the week with lemon cream cheese cookies.Listen: “Downhill Lullaby,” the first original song Sky Ferreira has released since 2013, veers sharply away from the armor-clad pop that filled her first album, our critic writes.Read: The movie has been rocking on Netflix, and now Mötley Crüe’s “The Dirt” appears on our paperback nonfiction and combined print and e-book nonfiction best-seller lists.Watch: King Hu directs Angela Mao in the 1970s film “The Fate of Lee Khan.” It’s a Critic’s Pick. Smarter Living: Intending to part ways with your laptop, tablet or cellphone? Provide them a second life: Sell them online, give them to people you know or donate them to nonprofits. If they’re too old to reuse, send them to a smelter to be reclaimed by “urban mining” — they’re often made of copper, silver, gold and lithium.Also, if you don’t feel like you have the time to read, try some bite-size books.The Times has been covering the Chinese government’s internment of hundreds of thousands — perhaps a million or more — of Uighurs and other Muslims in the western region of Xinjiang. We asked Chris Buckley, one of the reporters on the story, to explain the leadership’s rationale. The cost of internal strife is a major concern to China’s leaders, who have only to look to the Taiping Rebellion of the 1850s. That internal war, which claimed 20 million or more lives, remains one of the world’s bloodiest.The mass internments in Xinjiang reflect the leadership’s view that the religion and culture of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities are widely “infected” by antigovernment sentiments that could foment unrest and terrorism.Uighurs — a Turkic people — have had an uneasy, sometimes violent, relationship with the Chinese Communist authorities since 1949.In the 1980s and 1990s, the government allowed more space for the Uighurs’ language and customs. But policies became increasingly hard line, especially after ethnic rioting erupted in 2009, killing at least 200 people. In 2014, more than 30 people were killed in an attack by Uighurs in southwest China. There were many smaller-scale attacks as well.Thanks for reading the briefing in our new format.

California’s newly minted rich will be hungry for parties, houses, boats, bikes — and ice sculptures. Here comes the big one!By Nellie BowlesSAN FRANCISCO — Big wealth doesn’t come in monthly paychecks. It comes when a start-up goes public, transforming hypothetical money into extremely real money. This year — with Uber, Lyft, Slack, Postmates, Pinterest and Airbnb all hoping to enter the public markets — there’s going to be a lot of it in the Bay Area.Estimates of Uber’s value on the market have been as high as $120 billion. Airbnb was most recently valued at $31 billion, with Lyft and Pinterest around $15 billion and $12 billion. It’s anyone’s guess what prices these companies actually will command once they go public, but even conservative estimates predict hundreds of billions of dollars will flood into town in the next year, creating thousands of new millionaires. It’s hard to imagine more money in San Francisco, but the city’s residents now need to start trying.Welcomed finally into the elite caste who can afford to live comfortably in the Bay Area, the fleet of new millionaires are already itching to claim what has been promised all these years.They want cars. They want to open new restaurants. They want to throw bigger parties. And they want houses.One recent night, in a packed room with a view of the Bay Bridge and an open bar, real estate investors gathered. Standing at the front presenting was Deniz Kahramaner, a real estate agent specializing in data analytics at Compass.“Are we going to see a one-bedroom condo that’s worth less than $1 million in five years?” he asked the crowd. “Are we going to see single family homes selling for one to three million?”No, he said, not anymore. The energy rose as he revealed more data about new millionaires and about just how few new units have been built for them. San Francisco single-family home sale prices could climb to an average of $5 million, he said, to gasps.[Sign up for California Today, our newsletter for Californians and people who care about California.]“All cash. These are all cash buyers,” he said. “It’s just going to be astounding.”Now, seemingly the whole city — and not just the financial planners and the real estate agents and the protesters who block tech buses — is scrambling to prepare.As the idea of the coming I.P.O.-palooza took on currency, sellers started pulling their houses off the market. The broader California housing market has softened, and home sales are down, but here’s one fix for that. “Even if just half the I.P.O.s happen, there’s going to be ten thousand millionaires overnight,” said Herman Chan, a real estate agent with Sotheby’s. “People are like, ‘I’m not going to sell till next year, because there are going to be bajillionaires everywhere left and right.’”One of those is his client Rick Rider, a 61-year-old C.E.O. who decided not to publicly list his Bay Area house until some of the I.P.O.s have happened.“Our particular house is not a family home. It’s a Double Income No Kids sort of home,” Mr. Rider said. “So it would potentially play well for a lot of the people that would be benefiting from the I.P.O.s.”The spending wars will likely stay close to work. “The millennial tech workers are really looking for convenience,” said Christine Kim, the president of Climb Real Estate. “They seem to not want to own cars, and food deliveries are really easy now, and they want to be close to entertainment, so they’ll stay in the city.”When Google in Mountain View and Facebook in Menlo Park went public, their workers were spread across the Bay Area, and so the impact on housing was diffuse. Now, many of the biggest start-ups are based in San Francisco, in part thanks to the city’s tax breaks. Brokers say San Francisco is where the workers want to stay.In 2018 there were 5,644 properties sold in San Francisco and only 2,208 of those were single family homes. Software employees represent more than 50 percent of those buying, according to Compass. One real estate firm estimates an average one-bedroom in the city now rents for $3,690 per month. (Another firm puts that average at $3,551.)“Now you’ve got all these I.P.O.s at the same time, and we’ll potentially have thousands of young people, all now with money, looking to buy homes,” said Shane Ray, a real estate agent. “You’ll be able to feel it.”Those in the market for a house are trying to buy them fast while the inventory shrinks but before the wave hits.“I had this sense of existential dread that if we didn’t buy before all the I.P.O.s, we would forever be priced out,” said Tom McLeod, the founder of storage start-up Omni, who has been renting for nearly a decade. “We ended up pulling the trigger.”Companies instill in their employees a belief that stock only goes up. At this point, a decade since their founding, start-ups like Uber and Airbnb have been asking their employees to hold that faith for a long time. Now, wealth managers are hoping to rattle the religious.Ryan S. Cole, a private wealth adviser at Citrine Capital, said he has started getting an influx of new clients who are preparing for wealth. He is worried. This generation of the start-up wealthy seem especially bullish on their company’s success.“We’ve been trying to get them to exercise a little more caution, just because they’re so excited,” Mr. Cole said. “I don’t think a lot of them think there ever could be a downturn.”He cautions that no one can be sure how well a stock will do. A company like Uber is still dramatically unprofitable, he tries to remind his clients. So many I.P.O.s turn out to be busts. Groupon opened around $26 a share and now trades around $3; Snap opened around $27 and now trades at $9.“A lot of them are young — they’ve just seen their valuations going up forever and they don’t really understand that tech stocks are volatile,” Mr. Cole said. “And they have their managers painting especially rosy pictures of where the company is headed to get them to work harder.”Mostly, he just urges his clients not to spend too much yet.“They shouldn’t be buying boats,” Mr. Cole said. “We see a little bit of that.” Electric bikes, on the other hand, are a favorite mode of transportation for the San Francisco tech worker. Owners of the electric bike shop New Wheel say they are preparing for the I.P.O.s by ordering 30 percent more of the Stromer ST3 — the most popular configuration retails for around $7,500 — and 200 percent more of the Riese & Muller front-loader bikes, which sell for around $9,500. Michael Biggica, the founder of Pixel Financial Planning, said 2019 is the year of “pent-up demand” and that the excitement of a windfall can be intoxicating.“My role is eliminating that emotion,” Mr. Biggica said.Jonathan K. DeYoe, another private wealth adviser in the region, started working with tech clients in 1997 during the first dot-com boom. He said it was pretty exciting back then. Now, as he thinks about thousands of new millionaires coming onto the scene, he is worried about the region’s inequality.“There’s some who’ve talked about pitchforks,” Mr. DeYoe said. “And I don’t think we’ll go there, but there’s a point when that makes sense.”“It’s very visible,” Mr. DeYoe said. “This kind of wealth is very visible.”In cities like Oakland and Berkeley and San Francisco, millennials obsess over Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Twitter and attend Democratic Socialists of America meetings. But the socialist passion doesn’t seem to have impacted the city’s zeal for I.P.O. parties, which the party planning community says are going to surpass past booms.Jay Siegan, a former live music club owner who now curates private entertainment and music, is gearing up. He has worked on events for many of the I.P.O. hopefuls, including Uber, Airbnb, Slack, Postmates and Lyft.“We see multiple parties per I.P.O. for the company that is I.P.O.ing, as well as firms that are associated to them,” Mr. Siegan said. Budgets for start-up parties, he said, can easily go above $10 million. “They’re wanting to bring in A-list celebrities to perform at the dinner tables for the executives. They want ballet performers.”A popular new feature he’s noticing is clients hoping to curate their own theme concerts featuring fleets of bands. Mr. Siegan says he put on one for a 1980s loving tech executive, featuring the B-52s, Devo, The Bangles, Tears for Fears and Flock of Seagulls.In a warehouse in Concord, Calif., the I.P.O. ice sculptor is getting ready to staff up for what he says will be a long year.“It’s going to be a lot of 14-hour days,” said Robert Chislett, founder of Chisel-it, who has around 15 ice sculptors currently employed.Together, they have chiseled a full-size ice car for a tech executive’s party in Atherton and a 10-foot ice Taj Mahal for another’s swimming pool in San Jose. But, he says, I.P.O.ing executives usually want predictable things. An ice chair with the logo on the back, for photos. A lot of logos carved into ice rockets, to indicate that the company’s stock will be like a rocket. And ice cubes, for drinks, with the company logo on each one.And of course, the tech backlash, mostly quiet as stocks have vested, is preparing for its own revival.At Radio Habana Social Club in the Mission district, housing rights activists gathered one recent evening for a drink. By now, there is a well-known choreography: the cash comes flooding in to a few and the stock-less masses begin to gather. They will protest evictions, fight developers, organize against tax breaks and unfurl banners in front of tech buses.“It’s going to mean mass displacement,” said Sarah “Fred” Sherburn-Zimmer, the executive director of the Housing Rights Committee of San Francisco, of the coming wealth influx.She paused for a moment. “It feels like the same game,” she said. Activists stood elbow-to-elbow around a table of hummus and pepper jack cheese. “We’ve lived through boom times before,” said Maria Zamudio, the group’s associate director. “We’ve learned our lessons. We know what a massive influx of money looks like. Concessions we made in the past, we will not make this year.”Nellie Bowles covers tech and internet culture.

The proceeds will eventually be paid out to the nonprofit’s employees.Charity: water, which provides developing countries with clean water, has started a program to reward its employees in a potentially lucrative way modeled on start-ups.CreditCreditGabby Jones for The New York TimesSupported byBy David GellesLast year, the founder of a charity that is focused on making sure everyone on earth has clean water and a co-founder of an e-commerce mattress company met for lunch at a SoHo restaurant. As the two ate, the talk inevitably turned to start-ups.“How come at a start-up you can participate in the equity upside?” Neil Parikh, the co-founder of the mattress company, Casper, said in recalling the conversation with Scott Harrison, the founder of Charity: water. “But at a charity, you’re helping all these people, and you can’t participate in the monetary upside?”It was a quandary that Mr. Harrison, who has forged close ties with the Silicon Valley elite over the years, had been mulling for some time. Now he is doing something about it. Under a new program, start-up founders will be able to share their wealth not just with impoverished families in the developing world but also with a rather more comfortable demographic — Charity: water employees.Here’s how it works: Entrepreneurs who own sizable stakes in private companies can donate some of their equity to Charity: water. When their company goes public or is sold, some of the proceeds will be paid out as bonuses to Mr. Harrison’s staff.Already, founders and paper billionaires from Uber, WeWork and Casper have pledged at least 1 percent of their shares to the new program, which Charity: water is calling The Pool. That all but guarantees that the organization’s 78 employees will share in the spoils from some of the most hotly anticipated initial public offerings in the history of Wall Street.In the past decade, Silicon Valley titans like Jack Dorsey, Sean Parker and Daniel Ek have donated millions of dollars to the New York-based nonprofit organization, which has drilled some 38,000 wells for villagers in Ethiopia, Rwanda and other countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. But earmarking sizable donations to pay bonuses to a charity’s employees is unconventional to say the least, and could elicit backlash within the philanthropic community.“It’s very strategic to structure gifts in this way,” said Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation. “But the issue of enriching employees of the charity is potentially problematic.”Mr. Harrison, who is also Charity: water’s chief executive, said the new program was a natural extension of his efforts to recruit employees who might otherwise take jobs at Facebook, Google or Amazon.“We want to attract the best possible talent,” he said in an interview at the organization’s TriBeCa headquarters, which WeWork helped design. “But how do we compete with massages and Michelin stars?”If working for a good cause isn’t enough, now Charity: water employees can enjoy the perks of some Uber stock, too.“They’re making below-market salaries,” said Mr. Parikh, who has pledged 1 percent of his equity to the program. “In this tech boom, where a lot of their friends are participating in these I.P.O.s, why should they get left behind? It’s a win-win.”Never mind that the point of philanthropy is to give to others, not make for yourself. It seemed unjust to Mr. Harrison and his supporters that the tech-savvy millennials working at Charity: water should toil away on nonprofit salaries while their friends got rich.(Mr. Harrison’s total compensation was $325,278 in 2017, according to public filings. The organization’s “chief water officer” made $293,442. The chief operating officer made $201,261.)The program also melded with the charity’s broader mission to disrupt the nonprofit world. Mr. Harrison has already proved himself to be an innovator in marketing, fund-raising and community building. Now he wants to make his organization less like a stuffy old foundation and more like one of the Silicon Valley start-ups he relies on for funding.“We’ve been trying to reinvent and reimagine charity,” Mr. Harrison said. “The vision is to build a super transparent organization that looks more like Apple or Nike than my grandparents’ beige charity.”Before Mr. Harrison, 43, set about disrupting charity, he was a nightclub promoter. “After a decade of indulging his darkest vices,” his official biography reads, “Scott declared spiritual, moral and emotional bankruptcy.”In search of meaning, Mr. Harrison spent two years volunteering on a hospital ship off the African coast, and saw firsthand how the lack of clean water hampered health and economic development. He came back to New York and founded Charity: water in 2006, drawing on his robust social network for funding.From the outset, the organization had a knack for messaging. “They know how to brand water better than anyone,” said Mr. Walker of the Ford Foundation. “They understand the narrative about water, and they are also really good at giving you a sense of the crisis that we are in.”Among Mr. Harrison’s early innovations was encouraging people to “donate their birthdays” to his cause. Instead of receiving presents, people started asking friends and relatives to make gifts to Charity: water. The effort was a hit, and is widely mimicked by other nonprofits today.Mr. Harrison also struck up partnerships with companies including Google and Amazon. WeWork donated design expertise and furniture to the group’s headquarters.But Mr. Harrison’s signature innovation concerned how he would fund the organization. Instead of having just one pot of capital that covered everything from rent and salaries to equipment and work in the field, Mr. Harrison had two.A small group of wealthy donors, known as The Well, funds the overhead of the organization, each giving between $60,000 and $1 million a year. As a result, Charity: water boasts that 100 percent of donations received from the public go straight to programming costs.It was a savvy marketing move, but it rubbed many in the philanthropic community the wrong way.“Charity: water’s 100 percent model is largely smoke and mirrors,” said Joe Garecht, who runs a fund-raising consulting firm. “They have overhead. They have program expenses. They find donors to cover both, just like every other nonprofit on earth.”But by saying that all donations from the public go directly to program costs, Charity: water appears to be suggesting — intentionally or not — that other nonprofit organizations are less efficient.“It makes it seem to many donors like they can and should expect organizations they support to put 100 percent of their donations to programs,” Mr. Garecht said. “This is an unreasonable expectation for nonprofits. It’s not possible, and not helpful.”Nonetheless, the model has been a success. Today, there are 133 megadonors, who give a total of $11 million a year. Though many of them are tech entrepreneurs, it is a diverse group that includes Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, the venture capitalist Chris Sacca and the skateboarder Tony Hawk.In addition to funding the overhead, the top donors are granted access to Mr. Harrison’s inner circle. They are celebrated at the group’s lavish annual gala, which was held in 2017 in the Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and last year — in a nod to the group’s deep ties to Silicon Valley — in San Francisco for the first time. And many of them often travel with Mr. Harrison to Africa, enjoying made-for-Instagram moments that are shared widely on social media.Ryan Graves, a former chief executive of Uber, whose stake in the company is estimated to be worth as much as $1.6 billion and who has pledged at least 1 percent of it to Charity: water, went on a trip to Ethiopia this year.“It gives you the chills and makes you feel great,” Mr. Graves said of the experience.Miguel McKelvey, a co-founder of WeWork, whose stake in his company is worth an estimated $2.9 billion and who has also pledged at least 1 percent to Charity:water, traveled to Ethiopia with the group in 2017.“There’s nothing like seeing in real life what it’s like to bring water to a real community,” he said. Without a Charity: water well, Mr. McKelvey said, “literally a cow is peeing in the water and they are picking it up and going to cook with it.”“We all felt an obligation to help,” he said.For those with the means to donate at scale, the trips can also serve as networking events. Mr. McKelvey met another entrepreneur, Dan Teran, on his trip. Recently, WeWork acquired Mr. Teran’s company, Managed by Q.“It puts your life in so much perspective,” said Mr. Parikh of Casper, who went on a trip this year. “I can walk down to Union Square and get a smoothie anytime I want to.”After the idea-sparking lunch with Mr. Parikh and after working with HSBC to figure out how to accept private company stock, Mr. Harrison began approaching his friends with the ask.Already, start-up equity currently worth more than $50 million has been pledged to Charity: water. Besides the men from Uber, WeWork and Casper, donors include Heather Hartnett of Human Ventures and Courtney Nichols Gould, a founder of SmartyPants, a vitamin company.“It really speaks to their success in setting themselves apart with the tech world,” said David Callahan, author of “The Givers,” a book about modern philanthropy.When those shares are eventually sold, 80 percent of the proceeds will go to overhead like salaries and rent, and 20 percent will be paid out as bonuses to all employees except Mr. Harrison.“It almost has the effect of turning Charity: water into one of the tech companies,” Mr. Parikh said. “They’re participating in the capital pool of all their friends’ companies.”If all goes well, Mr. Harrison believes more perks could be on the way. “Maybe everyone gets a free mattress,” he said. “I haven’t asked Neil yet. Or we might be able to get a free gym membership for everybody.”Charity: water may be doing things differently, but it remains well regarded by many independent organizations that evaluate philanthropies, getting high marks for effectiveness and transparency from groups including Charity Navigator, Charity Watch and GuideStar.To date, Charity: water has raised more than $370 million, and claims its wells have brought clean water to nearly 10 million people.But Mr. Harrison, who approaches his work with an entrepreneurial zeal, now wants to scale up his operations, and is aiming to reach an additional 25 million people by 2025. He hopes to raise $1 billion over the next seven years, $800 million of which would go to program costs and $200 million to back-end support for field operations, rent and payroll.To accomplish as much, Mr. Harrison believes he will need to think less like a plodding foundation and more like a start-up.“We’ve always fashioned the organization as a quickly scaling business that’s trying to acquire customers,” he said.Mr. Harrison refers to donations as “revenue” and talks about key performance indicators. He is fluent in business speak and even calls himself chief executive officer, eschewing the traditional nonprofit leadership titles of executive director or president. To many of the entrepreneurs who support Charity: water, this is a big part of the appeal. He speaks their language. He’s one of them.“Scott runs it like a company,” said Mr. Graves of Uber. “It’s not a bloated, cloudy not-for-profit.”So far, it seems to be working. Charity: water’s work in the developing world draws favorable reviews even from those who question its fund-raising tactics.And while many young tech millionaires and billionaires are criticized for being insufficiently generous, Mr. Harrison is drawing them off the sidelines and putting their money to work, sometimes in the field and soon in the form of employee bonuses.“Scott and his team are trying to innovate,” said Mr. McKelvey of WeWork. “It’s an awesome exploration into the future of philanthropy.”David Gelles is the Corner Office columnist and a business reporter.

They said they believed that the man they had taken into custody, Nathaniel D. Rowland, 24, had recently lived nearby.Mr. Rowland faced murder and kidnapping charges. He was arrested early Saturday when the police found him driving a car that resembled the one Ms. Josephson had entered, said William H. Holbrook, the chief of the Columbia Police Department. The police did not say whether there was any known connection between Ms. Josephson and Mr. Rowland.The police did not share a possible motive for the killing, but Chief Holbrook asked the public to report any recent experiences of someone trying to “entice” them into a rideshare vehicle in the Five Points neighborhood, where Ms. Josephson was last seen at 2 a.m. on Friday getting into a black Chevrolet Impala.Uber on Saturday directed questions about the case to the police.The company said in a 2017 blog post that it had received reports “from cities across the country about rideshare scams.”“Unauthorized individuals may pose as rideshare drivers and target people who appear to be distracted or impaired,” the company said at the time, when it started a public safety campaign directing passengers to check that the driver and car matched the information on their apps.Ms. Josephson’s disappearance and the discovery of her body drew national attention, including from the University of South Carolina, where she was a student.“Our prayers are with the family and friends of Samantha Josephson following the devastating news of her death,” Harris Pastides, the president of the university, said in a statement. “Times like these leave me searching for words of wisdom and comfort.”On Facebook, her father, Seymour Josephson, wrote about the loss of his daughter. “It is extremely hard to write this and post it but I love her with all my heart,” he said. “I could continue to write about her but it kills me. I sit here and cry while looking at the picture and write this.”The Township of Robbinsville, N.J., where Ms. Josephson’s family lives, said in a Facebook post on Saturday that its “thoughts, prayers, boundless grief and endless support” were with them.Ms. Josephson lived with roommates in student housing, Chief Holbrook said. He said they reported her missing on Friday afternoon after they had been out together the night before but got separated and had not heard from her since.Ms. Josephson’s body was found in a wooded area off a dirt road in Clarendon County by people who were hunting turkeys, Chief Holbrook said.He said the police saw a black Chevrolet Impala around 3 a.m. on Saturday and that when they tried to stop the driver, Mr. Rowland, he got out and fled. He was arrested, and the police found blood on the car’s passenger seat and in the trunk that matched that of Ms. Josephson, the chief said.He said they had also found liquid bleach, germicide wipes and window cleaner in the car.The police did not say how they believe Ms. Josephson was killed.AdvertisementPaul Manafort’s Trail of ScandalsMy Dead Dad’s Porno TapesTen Meter TowerBetween Sound and SilenceCoal Miner to Trump: “Coal Mining Isn’t Coming Back”House Tour | Cary LeibowitzSanctuary City Hotline2011: Arab Spring‘Can The President Be Impeached?’ We Answer Your QuestionsCalving SeasonAdvertisementSupported byBy Winnie Hu[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]It is not enough that a subway fare increase could soon make traveling underground in New York City more expensive. The cost of getting around above ground is going up, too.An extra $2.50 fee will be tacked onto any yellow taxi rides in Manhattan that begin, end or pass through south of 96th street, and an extra $2.75 fee will be added for other for-hire vehicles, including Ubers and Lyfts — all before the car even starts.The new ride fees were supposed to start Jan. 1, and are intended to raise more than $1 million a day to help fix the city’s broken subway system. New York is following a growing number of states and cities, including Chicago and Seattle, that have adopted similar per-ride fees in recent years to pay for public transportation and other services.In New York, the new ride fees had been temporarily blocked at the last minute by a lawsuit filed by a coalition of taxi owners and drivers who called it a “suicide surcharge” that would drive away customers and devastate an industry already crumbling under financial pressures.Judge Lynn R. Kotler of State Supreme Court disagreed, ruling Thursday that the new ride fees could proceed, noting that the taxi coalition had not “demonstrated irreparable injury.” But she did deny a motion from the state to dismiss the lawsuit, saying that the coalition’s arguments merited moving the case forward.The $2.50 fee will raise the minimum taxi fare to $5.80 in Manhattan.Governor Andrew M. Cuomo’s office would not say when the fees would start.The new ride fees are seen as the first step in passing a comprehensive congestion pricing plan for Manhattan that would charge all vehicles a fee to drive in the busiest neighborhoods and help reduce gridlock. The fees were approved last year by the State Legislature and also included a 75-cents fee for shared car-pool services.The taxi coalition argued in its lawsuit that the fees would “drive the final nail in the proverbial coffin by making medallion taxicab rides so financially unattractive to consumers that the industry is sure to collapse in its entirety.”But lawyers for the state attorney general’s office countered that the lawsuit hurt city transit riders, and that every day the new fees went uncollected meant less money for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the subways.Patrick Muncie, a spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, said the decision was “a positive step in our efforts to find a dedicated revenue stream for our subways and buses, as well as easing congestion in Manhattan’s central business district.”But taxi owners and drivers criticized the judge’s decision, saying it would only add to their problems. Many are already struggling with enormous debt as the value of their taxi medallions — the aluminum plate that once sold for more than $1 million — has plummeted. Three taxi owners and five other professional drivers have committed suicide over the last year.“It’s a big problem — that means people will not ride in taxis anymore,” said Mahmud Hossain, 54, a yellow taxi owner and driver from Astoria, Queens. “It’s very hard.”Mr. Hossain said that he typically takes home $70 or less after a 12-hour shift, or about half of what he used to make five years ago before ride-hailing apps started taking away customers. He worries that he will take home even less now.Bhairavi Desai, the executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, said taxi drivers would feel the effect right away from the new fee. “Their income will drop immediately and force them to delay decisions over food and medicine,” she said.Ms. Desai called on the governor to hold off collecting the new fee while the lawsuit continues and said her group would lobby state legislators to pass an exemption for taxis from the new fee.“Implementing the surcharge while the lawsuit continues could put the industry in the predicament of figuring out how to refund passengers, even those who paid with cash, should the drivers ultimately win the case,” she said.With the new $2.75 fee, the cost for Uber, which has an $8 base fare in Manhattan, will also rise to a minimum of $10.75. But Uber and two other ride-app services, Lyft and Via, have supported the fees as a step toward addressing congestion and transit challenges in the city.The taxi lawsuit had argued that taxis should not be charged a “congestion tax” because their number has been capped by city law at 13,587 “to prevent an overabundance of cars and congestion,” even as Uber and other ride-app services were allowed to expand exponentially. In August, the city declared a one-year moratorium on new vehicle licenses for Uber, Lyft and other ride-app services.Mayor Bill de Blasio has supported the new taxi fee, but Meera Joshi, the commissioner of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, has said it would be “potentially devastating” for the taxi industry.David Graves, 60, a taxi driver for almost two decades, said he was frustrated that the city had created the congestion problem and was now trying to address it by turning taxis into “unpaid tax collectors for the M.T.A.”“This is my future, this is the future of the New York City taxi,” he added.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byTimes readers share some close calls and offer advice for protecting yourself. By Lela MooreRide-share companies are facing increased pressure to ensure their users’ safety and to provide better identification for their drivers after the death of Samantha Josephson, a University of South Carolina student who was killed last weekend after she got into a car she believed was her Uber. The Times’s Jack Healy reported Thursday about other incidents in which ride-share users, mostly young women, have been assaulted, kidnapped or robbed by someone posing as a driver. Uber sent an email to customers on Thursday imploring them to “Check your ride, every time.”We asked readers to share their stories of scary experiences with ride-share services. We heard from passengers and legitimate drivers alike, who offered advice for navigating these frightening situations. In some cases, drivers who don’t work for ride-share companies said they have been startled by would-be passengers trying to get into their cars. Here are some of those responses, which have been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.I was lucky! A few years ago I was visiting New York and decided to use the Uber app I had read about to go to the Metropolitan Opera. I stood on the curb outside my hotel looking at my phone as a Lincoln Town Car pulled up. “Are you my Uber?” I naïvely asked.“Yes. Yes. Get in.” When we arrived at Lincoln Center the driver asked for $20. “Doesn’t this go on my account?” I handed him the money and stepped out of the car, somewhat puzzled by my first Uber experience. Later, when I checked my voice mail, my real Uber driver said, “I am here at the Carlyle Hotel … ”I have since learned to verify all the driver details before getting in a car. — Kathryn Ryder Boussemart, 63, Palm Beach, Fla. I was leaving a club in a desolate part of the city in the small hours of the morning and got into the only car waiting on the block thinking it was my Lyft. The guy had a box of doughnuts in the back and I told him I would move them and started small talk. Before we got to the end of the block he stopped and said, “I am not your driver,” so I got out, in shock. I probably would have figured it out myself within the next couple of minutes but whoa was that a close call! I am increasingly choosing to drive myself if I can chance the parking situation in the city, which I increasingly do since it is a much better experience than rolling the dice with a Lyft/Uber. On that note, this urban dweller will not be relinquishing her car anytime soon. — Julia V., 33, San FranciscoI’m currently studying abroad in the Dominican Republic. It’s actually quite common here for the car to not match what the app says; people borrow their friend’s cars, or drivers have their original account suspended so they share a profile with a friend. My tactic is to always check that they have my profile up on their phones. There was a ride I took where the driver canceled the trip on the app as soon as we got in the car (I don’t have data service here so I didn’t find this out until I got to Wi-Fi) and drove us around the city, ignoring our directions. He charged us three times the average toll, and Uber can’t do anything about this since the trip was technically canceled. If I could do it over again, I’d get out of the car as soon as I suspected he was trying to scam us. It’s hard to know when you’re doing the right thing in such an intimidating situation. — Liz Roberts, 21, Saratoga Springs, N.Y.Recently, I decided to try a Lyft in Sunny Isles Beach, Fla., where I vacation. When the car arrived, there was already one female passenger. I noted that the license plate did not match the plate indicated on the app, and pointed this out to the driver, who said, “Sometimes I drive a different car.” His face did match the app photo. He pulled away and should have driven straight west. However, he left course and drove to a less populated industrial area. I asked him where he was going. He said, “To pick someone else up.” Four miles later, I told him to “let me out of the car.” The other female passenger did not speak English and she agreed this felt “wrong in some way.” I didn’t want to leave her alone. The uncommunicative driver said he “couldn’t find his pickup” and wanted me to calm down. I said, “I do not like this.” I pretended to be on a phone call with a loved one (a very protective and angry loved one), describing the area, giving the license plate, the driver’s name and street names.He did not slow down but did turn around and head to the most direct route. What should have been simple turned into something else. Immediately following I contacted Lyft and asked them to respond to my concerns. What I got was a standard email that dismissed my concerns. The email said, “OOPS that’s on us” and “sometimes our drivers are asked to pick up … ” Not what I expected. The Lyft response was unacceptable and made me rethink this whole Lyft/Uber thing. — Rebecca Krueger, 53, Bay Village, Ohio After parking my car recently, a young woman jumped in the back seat thinking I was her Uber ride. She was so careless that she did not even notice I had no Uber decal. After some confusion on both our parts, she spotted her actual Uber ride, apologized and jumped out. Her Uber ride car was not even the same color as mine. I hope this horrible story will get people to be a lot more careful, but ride-share companies need to come up with solutions not only for people who are paying attention, but those who are not. It is very easy to get distracted when you are with a group having fun and in many other scenarios. — Michael Rodriguez, 55, Corvallis, Ore. I am a driver. I can’t tell you how many times people try to hop in my car without looking and think I am their driver. There are bad actors out there, and you are the first person responsible for your safety. I can go on with hundreds of stories, but I am going to leave the ladies here some advice.If you are in a situation where you actually have someone who you think may not be a legitimate driver, fake it that you are receiving a phone call. Act extremely upset that your loved one was just rushed to a hospital. Tell the driver to bring you straight to the local emergency room. Now why do you ask about the emergency room? Simple, they are open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. There are always people there, and there is almost always a cop stationed there. Go inside and wait for the driver to leave, and then order a new car. — Matthew J. Andras, 48, Atlantic Highlands, N.J. Unfortunately, I regularly experience men telling me that they are my Uber driver when I am waiting for an Uber in Boston. It usually happens when I am waiting alone for an Uber outside of a bar or other highly trafficked spot. I have never gotten into one of these cars and I am fortunate that the first time that it happened I was walking where I needed to go and hadn’t called for a ride-share. — Sara Goldman, 22, Boston This happens to young women far more often than is reported. I had a similar situation in 2016 in Washington, waiting for an Uber on Wisconsin Avenue (in a well-lit, wealthy area). As my Uber X was supposed to arrive, a black car pulled up like clockwork. The driver rolled down the window and said he was my ride. As I was about to open the door and get in, something didn’t feel right. I hesitated and checked my app to make sure it was my car. He became increasingly insistent that he was my ride, and that he could give me a ride to wherever I want to go. Thankfully I realized he wasn’t an Uber driver and politely declined his ride. Unfortunately, at the time, I didn’t know this was a growing problem and didn’t know how to report it. Predatory drivers are scanning the sidewalks seeking women waiting for Ubers, even in areas you wouldn’t expect. — Amy Casey, 23, Brooklyn, N.Y.

The ride-sharing company leads a stampede of other highly valued private tech companies that plan to go public this year, including its archrival, Uber, as well as Slack, Pinterest and Postmates.But Lyft’s filing also raised questions about the financial health of the tech companies that are planning I.P.O.s. Its filing revealed that while it was growing quickly, its losses were widening. Last year, the company’s revenue totaled $2.2 billion, while it lost $911.3 million.“We have a history of net losses, and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future,” Lyft said in the filing, adding that it expects to spend more as it expands into new offerings and locations.The prospectus is the first time that Lyft has made extensive details of its finances publicly available. Its public offering is being led by JPMorgan Chase, Credit Suisse and Jefferies. Lyft did not disclose the market valuation it is seeking from public investors; it was last valued at $15.1 billion by private investors during a financing round in June.[Lyft and Uber said to offer drivers a chance to participate in I.P.O.s.]Lyft filed confidentially to go public in December, the same day Uber did. Both companies are dueling to hold their offerings ahead of the other, in an attempt to be the first publicly traded ride-hailing company. But the onus has mostly been on Lyft to get out first because Uber — estimated to go public at a valuation of as much as $120 billion — would potentially steamroll its much smaller rival.Both companies are set to face questions about when and how they will become profitable. The ride-hailing business is inherently expensive because companies typically pay incentives to recruit drivers and offer discounts to riders. In addition, the companies are spending heavily to grow in areas such as autonomous driving and bike sharing.In 2018, Lyft’s revenue more than doubled to $2.2 billion from $1.1 billion in 2017, according to its filing. But losses mounted, rising to $911.3 million last year from $688.3 million in 2017, though they declined as a percentage of revenue. Total costs and expenses were $3.1 billion in 2018, up 77 percent from $1.8 billion in 2017.Uber, which has disclosed its finances for several years even though it is not public, said in February that it lost $842 million in the final quarter of 2018 on revenue of $3 billion. The firm has been trying to turn its image around after a series of scandals involving its workplace culture and onetime hardball business tactics.Lyft also said 18.6 million people took at least one ride in the last quarter of 2018, up from 6.6 million in late 2016. And based on estimates by the Japanese e-commerce company Rakuten, which is an investor in Lyft, the company said it had a 39 percent share of the ride-sharing market in the United States, up from 22 percent in 2016.“Two years ago, I definitely viewed Lyft as a second-tier player,” said Jay Ritter, a professor of finance at the University of Florida and an I.P.O. expert. “But Uber’s problems with bad publicity, a lot of self-inflicted stuff, really benefited Lyft.”Matt Kennedy, a senior I.P.O. market strategist at Renaissance Capital, which provides institutional research on public offerings, said that it was possible Uber would bite back and that Lyft’s growth would decline.“The number of I.P.O.s that we’ve seen with $2 billion in revenue and growing at 100 percent are few and far between,” he said.Founded by Logan Green and John Zimmer in 2007, Lyft was initially called Zimride and focused on pooling riders for long-distance trips. By 2012, the pair had renamed their company Lyft and shifted the business to providing brief local trips, mimicking taxi rides.The company presented itself as a genial alternative to Uber. In its early days, Lyft encouraged drivers to strap fuzzy pink mustaches to their front bumpers and to greet riders — who often sat in the front seat — with fist bumps. Although Lyft has since lost the furry fender ornaments, it has maintained its softer image.On Friday in its prospectus, Lyft continued to emphasize that image as giving it an edge. In a founders’ letter, Mr. Green and Mr. Zimmer wrote that their focus on doing the right thing provided them with a “lasting competitive advantage.”Unlike Uber, which has operations across the globe, Lyft operates in the United States and Canada. It has matched Uber’s efforts to develop self-driving cars and has also expanded into short-term bike and scooter rentals.The company also disclosed that it planned to have two classes of stock: Class A shares, which carry one vote each, and Class B shares, which carry 20 votes apiece. Lyft plans to sell only Class A shares in its public offering.Mr. Green and Mr. Zimmer, who could become billionaires from the offering, each own millions of shares of Class B stock, giving them significant control over the company. In having separate classes of shares — and letting its founders have more power than other shareholders — Lyft is following a well-worn tech company tradition, one adopted by Facebook, Snap and others.“Lyft has the opportunity to deliver one of the most significant shifts to society since the advent of the car,” Mr. Green and Mr. Zimmer said in their founders’ letter. “We do not take that lightly, and we intend to lead this shift with integrity, humanity and strong execution.”Among Lyft’s biggest investors are Rakuten; General Motors; Fidelity, the investment management giant; Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital firm; and Alphabet, the parent of Google, according to the filing.One group that helped build Lyft — its drivers, who are independent contractors — will not share much in the public offering spoils since they do not own stock in the company. Lyft is now working on a cash program to give some drivers money to buy its stock at the time of the I.P.O. The company intends to give $1,000 each to drivers who have completed 10,000 rides for the service; those who have done 20,000 rides will receive $10,000.Follow Kate Conger and Michael J. de la Merced on Twitter: @kateconger and @m_delamerced.Kate Conger reported from San Francisco, and Michael J. de la Merced from London.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Erin Griffith and Michael J. de la MercedSAN FRANCISCO — When Jennifer Tejada, chief executive of PagerDuty, decided to take the software company public, she wanted to avoid this week. The stock market closes on Good Friday, and many people are on spring break. She had also feared being drowned out by a horde of other tech initial public offerings.“I remember saying, ‘I hope we don’t get run over by the ‘unicorn’ stampede,’” she said, using the term for private companies valued at more than $1 billion.Pinterest, a digital pin board company that is also going public, wanted to beat Friday’s holiday, according to a person familiar with the situation. It wound up scheduling its I.P.O. for Thursday — the same day that Zoom, a video conferencing company, will list its shares.And Lyft and Uber, the ride-hailing companies, decided to leave breathing room between their I.P.O. filings so as not to run into each other, said two people familiar with the deliberations, who were not authorized to speak publicly. When Lyft filed first, Uber gave itself a 30-day cushion before revealing its own prospectus last week.The maneuvering is the result of what promises to be a blockbuster year for tech public offerings. With a glut of prominent start-ups coming to market all at once, the companies, their bankers and the stock exchanges face a conundrum: Who goes when?I.P.O.s are generally a crowning moment that validate years of work. So companies approach the day as something more than a financial transaction — it is also a coming-out party, a branding event and a celebration. And it is a time when the companies do not want to share the spotlight.“Most of these companies have been private for 10-plus years, and it’s a huge moment,” said Nelson Griggs, president of the Nasdaq Stock Exchange, who oversees new listings. “Having their own day is important.”The investment banks that manage the I.P.O.s have been working to space out prominent offerings by a few weeks so companies don’t step on one another’s toes, according to three bankers, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential client matters.The biggest concern has been steering clear of the week that Uber goes public, they said. Its market debut next month is expected to be the largest since 2014, and the company has told some of its investors that its stock sale might value it at up to $100 billion. That would leave little attention for any other company.Many companies that plan to list their shares this year are racing to do so in the first six months, to sidestep any potential economic or market downturn. In January, they had to put their I.P.O. plans on ice for a time because the partial government shutdown affected the Securities and Exchange Commission, the agency that reviews public offering prospectuses.Yet even if the stock market and economy remain strong, excitement over I.P.O.s is likely to fade as the year goes on, especially with so many listings on the docket.“There could end up being I.P.O. fatigue because it is going to be overwhelming,” said Barrett Daniels, a partner at Deloitte who focuses on I.P.O. advisory work.If all of the large private tech companies that might be candidates for offerings went to market, they could issue over $100 billion in new stock, said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital, which tracks I.P.O. data. That would surpass 2000, the peak of the dot-com era, when companies raised $96 billion.So much new stock could prove difficult for the market to absorb. “I do think there’s going to be some potential indigestion,” Ms. Smith said.Mr. Daniels of Deloitte said, “We’ve never seen so much money be requested in a single year.” He added, “We’re in uncharted waters.”Josh King, vice president for communications at the New York Stock Exchange, said it was capable of handling multiple I.P.O.s and had twice hosted seven on the same day. There is only one finite resource that the exchange must manage for all of the offerings flooding into the market: the opening and closing bell ceremonies, when companies ring in and close out the day’s trading. Still, plenty of slots are available, he said.Many companies use the bell-ringing ceremonies as a branding moment. When Lyft went public last month on the Nasdaq stock exchange, its top two executives, Logan Green and John Zimmer, rang the opening bell from a newly opened support center for its drivers in Los Angeles. Pink confetti rained down, and the celebratory image was instantly memorialized.PagerDuty, which is based in San Francisco and makes software that helps companies respond to complaints and other incidents, was founded in 2009. It became a unicorn, valued at $1.3 billion by private investors, in 2018. On Thursday, it went public on the New York Stock Exchange.PagerDuty did not want to miss the opportunity to stand out on its first day of trading, so it brought Pagey, a smiling, bug-eyed, neon green cardboard-and-felt company mascot, to the New York Stock Exchange’s trading floor. Pagey frolicked around and photo-bombed CNBC interviews with Ms. Tejada.Transporting Pagey across the country from its home in San Francisco was not easy. The bulky mascot suit couldn’t be flat-packed into a FedEx box. Ms. Tejada said PagerDuty’s executives had contemplated buying Pagey a plane ticket.“We held our breath a few times when we didn’t know if he-she-they would make it on time,” Ms. Tejada said. (Pagey has no gender.) But she was determined to get the mascot to the trading floor to help show off PagerDuty’s lighthearted company culture. The company eventually packed Pagey in a customized box and shipped it via courier.In the end, Ms. Tejada’s concerns about being overshadowed by other tech offerings were moot. PagerDuty’s stock soared nearly 60 percent on its first day of trading.The company picked the right date for its listing. Minutes after the market closed that day, Uber unveiled its I.P.O. prospectus — and attention immediately shifted.Follow Erin Griffith and Michael de la Merced on Twitter: @eringriffith and @m_delamerced.Erin Griffith reported from San Francisco, and Michael J. de la Merced from London.

The regional government there said late Tuesday that it would ban ride-hailing companies from carrying passengers who booked less than an hour in advance, a proposal that has left Uber and others threatening to suspend services.By noon, the authorities in Madrid said that 11 people had been injured in clashes in the capital on Wednesday, including five police officers.King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia were ushered into the opening of Madrid’s annual tourism fair though a side entrance under heavy escort, as police officers charged against drivers who burned tires and containers to block road access.Outside, some protesters urged the queen, a former television presenter, to support them, shouting, “Letizia, your granddad was a taxi driver!”The confrontations reflect not only labor tensions caused by the growth of ride-hailing and other gig economy businesses but also a wider wave of popular anger in Europe: Many of the striking drivers wore yellow vests, echoing recent protests in France and elsewhere.In recent days, some of the taxi protests have turned violent in Barcelona, where a few drivers have attacked and damaged vehicles operated by Uber and its main Spanish rival, Cabify. In Madrid, one taxi driver was hospitalized after a ride-hailing vehicle drove into him.At Madrid’s airport on Wednesday morning, some visitors were unpleasantly surprised to find the taxi stand filled with locked, empty vehicles, while striking drivers and airport workers instructed them to go back inside the terminal and join the lines at its subway ticket machines.“I expected the flight to be tiring, but not the trip from the airport to downtown,” said Jack Miller, who was visiting from Los Angeles. “It’s not the best start, but it shouldn’t be enough to ruin my stay.”The course of the various strikes was complicated by conflicting official responses, with regional and national politicians accusing each other of intensifying the problem.Taxi drivers also paralyzed traffic in Madrid last summer, and the incoming Socialist national government promised new legislation on ride hailing. But the outcome was a government decree, adopted in September, that allowed Uber and others to continue operating within cities at least until 2022, but asking regional politicians to set the exact rules under which they would cohabit with taxis.In Barcelona on Wednesday, unions representing drivers were split on whether to accept the Catalan regional government’s one-hour delay proposal for ride-hailing pickups — increased from an initial offer of 15 minutes — and call off their strike.In Madrid, the president of the regional government is a conservative, Ángel Garrido, who on Wednesday accused the Catalan authorities of returning their region “to the Middle Ages” by making inappropriate concessions.“What Catalonia is doing with this seems to me exactly the opposite of what should be done,” Mr. Garrido told reporters. “Madrid will maintain its image of freedom and respect for competition, because that is also how citizens want it to be.”He also called on Madrid’s far-left mayor, Manuela Carmena, to step into the dispute, while blaming the Socialist government for staying on the sidelines after handing over “this hot potato” last September.Juan Galiardo, the director of Uber in Spain, told Spanish news media that about 3,000 of its drivers in Barcelona risked losing their jobs, and that his company would instead focus on other cities more favorable to its offering.If Barcelona implements the one-hour booking rule, “we will have no other alternative than to suspend our services,” Mr. Galiardo said. “It makes our product completely unviable.”Follow Raphael Minder on Twitter: @RaphaelMinder.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Mike Isaac and Kate CongerSAN FRANCISCO — When Logan Green, chief executive of the ride-hailing service Lyft, was asked which tech leaders he admired, he pointed to three men who had built their companies ruthlessly: Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos.“A lot of other Silicon Valley companies are very scared to get their hands dirty with operations,” Mr. Green said in a 2017 interview with The New York Times, adding that he wanted to emulate the take-no-prisoners methods of Mr. Musk, Mr. Zuckerberg and Mr. Bezos.The problem for Mr. Green is that Lyft seems very nice. Its app is pink. Its cars were once adorned with fuzzy bubblegum-colored mustaches. Its drivers have a reputation for being friendly. And while Lyft has racked up more than one billion rides and become a strong No. 2 to Uber in the United States and Canada, it has not shaken off its cuddly image.Now Mr. Green, 35, must show that Lyft can be as assertive as an Amazon or a Facebook. He and Uber are locked in a race to take their companies public: Both filed papers in December to list on the stock market in the coming months. The offerings — the first for any ride-hailing firm — are likely to create a bonanza of riches in Silicon Valley and set the stage for listings of other highly valued tech start-ups, including Slack and Pinterest.The pressure is on Mr. Green to get the jump on Uber. (Both offerings have been stalled because the government shutdown, which ended Friday, prevented the Securities and Exchange Commission from reviewing their filings.) Lyft, which was last privately valued at $15.1 billion, is tiny compared with its rival and could be overshadowed if Uber debuts first. Uber could go public at a $120 billion valuation.For Mr. Green, this means he may have to give up some up his reserve and step into a more public role. While Lyft’s more gregarious president, John Zimmer, his No. 2 for the last 12 years, has frequently handled the public-facing side of the business, Mr. Green would rather speak at staff meetings than at tech conferences. Colleagues describe him as reserved.In a 2017 interview, Mr. Zimmer said Mr. Green was often misunderstood because of his quiet demeanor. “He is, like, extremely competitive,” Mr. Zimmer, now 34, said. “He has been an activist.”Lyft declined to make Mr. Green or Mr. Zimmer available for new interviews, citing the quiet period before an initial public offering. In a statement, the chief operating officer, Jon McNeill, described them as “cutthroat missionaries in service of creating positive change.”One of the tech leaders Mr. Green cited as inspiration, Mr. Musk, recommended against taking Lyft public.“The current system makes long-term value creation and product innovation difficult,” Mr. Musk, chief executive of Tesla, wrote in an email last week. “It insists on quarter-by-quarter results or punishes companies severely. This is particularly bad for companies that are high growth and are valued on potential, like Lyft (or Tesla).” (The S.E.C. fined Mr. Musk  last year for a tweet about taking Tesla private.)Mr. Green, who was born and raised in Culver City, Calif., graduated from the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 2006 with a degree in business economics. He then worked as the university’s sustainability coordinator, poring over alternatives to the gas-guzzling one-car-per-owner model. He was also on the board of the Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District, a position that gave him insight into municipal transportation.While visiting Zimbabwe on vacation during his 20s, Mr. Green said in the 2017 interview, he was inspired by Zimbabweans who had created makeshift services to fill every seat in car pools, saving passengers money and taking cars off the road.So in 2007, Mr. Green started Zimride in Santa Barbara, Calif., to provide long-distance car-pool rides to college students by matching them with other students who were driving.Mr. Zimmer, then working at Lehman Brothers, noticed posts about the start-up on Facebook from John Siegel, whom he had met while studying abroad and who had attended middle school with Mr. Green.“John didn’t have this technical or programming background, but he was this really impressive guy,” Mr. Siegel said. “I thought they could work together well.”Mr. Green and Mr. Zimmer, who remained in New York, embarked on what Mr. Zimmer called a “long-distance relationship,” working together over Skype. In 2008, they moved to a two-bedroom apartment in Palo Alto, Calif. Neither drew a salary in the first three years of building Zimride, and each contract they sold to a college was celebrated with a trip to Ikea for Swedish meatballs, Mr. Zimmer said.In 2011, Zimride raised $6 million. But as a web service, it was caught flat-footed by the rise of smartphones and mobile apps. In 2012, Mr. Green decided to spin out of Zimride a mobile, peer-to-peer ride-hailing service, calling it Lyft.Instead of just pairing students for long-distance rides, Lyft would put drivers together with riders on public streets, in real time. Mr. Zimmer came up with the idea to emblazon the cars with pink mustaches; Mr. Green encouraged passengers to greet their drivers with a fist bump, to keep the community feeling of Zimride.At the time, ride-hailing wasn’t legal, and only licensed drivers could pick up passengers on public streets. Ann Miura-Ko, a partner at the venture capital firm Floodgate, who had invested in Zimride and sits on Lyft’s board, recalled that some board members had been doubtful about the change — but that Mr. Green had been confident.“Someone asked, ‘Will this really work?’ And he wasn’t just sure, he was positive,” she said.But Mr. Green didn’t reckon with one issue: Uber. At the time, Uber, run by Travis Kalanick, had positioned itself as a luxury service for the wealthy that used only licensed drivers, unlike Lyft’s lower-cost service. In 2013, Uber published a white paper outlining the risks of peer-to-peer ride-hailing, a way to elbow Lyft out of the market.“They were trying to get the whole category shut down behind the scenes,” Mr. Green said. “They didn’t want competition.”Uber officials met with California regulators about the matter. As for Mr. Green, several current and former regulators and lawmakers who oversee ride-sharing in California said they had never worked with him, because Mr. Zimmer was often the one who communicated with officials.“Truth be told, I’ve never heard of him,” said Aaron Peskin, a San Francisco supervisor who called for crackdowns on Uber and Lyft in their early years and negotiated a new per-ride tax with Uber and Lyft last summer.Mr. Kalanick eventually moved Uber into non-luxury ride-sharing with no licensed drivers, the same as Lyft. He and Mr. Green quickly became bitter rivals. When Mr. Green was set to introduce Lyft’s car-pooling product in 2014, Uber announced the same service first.That same year, Uber considered buying Lyft. Over dinner at Mr. Kalanick’s home in San Francisco, the Uber chief laughed at Mr. Zimmer’s high asking price. No deal was struck.An Uber spokesman declined to comment. A spokesman for Mr. Kalanick didn’t return a request for comment.While Mr. Kalanick went on to raise billions of dollars in funding for Uber, Mr. Green relied on Mr. Zimmer’s Wall Street knowledge and showman personality to garner investments from venture capitalists and others. In total, Lyft has raised close to $5.1 billion, compared with Uber’s roughly $14 billion in equity.In 2017, Mr. Kalanick was ousted from Uber after a series of scandals. Mr. Green seized the moment, billing Lyft as a kinder, gentler network. Ridership surged, with Lyft taking a share of up to 35 percent in some American cities.More recently, Lyft has ventured into self-driving cars, offering autonomous rides in Las Vegas. It also acquired Motivate, the largest bike-share operator in the United States, giving Lyft a dominant position in an emerging transportation market.In the 2017 interview, Mr. Green said he was far from done.“As an entrepreneur, you always kind of want what you’re pitching to sound somewhat off the wall,” he said. “You’re trying to pitch the future that doesn’t exist, and you want it to be — it needs to be — a little bit of a stretch.”Follow Mike Isaac and Kate Conger on Twitter: @mikeisaac and @kateconger.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Mike Isaac and Kate CongerSAN FRANCISCO — In a rush to beat its rival Uber to the public market, Lyft is preparing to start trading in early April, according to two people familiar with the company’s plans.Lyft intends to begin its roadshow, in which it meets with investors to talk up the initial public offering, the week of March 18, the two people said. Companies usually start trading a week or so after a roadshow.If Lyft wins this race, it will be the first ride-hailing company to go public. The two companies have been locked in a competition to go public, with Lyft facing pressure to be first to avoid being overshadowed by Uber, which is much larger.The start-up, founded in 2007 by Logan Green and John Zimmer, is one of several tech companies pushing to go public early this year. Slack and Pinterest are among the others.Lyft and Uber declined to comment.Lyft and Uber have competed fiercely for riders and drivers since their earliest days, often introducing copycat services within days of each other. In keeping with that tradition, both filed to go public with the Securities and Exchange Commission on the same day in early December.The review of their filings stalled briefly when the government partially shut down later that month. The review process may take longer for Uber than for Lyft, because Uber is involved in several secondary businesses, like food and freight deliveries. Uber and Lyft both operate bike and scooter services, as well as self-driving car development wings.Lyft will list on the Nasdaq and expects to be valued between $20 billion and $25 billion, according to the people familiar with the company’s plans. The details about Lyft’s pending roadshow were first reported by Reuters.The Lyft listing is a win for Nasdaq, which struggled to attract tech companies after the exchange suffered delays and technical issues during Facebook’s I.P.O. and faced tough competition from the New York Stock Exchange for tech debuts. In the aftermath of the Facebook fumble, tech firms like Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, Square, and Twitter went public on the Big Board.Lyft was last valued by private investors at $15.1 billion, and has selected JPMorgan Chase to lead its public offering.Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting from London.AdvertisementUnicorn companies like Lyft are finally going public, after large gains have been captured by elite early investors.CreditCreditIllustration by Andrew Sondern/The New York Times; Photographs by Thom Baur/Reuters and Christie Hemm Klok for The New York TimesSupported byBy Matt Phillips and Erin GriffithThe latest generation of Silicon Valley start-ups is now sprinting to the public markets, raising hopes among large and small investors eager to invest in these high-profile, fast-growing firms. But the class of 2019 is far different from its predecessors. These companies, including gig economy darlings like Uber and Lyft, are generally older and larger, powered for years by billions of dollars of private money that has reshaped the start-up world.The additional maturity of the companies may curb wild swings — both big gains and big losses — for new investors. But it could also mean that the companies’ fastest phases of growth are behind them. As a result, there is an increased risk that in this wave of tech I.P.O.s, an elite group of investors, like sovereign wealth funds and venture capitalists, will grab a larger share of the winnings compared with new investors.“Individual investors are going to get in too late,” said Jason DeSena Trennert, managing partner at Strategas Research Partners, a markets and economic analysis firm. “They’re going to be the last investors in, and that’s the concern.”[Lyft’s shares soared on Friday when it began trading on public markets.]The change reflects a large-scale shift in the way that American entrepreneurs raise money to build their companies. Instead of quickly turning to the public markets and the scrutiny that comes with that, as Amazon and Google did, they are building huge businesses over the course of many years on the back of private money, and with fewer demands for financial disclosures.Uber, the giant ride-hailing company, has raised more than $20 billion over the last decade. Lyft, its smaller rival, which priced its I.P.O. late Thursday at $72 a share and is expected to start trading on the Nasdaq Friday, raised $4.9 billion over seven years.Many start-ups in earlier waves — back to the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, when Amazon was listed on the Nasdaq — went public just a few years after their founding. Some, like Pets.com, had tiny amounts of revenue, and now exist only in Silicon Valley lore. A combination of policy changes and vast new riches in the tech industry has been changing the equation for start-ups for more than a decade. Mutual funds and hedge funds — the typical investors in a start-up’s I.P.O. — began buying stakes in large private companies as a way to build up larger stakes before the new businesses went public. Other big investors joined in, including large sovereign wealth funds and the outsize SoftBank Vision Fund, creating an even hotter market. Venture capital investments into United States-based companies grew to $99.5 billion in 2018, the highest level since 2000, according to CB Insights, a company that tracks start-ups.Those investments have driven valuations of start-ups to unusual heights. There are now at least 333 so-called unicorns, companies valued at $1 billion or more, according to CB Insights. In 2014 there were around 80.Lyft has a private valuation of more than $11 billion. So does Pinterest, another company in the process of going public. That is roughly the market value that public investors put on the retailer Kohl’s and the online trading firm E-Trade Financial.

Vertical scale is adjusted to orders of magnitude, making percentage differences comparable.Source: RefinitivBy Karl RussellUber, the largest of the private companies expected to head for the stock market this year, has a private-market valuation of more than $70 billion. In public markets, that’s roughly the same size as corporate giants such as Goldman Sachs and CVS Health. Matt Murphy, a partner at Menlo Ventures, a leading venture capital firm, said the higher valuations and larger investments correlate with bigger opportunities created by smartphones and cloud computing. “The magnitude of the audiences that can be reached and the monetization per user has grown,” he said. “Their growth potential is much higher than was previously anticipated.”Some industry groups and investors who urge fewer regulations say the emphasis on the private markets is an outgrowth of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the federal law passed in 2002 that tightened accounting rules for public companies after the accounting scandals of the early 2000s. Besides raising disclosure requirements and other changes, the law required top executives to attest to the accuracy of corporate financial statements. Some say those higher costs to guarantee compliance can dissuade smaller companies from going public. Private companies, by comparison, can operate with far less disclosure. They are under no obligation to file quarterly earnings updates or audited annual financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Nor are they required to broadly distribute updates on business developments to the public. Others say the decline in public offerings began before Sarbanes-Oxley passed. They attribute the change to a wave of federal deregulation, which made it easier to raise money and sell companies privately. Lighter antitrust enforcement set off a boom in mergers and acquisitions, allowing smaller firms to sell to bigger companies instead of going public. At the same time, new laws made it easier for private companies to sell securities to qualified investors around the country, bolstering funding from private equity and venture capital.Whatever the driver, the net result has been a clear downturn in the number of public companies in the United States. The number of listed companies has declined by 52 percent since 1997, to a bit more than 3,600 in 2016, according to a working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research published last year. This long-term shrinkage in publicly available shares is a reason that some analysts expect Uber, Lyft and other prominent start-ups to receive a warm response from the institutional investors who typically buy freshly issued shares, even if the potential upside could be smaller. “There’s an element, I think, of pent-up demand here,” said David Ethridge, who advises on public offerings at the consulting firm PwC. “I think people will have a feeling of, I don’t really want to miss out.”Investors have some reason to be skeptical of paying top dollar for newly minted public companies, however. Over the last two years, the value of companies that completed public offerings actually fell by an average of 8 percent, according to a recent research report from Goldman Sachs analysts. Over the same period, the S&P 500 stock index was up about 12 percent. Erin Griffith reports on technology start-ups and venture capital from the San Francisco bureau.

Its food delivery revenue grew 45 times.By Raymond ZhongSHANGHAI — As Uber and Lyft prepare to become the world’s first publicly traded ride-hailing companies, their peers overseas are continuing to raise huge amounts of money through private investments. Grab, which is based in Singapore and serves eight countries in Southeast Asia, announced on Wednesday that it had secured nearly $1.5 billion from the SoftBank Vision Fund, the technology investing arm of the Japanese conglomerate. With this latest funding, Grab said it had raised more than $4.5 billion in its current financing round from investors that include Toyota, Hyundai, Microsoft and Booking Holdings, the online travel services company. Grab is now valued at around $14 billion, according to a person briefed on the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly.The seven-year-old company’s diverse roster of backers is an indication of the breadth of its ambitions. Grab hopes that people will use its app not only to get from place to place, but also to order meals, send packages, pay for things offline and book hotel rooms, among other tasks.Last year, Grab acquired Uber’s Southeast Asia operations, a move aimed at expanding its presence in both food delivery and rides. Grab said that from last March, when the tie-up with Uber was announced, to the end of the year, its transport revenue almost doubled, while its food-delivery revenue grew 45 times.The “super-app” concept is already well established in China. WeChat drew in users with its messaging and social media capabilities, but is now just as important as a tool for making payments, playing games and signing into gyms. Meituan, which began life as a Groupon-like service for buying vouchers from local merchants, branched out into takeout delivery, bike rentals, movie tickets and a host of other services. Grab’s main rival in Southeast Asia, Go-Jek, has also made its name catering to a variety of needs within its app.The new pile of cash from SoftBank deepens the Japanese investor’s stakes in the worldwide ride-hailing industry. It made a first big bet on Grab in 2017, and has invested in Uber, Didi Chuxing of China and Ola of India.Raymond Zhong is a technology reporter.

DoorDash, an on-demand delivery app, raised a fresh $400 million from venture capital investors, the start-up said Thursday.The financing round values the company at $7.1 billion, and adds to the start-up’s already towering cash pile. Last year, DoorDash raised $785 million from investors.DoorDash’s main competitors, Postmates and Uber, the parent company of Uber Eats, are preparing to go public. In December, Uber filed confidential documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering that is expected in the coming months. In February, just a month after it raised $100 million in private funding, Postmates announced it had also filed to go public.DoorDash, armed with the new round of funding, led by Temasek and Dragoneer Investment Group, has no timeline for a potential public offering, said Tony Xu, its chief executive and a co-founder. The company has not touched most of the capital it has raised, he said.The funding will be used, in part, to broaden the types of deliveries the company makes. DoorDash already works with Walmart to deliver groceries, for example.“Our ambitions never started, nor will they end, with restaurants,” Mr. Xu said.The cash will also support the company’s fast expansion. The company more than tripled the number of its deliveries in 2018, Mr. Xu said. DoorDash’s services are now available in 3,300 cities in the United States and Canada. Mr. Xu said he envisioned DoorDash in every ZIP code.Founded in 2013, DoorDash is part of a class of on-demand companies that benefit from smartphone adoption and contract workers. Venture capital investors have poured money into the category, despite fears that on-demand delivery, an idea that has been around since the late 1990s, does not create big profits. DoorDash does not earn a profit.The company’s practice of using driver tips to cover the base pay for its deliveries came under criticism this month from drivers and customers who were not aware tips were being allocated that way. Instacart, a competing delivery service, changed its policy as a result of the blowback, but DoorDash did not.Mr. Xu said his company’s model, introduced in 2017, had led to an increase in the number of orders being fulfilled by members of its delivery network, as well as increased job satisfaction from its delivery people.“This is a model that is built with dashers in mind,” he said, using DoorDash’s term for its independent delivery workers. “The pay model is meant to make sure every order is worth fulfilling.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Winnie Hu[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]The new fees were supposed to help fix New York City’s ailing subway by raising more than $1 million a day from those who could afford to take taxis and Ubers in Manhattan.But before the $2.50 fees on rides could even go into effect as planned on Jan. 1, they were sidelined by a lawsuit brought by a coalition of taxi owners and drivers.The opponents warn that the fee will add up for passengers, and will also deal a final blow to a taxi industry teetering on the brink. They say the surcharge will drive away customers when they are already losing business to Uber and other app-based services and struggling with enormous debt and bleak prospects.Three taxi owners and five other professional drivers have committed suicide over the last year.“If they put the surcharge on, that’s it, we’ve lost our whole life investment,” said Gloria Guerra, 62, who with her husband, William, owns a taxi medallion, the aluminum plate required to drive a yellow taxi in New York that once sold for more than $1 million. “The business will be bankrupt. All the medallions will be bankrupt.”On Thursday, the Guerras and other taxi owners and drivers took their fight against what they call a “suicide surcharge” to a state court hearing in Lower Manhattan, capping off months of protests. Their lawsuit contends that by imposing the new taxi fee, state and city officials “seek to drive the final nail in the proverbial coffin by making medallion taxicab rides so financially unattractive to consumers that the industry is sure to collapse in its entirety.”Last month, a state court judge temporarily blocked the fee until both sides could present arguments. At Thursday’s hearing, a judge continued the suspension of the fee until the next hearing, scheduled for Jan. 31.The $2.50 taxi fee was passed by state lawmakers last year along with a $2.75 fee on other for-hire vehicles, including Ubers and Lyfts, and a 75-cent fee on shared pool rides. The fees are expected to raise more than $400 million annually, according to budget projections.Every day those fees go uncollected means lost revenue for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the subways and buses. As a result, taxi drivers and owners have found themselves pitted against state officials, business leaders and transit advocates who see the new fees as crucial to the city’s transit system.“Transit riders, individual taxpayers and business are all contributing toward the cost of modernizing our transit system and it is only fair that the taxi industry and their customers do the same,” said Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, a group of influential business leaders that supports the fee.The $2.50 taxi fee has also divided city officials and transportation advocates and complicated a renewed effort by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and transit advocates to push for a comprehensive congestion pricing plan for Manhattan that would charge all drivers a fee for entering the busiest neighborhoods at peak times. Mr. Cuomo and others have called the fees on taxis and for-hire vehicles the first phase of congestion pricing.Mayor Bill de Blasio has also backed the new fees on for-hire vehicles.But Meera Joshi, the commissioner of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, has criticized the fee, saying that it would be “potentially devastating” for the taxi industry. Ms. Joshi, who is stepping down in March, is named in the taxi lawsuit and declined last week to comment on the case.The $2.50 fee will raise the minimum taxi fare to $5.80 — which is still lower than an Uber ride. The cost for Uber, which has an $8 base fare in Manhattan, will rise to a minimum of $10.75, including the new $2.75 fee.Unlike the taxi industry, Uber and two other ride-app services, Lyft and Via, have supported the fees as a step toward addressing congestion and transit challenges in the city.“In order to truly address these issues, it’s imperative that all vehicles, including personal and commercial, are included in this effort,” said Campbell Matthews, a spokeswoman for Lyft.Danny Pearlstein, a spokesman for the Riders Alliance, a grass-roots group of transit riders, said most taxi riders in Manhattan can afford to pay the fees. They have access to more public transit options than in the other boroughs, he said, and should pay more if they choose to use a taxi or car service.“There are a privileged number of people who take taxis and Ubers to get around the core of the city,” he said. “They can afford to support the transit system that makes New York what it is.”But others said the new fees unfairly single out taxis and for-hire vehicles without a larger plan in place to charge all cars on congested streets — and by itself, will have little, if any, impact on reducing gridlock.Marco Conner, a deputy director of Transportation Alternatives, an advocacy group, said the taxi lawsuit — and the resulting court-ordered delay in fees — “shows the fallacy of taking baby steps to address a problem as tremendous as congestion and the M.T.A. crisis.”In the lawsuit, taxi owners and drivers also claim that they should not be charged a so-called “congestion tax” because their numbers have been capped by city law at 13,587 “to prevent an overabundance of cars and congestion,” even as Uber and other ride-app services had been allowed until recently to expand exponentially. In August, the city declared a one-year moratorium on new vehicle licenses for Uber, Lyft and other ride-app services.Bruce Schaller, a former city transportation official, said taxis and ride-app cars have contributed to Manhattan gridlock. In a study last year, he found equal numbers of taxis and black cars in the central business district during the weekday — together accounting for two-thirds of all the vehicles there. Making matters worse, the for-hire vehicles often drove around with empty back seats.“You don’t just tax the last person in,” Mr. Schaller said. “You tax everyone causing the problem. It’s not like moving around Manhattan was la-dee-da before Uber.”While Mr. Schaller agreed that the taxi fee would do little to reduce congestion, he said that it would raise badly needed money for the transit system. Chicago, Seattle and other cities and states have adopted similar per-ride fees to pay for public transportation and other services. “It’s a misnomer to call this a congestion fee,” he said. “It’s all about raising revenue.”Bhairavi Desai, the executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, said the new for-hire fee would force more taxi owners into bankruptcy, while taxi drivers would earn less and could have to cut back on food, medical care and other necessities.“I don’t know anybody who has savings left,” she said. “They will face foreclosures because payments simply won’t get made. I believe it will be this dire.”Augustine Tang, 34, a yellow taxi driver who planned to attend Thursday’s hearing, said he makes about $240 after 10 hours of driving. That is about $100 less than he earned four years ago when he said he inherited a taxi medallion — and the remaining $500,000 loan on it — when his father died.“It’s a little annoying that people are saying the lawsuit is costing public transportation,” he said. “We’re trying to save our lives.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBitsBy Erin GriffithEach week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times review the week’s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.Hello, It’s Erin Griffith, reporting, happily, from my home base in San Francisco and not the carnival of virtual assistants, shiny screens, crowded smart homes and greasy VR demos in Las Vegas. Our correspondents made the CES maze of gadgets look almost fun, which anyone who has been there before knows is an impressive feat.Back in the land of magical, billion-dollar start-up unicorns, things have been quieter, thanks to the federal government shutdown. No Securities and Exchange Commission means no progress on initial public offering plans of the larger start-ups, including Uber and Lyft.Any other time in the last five years, this would not have mattered. The unicorns have been putting off their public market debuts for as long as possible — what’s another month or two? But a volatile stock market and signs of a possible recession have fostered a creeping sense of panic.As The Times reported in December, Uber and Lyft already accelerated their I.P.O. plans to try to get ahead of a potential market shift. This week, Dara Khosrowshahi, chief executive of Uber, tempered expectations, telling The Wall Street Journal that market turbulence was not likely to affect the company’s plans, but “if it doesn’t happen, it doesn’t happen.”Uber shareholders would most likely be disappointed if the company does not go public in the coming year, he added.The shutdown, volatility and recession fears are happening at a crucial moment. The start-up world’s success hinges, in part, on its ability to use hype and “trust me” confidence to persuade people to believe in a vision of the future. It’s easy to get caught up in the narrative of innovation, disruption and rising valuations (and ignore the lack of profits).But not everyone has, and skeptics are getting louder. Chamath Palihapitiya, a prominent venture capital investor, recently called the entire start-up and venture capital system a “charade” and “an enormous multivariate kind of Ponzi scheme.”He’s right in one sense: A Ponzi scheme relies on its creator’s ability to persuade ever-larger crowds to buy into his or her vision. Same goes for start-ups that haven’t proved they’re able to turn a profit. A flash of doubt, especially among public-market investors, could spiral into a broader questioning of the entire start-up ecosystem.For the largest, most valuable start-ups in Silicon Valley, many of which plan to prove themselves and their unprofitable business models to the world by going public, there could not be a worse moment for that to happen. If Uber can’t go public, what does it mean for all the “Uber for X” companies that followed its lead?Cracks are beginning to show. This week, two high-flying start-ups experienced a reality check in their fund-raising. WeWork sought to raise $16 billion in new funding from SoftBank, its main backer. The company wound up raising just $2 billion — still an enormous pile of cash, but a steep step down from its original plan.And Bird, a two-year-old scooter company that was so sought-after by investors last summer that they doubled the company’s valuation in just a few weeks, is now raising funding at a flat valuation, according to Axios.Some venture capital investors say they welcome a downturn, as I wrote this week. They’re hoarding cash and making “downturn lists” of companies to invest in once valuations become more reasonable. And some companies have seen the venture-fueled madness and decided it’s not for them.Elsewhere this week:■ Economists and investors are clashing over the health of the American economy. No one is debating the health of the Chinese economy, with concerns spreading to non-tech companies including Ford, FedEx, Starbucks and Tiffany, Matt Phillips writes.■ Apple’s biggest issue is not the Chinese economy, it’s that people like the columnist Kevin Roose’s mother don’t feel the need to replace their phones every two years anymore.■ That may explain the surprising news from CES that Apple struck deals with a number of hardware companies, including Vizio, Samsung, Sony and LG, to use its software. The deals — something the company has resisted in the past — show Apple’s ambition to make more money from content and services, as sales of its cash cow, the iPhone, slow down, Brian X. Chen writes.■ When the government asked Palantir and Oracle to share the number of women and minorities it employs, the companies tried to hide the numbers, citing them as “trade secrets.” According to a report from Reveal News, the numbers are abysmal. (Palantir has no female executives and just one female manager.) The publication sued to obtain the letters the companies sent justifying their privacy around the issue. The Palantir letter cited fears that competitors would steal their lone female manager.Erin Griffith writes about start-ups, venture capital and the rest of the tech industry for The New York Times.

Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.Hello, dear readers! I’m Nicole Perlroth, cybersecurity reporter here at The Times. I’m afraid the week’s news isn’t all unicorns and rainbows.This should come as a shock to no one, but President Trump’s confrontational diplomacy has energized state hackers in Iran and China. They are targeting companies and government agencies in the United States with renewed gusto, after a multiyear lull. The rebound in activity comes on top of the continuing threat from Russians, who have already started hacking European civil society groups before elections there in May.Consider this a preview of 2020.With the United States pulling out of the nuclear deal with Iran, Iranian hackers are hitting American banks, businesses and federal agencies with cyberattacks. They’ve significantly stepped up their game: harder to track down and more effective.We’re no longer talking so-called denial-of-service attacks that make websites hiccup. They’re exploiting weaknesses in the internet’s backbone to steal web traffic as it passes between government agencies, banks and businesses that manage their back-end infrastructure.The attacks rattled Homeland Security officials, who triggered an emergency alert during the government shutdown last month. Security researchers say that the attacks have not relented and that they’re hitting American targets with an unnerving success rate.The news out of China is even more troubling. Mr. Trump’s trade confrontations with Beijing have energized state hackers in Beijing, who have renewed attacks on American businesses, especially in high-tech and defense companies.Chinese industrial espionage notably dropped after President Barack Obama and President Xi Jinping of China reached a 2015 deal to cease cybertheft of trade secrets. Now, the gloves are off.Miriam Wugmeister, a cybersecurity specialist at the law firm Morrison Foerster, told me that Fortune 500 companies were being hit at “shockingly high” rates.It’s rare that victims step forward — state laws require companies to disclose breaches only if personal data is compromised — but T-Mobile, Boeing and General Electric Aviation are among the companies in the crossfire.If that’s not worrying you, consider my colleague Sui-Lee Wee’s blockbuster report Thursday on China’s campaign to build a DNA database, in part to track and suppress China’s minority Uighur population. Beijing could not have pulled this off without a big helping hand from Thermo Fisher, a Massachusetts equipment maker, and genetic material provided by a prominent Yale University researcher who says he was unaware the material was used as a surveillance tool.In other news:■ Lyft is racing to beat Uber to an initial public offering, my colleagues Mike Isaac and Kate Conger reported. Lyft is hoping to debut on the Nasdaq at a $20 billion to $25 billion valuation before it’s overshadowed by its bigger ride-hailing competitor, Uber, which bankers initially pegged at a $120 billion valuation.■ Google is losing advertisers after a YouTuber posted video showing the prevalence of pedophiles who comment on videos of children doing regular activities like gymnastics or stretching. My colleagues Dai Wakabayashi and Sapna Maheshwari reported that major brands like Nestlé and Epic Games have pulled advertising after users flagged their ads on children’s videos targeted by pedophiles.YouTube and other big tech companies are already under fire for failing to aggressively police their platforms. Last month, YouTube said it had tweaked its algorithm to stop recommending conspiracy theories to users. This past week, my colleague Kevin Roose wrote a terrific piece outlining one of the central challenges for the company: Some of YouTube’s biggest stars (and ad magnets) push conspiracies.Google is hardly the only company struggling with misinformation. This month, The Guardian discovered that YouTube’s recommendation algorithms and Facebook’s search results were still steering viewers from fact-based medical information to anti-vaccine misinformation. All this as the Pacific Northwest is still reeling from an emergency measles outbreak.■ Karl Lagerfeld, the fashion icon, died in Paris on Tuesday. True to form, no obituary had an accurate read on his age, though The Times noted he was “generally thought to be 85.”A tech newsletter this depressing would not be complete without my favorite Lagerfeld quote: “Sweatpants are a sign of defeat. You lost control of your life, so you bought some sweatpants.” (Thank God Karl Lagerfeld never set foot in Silicon Valley.)Nicole Perlroth writes about cybersecurity in the Times’s San Francisco bureau.

But there have been several high-profile cases.Twenty-year-old Michigan State University student Rachel Orden says she always checks her Uber's license plate number and waits for the driver to say her name.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBitsBy Jamie CondliffeGreetings from London. Here’s a look at the week’s tech news:A lot of people are getting way more interested in putting fully autonomous cars on the road.With Lyft's initial public offering on Friday, and Uber’s expected in the coming months, investors are effectively placing bets on autonomous vehicles. The development of driverless technology is central to both companies’ becoming profitable and making good on their valuations of tens of billions of dollars.Uber and Lyft want robocars to navigate city streets alone so they can offer rides 24-7 without having human drivers share their takings. Lyft admitted in its I.P.O. prospectus that without autonomous vehicles, “our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.”So the companies need to test the technology in the real world, aggressively. And investors will want that to happen. But the technology still lags behind the hype.Waymo, broadly considered to be the market leader, has pushed widespread testing of its vehicles for years. It is testing an autonomous ride-hailing service in Phoenix that is used by paying members of the public.But according to a report by The Information, things aren’t going smoothly. Almost 40 percent of Waymo’s customers registered complaints in reviews seen by the publication, from wrong turns to near-crashes. “This buggy and concerning service should not be charging money yet,” one customer reportedly wrote.Ambitions to push harder are also softening. “Currently, the company doesn’t believe it is close to being able to operate a fleet of self-driving taxis without safety drivers,” The Information wrote.Investor pressure on Uber and Lyft will probably influence decisions about holding off on accelerated testing, which raises questions about how strictly cities and states should regulate self-driving vehicles. Some jurisdictions are liberal, even allowing some cars to be tested without safety drivers; others are more strict.Mark Fagan, a lecturer in public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, thinks city and state authorities should allow testing of vehicles only where safety improvements are “unambiguous.” Maybe that means airport shuttles, low-speed taxi pods or some other uses that are safe even if they are … well, a harder sell to investors.“I’m on the side of safety and security and over-testing,” Mr. Fagan says. “Rather than letting the market do its thing.”In the face of flagging iPhone sales, Apple unveiled a digital services plan last Monday — new TV programming, video games and news, as well as a credit card.The announcement was heavy on big names. A cast of Hollywood stars announced the streaming service, its news offering included publishers like The New Yorker and The Wall Street Journal, and its credit card is backed by Goldman Sachs.Beneath the gloss, questions lurked. There were no details about pricing of the TV service. It’s unclear how much content readers will have access to in the news service. The Journal is offering just a curated selection, for instance. And there were no details about credit limits or interest rates for the credit card.Still, Apple has the inertia of its ecosystem to fall back on. It has more than 1.4 billion devices in use around the world, including more than 900 million iPhones. Users have bought 300 million in-app subscriptions to services belonging to Apple and third parties.“If they are any indication of how Apple is leveraging their current iOS users, then they’ve been able to leverage them pretty well,” Annette Zimmermann of the research company Gartner said.If a commodities slump indicates impending economic issues, tech may have a problem.Samsung Electronics warned on Tuesday that its financial results for the first three months of this year would be disappointing. It pointed to its memory and display businesses, which account for 43 percent of its revenue.Memory and displays appear in almost all electronic devices, but are sensitive to supply and demand — like a tech world equivalent of oil. There is currently excess inventory and weak demand for the components: See, for instance, a 7 percent decline in global smartphone shipments during the fourth quarter of 2018.Samsung says it “expects the scope of price declines in main memory chip products to be larger than expected.” Competitors probably feel the same.It’s 2019, and a dating app is considered a potent security threat.The Chinese gaming company Beijing Kunlun is reportedly being forced to sell Grindr, the popular gay social network that it bought in two stages in 2016 and 2018, according to Reuters, which cited unidentified sources. That’s the result of an order from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews the national security implications of foreign investments in American operations.“This appears to be the first case in which the United States has asserted that foreign control of a social media app could have national security implications,” David E. Sanger wrote in The Times.It’s not too surprising. China is no stranger to cyberespionage, and some data on Grindr is highly personal. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States is supposed to be playing closer attention to data as a security risk, and has the power to unwind deals.But it’s a clear sign that United States trust in China’s digital operations has worn paper-thin.In other news:■ Google’s robot reboot is all about software.

As a nation obsessed with keeping a paper trail, Germans were very cautious about using apps to make everyday transactions easier — Apple Pay arrived only at the end of last year — but the apps are catching on. It has been several years since I used a paper ticket on the train, and where car-sharing services like DriveNow initially required an extra card to unlock the car, now all I need is my phone.Is there any tech that you’ve stopped using lately or use less, and why?I have turned off Apple’s FaceTime after the latest scandal over privacy, but I only ever used that to reach my 80-year-old father, who isn’t on WhatsApp.For years, I have been a lurker on Facebook and would like to quit it altogether, but I find it too useful for reporting. About 32 million of Germany’s 82 million people are active on the platform. Some members of Germany’s far-right and nationalist circles, including some members of the far-right Alternative for Germany party, use Facebook almost exclusively to communicate with their base, so it has become increasingly useful for tracking their activities.Germany has a reputation for being very privacy-conscious online. How have you seen that manifest itself?Many public records are protected in Germany by strict privacy laws, which means that access in general is difficult and that records are not at all available online. The country still demands that applications for most official documents take place via paper or fax. Digital databases of information on individuals do not exist.Searching for places in Germany on Google Street View returns a patchwork of images and blurred blotches. That’s because in 2010, data privacy activists succeeded in forcing Google to allow them to render their residences unrecognizable. The irony is that Germans, who like to head into vacations hyper-prepared, love to look up their hotels or the cities they will visit on Google Street View.Nothing in the Berlin public school system is digitized, and parents have to sign special waivers for their kids to have access to Wi-Fi in the schools that offer it. At the start of every school year, parents have to give permission for their email addresses to be shared on a class list, and those who don’t will be left out.That being said, Germans in their 20s and younger are as active on Instagram or Facebook as their counterparts in the United States. Yet despite being raised in a privacy-obsessed country, they seem to struggle with the idea that whatever they publish on Facebook can be seen publicly, unless they take special action to keep their entries private.After the 2017 terror attack on a disco in Istanbul, I reached out to a group of friends of one of the victims from southern Germany. They had posted homages to him, and I wanted to use them and perhaps talk to them about their friend. But my attempts to reach out were met with hostility that I would be invading their privacy and “preying” on their mourning — which they had made publicly available on Facebook.What apps and gadgets do Germans love to use? Germany’s highly mechanized society seems to extend even to the act of cleaning teeth: Germans love electric toothbrushes. Young kids are started on smaller, battery-powered brushes, which become larger and more sophisticated as they grow. I have had to argue with my dentist that I am capable of keeping my teeth clean with good old-fashioned brushing and flossing.Uber basically doesn’t exist in Germany after they were largely forced to retreat from the market in 2015 for violating local transport laws. To be on the safe side, the taxi companies quickly realized they needed to create an app or eventually be left behind, so MyTaxi was born. It works the way Uber does elsewhere, but by connecting riders with taxis wherever they are in Germany — even in tiny towns where the local taxi driver has to be pulled off his sofa in front of the TV to come pick you up at the station at some odd hour. To this day, I have never used Uber.Outside of work, what tech do you and your family love to use and why?Other than trying to keep up with the latest Netflix series and doing The Times’s crossword puzzle, we are largely an analogue family. Monopoly and Scrabble will come out on the rare nights we are all together for a game.My 17-year-old son is a YouTube junkie and is surviving his exams and studies by exchanging tips and notes with his peers around the world via Discord, the communication app. He recently wondered how anyone could have passed exams in the days before online resources were available.Despite teaching herself to read via Starfall, an online program, my 14-year-old daughter prefers paper books to her Kindle. Germany still has a strong network of bookstores, and I try to support their continued existence by ordering books through them, but more often than not we turn to Amazon for easy access to English-language books.People have always envied my having a bookworm for a child. But the frustrating part is that while I’ve never had any qualms removing an electronic device from someone, I have a much harder time pulling a book out of my daughter’s hands, even when homework and chores need to be done.Melissa Eddy is a correspondent based in Berlin who covers German politics, social issues and culture.

In some cases, he said, his offers to invest were outbid by as much as 40 percent. The only investment he led in 2018 was a $360 million deal in OutSystems, a software company in Atlanta.So here’s what Mr. Letteri is not-so-secretly hoping for in 2019: a downturn in the private start-up market.“When the market turns, we’re prepared to be more aggressive,” he said. He added that he had sketched out a “downturn list” of 150 targets — including financial tech, cybersecurity, and consumer internet companies — in case they become cheaper.Mr. Letteri is one of a growing number of venture capitalists rooting for a market dip to calm the overheated start-up scene. For the past few years, Silicon Valley tech start-ups have been awash in a stream of cash that has allowed them to expand quickly and sell or go public at high valuations. Yet that drove up the costs of deal making for venture capitalists, who often prefer to invest in young companies at lower prices in the hopes of making a bigger return later.Now some of these investors may get their wish for a market decline. Stocks tumbled late last year, led by tech giants such as Facebook and Apple, amid fears of slowing economic growth and a trade war with China. And so far this year, the stock market has swung wildly, whipsawed by confusing signals including Apple’s disappointing iPhone sales in China and American employers adding more jobs than expected last month.While it takes time for choppiness in the stock market to ripple out into the start-up market, many venture investors are already preparing for a downturn. Some are setting aside money to pounce on investments and are preparing to write bigger checks with the expectation that new investors who flooded in in recent years will flee. And they are keeping closer tabs on companies that were too expensive to invest in last year.“We definitely want to take advantage of a market downturn,” said Sandy Miller, a venture capitalist at IVP who projects that start-up valuations will fall by 10 percent to 40 percent this year. He said his Silicon Valley venture firm has set aside “meaningful reserves” to do more deals and to put more money into companies it has already invested in, though he declined to specify an amount.Silicon Valley investors have long complained that start-up valuations have gotten too expensive, given that the start-up ecosystem has been on a bull run since at least 2015. That has minted an unprecedented number of “unicorn” start-ups, which are valued at more than $1 billion, including now-giant companies such as Uber and Airbnb.But the rising valuations have only continued to climb in the last year. In 2018, the median company valuation for one category of mature start-ups more than doubled to $420 million, up from $183 million in 2017, according to Carta, a provider of valuation software and services. And in a 2017 National Bureau of Economic Research study of 135 unicorn start-ups, researchers concluded the companies were overvalued by an average of 50 percent.“There’s too much heat around good, not necessarily great, companies” that are older, said Mamoon Hamid, a partner at the venture firm Kleiner Perkins. Even one “good, not great” company he recently met with had 13 investment offers, he said. The upshot: Kleiner did not invest.Greg Sands, a managing partner at Costanoa Ventures, said his venture firm walked away from three investments in 2018 where the price was 30 percent higher than he was willing to pay, an increase from past years. He also screened out numerous companies that were asking for more money than seemed reasonable — yet some of those companies then went on to raise triple that amount from other investors.“What’s happening right now isn’t sustainable and it won’t go on forever. It can’t,” he said. Costanoa raised a $75 million “opportunity fund,”, which Mr. Sands said would give it the ability to do more deals when the market cools down.Many other venture capital firms are also in a position to become more aggressive in case of a market downturn. Venture funds raised $30.2 billion in the first three quarters of last year, on track to surpass 2017’s total of $35.3 billion, according to PitchBook, a data provider.Start-up founders also appear to be preparing for a potential shift in fortunes. In a survey conducted late last year by First Round Capital, a venture capital firm, just under half of 529 entrepreneurs said they expected fund-raising to become more difficult in 2019. A third said they believed the tech bubble was close to popping, a 10-point increase over 2017.Some start-ups are raising more money to weather the uncertainty, according to Kirsten Green, a managing partner at Forerunner Ventures. Others are creating backup plans to cut costs so their survival won’t depend on new funding.Not all venture capitalists want a downturn, especially if it will throw a wrench into the plans of some of the biggest unicorns — such as Uber, Lyft, Pinterest and Slack — to go public. Many investors are eager to cash out of those companies when they stage an initial public offering.“You always want a better market,” said Micah Rosenbloom, a managing partner at Founder Collective, which was an early investor in Uber. “In a crisis, everything gets hard. You’d rather have your companies in good times for everything from hiring to sales.”Still, Mr. Rosenbloom said he also saw opportunity in a downturn. His firm’s two most successful investments — Uber and the Trade Desk, a digital advertising company — were created in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.In previous downturns, the less serious entrepreneurs disappeared, leaving the most committed ones, said David Pakman, a partner at venture firm Venrock. “During those periods, some incredible companies were founded by highly determined entrepreneurs,” he said. “The cream rose to the top.”Follow Erin Griffith on Twitter: @eringriffithAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersSAN FRANCISCO — SoftBank Group Corp has agreed to give up board seats and access to sensitive information, take a more passive role in startups and make other concessions to get government clearance for its technology deals, as the Japanese investor confronts a new U.S. law aimed at cracking down on foreign investors.SoftBank's investment style has made it a frequent visitor of a U.S. government group known as the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), charged with reviewing foreign investment for national security and competitive risks. "We know the deals are going to be reviewed," Marcelo Claure, chief operating officer of SoftBank Group Corp, said in an interview with Reuters this week. "We have abided by what the U.S. government wants."SoftBank likes to take large stakes in companies working on artificial intelligence, data analytics, financial services and self-driving cars -- technologies increasingly viewed as critical to national security. This puts them in the crosshairs of a law signed by U.S. President Donald Trump last year expanding the powers of CFIUS.Giving up board seats and access to private information would make SoftBank's less of a threat in the eyes of CFIUS, giving its deals a better chance of approval."We would not accept this if we were in the business of running companies," Claure said of the concessions. "We're not. We are in the business of investing." Claure declined to provide specifics on investments where SoftBank has had to make concessions or give up board seats and the U.S. government does not comment on CFIUS reviews. The regulations have deterred many foreign investors from even attempting investment in U.S. tech companies."Everything is a conversation with the government so you figure you are going to pick your battles," Claure said.One regulatory battle SoftBank has chosen, so far, to sit out is regarding Uber Technologies Inc's board seats. As part of an $8 billion investment SoftBank closed in January 2018, which gave it a 16 percent stake in Uber and made it the largest shareholder, SoftBank was supposed to get two board seats.CFIUS reviewed SoftBank's investment in Uber, but SoftBank has not yet initiated the formal review of the two board seats, Claure told Reuters.As a result, more than a year later, Claure and Rajeev Misra, who oversees SoftBank's $100 billion Vision Fund, have not taken their board seats. The result is that Uber on Thursday kicked off its initial public offering with a board of 12 directors, not the 17 members long ago agreed upon. Another three independent directors cannot be appointed until after Misra and Claure join the board. By the time Uber's shares start trading on the New York Stock Exchange in early May, SoftBank may have missed its opening. When it becomes public, Uber's bylaws will change, erasing old agreements with its directors, according to Uber's IPO filing posted Thursday.Claure said SoftBank may still submit its board seat plan to CFIUS, but added that "it hasn't been a priority for us" and SoftBank still has the access it wants to Uber's executives.BUILDING A TEAM OF LOBBYISTSAfter becoming chief operating officer in May of 2018, Claure increased SoftBank's presence and lobbying power in Washington."The first job was to change the conversation with the U.S. government and explain to the U.S. government what is SoftBank," said Claure.It hired former Ford Motor Co lobbyist Ziad Ojakli to improve relations with regulators.SoftBank added a former White House staffer and a Department of Commerce deputy to its Washington staff last fall, and hired Jeffrey Dressler, previously a national security adviser to members of the U.S. Congress, as its national security policy director in January.Even without board seats or more control in a company, SoftBank still wields a lot of influence. SoftBank at times requires companies to meet performance goals before receiving money and generally prohibits founders and employees from selling their company shares. SoftBank last month unveiled a $5 billion fund to invest in technology companies in Latin America, where it will be well outside of CFIUS' control.

Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.Hi. I’m Jamie Condliffe; greetings from London. Here’s a look at the week’s tech news.You can’t have missed it: Facebook plans to shift people toward private messaging and away from the public broadcasting on which its business was built. Think encrypted communications among smaller groups of people, and ephemeral messages that can be deleted. In theory, that change could help the company overcome some of the problems it has faced.But Facebook has promised privacy features before that have never appeared — something skeptics were quick to point out after the plan was revealed on Thursday.“I understand that many people don’t think Facebook can or would even want to build this kind of privacy-focused platform,” Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s chief executive, wrote in a 3,200-word manifesto describing the shift.If we are to assume he means it, there’s still a huge problem: He lacks a business model.A shift to a private Facebook would crimp its current revenue streams. Most of its profits come from targeted ads enabled by the open sharing of content. In the encrypted future that Mr. Zuckerberg imagines, that will be hard. The company would also effectively rule out expansion into big potential markets like Russia and China, because it won’t run servers in countries with authoritarian governments.So how can it make money? Mr. Zuckerberg mentions commerce and payments, which fits with reports that Facebook is building a cryptocurrency. But that’s all he says, really.Mr. Zuckerberg seems O.K. with the lack of a plan. “The basic way that we’ve approached things is first to focus on building the consumer service that people really want,” he said to Wired. “That will be the foundation. If we do that well, the business will be fine.”Of course, a trick for monetizing private messaging may be hidden in his back pocket. If it isn’t, his critics’ skepticism may be proved right.Earlier in the week, Representative David Cicilline, the Rhode Island Democrat who leads the House antitrust subcommittee, proposed an idea to curb Big Tech’s dominance.During the Great Depression, the Glass-Steagall Act forced banks to separate commercial and investment banking operations. Mr. Cicilline told the Financial Times that something similar could apply to tech.“It’s an interesting idea whether there would be a way to think about separating what platforms do versus people who are selling products and information,” he said.Sadly, this feels like a nonstarter. Splitting the operations of banks was relatively straightforward; the data sales and platform components of companies like Google and Facebook are (whatever Mr. Zuckerberg says) deeply intertwined.Still, it’s probably one of many options. “There aren’t easy answers” to Big Tech antitrust questions, Mr. Cicilline said to Bloomberg Opinion in January. “We’re not going to approach this, like, ‘Here’s my solution.’”He has the wind at his back. Congressional hearings with Facebook and others last year revealed that lawmakers in both parties have antitrust concerns about tech companies. And the Federal Trade Commission recently announced a task force of 17 lawyers dedicated to “monitoring competition in U.S. technology markets.” The commission’s director of competition, Bruce Hoffman, said some companies could be forced to “spin off” previous acquisitions.How far these efforts will go — and how quickly — remains unclear. It may be difficult to prove violation of federal antitrust law until the laws are updated to better apply to technology companies. And splitting a company like Facebook or Google would require costly, lengthy legal battles that the government may yet balk at.Arizona prosecutors said Tuesday that they wouldn’t charge Uber with a crime after one of its autonomous cars hit and killed a pedestrian last year. Instead, they said investigators should look into what the safety driver “would or should have seen that night.”One interesting point about the news was raised by Frank Douma, a researcher at the University of Minnesota’s Center for Transportation Studies:“It’s a very conventional way of thinking to say we can expect and we should expect people to sit and monitor technology that is otherwise doing all the decision-making.”The “handoff problem” — that humans are too easily distracted to safely retake control of an autonomous vehicle in an emergency — is well documented. The Uber accident provided a first glimpse of how the law would deal with that issue. It suggests that, for now, the onus remains on the “driver.”The Chinese telecom giant Huawei sued the United States government on Wednesday over a ban that prevents government agencies from using the company’s products because they may violate national security. Days earlier, Meng Wanzhou, the company’s chief financial officer, sued the Canadian authorities for arresting her.Huawei is aggrieved by the Trump administration’s hardware ban and its lobbying of other governments to shun the company’s products when building 5G wireless data networks. The lawsuits are just one response: A defensive advertising campaign and outspoken interviews were already in play.Those more conventional lobbying approaches may have been working: Countries like Britain and Germany, which have considered the White House’s pleas, have wavered and may ultimately use Huawei hardware.But the lawsuits make Huawei look rash and aggressive. Is that the kind of company a government wants to help build critical infrastructure?The National Security Agency stopped its controversial phone spying. The system, which analyzed logs of Americans’ domestic calls and texts and was introduced to surveil conspirators in Al Qaeda, has been scrapped.Google said it was paying male workers too little. It gave $9.7 million in additional compensation to level things up for 10,677 employees, about 69 percent of them men. But the survey that led to the raises did not address a critical question: Are women hired at a pay grade below their qualifications?Net neutrality is back in Washington. Congressional Democrats announced bills that seek to reinstate net neutrality rules. Whether the bills can pass is another matter.Chinese hackers hit universities. An elaborate set of attacks sought to steal research about military maritime technology.Artificial intelligence cameras can spot shoplifters before they steal. Software can identify “restlessness and other potentially suspicious body language,” according to Bloomberg. You don’t know data overload. Gizmodo invites you to meet the digital hoarders who collect “terabytes of text files.”Jamie Condliffe is editor of the DealBook newsletter.

By Kara SwisherMs. Swisher covers technology and is a contributing opinion writer. I will die before I buy another car.I don’t say that because I am particularly old or sick, but because I am at the front end of one of the next major secular trends in tech. Owning a car will soon be like owning a horse — a quaint hobby, an interesting rarity and a cool thing to take out for a spin on the weekend.Before you object, let me be clear: I will drive in cars until I die. But the concept of actually purchasing, maintaining, insuring and garaging an automobile in the next few decades?Finished. [Kara Swisher answered your questions about this column on Twitter.]This could be the most important shift since the Cambrian explosion of the smartphone. Car-sharing continues to increase (Uber and Lyft are set to go public this year), new innovations emerge all the time (Scooters! Vertical-take-off-and-landing vehicles!) and all manner of autonomous technologies are inevitable (Elon Musk, whatever you think of him or the prospects of Tesla, is 100 percent directionally correct). Private car ownership declined globally last year, and it is a trend that I believe is going to accelerate faster than people think.Not everyone agrees. After an initial rush of hype and hope, there was a backlash against the idea that autonomous and shared cars would soon take over. But I am pretty good at this guessing game. In 1998, as one of the first Internet-focused reporters for The Wall Street Journal, I wrote a piece titled “I Cut the Cord” about giving up my land line and going all mobile. That was well before “feature” phones — as the first dumber versions of smartphones were called — and almost a decade before the iPhone. There was not much out there for the general population. Nonetheless, I “snipped my copper umbilical cord” and predicted that everyone else would do the same, and sooner than they thought.I did not find it easy, as I noted then: “My own all-cellular journey is strewn with technical glitches and innumerable lost connections, pricey millisecond charges that make using a cellphone seem like a bad addiction, and vague worries that perhaps too much cellphone exposure actually does cause brain tumors.”But it was time. Absent the brain tumors, this was the thought that hit me recently when my clutch died on a hill in San Francisco. After spending my life buying cars, I will never buy another after I sell my last, a manual Ford Fiesta Turbo named Frank.Since I first started driving I have named my cars: Cecil the Honda Civic, Jeanette the mighty blue Volkswagen Bug, Roger the Volkswagen Rabbit, Jerry the Jeep Wrangler, John the Jeep Cherokee, Alice the Honda Minivan, Sally the Subaru Outback, Abner the Mazda 3, Cindy the Mazda 5 and Frank. Why wouldn’t I name them, since they were an integral part of my life from my teens to my single days to motherhood?Many people feel this kind of bond with their cars. They represent so many major life moments (prom!) and individual tropes (freedom!) that it is difficult to imagine giving them up.But it will be easier than you’d think for a number of reasons that are increasing in speed and velocity, if you will excuse the pun. Consider how swiftly people moved from physical maps to map apps, from snail mail to email, from prime time TV to watching on demand. What had been long-held practices were quickly replaced by digital tools that made things easier, more convenient and simply better. Some of the shifts have been slower to develop, but then accelerated quickly, like what is now occurring in retail with online shopping and quick delivery pioneered by Amazon.Simply put, everything that can be digitized will be digitized.That is harder to envision with the heavy hunk of metal and fiberglass that is a car, but it is not hard to see the steps. You start using car-sharing services, you don’t use your car as often, you realize as these services proliferate that you actually don’t need to own a car at all.It’s also a small step toward a more carbon-free life, although my frequent cross-country flights pretty much make me a carbon criminal for life. (My fingers are crossed for not only an electric car, but an electric plane or even carbon-free jet fuel.)It’s obviously an easier decision if you live near a major metropolitan area, like I do, where the alternatives — cars and then car pools and then bikes and now scooters — are myriad. (Why, by the way, this is a revolution led by private companies instead of public transportation is an important topic for another day.) In other countries, often with denser populations, there are even more ideas bubbling up, from auto-rickshaws and motorbike taxis to new bus services. Obviously, the biggest change will be the advent of truly autonomous vehicles, which are still years or even decades in the future. But in the meantime I am going to lean into this future all I can, and will chronicle the efforts over the next year, its costs and its benefits and how I get there. Or not.Will I walk more? Take more buses or trains? How much will I use short-term car rental services? Will my kids freak out when I decline to be their constant chauffeur? It begins with the off-loading of Frank the Fiesta, so I have no excuse to use it at all. Anyone interested in a car with a loose clutch?The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We’d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles.

The Japanese entrepreneur is placing a $60 billion bet in more than 40 companies in a bid to steer the $3 trillion global automotive industry now dominated by vehicles people own and drive to a spectrum of transportation services available at the touch of a smartphone app. Those services range from ride hailing and car sharing to delivery robots and self-driving vehicles.The extent of those investments, based on a Reuters analysis of publicly available data and interviews with a dozen sources familiar with SoftBank's investment strategy, has not previously been reported. They show how Son has emerged as one of the power players trying to influence how people and goods move about the world in the coming decades. Graphic: Softbank's future mobility investments, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2UQXn4F Key partners in Son's quest are Uber, the U.S. ride services leader, and Japan's Toyota Motor Corp. Uber's planned initial public stock offering in May is expected to value the company at $90 billion to $100 billion, representing a potential windfall to SoftBank, which put $8 billion into Uber for a 15 percent stake in January 2018. The rising value of that investment will further supercharge Son’s growing clout in the sector, and eventually provide him with additional capital to invest in mobility. Closer to home, Toyota approached Son more than a year ago about a partnership, and SoftBank in February 2018 signed a memorandum of understanding with the automaker to consider how they might jointly develop mobility services, according to sources familiar with the document. The agreement was followed by the launch of a joint venture dubbed Monet Technologies, designed to set up automated mobility services.SoftBank and Toyota are also in talks to co-lead a $1 billion investment in Uber's self-driving unit, Reuters reported in March. While the deal is close to being finalized, discussions remain ongoing around issues such as how much of the unit SoftBank would control, sources told Reuters.Toyota declined to comment for this story. In an interview with Reuters, SoftBank Group Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure said that the two Japanese companies "have a lot sessions in which we think and we try to redefine the future of mobility." Central to those sessions are discussions about how Toyota and SoftBank can collaborate to bring autonomous vehicles to Japan, he said.Son has been working since 2014 to weave together a tapestry of diverse transportation bets. His deep portfolio of investments range literally from A to Z: From Arm, a British semiconductor maker that Son acquired in 2016 for $32 billion, to Zume Pizza, a Silicon Valley startup that aims to automate pizza delivery and raised $375 million last year from SoftBank. A FAMILY AFFAIRSoftBank has used at least five investment vehicles, including the $100 billion Vision Fund, from which to make its mobility investments, public records show. Its deep pockets, aggressive investing tactics and sweeping vision of the future of transportation give SoftBank and its leader Son an outsized influence in shaping the entire industry. The Vision Fund has more than 30 investment professionals who work to promote cooperation and integration among the portfolio companies, which they refer to as a "family." "We can create this web where companies talk to each other and they help each other because they are part of the same family and they do joint ventures and they do joint investments," Claure said.SoftBank and its affiliates have focused some of their biggest investments on self-driving firm Cruise, a unit of GM, and four global ride-services giants — Uber, Didi Chuxing, Ola and Grab. SoftBank is the largest shareholder in the four ride-services companies and the largest outside shareholder in Cruise.Son "is the true emperor of future mobility," said Tom De Vleesschauwer, senior director of long-term planning and sustainability at IHS Automotive.To help implement his vision, Son also allied with General Motors Co and Honda Motor Co, each of which is investing heavily in self-driving vehicles and ride services. Son laid out his future of transportation vision in an October press conference alongside Toyota, where he talked about building a "cluster" of leading mobility companies in different sectors, which "can collaborate with each other."Toyota a year ago introduced e-Palette, an electric shuttle designed for self-driving ride and delivery services, and quickly signed up Uber and Didi as development partners. The e-Palette is also the centerpiece of Monet Technologies, which added Honda as a minority partner in March. All are tied back to SoftBank. That collaboration is expected to enable some SoftBank companies to become "superapps," or applications where customers go for a range of services, such as transportation, shopping and payments. Such companies can be much more lucrative than those that offer just one core business or service. But the fact that many of SoftBank's companies are rivals can complicate the investor's ambitions. Uber and Ola, the Indian ride-hailing company, remain fierce competitors and are never in the same room when SoftBank discusses ride-hailing strategies, Claure said.Traditionally in venture capital, funds do not invest in direct competitors."There are tremendous synergies, but on the other hand there is significant risk of tremendous conflicts of interest," said Paul Asel, managing partner at NGP Capital and a longtime mobility investor.There are limits to the investor's influence, however. For example, SoftBank encouraged Cruise to acquire or take a stake in self-driving startup Nuro, but talks between the companies never led to a deal, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter.So SoftBank made its own, $940 million investment in Nuro.HUNTING BIG GAMEIn his five-year transportation push, Son's stakes in ride services startups now look like bargains. In late 2014, SoftBank joined Alibaba, China's internet giant in which SoftBank also has a stake, in a $600 million funding round in Kuaidi Dache, the forerunner of China's Didi.That investment has grown to more than $11 billion in Didi, in which SoftBank now holds more than 20 percent.SoftBank's partnerships with major automakers are also proving to be a boon to transportation startups. Toyota invested in Uber in 2016, then boosted its stake seven months after SoftBank's investment. Honda followed SoftBank with an investment into Grab, and last year committed $2.75 billion to Cruise's self-driving project, aiding SoftBank's ambitions.But the SoftBank portfolio is not without risks, particularly for companies dependent on the Japanese firm to sustain them financially for years to come. SoftBank faces financial pressures, including an obligation to pay an annual 7 percent dividend on a portion of the invested capital and has burnt through the majority of the Vision Fund.And it is compelled by a new U.S. law cracking down on foreign investment in technology to submit many of its mobility investments to a government regulatory agency for approval. Should that regulatory group block a deal, it could be catastrophic to a startup.But there is some safety for Son given the size of his portfolio. "He's shooting for big game," Roger Lanctot, global automotive practice director at Strategy Analytics, said of Son. "He only needs to bag one or two and he will do just fine."

Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.Hi, I’m Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here’s a look at the week’s tech news:Mark Zuckerberg has a vision that he’d like Congress to share.Lawmakers seem to agree that there are too few tech companies with too much power, and that Big Tech needs to be regulated. What they can’t agree on is how do it: Break companies up, tax them more, apply privacy rules, remove liability protections. The list goes on. There are lots of options, none particularly well developed, and little consensus on what might work.Mr. Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, appeared to take advantage of this when he made his own proposal for regulation in a Washington Post op-ed. According to Corynne McSherry, the legal director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, Mr. Zuckerberg’s proposals were “an effort to get ahead” of the many suggestions already on the table and “shape what happens down the pike.”The proposals were not earth-shattering; most had been suggested by policymakers already, or even put into effect in other parts of the world. But Mr. Zuckerberg fleshed them out into one of the more actionable calls for tech regulation that we’ve yet seen.They may seem like an appealing first draft of the rules to some lawmakers. An obvious question is: Should they be?“Legislation is written by legislators, and that is what they’re elected to do — no industry can replace that,” said Jason Oxman, the chief executive of the Information Technology Industry Council, a trade association. He added that “the tech industry will want to make its voice heard,” and that “it’s certainly our hope that Congress will balance a need to encourage innovation” with issues like maintaining privacy.Ms. McSherry said she was “very concerned” about the idea that policymakers might look to the chief executives of Silicon Valley for guidance on what they should do.“It’s sort of asking the foxes how best to guard the henhouse,” she said.My colleague Mike Isaac read between the lines of what Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. And all of his proposals appear to suggest regulation that would strengthen Facebook — by allowing Facebook to squash competitors, say, or better enable it to meld its main platform with its other properties, Instagram and WhatsApp.If regulation is to genuinely curb Big Tech’s power, Congress may be better served by spending less time on theatrical tech C.E.O. testimony and more time listening to the technologists who built the systems they’re trying to regulate and to the people who use them.Don’t panic, but some stickers could help run an autonomous car off the road.Driverless cars use artificial intelligence, often based on so-called neural networks, to interpret camera images. Such software can identify a stop sign. But small visual tweaks to an object, barely observable to humans, can fire connections in neural networks to convince them they’re looking at something else, like a speed-limit sign.Researchers from the Keen Security Lab, part of the technology company Tencent, reported that a similar trick forced an autonomous car to switch lanes. Tesla’s Autopilot software, they showed, uses only camera data to detect lanes, and small visual tweaks to a road surface could cause its neural networks to think road markings were veering. In tests, stickers on a road caused a Tesla Model S in Autopilot mode to swerve into another lane.Tesla said in a statement that “a driver can easily override Autopilot at any time by using the steering wheel or brakes and should always be prepared to do so.”But it demonstrates the fragility of current A.I. “You would expect the system to behave robustly,” said Marta Kwiatkowska, a professor of computing systems at the University of Oxford. “If you change the input very slightly, the output should change only very slightly.”Solving the problem isn’t just about improving A.I. The entire system needs to be made more robust by creating additional checks using other sensors, Ms. Kwiatkowska said. “We need to engineer these systems better,” she said.There’s a lot of awful stuff online. Not liking it is easy. Actually overcoming it is hard.Silicon Valley workers are aware of the problem. On Tuesday, Bloomberg published a report that said YouTube executives had ignored employee proposals to “change recommendations and curb conspiracies.” Their suggestions were reportedly “sacrificed for engagement.”Executives, like YouTube’s chief product officer, Neal Mohan, insist that the algorithms may be designed to keep people watching but not to recommend things like extremist content, even if that’s what they end up doing. After all, it “doesn’t monetize,” he said, because advertisers “don’t want to be associated with this sort of content.”But recommend they do, so calls for rules that force content takedowns are unsurprising. The most recent: a law passed in Australia on Thursday, which threatens big fines for companies if they fail to swiftly remove violent material.Sadly, it may not be that easy to solve the whole harmful content problem:■ First, defining “harmful” is a minefield. As Ms. McSherry of the Electronic Frontier Foundation put it to me, one person’s harmful content can be another’s political expression.■ That feeds a second issue: In the United States, moves toward mandatory takedowns of specific kinds of content could quickly run afoul of the First Amendment.■ Third, the technical challenge is huge. Tech companies have struggled for years to do it with the most troubling of content, and promises that A.I. will solve the problem have yet to bear fruit.None of this excuses the proliferation of harmful content online. But it helps explain why progress is so slow.Facebook user data spilled out again. Researchers found records for hundreds of millions of users stored publicly by a third party on Amazon’s cloud servers. (Also: Facebook might start a news service.)Wall Street is getting cold feet over cryptocurrencies. The plans of big banks are faltering, showing how hard it is to take a fringe technology into mainstream finance.What actually happens in a venture capital pitch? This, according to Wired.Washington is preparing for a 5G future including Huawei. The world doesn’t hear America’s security concerns, so the government is reportedly coming to terms with using “dirty networks.” (Also: Chicago and Minneapolis became the first cities in the United States to have 5G.)The biggest lobbyist for New York’s congestion charge? Uber, which spent $2 million backing the tolls. It’s trying to fend off claims that it causes congestion.A.I. experts want Amazon to stop selling facial recognition software to law enforcement. They argue that it is biased against women and people of color.Banning Netflix from the Oscars could violate antitrust laws. An exclusion that crimps movie sales could be anticompetitive.Want a smart home but don’t know where to start? Allow us to be your guide.Jamie Condliffe is editor of the DealBook newsletter.

By Peter EavisThe initial public offerings of Lyft and Pinterest will give investors the chance to buy into young, fast-growing companies led by founders with ambitious visions.But to get a piece of that action, investors will have to give up something big: an equal say in how the companies are run.Lyft, a ride-share company, and Pinterest, a social media network, will deprive their new shareholders of full voting rights when they go public in the coming days and weeks. Both companies plan to issue shares to a small number of insiders that have far more voting power than the shares everyone else will own.The use of two classes of shares has become increasingly popular among Silicon Valley start-ups going public. But such share structures have also prompted a backlash. Big investors, corporate-governance experts and even some tech executives warn that the issuance of super-voting shares undermines the system of accountability that has long been a pillar of public stock markets.Still, the Lyft and Pinterest offerings show that the desire to retain control after going public remains strong.Both Pinterest and Lyft are issuing two classes of stock, one that gives its holders 20 votes each and another, owned by outside investors, that will have one vote each.In Lyft’s case, the two founders, Logan Green and John Zimmer, will control 49 percent of the company’s voting power, while holding just under 5 percent of the overall shares. Pinterest has not yet disclosed numbers needed to do a similar breakdown. Google opted for a dual-class structure as it went public in 2004, when it was fairly unusual for tech companies to do so. Facebook issued shares that gave control to its founders in its 2012 I.P.O. Snap, a social media company, sold shares to the public in 2017 with no voting rights, which prompted an outcry. But that hasn’t slowed their adoption. Last year, nearly two-thirds of technology companies going public had more than one class of shares, compared with a quarter five years earlier, according to data from Dealogic.And it’s not just technology companies that have embraced maintaining control. Levi Strauss, which went public last week, has shares that put most of the voting power in the hands of its founder’s descendants. And some media companies, The New York Times Company included, have special shares that give control to their holders.Uber may buck this trend, though. The ride-sharing company is preparing to make its public market debut this year and is expected to do so with one class of stock.As owners of a company, shareholders expect to have some sway over management. Full voting rights give them a greater voice in who’s on the board and how much executives get paid, and on big decisions, like whether to sell the company. Diminishing public holders’ voting rights can give insiders too much power and insulate executives who make poor decisions. Strong boards, as well as the looming threat of activist investors, do a lot to assure top executives are responsive, says Glenn Kelman, chief executive of Redfin, an online real estate brokerage. “The feeling that I serve at the pleasure of the board, that it is a privilege to work at Redfin, is fundamental to this company and the best of business culture,” he said.It’s hard to say definitively whether companies with unequal voting rights perform better or worse over time. Google has grown strongly over the years, but so have Apple, Amazon and Microsoft, which don’t give special control to insiders. Viacom’s stock has done poorly while CBS’s has done quite well; Sumner M. Redstone, with the help of his daughter, Shari Redstone, controls both companies through voting shares. Much also depends on the type of control a company grants. Robert J. Jackson Jr., a commissioner at the Securities and Exchange Commission, has cited analysis showing that companies that give control to insiders in perpetuity ended up with lower valuations on the stock market than those that planned to get rid of unequal voting rights after a certain period.The question of control may become crucial when a company gets into trouble. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, faltered in his response to abuse of the company’s network and data. Shareholder advisory groups last year pressed for changes that they said would improve governance, including setting up a special risk committee on the board, but they did not get the necessary votes.  Mr. Zuckerberg enjoys the protection of powerful voting shares. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment.Perhaps the biggest is that they can shield executives from pressures to bolster a company’s performance in the near term and give them more freedom to make investments that take time to pay off. Google has made that argument.Of course, it is possible for companies that don’t issue special controlling shares to shrug off the “short-termism” of the stock market. Amazon has plowed significant sums into new businesses for years and is among the most valuable companies in the world. But companies at a vulnerable stage in their development may benefit from giving control to their leaders as they pursue their visions for their companies. Lyft, for instance, is planning big investments in self-driving vehicle technology, and the company’s stock may suffer if they don’t immediately bear fruit. And though Facebook’s controlling shares may have helped set the stage for its stumbles, the arrangement may also have helped the company respond. Since the scandals, Facebook has increased its spending to safeguard its network. Wall Street analysts have at times questioned the need for such costs, but Mr. Zuckerberg can mostly ignore them because of the voting power in his hands.Some efforts to address the use of high-voting shares have focused on how long these classes of shares exist. Critics oppose arrangements that allow the holders to keep control until they die, or those that allow the shares to be passed on to descendants. These create what Mr. Jackson, the S.E.C. commissioner, has called “corporate royalty.”Instead of granting long-term or perpetual control, a few companies have adopted structures that convert controlling shares into ordinary shares after a certain number of years. But this approach has failed to gain traction. In the three years through 2018, only 29 percent of the I.P.O.s with special controlling shares had a provision that allow their superior voting power to expire after a certain period, according to a New York Times analysis of data provided by the Council of Institutional Investors, a group that has criticized unequal voting rights.Lyft’s controlling shares won’t lose any of their power over time, but the company has attempted to bolster its corporate governance by having an independent chairman. Other companies have taken this step, including Snap, but it hasn’t been enough to satisfy critics of unequal share classes. “A lot of companies think an independent chair is a good idea, but is that person going to last forever?” Mr. Jackson said, “Is there anything to stop them from removing the independent chair?”Pinterest has a seven-year time limit, but it only kicks in if the holders of the high-voting shares own less than half the shares they had just before I.P.O. “I would not count that as a true, time-based sunset,” said Andrew Winden, a fellow at Stanford Law School Rock Center for Corporate Governance, referring to phaseout provisions.

Lyft’s target value is significantly greater than its $15.1 billion valuation in its last private funding round, a sign that it expects a warm reception from investors.That provides a benchmark for other tech companies that are preparing to go public this year, including Lyft’s chief rival, Uber, as well as Pinterest, Postmates, Slack and others. All are seeking high valuations, with their offerings likely to bring a wave of wealth to tech investors, founders and early employees that will once again rev up the Silicon Valley start-up ecosystem. Lyft’s I.P.O. is expected to be quickly eclipsed by Uber, which may go public at a valuation of up to $120 billion.“We’re looking at Lyft as a bellwether for the summer I.P.O. market,” said Matthew Kennedy, a senior I.P.O. market strategist at Renaissance Capital. “The others in the pipeline are all watching Lyft and looking to see whether investors are interested in companies that are highly unprofitable but highly valuable.”But in a troubling trend for some investors, Lyft’s new filing also revealed how tech founders are continuing to assert control over their companies in a way that gives other shareholders very little say. Because of a mechanism that gives Lyft’s two founders — Logan Green, the chief executive, and John Zimmer, the president — outsize voting rights, the duo will own less than 5 percent of the company’s outstanding stock once it is public but they will control nearly 49 percent of its voting shares.The filing coincided with the start of Lyft’s so-called road show, a two-week run of meetings during which company executives and advisers will try to persuade prospective investors to grab a piece of what will the first ride-hailing firm to go public.Lyft’s offering will test how investors value the ride-hailing business model. Lyft and Uber have demonstrated rapid growth but neither company is profitable, and each spends heavily on subsidies for riders and drivers in an effort to win market share from each other. Lyft lost $911.3 million last year on revenue of $2.2 billion, the company disclosed in an earlier filing.In its new filing, Lyft proposed a high-end share price of $62 to $68, a range that would generate about $2.1 billion, and perhaps as much as $2.4 billion if demand for shares is great enough for the company to increase the number it makes available.Mr. Green and Mr. Zimmer are set to reap hundreds of millions of dollars apiece as a result of the offering, the updated prospectus showed. Mr. Green’s stake would be worth about $569 million at the high end of the expected initial share price; Mr. Zimmer’s would be worth about $393 million.Perhaps more important, the two men would retain control of Lyft, thanks to their ownership of a special class of shares that gives them 20 times the voting power of regular shareholders, despite each of them owning less than 3 percent of the company.The arrangement is common in I.P.O.s by founder-led technology companies. Facebook and Snap, for example, ensured that their creators would keep an iron grip on their businesses. But the practice has been criticized by investor advocates who say that it creates a disadvantage for regular shareholders.“This arrangement imposes a significant gap between those who exercise control over the company, and those who have economic exposure to the consequences of that control,” a coalition of institutional investors wrote in a letter last week to Lyft’s board that asked them to reconsider the arrangement.In a video promoting the company’s roadshow that was also released on Monday, Mr. Green and Mr. Zimmer discussed their reasons for founding Lyft. The video showed Mr. Green, 35, riding a public bus in San Francisco and recalling a visit to Zimbabwe, where he drew inspiration from car pools he saw there. Mr. Zimmer, 34, reflected on his time in hotel management while wandering through a hotel parking garage.In the video, the pair then meet in the back seat of a car, where they hinted at their advantages: Their company is still led by its founders, they said, and is solely focused on consumer transportation without side bets in food delivery and freight shipments. Their message was a dig at Uber, whose founders are no longer in executive roles at the company and which has expanded into food delivery with Uber Eats and freight shipments with Uber Freight.“Car ownership in the U.S. is failing people,” Mr. Zimmer said in the video, suggesting that the transportation industry will eventually flip from car ownership to ride services like Lyft.The price for Lyft’s shares is expected to be finalized on March 28, according to Ipreo, setting the company up to begin trading on the stock market on March 29.Kate Conger reported from San Francisco and Michael J. de la Merced from London.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Emma G. Fitzsimmons and Winnie Hu[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]A bus company has called lawmakers in New York asking for an exemption. A mayor in New Jersey warned drivers they might be tolled twice when they leave the state. Truckers are putting together a lobbying strategy. And taxi drivers have written a letter to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo seeking a reprieve.One battle over congestion pricing is over. But now that the plan is officially coming to New York City, the next fight has begun: Who will pay, how much will it cost and who might get a break?The outcry began almost immediately after Mr. Cuomo and state lawmakers reached a deal last weekend to make New York the first city in the country to enact congestion pricing. Starting in 2021, drivers entering the heart of Manhattan could pay $11 to $25, money that will be used to pay for improvements to the city’s troubled subway.State leaders were careful to avoid including too many details in the legislation, in part over concerns that it would be harder to pass. Instead, they left many of the difficult decisions to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and a yet-to-be-appointed six-member “traffic mobility review” board.But that has opened the way for various groups to try to influence the outcome in the months ahead and to make their case for exemptions and discounts.“We will be having discussions with the panel to educate them on the trucking industry and the challenges they have when it comes to delivering in the zone,” said Kendra Hems, the president of the Trucking Association of New York. “We feel very strongly that the industry should be exempt from paying.”But state officials and transit advocates say allowing too many loopholes could prevent the city from achieving its two major goals: reducing congestion and raising $15 billion for public transit.“The intent is not to have a whole list of exemptions,” said Robert Mujica, the state budget director. “You’re trying to discourage people from driving into the zone — that’s the only way to reduce traffic.”But that will not deter people from trying.“Every constituency in town is going to ask for a special exemption and carve out, but part of what makes congestion pricing work is that it’s fair and applies broadly,” said John Raskin, executive director of the Riders Alliance, an advocacy group.The stakes are high to get it right. New York could serve as an example for other cities, like Los Angeles and Philadelphia, that are also considering the idea. If it is a debacle, other cities might abandon their plans.In London, where congestion pricing began in 2003, the toll has risen to about $15 per day, from about $8. Residents who live in the zone get a discount, as do owners of low-emission vehicles. Taxis and other ride-hailing cars are exempt.The New York legislation included only a broad framework: The congestion zone is below 60th Street in Manhattan, except for the West Side Highway and F.D.R. Drive, two busy roadways on each side of the island. Emergency vehicles and those carrying disabled people are exempt. People who live in the zone and earn less than $60,000 a year can receive a tax credit.The framework has left ample room for complaints.Leaders in New Jersey say its drivers could get gouged. Gov. Philip D. Murphy asked Governor Cuomo for a discount for those who use the George Washington Bridge, the world’s busiest bridge.Steven Fulop, the mayor of Jersey City, said on Twitter that New Jersey should seek revenge by tolling New York drivers to pay for upgrades for New Jersey Transit, the state’s sputtering commuter rail and bus network. If some bridges and tunnels are discounted and not others, he said, that could lead to major traffic jams at certain crossings.“If you selectively exempt people based on politics, that’s a big issue for us,” Mr. Fulop said.The backlash in the region has been swift. About 54 percent of New York City voters oppose congestion pricing and more than half believe it would not reduce traffic, according to a Quinnipiac University Poll released on Tuesday.Drivers will likely pay $12 to $14 for cars and around $25 for trucks entering the city during peak business hours, and less at night and on weekends, said Samuel I. Schwartz, a traffic expert known as Gridlock Sam who was one of the architects of the congestion pricing plan. But if the authority starts handing out exemptions, that would likely push up tolls for everyone else to $15 or more.“I think there should be just about no exemptions,” he said. “People using their cars contribute to congestion. It doesn’t matter what group they belong to.”But even Mr. Schwartz has not been able to escape the calls for exemptions from friends and neighbors in northern Manhattan. “People are calling me asking for their own personal exemptions — even neighbors of mine,” he said. “I’m not terribly popular at the moment.”Sean Hughes, a spokesman for Coach USA, which operates hundreds of buses in Manhattan daily, said he has been calling, emailing and meeting with state lawmakers to make a case for exempting buses. Mr. Hughes said buses reduce congestion by carrying people who would otherwise be driving.“Busing is a form of mass transit that is a solution to congestion,” he said. “We should be exempt.”Several motorcycle clubs have also pressed state lawmakers for an exemption or discount, with their members saying that they should not have to pay the same fees as drivers since their two-wheelers contribute less to congestion than cars.“One car can take the space of six bikes,” said Joseph Notovitz, 64, a branding specialist from Long Island who regularly rides his motorcycle to and from Manhattan and weaves around cars trapped in gridlock.The transportation authority, the sprawling agency that oversees the subway, buses and commuter railroads, will determine the tolls and exemptions based on recommendations by a “traffic mobility review” board. The authority’s board, which has representatives from across the region, must also approve the tolls.The authority will appoint the mobility board, which must include one member recommended by New York City’s mayor. One member must live in the area served by the Metro-North Railroad and another must live along the Long Island Rail Road. Its findings are due around November 2020.Mr. Mujica said the mobility board will review a traffic study analysis of bridges and tunnels and consider public input before deciding whether to credit drivers who already pay tolls. The board, which will likely have members with experience in public transportation and finance, will also come up with a plan for taxis and ride-hail vehicles, including Uber.Uber, the popular ride-hail app, has been a key booster for congestion pricing. The company says it has spent more than $2 million to support the proposal. Uber has paid lobbyists more than $1 million in New York since 2017 and spent nearly $200,000 on television ads and phone calls to support congestion pricing last year, according to state records.Uber officials say congestion pricing is the best way to relieve traffic in the city, instead of blaming Uber for congested streets and imposing a cap on new ride-hail vehicles. Josh Gold, a spokesman for Uber, declined to comment on whether Uber might seek an exemption from the congestion toll.State Senator Todd Kaminsky, a Democrat from Long Island, said that he is pushing for a credit for Long Island commuters who use the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge on the way into Manhattan. “These people should not get double tolled,” he said.The authority’s bridges and tunnels division will technically oversee the tolling program. Its acting president, Daniel DeCrescenzo, along with the new M.T.A. chairman, Patrick Foye, will have considerable power over the plan. So will Mr. Cuomo, who appointed Mr. Foye and has taken near total control over the transit agency.Taxi leaders are writing a letter to Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Foye asking for an exemption for an industry that has already been decimated by the rise of Uber. Nicolae Hent, a Queens taxi driver, said the new tolls in Manhattan could add up to hundreds of dollars a month.“It’s another nail in the coffin,” he said. “Of course, I’m going to fight.”Angela Macropoulos contributed reporting.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Michael J. de la Merced and Kate CongerLyft was not the first ride-hailing company. But it is poised to become the first publicly traded one, and investors’ appetite for its shares proved enormous.The company priced its shares at $72 each on Thursday, after raising its price range amid significant demand from prospective shareholders. That puts Lyft’s value at more than $24 billion as it prepares to begin trading on the Nasdaq stock market on Friday, under the ticker symbol LYFT.In total, the company raised about $2.3 billion, having also increased the number of shares that were sold. (That amount could grow if Lyft’s underwriters sell an additional block of shares to meet even stronger-than-expected investor demand.)The offering marks the arrival of a new generation of Silicon Valley darlings on the public markets. Many of the companies promised new business models, upended established industries such as transportation and triggered a chain effect on how people work and make a living. The public offerings cement the place of the companies in people’s lives, promise millions of dollars in investment gains for their longtime backers and are set to unleash a new wave of wealth in the tech industry.[Lyft’s shares soared on Friday when it began trading on public markets.]Among those set to follow in Lyft’s footsteps is its archrival, Uber, whose initial public offering in the next few months is expected to be the biggest in years. Others on the docket include the digital pin board company Pinterest, the messaging platform Slack and the delivery service Postmates, all betting that they will also gain enthusiastic backing from investors.Some of the most valuable tech start-ups are preparing to go public, and the I.P.O.s promise to generate big paydays for employees and investors.“The strong demand for Lyft certainly bodes well for other unicorns,” said Jay Ritter, a professor at the University of Florida’s Warrington College of Business, using a term for start-ups valued at $1 billion or more.But some investors worry that these companies, awash in red ink and unlikely to turn a profit for years, are being valued too highly and could ultimately disappoint their new public-market backers. Some companies that went public while running big losses, including Groupon and Snap, now trade well below their I.P.O. prices.In its offering prospectus, Lyft revealed that it lost close to $1 billion in 2018. Lyft and Uber regularly lose money in their competition to win new markets, where they spend amply on subsidies for riders and drivers. The companies also burn cash on other transportation initiatives, like bikes, scooters and autonomous vehicles. Last year, Lyft bought the largest bike-sharing company in the United States for around $250 million.“With Lyft, obviously, the market is saying, ‘We’re willing to give you the benefit of the doubt on a lot of things,’ given that there are huge uncertainties about its future,” Mr. Ritter said.At its I.P.O. price, Lyft’s market value puts it within range of old-line auto companies like Ford Motor. It is a significant increase from the $15.1 billion that Lyft earned in its last private fund-raising round last year.Over the past week and a half, Lyft executives and their bankers embarked on a roadshow that took them from New York to Kansas City to San Francisco, pitching their business to institutional investors. Lyft initially set a price range of $62 to $68 for its shares, before raising that range on Wednesday to $70 to $72. The offering was led by JPMorgan Chase and Credit Suisse.Between 2001 and 2018, I.P.O.s that were priced above their initial range averaged a return of 37 percent, Mr. Ritter said.But Lyft must now prove that it is worth the eye-popping valuation bestowed upon it by its new public-market investors. That challenge includes maintaining its enviable growth rate — it more than doubled its revenue in 2018 — while showing that its focus on transportation, rather than branching out into ever-more business lines as Uber has, can be lucrative.The offering’s success will bring windfalls for Lyft’s biggest existing investors. Among them: the company’s founders, Logan Green and John Zimmer, who are poised to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars; Rakuten, the Japanese e-commerce giant; and venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz.Though Mr. Green and Mr. Zimmer are taking their company public, they will still retain control, following in a long tradition of founder-led technology businesses. The two own special holdings that give them nearly 49 percent of voting shares, despite owning less than 5 percent of the overall stock.Lyft also plans to give cash bonuses to drivers who have completed a large number of rides for the company, so that they can buy shares at the I.P.O. price. Drivers with 10,000 rides will receive $1,000, which at the $72 price would allow them to buy 13 shares before taxes. Drivers who have finished 20,000 rides will receive $10,000.Only full-time drivers who have been with the platform for several years are likely to make the cut, said Harry Campbell, an Uber and Lyft driver who runs the driver blog and resource site The Rideshare Guy.“It was the right thing to do,” he said of Lyft’s cash bonuses for drivers. “If you gave 10,000 rides for Lyft, you actually were a big part of helping build this company.” He added that the I.P.O. was “kind of exciting to be part of” for drivers.Unlike Lyft’s employees and early investors, who are restricted by a lockup period from selling their shares, drivers will be able to sell any Lyft stock purchased through the cash bonus program as soon as the company begins trading on the public market, according to an email sent to qualifying drivers and reviewed by The New York Times.But the cash bonuses ultimately did not satisfy many drivers, who work as freelancers for Lyft and Uber and do not receive full-time employee benefits. This week, hundreds of them protested in San Francisco and Los Angeles against lower pay rates.“If political will starts to shift against Uber and Lyft, that’s a scary proposition,” Mr. Campbell said.Follow Michael J. de la Merced and Kate Conger on Twitter: @m_delamerced and @kateconger.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Kate Conger and Michael J. de la MercedSAN FRANCISCO — Owning a piece of the gig economy became a reality for millions on Friday when Lyft began trading on the public markets, signaling the start of a stream of stock offerings expected from high-profile technology companies this year.Lyft’s shares rose 8.7 percent in its first day of trading after opening at $87.24, far above the public offering price of $72. By the end of the day, the ride-hailing firm’s market value stood at $26.4 billion, making it one of the most valuable American companies to go public in the last decade. At that level, it was more than 23 times the valuation of the parent company of Hertz, the rental car provider, and bigger than the parent of United Airlines.Lyft’s public market debut formalized the rise of the sharing economy, even though persistent questions remain about the effect of gig-type work on people’s quality of life and their wages. When ride-hailing companies like Lyft and Uber began growing this decade, they hawked their kind of work — where drivers are freelancers who drive only when they want to — as providing flexibility. But with drivers ineligible to receive employee benefits like health care, the businesses have since prompted lawsuits and labor protests.Gig economy companies also have not proved a business fundamental: that they can make money. While Lyft and Uber have been expanding rapidly, they have lost close to or more than $1 billion a year. And the companies are spending heavily on new initiatives like food delivery, electric bikes and self-driving vehicles, making profits a distant prospect.[Unicorns are riding into the public markets, and their elite early investors will be the biggest winners.]Even so, Lyft’s offering means that people will now own shares of the company in their mutual funds and stock portfolios, giving them more of a vested interest in the financial outcomes of gig economy firms. That will be compounded when Uber, the world’s biggest ride-hailing operator, goes public in the next few months in what is expected to be the largest initial public offering of the past five years. Uber will almost certainly become part of index funds, which underlie the retirement portfolios of millions of Americans.“Their business model is completely reliant on an unsettled issue, which is the status of their drivers,” Veena Dubal, an employment and labor law professor at the University of California’s Hastings College of the Law, said of ride-hailing companies. “They’ve been trying to shift risk onto workers, and now they are shifting risk onto investors as well.”Those risks sent jitters through some investors on Friday, with Lyft’s shares falling after opening up strongly. The stock dipped to roughly $80 before declining further near the end of trading to finish the day at $78.29.But others turned a blind eye to the steep losses and heavy spending, which bodes well for the herd of other coming tech offerings. Apart from Uber, those set to join the I.P.O. bonanza are Pinterest, the digital pin board; the messaging company Slack; the delivery company Postmates; and the home-fitness company Peloton.Some of the most valuable tech start-ups are preparing to go public, and the I.P.O.s promise to generate big paydays for employees and investors.Interest in buying Lyft’s stock was so high that demand outstripped supply within the first two days of the company’s road show to pitch prospective investors this month. By the end, the I.P.O. was 20 times oversubscribed, Lyft told investors on Friday.Lyft’s high listing price and performance are a “reflection of the appetite” from investors, said Tom White, a senior vice president at D. A. Davidson, a wealth and asset management firm. “Right now, I think investors generally are focused on growth.”With its initial offering, Lyft leapt ahead of Uber to become the first publicly traded ride-hailing firm. Logan Green and John Zimmer, Lyft’s founders, celebrated the event on Friday in Los Angeles, where pink confetti rained down them as they marked the occasion. The pair had founded Zimride, a long-distance car-pooling service for college students, in 2007. Zimride evolved into Lyft, which initially used the gimmick of fuzzy bubblegum-colored mustaches to distinguish its service.Mr. Green, 35, who grew up in Santa Monica, and has cited heavy traffic in the area as an inspiration for Lyft, and Mr. Zimmer, 34, used the I.P.O. to announce a program called Lyft City Works. The program will donate $50 million to transportation initiatives in cities where it operates.Mr. Green said he planned to further expand Lyft into other modes of transportation, including public transit.“We want Lyft to be the first app that you open up,” he said. “The biggest investments we’re making today are broadening the portfolio of products that you can access within Lyft.”The offering increased Mr. Green’s and Mr. Zimmer’s wealth, while allowing them to maintain tight control over their company. The pair hold a special class of shares that give them extra voting power, a practice common among tech founders but criticized by investor advocates.During the nearly two-week road show, Lyft pitched itself to institutional investors as a mission-driven company focused on reshaping the transportation industry. It emphasized its do-gooder stance on encouraging car-pooling and reducing the environmental impacts of individual car ownership.Investors’ most frequent question during the road show was what the company would look like in five years, Mr. Zimmer said. “Investors realized that ride-sharing is the tip of the iceberg,” he said.Using independent contractors to provide services has indubitably become the keystone of a generation of tech companies, from ride-hailing apps to food delivery services like DoorDash to hair and makeup services like Glamsquad. Some researchers said contingent work could account for 43 percent of the American work force by next year, though the Department of Labor has reported that the number of workers in gig roles has remained mostly flat since 2005.“I think it’s quite clear that this is part of a larger trend in the economy,” said Sean Aggarwal, Lyft’s chairman. “That makes it an exciting story for the long-term investor. It gives them an opportunity to participate not just in this gig economy transformation but also in this larger trend of transportation as a service.”Mr. White of D. A. Davidson said the good will toward Lyft would eventually evaporate if it ultimately couldn’t make money.“As we get closer to 2020, there will be an expectation that we see them narrow the losses,” he said.Follow Kate Conger and Michael J. de la Merced on Twitter: @kateconger and @m_delamerced.Kate Conger reported from San Francisco, and Michael J. de la Merced from London.OpinionAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Noam ScheiberIt’s one of the most vexing challenges facing the labor movement: how to wield influence in an era increasingly dominated by technology giants that are often resistant to unions.Are workers best served when unions take an adversarial stance toward such companies? Or should labor groups seek cooperation with employers, even if the resulting deals do little to advance labor’s broader goals?The debate has flared up around labor’s efforts to make inroads with the likes of Uber and Airbnb, businesses that allow drivers and homeowners to earn income as contractors. And it was on vivid display in the political battle over Amazon’s plan to create a new headquarters in New York with 25,000 jobs.The plan fell apart in the face of a backlash over public subsidies, resentment of the covert process in which the city and the state negotiated the deal, and concern about its neighborhood impact. But labor issues were also a factor, giving rise to tensions even among unions.In the more confrontational camp were labor groups led by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which called on the city and the state to withhold nearly $3 billion in subsidies unless Amazon established a “fair process” for its warehouse workers in the city to unionize. The retail workers said they were open to negotiating what that meant.“I think we stood on principle,” said Stuart Appelbaum, the retail workers’ president. “If you’re aggressively anti-union, we shouldn’t be giving you subsidies.”A company executive told the City Council last month that Amazon would not remain neutral in an organizing campaign at its local facilities, though an Amazon spokesman said this week, “We respect the rights of our employees to choose to join or not join a union.”In the engagement camp was the local council of building trade unions, whose members were likely to get work from the construction of Amazon’s headquarters in Queens. They were joined by a Service Employees International Union local, which had gained the right to represent janitors and other service workers at the Queens complex.[Read more: How New York City became a tech town, without leaning on big tech.]“Their presence in New York — a progressive community, a union town — was eventually going to lead to some potential change down the road,” said Héctor J. Figueroa, the president of the service employees local, known as 32BJ.In terms of economic, political and cultural impact, the finance industry dominates. But tech is gaining fast, and is where much of the growth is.In some respects, these arguments go back decades. Thomas Kochan, a management professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, noted that the United Automobile Workers and General Motors negotiated a new arrangement when the company set up its Saturn division in the mid-1980s. In exchange for a role in managerial duties, the union agreed to forgo many of the work rules typical in other plants, such as those governing which worker could do what job. The arrangement stoked tensions within the union and the company for years.But in recent years the growing reach of tech conglomerates has created urgency within labor to court their workers, Mr. Kochan said.Despite their minimal presence in these companies, unions have a variety of levers to pull. They can exert influence through politicians when public subsidies are involved, as in the Amazon case. And they can pressure regulators to scrutinize businesses that upend traditional industries, like transportation and hospitality.Whether to use these levers to force concessions, or to take a less adversarial approach that would give labor a foothold in big tech, has divided the labor movement.In 2016, Uber reached a five-year agreement with a regional branch of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers to create a drivers’ guild, which would advocate on behalf of drivers but not challenge their status as independent contractors. The Machinists would also have to refrain from turning the guild into a formal union during that time. In exchange, Uber agreed to provide the organization with funding and a way to communicate directly with drivers. The guild says a majority of its revenue comes from other sources.A rival group representing professional drivers criticized the Machinists for creating a so-called company union — federal law prohibits unions that companies fund or control, though the law applies only to workers who are employees. Some union officials complained that the guild was anti-democratic, since drivers hadn’t elected Machinists officials to represent them.But Sharon Block, a senior Labor Department official under President Barack Obama, argued that the deal was defensible. Ms. Block pointed out that the guild had taken something of a hybrid approach between cooperation and antagonism, lobbying for policies such as a minimum earnings standard for drivers and allowing passengers to tip, both of which have been enacted in New York.“There are situations in which taking the half loaf can be worthwhile,” Ms. Block said.Around the same time, the Service Employees International Union was completing a deal with Airbnb in which the company would connect hosts who needed their homes cleaned with unionized workers, an approach that the two sides were already testing in New York and Los Angeles.The agreement collapsed after a prominent hospitality workers union, Unite Here, protested that the deal would merely provide political cover to Airbnb, which the union accuses of destroying good-paying hotel jobs and creating housing shortages.The union’s president, D. Taylor, said that Unite Here was always open to working with employers, but that unions typically lacked the clout to cut good deals when they wandered into an industry where their presence was weak.“You’re settling a contract that has lower standards than the dominant union in that industry could get because you don’t have leverage,” Mr. Taylor said.The service workers’ union declined to comment.Given the number of people Amazon employs — more than 250,000 in the United States, not including seasonal workers — and its influence over numerous industries, the proposed New York headquarters arguably represented the highest stakes yet for a test of these competing approaches.Some experts said a deal allowing a union to represent building-service workers at the proposed Amazon complex could have been valuable.“They have the opportunity to show the people who work there at all levels that unionization is good,” said Catherine Fisk, an expert on labor law at the University of California, Berkeley. “That it’s a way to equitably allocate wages, that there is an orderly process for dealing with sexual harassment allegations, with issues about absenteeism — whatever the company is concerned about.”But others were skeptical that allowing janitorial workers to unionize would have any benefit for the company’s broader work force in New York, much less anywhere else in the country.The problem, said Ruth Milkman, a sociologist at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, is that servicing buildings is just too far removed from what most Amazon workers do. Many companies have unionized building-service workers but are otherwise union-free, she said.Like those companies, Amazon seemed intent on drawing the line at service workers: It walked away from discussions with labor about a framework that could have made it easier to organize employees who perform core functions, like packing goods at the company’s fulfillment centers.The question is whether Amazon can sustain this hard line indefinitely. If it can, progressives and labor activists may have contributed to the loss of 25,000 jobs and billions in future tax revenue without winning any tangible benefits for workers.But there is reason to believe that Amazon may have to bargain with labor in New York at some point, and that unions and other progressive groups will have established an important principle when that happens.After all, many of Amazon’s facilities are not like automobile plants or call centers, in that the company can easily plunk them down anywhere. Amazon tends to locate warehouses reasonably close to customers, of whom there are potentially millions in the New York area. It has sought to put its white-collar hubs in areas with many high-skilled workers, a practice that also favors cities like New York.In its statement about the demise of the Queens plan, the company noted that there “are currently over 5,000 Amazon employees in Brooklyn, Manhattan and Staten Island, and we plan to continue growing these teams.”And that logic is likely to apply to a variety of tech companies that seek customers and workers in liberal hubs.“You don’t have huge numbers of highly educated people who they need who want to move to small cities in Arkansas,” Professor Fisk said. “I think California and New York and a lot of other places may have more leverage to insist on the highroad approach.”Follow Noam Scheiber on Twitter: @noamscheiber.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBitsBy Jamie CondliffeHi. I’m Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here’s a look at the week’s tech news:Machines are more than ever controlled by software, not humans. Occasionally it goes fatally wrong.On March 10, 157 people died when an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 Max 8 jet crashed. Five months earlier, another crash of the same model of airplane killed 189 people. There are indications that software intended to prevent the jets from stalling may have played a role in both accidents.Reporting by The New York Times suggests that the software didn’t receive a detailed review by the Federal Aviation Administration before it entered use: Under new rules, the agency delegated much of the responsibility to Boeing. If the software was at fault, and the problem did slip through the regulatory net, it raises questions about how safety-critical technology is vetted.Those questions will become more important over the next few years.A year ago, an Arizona woman was struck and killed by one of Uber’s autonomous cars. The vehicle’s autonomy systems failed to brake, as did the safety driver behind the wheel.Companies like Uber and Waymo, along with most of the auto industry, expect autonomous cars to proliferate over the next decade. Such advances aren’t limited to cars — they will further automate everything from air travel to food delivery. They are built on technologies, like artificial intelligence, that will make split-second decisions for humans.The Boeing software was designed to perform a simple task: Nudge the airplane’s nose down based on sensor readings if a stall was anticipated. As harder tasks are handed to software, the stakes rise.“As you create more advanced A.I. systems, the harm that can result from them failing can be really large,” said Jade Leung, a researcher at Oxford University’s Center for the Governance of Artificial Intelligence.But increasing the complexity of systems makes checking them more difficult. Hardware, from chips to special sensors, can be difficult to test. And it can be difficult for humans to understand how some A.I. algorithms make decisions.Ms. Leung said regulators needed to be more aware of tail-end risks — the highly unlikely but catastrophic events that could occur if something malfunctioned. That might mean introducing more conservative rules that relax as technology matures, ideally developed in tandem with technologists who understand deeply how the systems work.“Verifying the performance and safety of software is a really, really hard technical challenge,” Ms. Leung said. Nonetheless, it’s a challenge that has to be addressed.When a company spends billions on world-leading digital infrastructure, it naturally wants to wring every last cent of revenue out of it. That’s partly what is driving Google’s new Stadia gaming service, announced on Tuesday.Google’s pitch is straightforward: Think of it as Netflix for gaming. As long as they have a fast internet connection, users can pay a subscription to play high-definition games, akin to what they’d find on current top-end consoles, on any computer, phone or tablet.The company’s promise: that its cloud infrastructure makes that achievable. It will add racks of gaming-specific chips to existing server farms to essentially give people an on-demand, remote gaming computer. And Google officials believe that since most users are now so close to its pervasive hardware, lag won’t be a problem — an issue that held back earlier game streaming platforms, like the now-defunct OnLive.Google is not alone in the push into what some people see as the future of gaming. Microsoft had already announced that it planned to offer a trial of a similar service for Xbox consoles, computers and mobile devices this year. Amazon, which owns the game-watching service Twitch, is widely believed to be planning something similar, built on its Amazon Web Services cloud infrastructure.Those three companies happen to be the world’s largest cloud providers. It’s not surprising that they’re enamored of the idea of taking a slice of the $135 billion gaming industry, when all it could take is the flex of an existing muscle.About $500 million should buy a lot of computer. This past week, we found out how much. Writing for The Times, Don Clark explained what the Department of Energy would get for dropping that sum on a supercomputer:Lab officials predict it will be the first American machine to reach a milestone called “exascale” performance, surpassing a quintillion calculations per second. That’s roughly seven times the speed rating of the most powerful system built to date.The device, called Aurora, will be used to figure out everything from how drugs work to the impact of climate change. It’s also a useful indicator of the nation’s competitiveness in science and technology — or, at this point, whether it’s leading or lagging behind China. On that front, Mr. Clark reports that it has been a mixed bag for the United States:An IBM system called Summit, built for the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, took back the No. 1 position last year on a twice-yearly ranking of the world’s 500 most powerful systems — a spot held by China for five years. But China leads by another key measure: It accounted for 227 systems on the Top 500 list, compared with 109 for the United States.China is expected to have its own exascale supercomputer running as soon as 2020 — a full year before Aurora boots up.Google received its third antitrust fine from the European Union since 2017. This one, for 1.5 billion euros, or about $1.7 billion, was for imposing unfair terms on the search service it offers to other websites.Facebook will stop targeting some of its ads. It will no longer allow advertising of housing, jobs or credit to be aimed at those of a certain race, gender or age group.The Pentagon’s giant cloud contract has a one-man holdup. Deap Ubhi, a little-known entrepreneur, is at the center of a legal battle between Amazon and Oracle over the $10 billion project.Take a look at an early iPhone prototype. It’s red, about the size of an old computer motherboard and helped engineers to program the first breakthrough smartphone.A.I. researchers could give computers a little more credit. Rich Sutton, a pioneer of some of today’s most effective A.I. techniques, argues that a “bitter lesson” in artificial intelligence is that “the only thing that matters in the long run is the leveraging of computation.”Why is there still relatively little tech regulation? “Lawmakers are reluctant to disrupt the enormous wealth creation machine that technology has turned out to be,” according to the security expert Bruce Schneier.Screen sharing can be an easy route to professional humiliation.

Follow him on Twitter here: @jme_c.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byGood Sunday morning, and welcome to a special edition of the DealBook Briefing, where we’ll take a deep dive into Lyft’s upcoming public offering. It’s the first of many decacorns about to go public. (Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up here.)Lyft plans to make its public market debut in the coming week. The car sharing company’s I.P.O. will be the first of many highly valued tech companies that are expected to hit American stock exchanges this year.Uber, Slack, Postmates and Pinterest have all filed documents with the S.E.C. to list shares. Palantir, Peloton and possibly Airbnb are expected to follow later this year.America’s most successful start-ups have remained off-limits to most investors for years:• Venture capital cash allowed America’s current wave of unicorns to eschew the public markets — and the spotlight that comes with them.• That means a large portion of investors have been unable to buy a slice of the fastest-growing start-ups.With Lyft’s I.P.O., that’s about to change, which explains much of the excitement it is generating. Here’s your cheat sheet for the offering.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Stephen Grocer in New York and edited by Jamie Condliffe in London.____________________________Founded by Logan Green and John Zimmer in 2007, Lyft was initially called Zimride and focused on pooling riders for long-distance trips. In 2012, Mr. Green and Mr. Zimmer renamed the company Lyft and shifted the business toward providing short trips, mimicking taxi rides.Here’s how it sizes up today:• Lyft gave 18.6 million people at least one ride in the last quarter of 2018, up from 6.6 million in late 2016.• It has a 39 percent share of the United States ride-sharing market,  based on estimates by the Japanese e-commerce company Rakuten, which is an investor in Lyft. That is up from 22 percent in 2016. But Lyft has been offering discounts to riders ahead of its offering, and the company warned: “We believe that much of the growth in our rider base and the number of drivers on our platform is attributable to our paid marketing initiatives.”• Lyft only operates in the U.S. and Canada, unlike Uber, which has operations across the globe.• But it has matched its rival’s innovation, by developing self-driving car technology and expanding into short-term bike and scooter rentals.Lyft will list its shares on the Nasdaq under the ticker of, er, “LYFT.”The company expects to be valued at as much as $23 billion. It plans to sell about 35.4 million shares, including the additional shares allotted to the underwriters, at between $62 to $68 a piece. At the high-end of that range, it will raise $2.4 billion.That’s well above the $15.1 billion that private investors valued it at during a financing round in June.And it would make it one of the largest I.P.O.s in the past 10 years. At a $23 billion valuation, Lyft’s offering would rank as the fifth largest since the financial crisis, and among the largest ever for American technology start-ups — only Facebook’s I.P.O. in 2012 would be larger. JPMorgan Chase, Credit Suisse and Jefferies are the lead underwriters of the I.P.O. for Lyft. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the top underwriters of tech I.P.O.s recently, are both working on Uber’s offering.In all, Lyft will have 29 underwriters for its I.P.O., 13 (or 45 percent) of which are firms owned or led by women, minorities and military veterans. By comparison, such firms accounted for 30 percent of the underwriters Facebook selected for its I.P.O. and 14 percent for Snap’s.After going public, the company will have two classes of stock: class A shares, which carry one vote each, and class B shares, which carry 20 votes. Lyft plans to sell only class A shares in the offering.Lyft’s two founders will hold the Class B shares. That means that Mr. Green, the C.E.O., and Mr. Zimmer, the president, will own roughly 5 percent of the company’s outstanding stock but control nearly 49 percent of its voting shares.This is quite normal in Silicon Valley. Facebook and Google went public with a dual-class structure that gave outside shareholders one vote per share and insiders 10 votes per share. Snap went further: It issued only nonvoting shares during its 2017 I.P.O.But the practice is increasingly controversial among governance experts. Kenneth Bertsch, the executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors, said in a letter to Lyft’s outside board members: “The principle of one-share, one-vote is a foundation of good corporate governance and equitable treatment of investors.”Companies with dual-class stock structures outperformed those with a single stock structure in recent years, according to some studies. But prior to 2010, studies show, such companies didn’t perform as well.Lyft is growing quickly. Its revenue more than doubled to $2.16 billion last year from 2017.Its losses are also increasing, though not nearly as quickly. The company reported a loss of $911 million last year, up from $688 million in 2017. Total costs and expenses were $3.1 billion in 2018, up 77 percent from $1.8 billion in 2017. Uber’s losses are smaller in percentage terms. Lyft’s rival, which has disclosed its finances for several years even though it is not public, said in February that it lost $1.8 billion in 2018 on net revenue of $11.3 billion.Bookings, which represent fares less taxes, tolls and tips, surpassed $8 billion last year for Lyft, 76 percent more than in 2017. (In 2018, Uber increased its bookings to $50 billion, up 45 percent from 2017.)Lyft plans to funnel some future profits into ethical investing. In its pitch to investors, it says it expects “to invest the greater of 1% of our profits or $50 million annually toward our social impact efforts.”The risk factor section of any I.P.O. prospectus acts as a warning label for investors. Lyft’s is no different, but it offers a discussion of regulatory and data security issues that could become a recurring theme in this year’s I.P.O.s.Rivals: The company faces a long list of competitors on several fronts. Uber, Gett (along with its acquisition Juno) and Via are its main ride-sharing rivals, along with regular taxi companies and automotive manufacturers, such as BMW, that are looking to enter the sector. Its bike and scooter sharing business faces competition from Lime, Bird and Uber’s acquisition Jump. And Waymo, Apple, Baidu, Uber and a number of other tech and auto companies compete with it on autonomous vehicles.Regulation: Lyft says its industry is “rapidly evolving and increasingly regulated.” It warns investors that it has “been subject to intense regulatory pressure from state and municipal regulatory authorities across the United States and Canada, and a number of them have imposed limitations on or attempted to ban ride sharing.”Labor: Lyft’s million-plus drivers are independent contractors, not employees. Legal actions that classify them as employees “could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations,” the company says.Autonomous driving: Among the biggest risks involved in the push to driverless cars is getting beaten in the race. The first companies to offer autonomous ride sharing “are expected to have long-term advantages compared with traditional non-autonomous ride sharing offerings,” Lyft says.For Lyft’s current shareholders and employees, the I.P.O. could provide a windfall. Here’s a rundown of who stands to gain.• Mr. Green and Mr. Zimmer will hold stakes in the company that are set to be worth $570 million and $390 million, respectively.• The Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten is Lyft’s biggest shareholder, with a 13 percent stake. At $68 a share, its holdings would be valued at $2.1 billion. It will own 11.6 percent of Lyft’s stock after the I.P.O.• General Motors invested $500 million in Lyft in 2016. That stake could be worth as much as $1.27 billion at the time of the I.P.O.• The fund giant Fidelity is Lyft’s third largest shareholder. Its stake could be worth as much as $1.26 billion.• Alphabet owns 12,828,964 shares, most of them purchased by its venture capital arm, CapitalG. That stake is worth $870 million at the high end of the range.• The venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz was among the earliest investors in Lyft. At $68 a share, the firm’s stake will be valued at just over $1 billion.Governments and money managers have made a push to improve gender diversity on corporate boards. Last fall, California, where Lyft is headquartered, became the first state to require its publicly held corporations to include women on their boards.Lyft will have three women on its board:• Valerie Jarrett. The former senior adviser to President Barack Obama has been on Lyft’s board since July 2017.• Maggie Wilderotter. The former chief executive of the telecom company Frontier Communications joined Lyft’s board in May 2018.• Ann Miura-Ko. The co-founder of Floodgate Fund, a venture capital firm, has served on the board since June 2016.Rounding out the board of directors are: its chairman, Sean Aggarwal, of Soar Capital; Ben Horowitz of Andreessen Horowitz; David Lawee of CapitalG; and Hiroshi Mikitani of Rakuten.Lyft and Uber are unlike any other businesses, Shira Ovide of Bloomberg Opinion writes. That “makes it difficult for potential investors to feel confident that they’re paying the right price given the potential reward and the potential risk that the on-demand ride business isn’t financially viable or as large as optimists believe.”Lyft’s investors “will need to strap themselves in for what may be long periods of rather ugly numbers,” according to Heard on the Street’s Dan Gallagher. That’s because “decacorns tend to share two characteristics: plenty of money and a propensity to spend it in a race to build up share.”“Investors may still want to decide between” Lyft and Uber, argues Richard Beales of Breakingviews. “If their fear of missing out allows them to look past the absence of foreseeable profit at either company, though, it’s hard to see any sensible course other than to put money on both.”“The last time a fast-growing, lossmaking tech company tried this hard to persuade Wall Street to judge it by its own measure of profits, things didn’t end well,” the FT’s Richard Waters writes. He is referring to Groupon.An I.P.O. prospectus often features an idealistic, sometimes corny, letter from the company’s founders about their vision for the firm. Here are a couple of choice cuts from Lyft’s letter:“The Y in Lyft. The why in what Lyft is doing is most important to us, as well as the cities and communities we serve, and it will always be our company’s North Star. Lyft’s mission is to: improve people’s lives with the world’s best transportation.”“Lyft has the opportunity to deliver one of the most significant shifts to society since the advent of the car. We do not take that lightly, and we intend to lead this shift with integrity, humanity and strong execution.”Thanks for reading!

But it failed to spell out why anyone should take the company up on its offer.• Apple TV Plus will offer new original content, as well as programs from channels like HBO and Showtime. Reese Witherspoon, Steven Spielberg and Jennifer Aniston took the stage to make the announcement, but details — even about fundamentals like pricing — were glaringly absent.• Apple News Plus gives access to 300 magazines, including The New Yorker and National Geographic, as well as newspapers like the LAT and the WSJ for $9.99 a month. But it’s unclear whether you’ll get all the content — business stories and analysis will remain exclusive to full WSJ subscribers, who pay $39 a month, for example — so it’s not quite as robust an offering as it first seems.• Apple Arcade is a video game subscription service that will launch later this year. Surprise: No details were given about how much it would cost, or which games would be included.• Apple Card is the company’s new credit card, which has been developed with Goldman Sachs. It’s meant to work mainly on the iPhone, with users receiving 2 percent cash back on the same day if they make purchases through Apple Pay. Some important questions you might have — such as credit limit and interest rate — weren’t answered.The company is betting that consumers will be tempted by the convenience (and, presumably, slick experience) of having one company provide every scrap of content to them. But its success will rest on the quality of the content and the value on offer — and we still have little idea about either.Lobbyists for clients like Uber and Handy are pressing legislatures to keep workers from being deemed employees, Noam Scheiber of the NYT writes:• In December, a Texas regulator proposed that companies using a “digital network” to dispatch workers, as Uber does with car drivers, could label them contractors rather than employees.• That’s a big deal for gig-economy companies, who want to designate workers as contractors to avoid paying unemployment insurance and overtime, saving billions.• This month, it came to light that Tusk Ventures, a venture-capital and political-strategy firm, appears to have been the primary author of the Texas proposal.• Tusk was retained by the on-demand cleaning and repairs company Handy, and is run by Bradley Tusk, once a top political consultant for Uber and a large shareholder who could make millions when the company goes public.• Tusk has also pursued similar efforts in other states, like Illinois.• “Worker advocacy groups say the goal is to chip away at classification rules in enough places to create pressure for a broad exemption nationally,” Mr. Scheiber writes.Last year, Michael Avenatti became a celebrity for representing Stormy Daniels, the adult film star, in her fight against President Trump. Yesterday, he was arrested for what prosecutors said was an attempted shakedown of Nike.Mr. Avenatti threatened the sports giant, saying he would release evidence showing that its employees had given money to college recruits — unless he and an unnamed client were paid at least $22.5 million, prosecutors said.“The company will die — not die, but they are going to incur cut after cut after cut after cut, and that’s what’s going to happen as soon as this thing becomes public,” Mr. Avenatti told Nike lawyers in a meeting that was recorded.The federal charges were announced around the time that Mr. Avenatti tweeted that he planned to hold a news conference to accuse Nike of “a major high school/college basketball scandal.”“When lawyers use their law licenses as weapons, as a guise to extort payments for themselves, they are no longer acting as attorneys,” Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said yesterday.Britain’s lawmakers grabbed control of the nation’s departure from the E.U. yesterday, in a move that highlights the struggles of Prime Minister Theresa May, Stephen Castle of the NYT reports.Parliament gave itself power to vote on alternative Brexit plans. “Its attempt to take control of the process came as Mrs. May prepared for a last-ditch effort to persuade lawmakers to support her withdrawal plan, which has already been rejected twice by huge margins,” Mr. Castle writes.It will hold a series of votes tomorrow on alternatives to Mrs. May’s plan. “These could include a so-called ‘soft Brexit’ that would keep Britain tied into European economic structures; a second referendum, revoking Brexit completely; or leaving without any deal,” Mr. Castle explains.“Mrs. May said she could not commit to honoring the outcome of any of these nonbinding parliamentary votes, particularly if they contradicted the pro-Brexit stance in the Conservative Party’s manifesto for the 2017 general election.”But the situation challenges Britain’s political traditions, where the government normally controls the agenda in Parliament, and “could create a constitutional showdown,” according to Mr. Castle.The ride-hailing giant said this morning that it will acquire Careem, its main competitor in the region, for $3.1 billion, Kate Conger of the NYT reports.The deal comes ahead of Uber’s I.P.O., and could give a boost to the company’s financial prospects in the region by eliminating a rival. It also gives Uber immediate access to several markets where it doesn’t currently operate, including Iraq, Morocco and Palestine.The deal represents a change in strategy, since Uber has largely sought to form joint ventures with international rivals like Didi Chuxing of China and Yandex of Russia.But it could raise privacy concerns, Ms. Conger writes. Careem will keep operating under its own name, but will eventually share some features with Uber. Though Uber has declined to share user data with the Egyptian government, Careem was more open to doing so.At the center of the college bribery scheme that ensnared celebrities and financiers is Rick Singer, a higher-education guru who said he was able to get applicants into top schools. The WSJ traced one way he operated: partnering with financial advisory firms.• He was a regular on the financial speaking circuit, the WSJ reports, “which allowed Mr. Singer to move through elite circles in finance, tech and entertainment.” His services often spread through word of mouth.• “Mr. Singer listed work with other financial-services firms, including Oppenheimer and Morgan Stanley, on his website and social media.”• “Employees at bond-fund giant Pacific Investment Management Co., based in Newport Beach, Calif., twice invited Mr. Singer to speak about the college-admission process, and the company said some there used his legitimate services.” (Douglas Hodge, the former C.E.O. of Pimco, as the company is known, has been charged in the bribery scheme.)• “In November 2017, for instance, an employee at a Los Angeles-based financial adviser emailed Mr. Singer, introducing him to a parent who wished to make a ‘donation’ to ‘one of those top schools’ for his daughter, according to federal filings, which don’t name the firm.”DE Shaw may be best known as the hedge fund where Jeff Bezos began his career. But as Robin Wigglesworth of the FT writes, it was also an early leader in computer-driven investing — and is now betting on A.I.-enabled stock picking.• “Many in the industry believe this is the future, and are rushing to hire computer scientists to help realize the benefits of big data and artificial intelligence in their strategies.”• “People have gone insane about this, but in a good way,” Eric Schmidt, the former Google executive chairman who owns 20 percent of DE Shaw, told the FT. “We are at the beginning of a new era in artificial intelligence. These technologies should benefit investing as well.”• DE Shaw keeps its operations shrouded in secrecy. “They’re really smart, but I’ve never quite understood them,” one quant hedge fund manager told the FT.• But there’s reason to be skeptical of its current approach, Mr. Wigglesworth writes. “Wall Street has seen several cycles of quant hype before, and many remain skeptical that traditional firms can retool their culture sufficiently to unlock the potential advantages of a more hybrid approach.”• “Some rivals question whether it has departed too far from its roots. For instance, Two Sigma — a major quant hedge fund started by former senior DE Shaw executives — has eschewed their former colleagues’ hybrid methods.”Seth DuCharme, the chief of the criminal division for the U.S. attorney’s office for the Eastern District of New York, will join the staff of Attorney General William Barr. Jacquelyn Kasulis, who led the prosecution of Martin Shkreli, will become the acting chief of the division.The investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners has hired Nancy Boehm from the CIT Group as a managing director and its chief technology officer.Deals• Qatari investors, who own about 6 percent of Deutsche Bank, are reportedly resisting a merger with Commerzbank.

It consistently ranks atop lists of Americans’ favorite brands, and its obsessive focus on customer satisfaction has created a generation of consumers who can’t imagine shopping anywhere else.Amazon is also overwhelmingly popular in New York, where polls have consistently shown that a majority of city residents supported the company’s planned Queens expansion.But happy customers don’t necessarily translate to political power.[Read more on Amazon’s decision to pull its planned New York headquarters.]Amazon acted as though its popularity — and its early support from key politicians, including Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio — would clear a path to political concessions. But the company miscalculated the power of local organizers, who turned what might have been a straightforward construction project into an all-out political brawl. Amazon was caught flat-footed by the opposition, and belatedly mounted a charm campaign, taking out full-page newspaper ads and sending mailers to Queens residents in support of the deal.In the end, confronted with a choice between fighting and fleeing, Amazon packed its bags.“This is a case of significant political malpractice, more than anything else,” said Bradley Tusk, a venture capitalist and former campaign manager for Mayor Michael Bloomberg.Mr. Tusk, who now acts as a “fixer” for technology companies looking to break into regulated markets, said that Amazon’s response to local opposition was a tone-deaf misstep.“Amazon did not understand the local politics on the ground at all,” he said. “They just took Cuomo’s word for it that everyone would be supportive.”Amazon, which says it still plans to expand in Northern Virginia and Nashville as originally planned, blamed a small but vocal minority for sabotaging the deal.“While polls show that 70 percent of New Yorkers support our plans and investment, a number of state and local politicians have made it clear that they oppose our presence and will not work with us to build the type of relationships that are required to go forward with the project,” the company said in a statement.Local business leaders echoed that criticism.“New Yorkers wanted Amazon to come. The people who live in Queens wanted Amazon to come,” said Julie Samuels, the executive director of Tech:NYC, a nonprofit organization that represents the city’s tech industry. “A handful of politicians got in the way.”Meanwhile, Mr. de Blasio characterized Amazon as a thin-skinned weakling, saying in a statement that “you have to be tough to make it in New York City.”This fight echoed the political drama surrounding two other tech companies that had difficulty breaking into city politics: Uber and Airbnb, which faced early political opposition despite broad popularity with customers.Several years ago, in response to a regulatory crackdown that threatened to crush its business model, Uber built a political war machine, hiring armies of lobbyists and political consultants — including Mr. Tusk — to make its case to officials across the country. It enlisted users, too, putting customized icons inside their Uber apps and urging them to petition City Hall for a reprieve. Airbnb used the same tactics, mobilizing its users in the cities where it faced restrictive regulations.Amazon certainly knows how to fight. Last year, it successfully lobbied to kill a proposed business tax in Seattle that would have raised about $50 million a year for affordable housing and other programs.It could have mounted a similar campaign in New York. Or it could have taken a page out of the Uber and Airbnb playbook, urging Amazon Prime members in New York to contact their representatives and agitate for a deal.Instead, the company did its lobbying in private, preferring back-room negotiations to a noisy, public-facing campaign.“They failed to appreciate that this market was different than the others,” Mr. Tusk said.“They didn’t do their homework.”For Uber and Airbnb, of course, the stakes of political success were existential. Amazon’s size and market dominance have given it the ability to walk away from even a multibillion-dollar deal relatively painlessly. New Yorkers will still buy their toilet paper and dog food from Amazon, even if the company doesn’t have an office in Long Island City.Some New Yorkers who supported Amazon’s expansion plans may consider the company’s retreat proof of the shortsightedness of politicians.“I hope there will be real lessons learned here,” Ms. Samuels of Tech:NYC said. “They were playing with fire, and look what happened.”But this should be a teachable moment for Amazon, too.For years, the company succeeded wildly by catering to shoppers, and betting — mostly correctly — that its sterling customer reputation would insulate it from criticism over its labor practices, anti-union resistance and other corporate shortcomings.But that era may be over. In New York, at least, there are some problems that low prices and two-day shipping can’t fix.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressNEW YORK — Paul Buijs had logged more than 750 Citi Bike rides before he took out an electric bike for the first time. He was riding it in Manhattan when a minivan swerved into his path.Buijs hit the brakes and immediately flew through the air, taking the brunt of the fall with his nose and lip. He said it felt like his teeth were grinding across the pavement."It basically just catapulted me face-first into the road," said Buijs, 41, who is an avid cyclist.Lyft, which owns Citi Bike, has pulled 3,000 electric bikes from the streets of New York, San Francisco and Washington, D.C., after customers like Buijs complained the bikes were braking too hard.A spokeswoman with the ride-hailing company said Monday they are aware of reports of injuries, but wouldn't specify the number of complaints it received.Lyft removed the majority of its electric bikes, which can go up to 18 miles per hour, from the three cities on Sunday. Lyft is working with an engineering firm to determine the cause and did not estimate when the electric bikes would be back on the road."We recently received a small number of reports from riders who experienced stronger than expected braking force on the front wheel," Lyft wrote in a letter to customers on its bikeshare websites. "Out of an abundance of caution, we are proactively removing the pedal-assist bikes from service for the time being."The electric bikes in question were designed by Motivate, the largest bike share operator in the U.S., which Lyft bought in November. Motivate operates in New York City as Citi Bike, San Francisco as Ford GoBike and Washington D.C. as Capital Bikeshare.Lyft is also working on designing its own new electric bikes, which have not yet been released. Rival Uber acquired bike sharing company Jump Bikes last year and also invested in Lime, a bike and scooter-sharing company.Buijs came away from his crash with a bloody gash in his upper lip and his hand is still bruised more than two weeks later. He has gone over the handlebars on a mountain bike before while riding downhill, but said "any experienced rider should not be going over the handlebars on a flat road."In San Francisco, which has a higher percentage of electric bikes in its fleet than Lyft's other markets, Lyft is extending monthly and annual bike memberships by a month.Lyft made its public debut on the stock market in March, but company shares have tumbled far below initial offering price of $72.On Monday shares slid another 6% to close at $56.11. That's 37% below the highs reached during the first day of trading late last month.Uber is expected to go public in the next few weeks.___Follow Cathy Bussewitz on Twitter: @cbussewitzAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byModern LoveModern Love in miniature, featuring reader-submitted stories of no more than 100 words.We met in the back of a shared Uber. I was coming from a progressive political rally. She was coming from a work happy hour. Tipsy, she moaned longingly at my McFlurry. I asked if she wanted some. She did. We flirted as the passenger in the front seat was dropped off. She asked the driver if she should get out with me. The driver said we lived near each other. We kissed to make sure it was worth it. It was. Eight months later, we can’t get Uber to sponsor our love. Uber? McDonalds? Are you there? Let’s synergize. — Sam BonarMy brother going off to war in Afghanistan — a modern Odysseus — unexpectedly transformed me into Penelope. Just as Penelope wove a never-ending shroud while she waited for her soldier to come home, I developed a new and sudden obsession with knitting, winding yarn around needles to make him an endless stream of impractical and unwanted accessories — scarves, gloves, even a camouflage hat (with pom-poms). Powerless to protect him, I turned the rows of stitches into my rosary: “Come back, come back, come back.” Once he was home I put down my needles, permanently. — Kate SturlaIt was my first wedding with her as my plus-one, and we were first on the dance floor. When the D.J. played “Low” by Flo Rida, I dropped it so low that I split my pants. We went to the women’s bathroom to survey the damage. It was pretty bad. She could see my whole butt, especially when I tried out some dance moves. She’d never worn a thong before, but the situation was dire. So we swapped. I pulled on her full-coverage underwear, she slid on my thong, and we headed back out to dance. — Jessica HackelMy first boyfriend, Howie, was matzo ball soup: warm and homey, wonderful on a cold, wintry day, but not a lot of sex appeal. My previously married ex-husband, John, was leftover Chinese food: so compelling in the refrigerator, but you were always sorry after you ate it. Vinnie, pizza-maker and “transition man,” was a banquet verging on bacchanal: destined to create heartburn but impossible to stop eating. My now and hopefully forever man, Charles, is bran flakes sprinkled with a few Lucky Charms: He keeps me regular and, on most days, is magically delicious. — Jill LiptonWe met on an app. I chose my favorite brewery for our first date.

(Want this by email? Sign up here.)The C.E.O.s of seven huge American banks testified on Capitol Hill yesterday — the first time since 2009 that top Wall Street C.E.O.s have appeared en masse before Congress. Here’s how they responded to a grilling by House Democrats on a variety of issues.Banking rules: The C.E.O.s argued that the financial system is much safer today than it was a decade ago, despite recent easing of regulations.Russia: Brian Moynihan of Bank of America, James Gorman of Morgan Stanley and Mike Corbat of Citigroup all said they had reviewed their account holders for potential Russian money-laundering. Mr. Corbat was the only one to say he “could not comment on ongoing investigations.”Guns: “JPMorgan has refused to adopt a policy to ensure responsible lending to the gun industry, even though you claim that client selection is important,” said Representative Carolyn Maloney. “Will you commit to adopting a formal policy that ensures responsible lending in your bank’s business with the gun industry?” Jamie Dimon responded that JPMorgan has “a very small relationship with gun manufacturers,” and added that he would be willing to consider adopting a formal policy. Mr. Gorman said Morgan Stanley had clamped down on doing business with gunmakers; Citi and Bank of America have already done so.The economy: Asked about the biggest economic threat facing the U.S., Mr. Corbat answered, “Our ability to talk ourselves into the next recession.”Diversity: Not one of the C.E.O.s thought that his successor would be a woman or a person of color.More: Lloyd Blankfein, the former Goldman Sachs C.E.O. who testified at the 2009 hearing, tweeted yesterday, “Boy, I really miss my old job!!!” To curb disinformation and hateful content, Andrew suggests in his latest column that tech giants take a page from the banking industry and make sure they know who they’re doing business with.• “The concept is ‘know your customer’ — or KYC, as it’s called on Wall Street — and it’s straightforward: Given concerns about privacy, security and fraud when it comes to money, no bank is allowed to take on a new customer without verifying its existence and vetting its background.”• “What if social media companies had to verify their users the same way banks do? You’d probably feel more confident that you were interacting with real people and were not just a target for malicious bots.”• “When I broached the idea of applying a ‘know your customer’ principle to their business, several senior executives at social media companies recoiled at the prospect, questioning how they would pull off such a huge feat, especially in emerging markets where many people lack credit cards, and even fixed street addresses.”• But there’s precedent: NextDoor, the social network focused on local communities, requires users to submit a credit card or phone number, which it checks against databases.• A “know your customer” rule could become more important as social networks like Facebook become fully encrypted. Fake users could easily spread misinformation and be harder to stop in an encrypted world — unless there was a way to verify their identities at the outset.More: Facebook says it is expanding its efforts to clamp down on disinformation through steps like expanding fact-checking operations and reducing the reach of groups that share misleading content. It’s also taking steps to minimize unwelcome reminders of dead friends on its network.The ride-hailing giant has told some investors that its forthcoming market debut could value it at up to $100 billion. It’s the first sign from the company about how big its I.P.O. will be.Uber told holders of some convertible bonds that its stock could be valued at $48 to $55 a share. That translates into a valuation of about $90 billion to $100 billion, including the $10 billion it plans to raise during the I.P.O.That’s below the $120 billion that bankers had predicted last year, prompting some commentators to wonder whether Lyft’s struggles in the public markets had forced Uber to lower its aims. (Shares in the smaller ride-hailing company are now down nearly 17 percent from their I.P.O. price.)The big question for Uber, along with many of the other tech companies going public this year: How long will investors tolerate losses? Earlier this year, Uber disclosed that it lost $842 million in the last three months of 2018 alone. And the company acknowledges it will lose money for a long time, though it plans to show a path to profits.We expect to learn more about Uber’s I.P.O. later today, when the company plans to publish a prospectus for the stock sale. Its shares are expected to begin trading next month.More: Uber, Pinterest and other unicorns are reportedly worried about their existing shareholders’ lock-up agreements, which prevent them from selling for several weeks after an I.P.O.Less than 48 hours before Britain’s scheduled departure, the E.U. last night extended the exit deadline until Oct. 31, Stephen Castle and Steven Erlanger of the NYT write.It took nine hours for European leaders to agree on the delay. The six-month extension is more than the three months that the British prime minister, Theresa May, had asked for — and that President Emmanuel Macron of France had pushed for — but shorter than the year that some E.U. leaders favored.The delay gives Britain time to get its ducks in a row. The European Council president, Donald Tusk, urged the U.K., “Please do not waste this time.” Mrs. May acknowledged that there would be “huge frustration” back home over the extension, but said she would again seek to persuade lawmakers to back her deal. The extension could be cut short if she manages to do so.But “the path ahead still resembles a minefield, dotted with explosive issues like a possible attempt to topple Mrs. May, a general election or a second Brexit referendum — or some combination of the three,” Mr. Castle and Mr. Erlanger write. “Most immediately, Mrs. May is likely to face calls to step down, and potential successors are already trying to raise money and advertise their credentials.”Don’t rule out another extension. At a news conference last night, Mr. Tusk told journalists, “Our wish and hope is the U.K. will be ready with a final solution at the end of October — but I’m too old to exclude another scenario.”American Media Inc., which owns the tabloid, said yesterday that the Enquirer is on the block. And a deal could be reached within days, Ed Lee, Andrew and Ben Protess of the NYT report.American Media is led by David Pecker, who helped silence a woman who said she had an affair with President Trump by buying her story for $150,000 before his 2016 election and never publishing it. Prosecutors who investigated the arrangement gave the company a nonprosecution deal, which requires it to avoid committing crimes for the next several years.But American Media is in a tough spot over The Enquirer’s feud with Jeff Bezos, who says he was threatened by the publication. Mr. Bezos is expected to meet with federal prosecutors this week to discuss his claims. If prosecutors move forward with a case, it could jeopardize American Media’s non-prosecution agreement.The controversy is spurring the sale. American Media’s principal owner is behind the push to sell the tabloid, the NYT reports. That company, the hedge fund Chatham Asset Management, “no longer saw an upside in being associated with The Enquirer.” An unnamed source told the WaPo that American Media’s investors were uncomfortable owning a tabloid involved in supporting Mr. Trump.But the publisher says its business focus has shifted away from tabloids to glossy magazines like Us Weekly and Men’s Journal. “Because of this focus, we feel the future opportunities with the tabloids can be best exploited by a different ownership,” the company said in a statement.The House approved legislation yesterday that seeks to revive so-called net neutrality regulations that the Trump administration overturned in 2017, Cecilia Kang of the NYT writes.• “The legislation would prohibit blocking and throttling web traffic and would categorize broadband as a service open to heavy regulation,” Ms. Kang writes. The 232-to-190 vote effectively supports giving users equal access to content.• “Supporters say the regulation would prevent companies from blocking or slowing the delivery of content like videos.”• “Opponents say it would strap broadband providers like Verizon and Comcast with heavy-handed restrictions, and could lead to price controls.”But the legislation faces long odds in the Republican-led Senate. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said this week that the legislation would be “dead on arrival.” And earlier this week, the Office of Management and Budget “advised the White House to veto the law if it reached the president’s desk,” Ms. Kang writes.And then there were two. The Pentagon said yesterday that only two candidates remained in its contest to win a $10 billion contract: Amazon and Microsoft.Those were the only companies to meet the “minimum requirements” for the contract, according to the Defense Department. Only one provider will win the huge contract, which will build the main global data repository for U.S. military services and is known as JEDI.The contest had been mired in controversy since Oracle, one of the now-rejected bidders, alleged that an Amazon employee who had worked on JEDI during a stint at the Defense Department had undue influence on the process. A Pentagon spokeswoman said yesterday that the employee had “no adverse impact on the integrity of the acquisition process.”The P.R. firm Gladstone Place Partners has hired Christina Stenson, most recently of the Brunswick Group, as a partner in San Francisco.Deals• U.S. authorities reportedly pressured Pamplona Capital Management, an investment firm backed in part by a Russian billionaire, into selling a stake in the cybersecurity company Cofense over national security concerns.

At the high end of that range, the digital pin board company would be valued at about $11.3 billion, accounting for stock options and restricted stock. The business was first valued at $12 billion in 2015, and again in 2017, by venture capitalists and other private investors.Pinterest’s price range dampens some of the fervor over a wave of tech offerings this year, which had promised to generate piles of new wealth in Silicon Valley. It follows last month’s I.P.O. of Lyft, the ride-hailing company, which is deeply unprofitable. While the offering created a great deal of hype and Lyft’s shares rose on their first day of trading, the stock fell below its offering price on its second day of trading, as it faced questions about its business.“People are looking at Lyft and realizing that even if the road show goes extremely well and there is a lot of demand, you can’t overprice the offering,” said Elliot Lutzker, corporate and securities partner at Davidoff Hutcher & Citron.He added that investors were looking more at business fundamentals. “Not every company is an Amazon that can afford to lose money for years and years while growing,” he said.How Lyft and Pinterest perform in their public debuts will be critical in the lead-up to the public offering of Uber, the largest of this generation of tech start-ups. Uber is expected to go public in the next few months at a valuation of around $120 billion, in what would be the biggest I.P.O. by an American company.Several other smaller companies are also planning public offerings, including Zoom, a video conferencing company; PagerDuty, a software company; and Slack, an office communications company.Pinterest’s filing on Monday coincided with the beginning of the company’s so-called road show, during which it plans to pitch institutional investors before the company’s final I.P.O. pricing and first day of trading. High demand from investors over the next several days could lead the company to raise the price of its shares.Some of the most valuable tech start-ups are preparing to go public, and the I.P.O.s promise to generate big paydays for employees and investors.At the midpoint of its price range, the company would raise around $1.2 billion from public market investors. Pinterest also has $628 million in cash on its balance sheet.If Pinterest goes public below its last private market valuation, that will not be a first for this generation of highly valued start-ups. Box, a cloud storage company, went public in 2015 at $1.6 billion, below its $2.4 billion private market valuation. The company now trades at a $2.8 billion market capitalization. Square, a payments company that was worth $6 billion in the private market, went public in 2015 at a $2.9 billion valuation. Square now has a $31 billion market capitalization.In total, private investors have poured about $1.5 billion into Pinterest. A market debut below $12 billion could spell a loss for the ones that invested most recently.But the company’s earlier investors will still see huge paydays. In its updated prospectus, Pinterest revealed the ownership stakes of its biggest shareholders, which include the venture capital firms Bessemer Venture Partners, FirstMark Capital and Andreessen Horowitz. At the midpoint of the proposed I.P.O. price range, Bessemer’s stake would be worth $952 million, FirstMark’s would be worth $710 million, and Andreessen’s would be $696 million.The biggest individual shareholder is Ben Silbermann, Pinterest’s 36-year-old chief executive and co-founder. He owns 11.4 percent of Pinterest’s shares, making his stake worth $825 million at the midpoint of the pricing range. Evan Sharp, 36, another co-founder and the chief design and creative officer, owns 2.1 percent of the company.Pinterest, which makes digital pin boards that allow people to save images and links from around the web, took off around 2011. Pinners, as users are known, create collagelike mood boards on topics like food, events and hobbies. Mr. Silbermann, who has taken a conservative approach to spending and growth, sought to build the company slowly. In 2014, Pinterest began selling ads.Mr. Silbermann’s methods contrasted with those of other entrepreneurs who lead companies known as unicorns, which are valued at more than $1 billion by private investors. Such companies have typically put a priority on fast growth over profits and take many years to go public. Unicorns that sell or go public below their last private valuation are known as undercorns.Like its peers, Pinterest loses money. But the company, which generates revenue from advertising, is burning less cash than Lyft or Uber. Last month, Pinterest revealed it lost $63 million on revenue of $756 million in 2018. Pinterest is also growing quickly, reporting a 60 percent jump in revenue from 2017 to 2018.The company plans to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol PINS.Follow Erin Griffith and Michael J. de la Merced on Twitter: @eringriffith and @m_delamerced.Erin Griffith reported from San Francisco, and Michael J. de la Merced from London.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersSTRASBOURG — The European Parliament on Tuesday approved a law setting minimum rights for workers in the "gig economy", a move that may benefit Uber drivers, Deliveroo and Just Eat food couriers and others.Gig workers are usually treated as independent contractors with none of the employment rights guarantees in more regular jobs, something the companies say gives flexibility to all but which critics say often results in exploitation.The new rules will apply to those who work a minimum of three hours per week and 12 hours per four weeks on average, including casual or short-term workers, those who work on-demand and paid trainees and apprentices.The rights include informing workers about the working conditions such as duration and remuneration from day one.Workers will also be able to refuse, without consequences, an assignment outside predetermined hours or be compensated if the assignment is not cancelled in time.Employers will not be allowed to hinder workers from working for other companies and will have to provide free mandatory training."All workers who have been in limbo will now be granted minimum rights thanks to this directive, and the European Court of Justice rulings. From now on no employer will be able to abuse the flexibility in the labour market," lawmaker Enrique Calvet Chambon from the ALDE liberal group, said.EU governments, which have agreed to the rules, will have three years to enforce them.

It’s the second of many decacorns — $10 billion-plus start-ups — to go public this year. And it could be an indicator of what’s to come during the rest of 2019. (Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up here.)What is investors’ appetite for fast-growing, highly valued start-ups that are burning cash?Many of the world’s most prominent tech start-ups are about to find out. Lyft has already listed, Uber will head to market in May, and Slack and Postmates are expected to follow soon.The next test comes this week with Pinterest. The digital pin board company plans to sell shares to investors and make its public market debut in the coming days.This is a slightly different breed of unicorn. Pinterest is burning less cash than some of the other big names going public this year, like Lyft and Uber. And it expects to price its I.P.O. below its last private market valuation. Lyft has struggled since its market debut last month. Its shares are trading 17 percent below the offering price.So is that a Lyft thing, or a tech I.P.O. thing? If Pinterest can avoid a Lyft-style early wave of selling, it may ease concerns for the companies expected to follow. Here’s your cheat sheet for the offering.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Stephen Grocer in New York and edited by Jamie Condliffe in London.____________________________The company grew out of Cold Brew Labs, a tech incubator founded in 2008 by Ben Silbermann, who became Pinterest’s chief executive, along with Evan Sharp and Paul Sciarra. It calls itself “a productivity tool for planning your dreams” — to you and me, it’s a web service that lets you save images to virtual pinboards.Here’s how it sizes up today:Pinterest has taken a low-key approach, rejecting Silicon Valley’s typical unicorn formula of moving fast, breaking things and chasing growth at all costs.That has spared it the controversies about disinformation and harmful content that have engulfed peers like Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.But it has grown steadily over the last two years, particularly as people outside the United States have begun to gravitate to its service.It had 265 million monthly active users in the fourth quarter of 2018, according to the company. That’s compared with 216 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.Pinterest will list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “PINS.”It hopes to be valued at $11.3 billion including stock options and restricted stock. It plans to sell 86.3 million shares, including the additional shares allotted to the underwriters, at a price between $15 and $17 a piece. At the top of that range, the company would raise $1.5 billion.That’s below the $12 billion valuation that private investors and venture capital firms placed on the company in 2015 and 2017.If Pinterest does go public below its last private market valuation, it would not be the first highly valued start-up to do so recently. Box, a cloud storage company, and Square, a payments company, both did it, and both now trade above those private valuations.But Pinterest could price higher if investor demand has proved robust during its roadshow.Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Allen & Company are underwriting the offering. In all, Pinterest will have 12 underwriters.Pinterest is the rare unicorn preparing to go public this year that is not hemorrhaging cash at an alarming rate.Pinterest lost $63 million in 2018. That put it far closer to making a profit than the previous year, when it lost $130 million.While it is unprofitable, its losses are far lower than those of other well-known start-ups like Uber and Lyft.And it’s growing quickly. The company’s revenue, which came from advertising, totaled $756 million last year, up 60 percent from a year earlier.It listed a cash stockpile of $628 million.After going public, the company will have two classes of stock: class A shares, which carry one vote each, and class B shares, which carry 20 votes. Pinterest’s founders, top executives, employees, big investors and directors will be given class B shares; new investors will get class A shares.The holders of the class B stock will have 99.2 percent of the voting power after the I.P.O. Pinterest’s three founders will control about 23 percent of the voting power. Bessemer Venture Partners will have the most control of any single investor, with 13 percent of the voting power. Pinterest acknowledges in its I.P.O. prospectus that this will limit investors’ ability to influence it.Such share structures have grown in popularity in Silicon Valley. Lyft also went public with a dual-class share structure; its two founders now own roughly 5 percent of the stock, but control of nearly 49 percent of the voting power. Facebook, Google and Snap have all famously used dual-class structures, too.But the practice is increasingly controversial among governance experts. And Kobi Kastiel and Lucian Bebchuk from Harvard Law School have warned that the dual-class structure may “significantly decrease the economic value of Pinterest’s low-voting shares.”The risk factor section of any I.P.O. prospectus acts as a warning label for investors. Pinterest’s is no different — here’s a rundown of what it thinks can go wrong.Advertising: “The failure to attract new advertisers, the loss of advertisers or a reduction in how much they spend could harm our business,” Pinterest writes.Security: “If our security is compromised, or Pinners or advertisers believe our security has been compromised, Pinners and advertisers may use our service less or may stop using our service altogether.”Infrastructure: “We depend on Amazon Web Services for the vast majority of our compute, storage, data transfer and other services. Any disruption of, degradation in or interference with our use of Amazon Web Services could negatively affect our operations.”Regulation: “We receive, process, store, use and share data, some of which contains personal information, which subjects us to complex and evolving governmental regulation.” It adds that it “may be liable as a result of content or information that is published or made available on our service.”Rivals: Because Pinterest makes money from online advertising, it acknowledges that it is a competitor to big names like Facebook, Instagram, Amazon, Google, Twitter and Snap. It also sees websites like the recipe repository Allrecipes, the home improvement website Houzz and the cookery site Tastemade as rivals.For Pinterest’s current shareholders and employees, as well as the private market investors who have poured around $1.5 billion into the company, the I.P.O. could provide a windfall. Here’s a rundown of who stands to gain:Mr. Silbermann would hold a stake worth $878 million at the high end of the offering. Mr. Sciarra and Mr. Sharp, his fellow co-founders, will hold stakes worth $721 million and $161 million. Bessemer Venture Partners will be Pinterest’s largest shareholder, with a stake worth about $1 billion. FirstMark and Andreessen Horowitz are the next two biggest venture capital investors with holdings of $755 million and $740 million.Fidelity and Valiant Capital Management will hold stakes of $549 million and $460 million.Pinterest is “taking some of the hype out of the I.P.O. process” by initially pricing its I.P.O. below its last private market valuation, Gina Chon of Breakingviews argues. That, she says, could help it argue that its “conservative approach puts the long-term interests of both the company and its investors first.”On the other hand, Pinterest’s “guarded approach may be risky,” Laura Forman of Heard on the Street writes. Since 2014, just 13 U.S. tech companies have priced their I.P.O. below their last private market valuation, she says, and “the 10 of those with publicly available financing data that have traded for a full 12 months lost 19.2 percent of their value on average in their first year.”“Is it good enough to grow at 60 percent a year?” Shira Ovide of Bloomberg Opinion asks. “Under normal circumstances, this kind of company would be a must-have for investors,” she adds, but with investors also considering growth-focused companies like Lyft and Uber, Pinterest could experience “cooler demand from investors.”An I.P.O. prospectus often features an idealistic, sometimes corny, letter from the company’s founders about their vision for the firm. Pinterest’s might make non-Silicon Valley types squirm a little, but it also takes a not-so-subtle dig at other social networks:“Pinterest is designed to inspire. Pinners tell us they love how they feel on Pinterest: optimistic, confident and inspired. We work hard to keep the enemies of inspiration — comparison, cynicism, judgment — off of Pinterest.”“Pinterest is personal. Not social. Pinterest isn’t about your friends or celebrities, it is about you. There are many tools to connect people, but there are few that help you connect with yourself.”“Pinterest is made for real world action. Most ideas on Pinterest can be made, bought, tried or visited.

The up-and-coming generation is looking very different.By Erin GriffithSAN FRANCISCO — Technology start-ups worth $1 billion, once as rare as unicorns, are now plentiful enough and old enough that there’s a new generation behind them — one that looks very different.Silicon Valley’s current crop of highly valued tech start-ups, which include now-household names like Uber and Airbnb, all benefited from the spread of smartphones and cheap cloud computing. Many of these companies built global empires by simply taking existing businesses — like taxis, food delivery and hotels — and making them mobile. Some of the start-ups became giants: Uber, for instance, may reach a $120 billion valuation this year.But as those companies have matured and prepare to go public, the easy opportunities for disrupting old-line industries are drying up. Now, many of the up-and-coming start-ups that may become the next unicorns have names like Benchling and Blend. And they largely focus on software for specific industries like farms, banks and life sciences companies. That’s according to an analysis for The New York Times by CB Insights, a firm that tracks venture capital and start-ups. CB Insights used a variety of data — including financial health and the strength and size of the market a company serves — to identify 50 start-ups that may be on a path to achieving a $1 billion valuation (though there is no guarantee they will get there). Software start-ups may seem boring. But many of them are growing fast because industries like agriculture require more software tools as they adapt to the tech era, said Jason Green, an investor at Emergence, a venture capital firm that invests in cloud software companies.[A list of 50 start-ups that may be the next billion-dollar unicorns.]“Maybe it’s not as sexy as the companies in the first wave,” said Kirsten Green, a venture capitalist at Forerunner Ventures. “A lot of those industries are big giant industries that we need in our lives and in business, and they need to be modernized.”Other potential unicorns, such as Checkr and Earnin, are building businesses off the last generation of unicorns by offering services to them. CB Insights also pinpointed three start-ups that are popular with millennial women — Glossier, Zola and Faire — as unicorn candidates.Some of these companies may reach the $1 billion threshold quickly, as unicorn start-ups are created more quickly than ever, said Anand Sanwal, chief executive of CB Insights. Funding rounds of $100 million or more — a once eye-popping sum of capital — have become common. Today, there are 315 unicorns, compared with 131 in 2015. “If you are one of those high-momentum companies, investors are going to be beating down your door because there is so much interest in investing in the next big winner,” Mr. Sanwal said.Here’s a look at some of the up-and-comers.In 2012, Sajith Wickramasekara founded Benchling. His goal: To solve some of the personal frustrations he had with the outdated technology tools that he used in the molecular biology labs of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology when he was a student.Benchling, based in San Francisco, began providing software that allows lab scientists to replace their paper notebooks with searchable records stored in the cloud. That way, scientists could more easily use the records to collaborate with one another, Mr. Wickramasekara figured. Younger researchers were also increasingly asking for such tools.“Software has touched a lot of different sectors of the economy, but it has not kept up in the field of science,” said Kaiser Mulla-Feroze, Benchling’s chief marketing officer. Today, 140,000 scientists use Benchling’s software, including academics at Harvard and M.I.T. who use a free version, and paying customers like Pfizer and Regeneron. Benchling charges smaller companies $15,000 a year, while large customers who use more advanced features pay millions of dollars a year, Mr. Mulla-Feroze said. Benchling has raised nearly $30 million in funding. Last year, the start-up tripled its revenue and number of customers, Mr. Mulla-Feroze said.The company is representative of a new class of software start-ups as different industries adopt more technology. Mr. Green, the venture capitalist, said it’s become clear that software aimed at niche sectors offers larger opportunities than previously expected. “Health care, automotive, retail, consumer packaged goods, advanced manufacturing companies — they’re all trying to figure out how technology helps reduce costs or how technology is going to help them build their next business model,” said Mr. Sanwal of CB Insights.Other fast-growing start-ups that fit this description include Farmers Business Network, which was founded in 2014 by Charles Baron, a former Google program manager, and Amol Deshpande, a serial entrepreneur and venture capitalist. The company charges farmers $700 a year to share and analyze data about their farms, buy supplies and sell crops. Mr. Baron said the start-up counts 7,700 farms as customers and has raised nearly $200 million in funding. A company like Farmers Business Network wouldn’t have been possible 10 years ago, before the proliferation of cloud computing and the “digitization” of farming processes, Mr. Baron added. Now, farms produce a lot of data, which Farmers Business Network is helping them to process and use to make decisions. “Agriculture is going through a digital revolution,” he said. In 2013, when Shan-Lyn Ma’s friends began getting married, she noticed that most digital tools for wedding planning were outdated, poorly designed or cost money. So Ms. Ma, who previously worked at a site that held flash sales for designer merchandise, Gilt Groupe, started Zola, which offers a streamlined place to create free wedding registries. Zola now sells 70,000 gift items in its registry. It has also developed tools like online guest lists and R.S.V.P. tracking, all designed to lure more couples to its registry product. The site has been a hit with millennials, allowing the company to raise $140 million in funding and reach a valuation of $600 million.Zola is one of three companies on the list of potential next unicorns that have been fueled by millennials’ spending. Glossier, a beauty products company in New York, and Faire, an online marketplace for local boutiques and vendors to buy and sell wholesale items, have also grown by largely catering to a youthful audience. Max Rhodes, who founded Faire in 2017, said millennial women are driving a resurgence of local boutiques. These shoppers “don’t want to drive out to the strip mall and buy the most stuff that’s made as cheaply as possible,” he said. “They want unique products that have a story behind them.” The rise of companies like Uber and Airbnb has created its own mini-economy of start-ups. One of those is Checkr, which was founded in 2014 by Daniel Yanisse and Jonathan Perichon, who worked as software engineers at Deliv, a delivery start-up. Both had become frustrated at the slow-moving background checks for the delivery drivers they wanted to hire for Deliv, so they created their own business to expedite the process.Now Checkr works with Uber, Lyft and Instacart. It has also added other types of customers like the insurance company Allstate.Checkr is selling “picks and shovels” to the gig economy, said Rich Wong, a partner at Accel, a venture firm that invested in the start-up. Another potential unicorn that serves gig economy workers is Earnin, founded in 2012 and based in Palo Alto, Calif. Earnin, which makes an app that provides free cash advances to workers, has a partnership with Uber that lets its drivers cash out immediately after a ride. Ram Palaniappan, Earnin’s founder, said the app has been downloaded more than 1 million times and its users open the app 25 times a month on average. Notably, 17 of the fast-rising start-ups are dispersed internationally. CB Insights identified five companies in India, four in China, and three in Latin America as possible candidates to reach $1 billion in valuation. They ranged from CargoX, a Brazilian start-up using technology to make trucking companies more efficient, to Deputy, an Australian company that provides tools to businesses to manage their hourly workers.Erin Griffith reports on technology start-ups and venture capital from the San Francisco bureau.

Two readers are dubious.To the Editor:Re “When Owning a Car Is a Quaint Memory,” by Kara Swisher (Op-Ed, March 23):Has Ms. Swisher lived in the ’burbs? Ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles are great, but giving up owning a car is less practical for those living outside cities. Would you teach your 7-year-old to use Uber to get a ride home from her swim lesson? Should I use it to go hit several nurseries for spring plants? Each stop can easily be half an hour, and at the end we’ll be hauling home plants in pots and shrubs in burlap sacks. When I get the boat ready to launch in the spring, it takes five to 10 trips over a few weeks, and the tools, wax, paint and gear I use get loaded at the start and put away when the job is done. I’ve lived in New York City on and off for much of my life, and never wanted a car there. Here in southern New Jersey, it’s a pretty essential tool.Bill WayToms River, N.J.To the Editor:Access to a car is a matter of survival for many people. For many Americans the spiritual journey to having no car would end up in homelessness or bankruptcy. Many people in our country live in regions where trying to hold down a job without a car is impossible. The yawning income gap in the Bay Area is evinced by the large number of people who must actually live in their cars with their families.

"It is my sincerest hope and desire that stepping down now will allow the student-athletes, coaches and administration at Wake Forest to focus fully on their studies and on the season ahead, without distraction, while I focus all of my attention and energy on resolving my legal case."A Wake Forest athletic department spokesman declined to comment on whether Jones was paid during the 2018-19 season or whether he is receiving any severance, according to the Winston-Salem (N.C.) Journal.Demon Deacons head coach Danny Manning said in a statement, "This decision is in the best interest for both our program and Jamill. I appreciate everyone on our staff who took on extra responsibilities during Jamill's leave and we are committed to finding a great addition to complete our coaching staff."Jones is charged with third-degree misdemeanor assault in connection with the death of a 35-year-old Florida man. He has pleaded not guilty, and the next hearing in the case is scheduled for May 6 in New York.In late September, the New York City medical examiner ruled that Sandor Szabo's death Aug. 5 was the result of a homicide, listing the official cause of death as "blunt impact injury of the head with brain injury."According to police, Jones punched Szabo in the face after Szabo knocked on Jones' car window thinking it was his Uber ride. As a result of the punch, Szabo's head reportedly hit the pavement, and he lost consciousness.

(Any day now!) Enjoy the rest of your weekend.MARCH 24-30 Eight members of the Sackler family, owners of the pharmaceutical company that makes the potent (and highly addictive) opioid OxyContin, have been sued for fraud by New York State. They are accused of hiding profits and siphoning hundreds of millions of dollars from their company, Purdue Pharma, into personal offshore accounts while the business was under investigation for its role in stoking the opioid epidemic. Since OxyContin came on the market in 1996, more than 200,000 people in the United States have died from overdoses involving prescription opioids, and the Sacklers have become one of the country’s wealthiest families. If you take a Lyft this week, pay attention — does it feel any different to use the world’s first publicly traded ride-hailing platform? Perhaps not, but at least you’re both going places. The company made its market debut on Friday, hitting the Nasdaq with much fanfare at $72 a share. It finished its first day of trading at $78.29 (putting its value at more than $26.4 billion), and its Silicon Valley brethren will be closely watching its progress. A wave of other big tech start-ups — known as “unicorns” once they cross the threshold of a $1 billion dollar valuation, although these are now technically “decacorns” — plan to follow in Lyft’s footsteps later this year, including Uber (Lyft’s bigger competitor), Slack, Pinterest and Postmates. Apple is turning over a new leaf — or several. The tech company plans this fall to start streaming original programming and shows from partnering networks on an app called Apple TV Plus, intended to rival Netflix and HBO. It’s also rolling out a news service that charges users $10 a month to access over 300 different publications, some of which charge subscription fees otherwise. Plus, it’s introducing more games. And — why not? — a credit card with Goldman Sachs. It’s all part of a larger plan to diversify beyond hardware products like iPhones, which haven’t been bringing in as much revenue lately. MARCH 31-APRIL 6What’s to become of Brexit? As its original deadline of March 29 came and went, Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union is a bigger mess than ever. The British Parliament rejected Prime Minister Theresa May’s last-ditch effort to pass her plan on Friday, even when she played her final bargaining chip — her own seat, which she offered to give up if opposing lawmakers would agree to the deal. That wasn’t enough. Now, Britain is lurching toward a potential “no-deal” Brexit on April 12. That could have catastrophic consequences for its economy and send shock waves through Europe and beyond. Look out for more definitive news about what may have caused the two deadly Boeing 737 Max plane crashes, and what Boeing and the Federal Aviation Authority plan to do about it. Investigators reached a preliminary conclusion on Thursday that a glitchy system kicked in right before the Ethiopian Airlines flight went down earlier this month. Boeing has proposed updating the software and making other changes to the planes, which have been grounded for more than two weeks. The fixes would give pilots more control over the flight system and make it less likely to be set off by faulty data. Boeing didn’t provide a timeline for carrying out the fixes, since it needs the F.A.A. — also under intense scrutiny over its certification of the jet — to give its blessing first. If you’re sick of the trade war between the United States and China, imagine how the negotiators on both sides feel at this point. Chinese officials will fly back to Washington this week to continue talks, just days after American representatives visited Beijing. But the needle is moving on one major sticking point: intellectual property. American companies have complained of pressure to share their proprietary technology as a condition of working with Chinese business partners, only to see that technology adopted by Chinese competitors. As part of a trade deal, the United States wants to put a lid on this practice, and officials say that progress is finally being made. Facebook has been accused of causing housing discrimination by allowing advertisers to target ads on the platform based on characteristics like race, religion and national origin. Separately, the platform announced a ban on all white nationalist content after a New Zealand gunman used social media to post live video of his attacks on two mosques.

And speaking of dud flights: The first all-female spacewalk was canceled when astronauts couldn’t find spacesuits to fit them at the International Space Station.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Kate Kelly and Ben HubbardThere was much to celebrate last spring when Ariel Emanuel, the chief executive of the talent agency Endeavor, helped throw a splashy Hollywood party for Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman.The soiree, with guests including the Disney chief executive Robert A. Iger, the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and the former N.B.A. star Kobe Bryant, took place as Saudi Arabia’s government investment fund was completing an agreement to invest $400 million in Mr. Emanuel’s firm. The deal was meant to finance Endeavor’s growth, while diversifying Saudi Arabia’s economy via the talent agency’s work in sports, events, modeling and television and film production.Less than a year after the star-studded party, Endeavor and Saudi Arabia have gone through a messy breakup, set in motion by the murder last October of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.In recent weeks, Mr. Emanuel’s firm returned the $400 million investment, effectively severing Endeavor’s relationship with Saudi leaders, according to two people with knowledge of the transaction.It is one of the few instances of a major company halting business with the wealthy kingdom to protest its agents’ assassination of a journalist.A spokesman for Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, or PIF, which made the investment in Endeavor, did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Neither did Mr. Emanuel.Prince Mohammed has worked to turn the fund into a global investment giant whose profits can reduce the kingdom’s dependency on oil. On a high-profile tour of the United States last spring, the prince met with politicians, business leaders and celebrities. Many hailed him as a valuable business partner and a potentially transformative figure in the Middle East.On the prince’s American trip, the fund signed deals with the movie-theater company AMC and the amusement-park operator Six Flags to expand into Saudi Arabia. And it completed the investment with Endeavor, an alliance that Prince Mohammed hoped would lift the kingdom’s nascent entertainment sector.Then Mr. Khashoggi’s murder in October led to an international outcry.Richard Branson, founder of the British media and technology conglomerate Virgin Group, suspended talks with the Saudi fund over potential investments in his space-travel businesses. Executives from the private-equity firm Blackstone Group, the ride-sharing service Uber and Goldman Sachs canceled plans to attend a major investment conference in Riyadh, the Saudi capital.Mr. Emanuel joined the chorus. At an industry event in Cannes, France, on Oct. 15, he called the Khashoggi disappearance, about which many details had not yet emerged, “very, very concerning, really concerning. It’s upsetting.”Privately, Mr. Emanuel informed officials with the Saudi fund that he intended to return the $400 million that it had invested. Worried about the Saudi reaction, he began traveling at times with bodyguards, according to a person briefed on the matter.Mr. Emanuel canvassed other investors, including some who already had put money into Endeavor, to help fill the void that would be left when the firm returned the Saudi money, according to the two people familiar with the talks, including one who is an Endeavor investor.The process wrapped up in the past few weeks, with Endeavor investors kicking in money and the company repaying Saudi Arabia.Endeavor’s clean break with the kingdom has made it an outlier in the business community.Despite the American sanctions against 17 Saudis said to have been involved with Mr. Khashoggi’s killing, on top of the public outcry, most of the kingdom’s overseas partnerships have remained intact. Blackstone is using billions of dollars of Saudi money to invest in United States infrastructure projects. The asset manager BlackRock has said it will continue to manage Saudi funds. And Uber and other companies that accepted money from the Saudi government have not indicated any plans to return it.“People still want sovereign wealth fund money,” said Michael Maduell, president of the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute, which provides research on government investment funds.Greg Fairchild, who teaches business ethics at the University of Virginia’s Darden School, said there was a strong argument for corporate leaders to follow Mr. Emanuel’s lead.While it might hurt in the short term, he said, “you can look in the mirror and say, ‘We’re just not involved in that.’”Ben Hubbard reported from Beirut, Lebanon.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported bywith interestBy Charlotte CowlesWant this column in your inbox?

You don’t need reminding that it’s the shortest weekend of the year; make the most of it.MARCH 3-9Facebook, the platform known for sharing your personal information with the world whether you like it or not, is going for a more discreet vibe these days. The company’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, wants to nudge users toward “private” messaging and away from blasting their networks with status updates, a trend he says is already underway. He likened his new vision, which will integrate other Facebook-owned platforms like Instagram and WhatsApp, to a “digital living room” where people can have intimate discussions secure from outsiders. (He emphasized the term “encrypted.”) It’s unclear how this pivot will affect Facebook’s business model, and critics have pointed out the obvious paradox of a company known for playing fast and loose with users’ data suddenly espousing privacy protection.Yet another sign that the country’s economy may be cooling: February’s disappointing jobs numbers. Only 20,000 new jobs were added, far less than the 175,000 that analysts had predicted. It’s the weakest report since September 2017, but on the upside, it still marks the 101st consecutive month of growth. Wall Street got good news this past week as regulators eased their oversight of the nation’s biggest banks. The policy shift is part of the Trump administration’s promise to call off the watchdogs put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, rules that the financial industry has criticized as hampering economic growth. While these rollbacks may help stoke markets, they could also lead to a less transparent financial system — and a repeat of past mistakes. Go back to enjoying your pasta: The Italian food impresario Mario Batali has formally exited his dining empire. More than a year after multiple women accused him of sexual harassment and assault, he “will no longer profit from the restaurants in any way, shape or form,” said Tanya Bastianich Manuali, who will run the remaining 16 establishments in Mr. Batali’s former portfolio. She and her brother, Mr. Batali’s erstwhile business partner Joe Bastianich, bought the disgraced chef’s shares in the Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group for an undisclosed sum. Mr. Batali will also hand over the keys to Eataly, the chain of Italian food emporiums. MARCH 10-16If you’ve been holding out for a Tesla that can fit your family and Elon Musk’s ego, the automaker will unveil its new crossover S.U.V., the Model Y, at the company’s Los Angeles design studio this week. Mr. Musk, the chief executive, said that the Model Y will be about 10 percent roomier than the Model 3 sedan, have slightly less battery range and come at a higher price. Tesla could certainly use the revenue boost. In its effort to sell the Model 3 for a long-promised $35,000, it’s had to lay off workers, close showrooms and cut other costs — moves that have battered its stock price. Wondering what the growing crowd of presidential candidates will be talking about this coming week, in addition to the country’s new record-high trade deficit? Well, President Trump is expected to deliver his budget proposal for 2020 this Monday, about a month late because of the government shutdown earlier this year. Lower tax revenue and increased government spending have driven up annual budget deficits, which now are expected to exceed $1 trillion starting in 2022, according to the Congressional Budget Office. But Mr. Trump is likely to play down those numbers and focus on spending cuts instead. It’s understandable if you’ve been ignoring the Brexit commotion; all that back-and-forth was getting tedious. But now is the time to start paying attention, as talks come down to the wire. Britain’s House of Commons will vote on the latest version of Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit plan this Tuesday. If it is rejected — as it probably will be — then Parliament will vote on whether to leave the European Union without a deal or to delay Britain’s departure beyond the original March 29 deadline. Either way, the path doesn’t look smooth, and the European Central Bank is bracing itself. On Thursday, it abruptly reversed course and revived its stimulus measures.Uber will not be held criminally liable for the death of a woman who was hit by a self-driving test car in Arizona last year, although its safety driver — who was sitting in the driver’s seat at the time of the accident — still could face charges. In other news, a new cosmetics deal has made Kylie Jenner, at 21 years old, the world’s youngest “self-made” billionaire (the “self-made” label is up for debate, but hey, the money’s real). Perhaps she’ll buy this Bugatti, which set a record last week as the world’s most expensive car at $19 million.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported bywith interestPlus, Facebook sheds two top executives and gains a criminal investigation.By Charlotte CowlesWant this column in your inbox?

Your Monday self will be better for it.MARCH 10-16Boeing’s brand-new fleet of 737 Max aircraft was grounded in over 40 countries after a deadly plane crash in Ethiopia last Sunday, the second 737 Max to go down in five months. There’s no hard evidence that the planes have anything wrong with them, but similarities between the two crashes caused widespread concern among aviation officials (and passengers) around the world. Boeing has promised a software fix and new training program for pilots by April, but it may take a lot longer to repair the damage to its reputation and its bottom line, considering the 737 Max was its best-selling jet ever.Humans were forced to have actual conversations when Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp went dark for few hours on Wednesday. (The platforms, all owned by Facebook, were apparently suffering from a server issue.) But the company may not bounce back quite so fast when federal prosecutors start examining its business deals. Officials are  conducting a criminal investigation into partnerships that Facebook struck with other big tech companies, namely, agreements that involved handing over its users’ personal information without their consent. Other signs of turmoil: Two of Facebook’s top executives resigned on Thursday without giving explicit reasons. Firearm makers took a hit on Thursday when a Connecticut court ruled that the families of victims in the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School could proceed with suing Remington, which made the AR-15 rifle used in the massacre. The decision conflicts with Congress’s previous policy of shielding gun manufacturers whose weapons are used in a crime, and creates a potential opening to hold those companies liable. At the center of the lawsuit is Remington’s promotional messaging, which the families argue shows an effort to appeal to troubled young men. An outcome in the plaintiffs’ favor could have far-reaching effects on how guns are marketed and sold. MARCH 17-23We were so looking forward to March 29 as the last day of Brexit negotiations (and hearing people talk about them). But alas. British lawmakers voted on Thursday to push back the country’s departure from the European Union until they can agree on how to actually pull it off, so the squabbling will drag on for … well, who knows. Prime Minister Theresa May will meet with European Union leaders in Brussels this Thursday to discuss the terms of the postponement, which will require approval from all 27 members of the bloc to proceed. Expect more stump speeches about breaking up big tech companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook after Senator Elizabeth Warren discussed her plan to do so at the annual South by Southwest Interactive conference in Austin, Tex., last week. Senator Warren, who is also a 2020 presidential candidate, argues that tech giants have abused their power by acquiring potential competitors, making it harder for smaller start-ups to compete, and wants to appoint regulators to divide the conglomerates. Almost everyone can agree that these corporations need clearer rules, but how to go about it will be a major topic as the 2020 presidential race heats up. Federal Reserve officials will meet this Tuesday and Wednesday to decide whether to raise the benchmark interest rate, but it would be a huge surprise if they did. The number (currently 2.25 to 2.5 percent) is the baseline for banks and other lenders to set interest rates on loans (like your mortgage), and the Fed recently took a much more hands-off approach to it. This new stance delighted Wall Street, but has also been interpreted as a bellwether of growing economic uncertainty. The college admissions scandal that you’ve been following so breathlessly isn’t just taking down celebrity parents. Big names in the finance world are accused of paying bribes to get their children into top schools, too. (But are you really surprised?) In other news, Uber’s self-driving cars may soon get a $1 billion cash infusion from SoftBank, if their current talks go well. The company also just settled a lawsuit with drivers who wanted to be recognized as employees. The drivers got $20 million, but not the title: they’re still designated independent contractors.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBlame has been cast on events like Brexit, but there are other changes that are reshaping the industry globally. By Amie TsangAutomakers, in quick succession, have moved in recent weeks to end parts of their operations in Europe. Nissan is the latest: On Tuesday, it confirmed that it would cease assembling Infiniti cars at its plant in northeast England.The moves, during Britain’s wrenching debate over its departure from the European Union, known as Brexit, have raised the question: Is Brexit forcing the carmaking industry out of Britain? It’s not quite so simple. Traditional car manufacturers, in Britain and in Europe over all, have been buffeted by forces around the world, and they assess where they want to make the next model of a car every few years or so. As automakers allocate resources, they have been balancing the need to respond to these changes with the justifications for producing cars in places like Britain. Here are some of the forces reshaping the industry. Honda said it would close its plant in Swindon, England, by 2021 and stop making one of its sedans in Turkey. The Swindon plant employs 3,500 and the Turkish plant about 1,100. Nissan reversed an earlier decision by deciding to produce the next generation of its X-Trail sport utility vehicle in Japan instead of Sunderland, England. Its luxury brand, Infiniti, is withdrawing from Western Europe altogether. Ford said in January that it would cut thousands of jobs across Europe. Jaguar Land Rover announced in January that it would be cutting 4,500 people from its global work force; most of the cuts are expected to be in Britain. Dyson, which is developing an electric car, moved its headquarters from Britain to Singapore the same month. General Motors pulled out of Europe in 2017, selling the Opel and Vauxhall brands. In the wake of Volkswagen’s diesel-cheating scandal in 2015, when it used software to trick emissions tests, awareness of the harmful effects of fossil fuels has prompted stricter regulation throughout the Continent.Some German cities are banning older diesel engines in an effort to reduce pollution in urban areas. London has initiated a levy on drivers of older diesel vehicles. Britain and France plan to phase out sales of new diesel and gasoline-powered cars by 2040. Volkswagen admitted that 11 million of its vehicles were equipped with software that was used to cheat on emissions tests. This is how the technology works and what it now means for vehicle owners.In the meantime, more governments, drivers and carmakers are pivoting to electric vehicles. Cars running on alternative fuels made up 6 percent of new car registrations last year in Europe, up from 4.8 percent in 2017, according to JATO, an auto industry research firm. Norway is aiming to sell only electric cars by 2025, while India is aiming to be all electric by 2030. Carmakers are racing to respond. Volkswagen said Tuesday that it intended to sell 22 million electric cars over the next 10 years, compared with its previous goal of 15 million, and that the company would aim to be carbon neutral by 2050. The investments necessary for building electric cars have added to cost pressures for automakers that, in some cases, have struggled to turn a profit in Europe. In justifying the closing of its Swindon factory, Honda said it wanted to focus on electrification. “The significant challenges of electrification will see Honda revise its global manufacturing operations, and focus activity in regions where it expects to have high production volumes,” the company said. As carmakers channel billions of dollars into grabbing a portion of the electric car market, many are looking to China, which is the world’s largest maker and seller of electric cars. China wants one in every five cars sold to run on an alternative fuel by 2025, and officials have said the country will get rid of internal combustion engines in new cars altogether. The country’s rules also require carmakers to sell more alternative-energy cars if they want to continue selling regular models. This has prompted car companies to realign where they make and develop cars. Tesla has opened a factory there. Volkswagen signed an agreement with the Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group last year to develop an electric vehicle. General Motors has made China the hub of its electric car research and development, while both Renault-Nissan and Ford have joint electric-car ventures in China. In their efforts to grab a share of the growing market for electric cars, traditional car companies are competing not just with each other but also against technology companies. Uber, Alphabet and Tesla are channeling money into electric cars and autonomous cars, while reshaping the way people travel with ride-hailing services. This has prompted rivals to team up, or to work with the technology companies, so that they are not left behind. Ford and Volkswagen formed an alliance in January to share technology for electric and self-driving vehicles, and save money. BMW and Daimler announced in February that they would collectively invest 1 billion euros in a joint venture focused on offering services like car-sharing and electric charging points. Audi, BMW and Daimler have joined forces to buy a digital mapping company. Daimler has teamed up with Uber on autonomous vehicles. BMW is working with the chip maker Intel and Mobileye, an Israeli tech company, to develop a self-driving car. It is also in a partnership with IBM to use artificial intelligence to adapt vehicles to owners’ preferences. Fiat Chrysler is working with Google on self-driving cars, General Motors invested $500 million into Lyft, and Volvo provided the chassis for Uber’s driverless car tests. This shift has accelerated change and added to costs, said Peter Wells, a professor at the Center for Automotive Industry Research at the Cardiff Business School in Wales. And that has prompted companies to scrutinize whether they should maintain operations in markets that are not expected to grow and could become more difficult to serve. “Companies around the world are having to re-evaluate their positions,” Mr. Wells said. The European car market is not growing. Annual car sales there peaked in 2007 at about 16 million. They’re at about 15 million now, according to JATO. It is also a saturated market, dominated by European marques, and favors smaller cars. Carmakers hungry for profits generated by pickup trucks and S.U.V.s are looking elsewhere for growth. Sales of S.U.V.s in Europe are still far behind those in China and the United States. The Italian-American company Fiat Chrysler said in February that it planned to expand its capacity in the United States by updating several plants. They will produce large Jeep models. Certainly, even promising regions face challenges. In the United States, many believe that car sales have peaked, forcing the idling of some factories. And the economic slowdown in China has sent car sales plummeting. But in announcing its withdrawal from Western Europe, Infiniti said it intended to focus on its S.U.V. in North America and its new models in China. Against this backdrop, the uncertainty surrounding Britain’s departure from the European Union has made it difficult for companies to plan ahead. Several car companies have said they will close their factories temporarily after the country leaves the bloc in order to adjust to the disruptions that could arise. The fear is that Brexit could cause havoc with the carefully choreographed just-in-time production processes at assembly plants. In Britain, more than half of the components in cars come from the European Union, entering seamlessly on trucks from the Continent and arriving within minutes of being fitted in the final product. After Brexit, those trucks could face substantial delays if they must go through customs checkpoints. Without a clear sense of the terms of Britain’s scheduled departure in a couple of weeks, making plans for production a few years down the line is more difficult. Investment into Britain’s auto industry fell by half last year. ​Amie Tsang is a general assignment business reporter based in London, where she has covered a variety of topics, including the gender pay gap, aviation and the London Fatberg.  @amietsang AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Erin GriffithSAN FRANCISCO — Pinterest confidentially filed paperwork to go public, according to two people familiar with the decision, joining a stampede of high-profile start-ups heading toward the public markets.

At the time, it had 250 million monthly active users.Mike Mayzel, a Pinterest spokesman, declined to comment.The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that Pinterest had filed the paperwork with regulators. The stampede of initial public offerings by highly valued Silicon Valley companies has intensified in recent weeks. Lyft is preparing to begin trading its shares in late April. Its ride-hailing rival, Uber, which filed its initial paperwork with the S.E.C. last year, is expected to follow. Investment bankers have estimated that Uber could be worth $120 billion on the public market. Slack, an office messaging app company, has also filed to go public. The company was last valued at $7.1 billion by private investors. Postmates, a food delivery app worth nearly $2 billion, has also filed confidential paperwork to go public. Pinterest has plenty of cash: It raised around $1.5 billion in venture capital funding and has come close to profitability in the past. But it is unclear how investors will view the company, which makes money from online advertising and competes against Facebook, Instagram, Google, Twitter and Snap for market share.The company is unusual in Silicon Valley for its avoidance of hype and media coverage. That reluctance has frustrated some investors and executives, leading to executive turnover in recent years. But others view Pinterest’s reserved, slow and steady approach as the reason for its success. In contrast to its social media peers like Facebook and Twitter, Pinterest has taken bold steps to eradicate potentially harmful disinformation from its platform. The company recently removed search results for content related to vaccines to prevent false anti-vaccination memes and information from spreading.Ben Silbermann, Evan Sharp and Paul Sciarra founded Pinterest in 2010. The company’s growth took off soon after, particularly among Midwestern women. In recent years, user growth had slowed, but Mr. Silbermann, the chief executive, resisted Silicon Valley’s typical tricks for juicing the numbers in the short term, favoring what he called “quality growth.” “There’s a natural rate at which you can scale a company that’s healthy,” he told The New York Times last year.A year ago, the company hired Francoise Brougher as its chief operating officer, a move that many people in the industry saw as a sign that Pinterest would soon tap the public markets. Ms. Brougher helped take Square, the payments company, public in 2015. In November, in a sign that it wanted to promote itself more than it had in the past, the company hired Andréa Mallard, formerly a marketer at Gap Inc.’s Athleta brand, as its chief marketing officer.Some of the companies from this generation of start-ups plan to do nontraditional public offerings called direct listings.In a direct listing, companies do not go on I.P.O. “road shows” to pitch their stock to potential investors, nor do they issue new shares or arrange stock sales in advance of the listing. This avoids lockup periods when a stock first goes on the market. During that period, insiders cannot sell their stock. The option is attractive for companies that have no need to tap the public markets for more money. It has piqued the interest of highly valued start-ups that have raised billions from private market investors.Spotify, the music streaming company, had a successful direct listing last year. Slack plans to follow in its footsteps with a similar transaction in the coming months.But Pinterest plans to pursue a traditional I.P.O., one of the people familiar with the situation said.Erin Griffith reports on technology start-ups and venture capital from the San Francisco bureau. Before joining The Times she was a senior writer at WIRED and Fortune.  @eringriffith AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Reuters(Reuters) - Pinterest Inc on Monday set a price range of $15 to $17 per share for its initial public offering of 75 million shares, valuing it below the $12 billion at which the online image-search company sourced its last fundraising in 2017. At the upper end of its target range, the company could have a market valuation of about $11.30 billion and could raise $1.3 billion in net proceeds, taking into account restricted stock units and options.Reuters had reported in January Pinterest, which plans to list under the symbol "PINS" on the New York Stock Exchange, could raise around $1.5 billion and that the IPO was likely to come in the first six months of 2019.The company, which owns the image search website known for the food and fashion photos that its users post, reported annual revenue of $755.9 million in 2018, up 60 percent from a year earlier. But it remains unprofitable even though its net loss narrowed to $62.97 million in 2018 from $130 million a year earlier.The company will go public with a dual-class share structure to concentrate voting power with Class B shareholders, which included Co-founder, President and Chief Executive Officer Benjamin Silbermann, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Pinterest would join a bevy of high-profile companies that went public, including Lyft Inc and Levi Strauss. Ride-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc is also expected to kick off its IPO this month, according to sources.Profitability has been a key theme for companies that have gone public since the start of the year. Lyft's shares slipped below their IPO price on the second day after its debut as analysts did not see a clear path to profitability.IPOs of Pinterest and other such loss-making unicorns have presented a predicament for investors sitting on the fence since they do not want to miss out on popular companies with fast growth, but at the same time have to weigh the risks of businesses with unproven economics.

The idea of the open road evokes these intertwined meanings: The freedom to use it should be free. Residential street parking should be free. Traffic lanes should be free. Stretches of public curb dedicated to private driveways? Those should be free, too.In other ways, the government has heavily subsidized driving, or hidden the reality of who pays for it in places no one sees. Local laws require off-street parking from businesses and housing developers, who pass on the construction cost of it to tenants and customers who may not drive at all.Federal and state governments fund roads with gas taxes that feel far removed from a direct user fee (and that have come to operate like less and less of one in an era of fuel efficiency).“They add up to a pretty giant system of subsidies,” said Michael Manville, a professor of urban planning at the University of California, Los Angeles. “But they don’t look like what we often consider subsidies.”This system looks to us, instead, like an entitlement — driving is an American right, and so the infrastructure that enables it should be free.Congestion pricing is premised instead on the notion that public roads are a valuable and scarce resource. And we should pay in some places to use it not primarily to gin up revenue, but to help manage access for everyone.“It’s a huge departure from how we’ve culturally thought about this over the years,” said Kari Watkins, a professor at Georgia Tech’s School of Civil and Environmental Engineering.In reality, the government is a monopoly provider of road space, and the government has largely chosen to give it away. It’s no surprise, then, that the vast majority of American commuters drive to work alone, or that all those lonely commuters (plus taxis, Ubers, buses and delivery trucks) cause congestion.When the government holds down the price of something people value, Mr. Manville said, we get shortages. And congestion is effectively a shortage of road — one that occurs at the peak times when people want to use it most.If we had that problem with other kinds of infrastructure or commodities, we’d charge people more for them. If airline tickets were particularly in demand, their prices would go up. If there were a run on avocados, grocers wouldn’t respond by keeping them as cheap as possible. “The roads hold such a special position in our brain that we use logic around them that we would never use around everything else,” Mr. Manville said.Other countries have socialized health care, parental leave or housing, Jeffrey Tumlin, a transportation consultant at Nelson\Nygaard, pointed out. In America, we’ve socialized driving — and housing for our cars.“We don’t let people put their self-storage containers in public parks, but it’s just fine to store their cars on other public land for free,” Mr. Tumlin wrote in an email. Peter Norton, a historian at the University of Virginia, traces this thinking to the 1920s and ’30s, when industry groups and government officials were debating whether to fund America’s expanding roads with tolls, which were by then common on bridges. Road builders were happy to have tolls, and they appeared in places like the Pennsylvania Turnpike. But auto clubs and car manufacturers dependent on car sales opposed them. They preferred a gas tax, a cost less visible to drivers every time they got in a car. Together, they were remarkably savvy about branding the choice as one between “toll roads and free roads.” (A 1939 federal report even adopted that phrase as its title.)“Of course, there’s no such thing as a free road,” Mr. Norton said. “But they were making the ambiguous association between their cause and the great cause of freedom.”Industry publications at the time linked the need for “free” roads to patriotism, the Bill of Rights, even the Minutemen. Today, because most people seldom pay directly for roads — or because general funds do — it can seem as if no one does.“Therefore the street transportation system has no cost,” said Yonah Freemark, a doctoral student in city planning at M.I.T., who runs the blog The Transport Politic. “And therefore we can just expect to have unlimited parking, we can expect to have unlimited access to neighborhoods, for whatever reason, for free.”Take those expectations to their logical conclusion in a major city today, and you get 10-mile-per-hour road speeds, rampant double parking, clogged intersections and worsening commute times. You get, finally, the political will for congestion pricing.Now the culture of limitless, cheap driving may begin to shift in some places. But it will take much longer to change the physical environment that has grown up around that culture over decades, leaving many people without good alternatives to driving alone.Where there are few other choices, like reliable bus routes, congestion pricing risks burdening poorer drivers in particular. But that is a problem we’ve thought about before, too, Mr. Manville said, if we’re now willing to treat roads as we do other infrastructure. He pointed to “lifeline” utility services: subsidized rates for electricity and gas offered to users with fewer resources.“Fortunately, congestion pricing comes with its own built-in solution,” he said, “which is that it raises a ton of money.”Emily Badger writes about cities and urban policy for The Upshot from the Washington bureau.

Here are some of them.By Erin GriffithBrian Chesky, chief executive of Airbnb, likes to tell the story of his early struggles to fund his home-sharing start-up. Many venture capitalists refused to meet with him, he said in an email. Some walked out in the middle of meetings. That changed after venture firms such as Sequoia Capital, Andreessen Horowitz and Founders Fund decided to gamble on Airbnb’s potential to shake up the vacation rentals business. Three investors at those firms — Alfred Lin of Sequoia, Jeff Jordan at Andreessen Horowitz and Brian Singerman of Founders Fund — are now among the top players in the venture capital industry, according to an annual ranking compiled for The New York Times by CB Insights, which tracks the start-up industry. Airbnb, privately valued at $31 billion, landed more venture investors at the top of the list than any other company.In his email, Mr. Chesky said Mr. Lin, Mr. Jordan and Mr. Singerman “have a founder’s mind-set” and “share our long-term vision.”Airbnb is expected to go public sometime in the next year, following a bumper crop of initial public offerings that began on Friday with the ride-hailing company Lyft. Uber, Pinterest, Slack and others are also expected to list their shares in the next few months. These offerings will likely mint many venture capital winners, generating huge returns for those who wrote the early checks to these companies. Here’s a look at some of the venture investors who may reap the I.P.O. rewards.When Uber goes public, Mr. Lin may feel a sting. That’s because he made a small personal investment in the ride-hailing company when it was very young, but turned down numerous chances to invest on behalf of Sequoia as Uber grew into a behemoth. “We just didn’t dream with the entrepreneurs,” said Mr. Lin, 46, who joined Sequoia in 2010. “Sometimes we just make the wrong call.”He may have other opportunities to celebrate. Mr. Lin and Sequoia invested early in Airbnb; DoorDash, a food delivery start-up valued at $7.1 billion; and Houzz, a home design and remodeling start-up worth $4 billion.Sequoia wrote Airbnb a $585,000 check in 2009 and invested in each of the company’s later funding rounds. Mr. Lin said he was impressed by how the Airbnb founders could “articulate a dream of the world that is very different from what exists today.”Yet sometimes those lofty dreams clashed with reality. As Airbnb grew, Mr. Chesky said, he wanted to hire executives from Apple and Disney, companies he admired for their creativity, design and simple product lines.Mr. Lin, a former executive at Amazon-owned Zappos, said he had gently suggested that Airbnb emulate businesses that looked more like itself: ones with complex operations in many different places and a wide array of inventory, like Airbnb’s millions of home listings. To help make the point, Mr. Lin introduced Mr. Chesky to Jeff Wilke, the head of Amazon’s retail business, in 2012. That meeting persuaded Mr. Chesky to shift his focus. Airbnb ended up poaching top Amazon executives to become its chief financial officer and head of its homes business.“Part of our job is to help with the sparring of ideas,” Mr. Lin said.With the I.P.O. stampede now on, he said, he is cautioning companies not to rush to go public because their peers are doing so. “These things are milestones, to some degree, that you celebrate,” he said. “But soon after you go public, you have to go back to running your business.”What’s next? Mr. Lin said he and his team were looking at everything from robotics and artificial intelligence to payments and short-form video.Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, the founders of Andreessen Horowitz, have long been fixtures in the top rankings of venture capital investors, thanks to investments in companies like Lyft. Mr. Jordan, their partner, has recently outdone them.Mr. Jordan, 60, got behind companies such as Pinterest, the digital pin board, which recently filed its prospectus for going public. He also bet on Instacart, the grocery delivery company worth $7.6 billion, and Lime, a scooter start-up valued at $2.4 billion. In 2011, Mr. Jordan also led Andreessen Horowitz’s $60 million investment in Airbnb. He has said the company’s “marketplace” model of matching travelers with home providers reminded him of the early days of eBay, where he was an executive for five years. When Airbnb experienced a hiccup in 2011 — a host’s home was trashed by a guest — Mr. Jordan helped the company with a new insurance program, Airbnb Guarantee, which was modeled after one at eBay. Mr. Jordan, who also led OpenTable before joining Andreessen Horowitz in 2011, said part of his investment success was due to the firm’s wide range of services for start-ups, including recruiting, public relations and business development. It was once unusual for venture firms to to provide those services, though they have become more common. Apoorva Mehta, founder and chief executive of Instacart, said Mr. Jordan often provided corporate development advice and introductions to potential retail partners. “Jeff has always felt like an extension of our team,” Mr. Mehta said. Mr. Jordan, who declined to comment on the current wave of I.P.O.s, said he was looking for the next “platform,” which could be voice or augmented reality and virtual reality. Founders Fund does not offer a suite of services to its start-ups. That’s in keeping with the contrarian philosophy of its founder, Peter Thiel.“We’re not operating the company,” Mr. Singerman, a partner at the firm, said of the reason for not providing additional services. He added that he also eschewed the typical venture capital practice of investing in companies based on a specific strategy or thesis. “That is not me,” he said. “I’m actually open to anything. “All of this helps explain why Mr. Singerman, a 42-year-old former Google engineer, has backed companies as diverse as a health insurance start-up, a payments company, a cancer drug maker and a seller of cheap novelty gifts. And, of course, Airbnb.When Founders Fund helped fund Airbnb in 2013, its international growth had begun taking off. “We had never seen an international network effect like they had,” Mr. Singerman said. He said Mr. Chesky also had a strong sense of what his customers wanted and “kind of wills things into existence.” Mr. Singerman, who joined Founders Fund in 2008, said his biggest challenge was finding the right companies and persuading the founders to let him invest. To source deals, he relies on a broad network of contacts, which led him to Stemcentrx, a cancer drug company that was sold to AbbVie in 2016 for $5.8 billion, and RigUp, an online job platform for energy industry workers.There’s one area in which Mr. Singerman is like other venture capitalists: his professed nonchalance toward I.P.O.s. Founders Fund tends to hold stock in its investments “for a very, very long time,” so a company’s public offering “doesn’t impact us,” he said. In 2016, Mr. Singerman invested in a company called Long Term Stock Exchange. Founded by Eric Ries, the author of the start-up bible “The Lean Startup,” the company wants to open a new stock exchange for young companies that are seeking investors who will stick around for the long haul.Mr. Ries said he had gone to Mr. Singerman for funding because he knew his idea was “out on a limb” and would require patience from investors. CB Insights analyzed investors’ deals, including companies that sold or went public and the value of current portfolio companies, to rank the top venture capitalists. The analysis spanned 2010 through March 2019 and is weighted toward more recent performance. The Times presents the top 20 here:1. Neil Shen — Sequoia Capital China2.

Electric scooters, owned by start-ups looking to mimic the success of ride-hailing companies like Uber, appeared around town. The idea was simple: Use a smartphone app to rent a scooter and then leave it at the end of the ride for the next person.Soon, people in cities from San Francisco to Paris were complaining that the scooters were all over sidewalks — usually without the approval of local officials.In Portland, Ore., city officials worried that they would soon get their own flock of uninvited scooters. So they established a four-month pilot program in July with a limit on scooters and a requirement that companies share detailed data about trips and injuries with city officials.That data, released Tuesday by the city’s Bureau of Transportation, offers the most detailed analysis of the impact of e-scooters on a city. Scooters often replaced short car trips in Portland, offering some support for one of the biggest selling points the companies have made to communities: They can help reduce congestion and pollution. And the scooters did not lead to as many injuries as some had feared.But it is not yet clear if scooter companies can comply with different cities’ tight and varying limits and still run profitable local operations. The programs often cap the number of scooters and dictate which neighborhoods they ought to be in.“That is not letting the market determine how many scooters should be anywhere,” said Gabriel Scheer, Lime’s director of strategic development. “How do you unfetter us in a way that allows us to meet demand?”Still, Portland officials are using the pilot program to make a big point with start-ups: It is better to ask permission and work with local regulators than risk being run out of a community.That has not always been the case among start-ups trying to get a piece of the so-called sharing economy. Ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft and the short-term rental company Airbnb have usually jumped into new markets before local regulators have had time to understand their businesses.For the scooter start-ups, not asking for permission has had consequences. After Lime and Bird began to operate without permission in San Francisco, the city instituted a permit system — but issued permits to only Skip and another smaller competitor, Scoot, effectively locking Lime and Bird out of the city. Some cities have simply impounded the scooters.“A lot of these companies roll into town, flout local regulations, see what they can get away with and how far they can push cities to accommodate them,” said Chloe Eudaly, a Portland city commissioner. “I feel like there is somewhat of a reversal of that trend among these companies and they are learning that’s not necessarily the best way to do business.”Other cities are establishing permit programs to limit the impact of unexpected scooter invasions. Washington, for example, said in November that companies could deploy no more than 600 scooters each, which Bird argued would make it “impossible” to provide full service.Bird, Lime and Skip received permits to operate in Portland. They handed over a wealth of data about scooter rides, giving city regulators access to information about where each trip started, the route it followed, where it ended and what time of day it occurred. Personal information on riders, such as payment data, was not shared.Portland capped the number of scooters at about 2,000, roughly divided among the three companies. Mr. Scheer, from Lime, said the cap system made it difficult to determine how many scooters a city actually needed.But he added that the limits forced scooter companies to hone their operations, offer scooters with smoother rides and ensure they were deployed in neighborhoods where they could draw the most riders. And the caps forced the start-ups to compete on how well they could comply with the city’s mandates rather than playing a numbers game.“We don’t think this is a land-grab type of business. This is one where you have to solve problems in a sustainable way,” said Sanjay Dastoor, the chief executive of Skip. “Having more vehicles on the road isn’t going to help if there aren’t places where people can ride them and feel safe.”The data that Portland collected allowed the city to assess whether e-scooters live up to their promises of reducing pollution and congestion. According to a citywide survey, 34 percent of residents who used the scooters and took a survey said they had used e-scooters to replace driving their own car or taking an Uber.City officials also had concerns about accessibility and safety, but saw low rates of injury and will continue to study those issues during a second test run.Some rules were meant to get the scooters into neighborhoods that could be underserved. One hundred scooters from each company had to be positioned in East Portland, a lower-income neighborhood with poor access to Portland’s public transit system. About 6 percent of the city’s rides originated in that neighborhood.Scooter start-ups didn’t always comply with restrictions, according to the report. The scooters often exceeded the speed limit of 15 miles an hour that the city had imposed, and none of the start-ups completely fulfilled their obligations to deploy scooters in East Portland.Over the four-month program, Portlanders took 700,369 scooter rides. Nineteen percent of those rides occurred between 3 and 6 p.m. on weekdays. But it was a small sample size compared with other cities. In Paris, which has no scooter cap, Lime alone provided more than a million rides over four months.When the Portland pilot effort ended in November, all of the e-scooters were cleared off the streets. The city is planning a second, yearlong pilot program in the spring but has not decided how many scooters it will allow, a spokesman said.“It seemed like a little bit of carnival on our streets for a while, but I think they definitely have potential to make our city easier to navigate for a lot of different people in different ways,” Ms. Eudaly said.She even took a ride on an e-scooter. “It was fun. It was easy,” she said.Follow Kate Conger on Twitter: @kateconger.Erin Griffith contributed reporting.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byEntrepreneurshipBy Janet MorrisseyBusinesses can deliver everything on demand, from dinner to dry cleaning. Some will even show up at your door to give you cupcakes or walk your dog. Now, entrepreneurs are exploring a growing niche: health care.Start-ups are offering access to doctors, prescription drugs and wellness programs as fast and easy as hailing an Uber driver. Experts say this is the early stages of a movement that could disrupt the health services industry, which critics have long contended suffers from soaring costs and reduced access to care. Seven in 10 Americans in a recent Gallup poll said they believed health care was “in a state of crisis” or had “major problems.”“Health care delivery is so broken that we need to explore new channels — new conduits — and this represents one of them,” said Dr. Eric Topol, a cardiologist and the author of “The Patient Will See You Now.”The on-demand economy, which offers consumers immediate access to goods and services, surged 58 percent in 2017 from the previous year to an estimated $75.7 billion, according to a study by Rockbridge Associates, a market research firm.As the industry swells, dozens of health and wellness companies are tapping the trend.Heal, DispatchHealth, MedZed, Dose Healthcare and Pager will send a doctor or a nurse practitioner to a person’s home or workplace to treat nonemergency problems like strep throat or a sprained ankle. The I.V. Doc offers intravenous treatments for conditions like jet lag, hangovers and food poisoning. And Capsule will deliver prescriptions to a person’s doorstep.“People want convenience,” said Josh York, founder of GymGuyz, a “gym on wheels” that sends a trainer and fitness equipment to customers’ homes. “You could get your pizza delivered but you couldn’t get your workout delivered, and I thought, ‘This is where the future is going.’”GymGuyz and other start-ups, like the I.V. Doc, were bootstrapped by the founders’ friends and family. But some — especially on-demand medical companies, like Heal and DispatchHealth — needed substantial cash to hire doctors, lease vehicles and bring in administrative staff to handle insurance claims.Cue the investors, many of whom are hunting for the next billion-dollar opportunity.Samir M. Patel, a principal and co-founder of IRA Capital, was so impressed with Heal after using it for at-home visits and an annual physical in his office that he became an investor.“To us, this feels like we’re investing in Uber in 2010,” Mr. Patel said. “This is going to revolutionize and change the entire health care industry.”Uber, a pioneer in the on-demand economy, could be worth as much as $120 billion as it prepares for an initial public offering this year.Heal has raised $70 million from such investors as the former Qualcomm executive chairman Paul Jacobs, Tull Investment Group and the singer Lionel Richie, while DispatchHealth has raised $36 million from such investors as Questa Capital and Alta Partners.But the potential to be the next “unicorn” — a start-up valued at $1 billion or more — has created a crowded field.The popularity of the I.V. Doc prompted a flurry of smaller companies, like IVDrips, Drip Hydration and the Hangover Club/NutriDrip, to offer similar services — sometimes at cheaper prices. To fend off competition, the I.V. Doc recently expanded to offer injectable drugs, like Botox and Restylane, as well as postoperative care for plastic surgery.Large tech companies are seeking a bigger share of the more than $3 trillion spent annually on health care in the United States. Amazon, which has been making an aggressive push into health care, announced last year that it would buy PillPack, an online service that organizes and delivers prescription medications. Apple and Alphabet, Google’s parent company, have also made significant acquisitions as they accelerate their efforts on new technologies for doctors, patients and consumers.“Health care is a $3.5 trillion industry — who wouldn’t want a piece of that?” said Jeff Becker, a senior analyst and health care IT expert at Forrester.But start-ups are facing challenges on their path to financial viability. Because mobility brings extra liability, one of the biggest roadblocks is insurance for themselves. Problems can crop up on the road, like traffic accidents, or in a customer’s home, like an equipment malfunction. Or perhaps a doctor, lacking sufficient equipment, makes an incorrect diagnosis. These headaches can make it difficult for start-ups to find proper protection.Dr. Adam Nadelson, the founder of the I.V. Doc, approached five insurers in 2013 before finally finding one to sign on.“It was a mixture of them not understanding what we were doing and then some gave us a price that was just outrageous,” he said.Mr. York of GymGuyz had more than 30 meetings over six months to get an insurer before starting his company in 2008.“It was very very hard; I had to really paint the vision and meet with a lot of people because the business was so different,” Mr. York said. “The doors were shut on me so hard that my nose was hurting.”Insurance not only protects the company, business owners say, it also covers employees, who take a risk entering a private residence.“We have walked into a house and somebody had a gun or walked into a yard where there’s a pit bull,” said Dr. Mark Prather, chief executive and co-founder of DispatchHealth. Both DispatchHealth and Heal always send two people to house calls for safety and efficiency.Getting their customers’ health care insurers on board is equally critical, and providers are slowly coming around.Owners who offer medical care contend that their business model will save insurers money because people will seek medical attention sooner if it’s fast, easy and affordable and does not require monthlong waits for an appointment or long waits in a doctor’s office. And they say early detection and treatment could prevent a problem from morphing into a debilitating illness that later requires an emergency room visit or hospitalization. Visits to the E.R. can cost $1,000 to $2,500, Dr. Prather said.Entrepreneurs point out another benefit: Their doctors and nurses can identify health triggers in a patient’s home.A Los Angeles man who had called for a Heal doctor complained of migraine headaches, recalled Nick Desai, a co-founder of Heal. The man had been to eight doctors, had three M.R.I. scans and had tried multiple medications. When the Heal doctor arrived, he noticed black mold.“So the patient hired a cleaning person to clean the black mold — and his migraine headaches were gone,” Mr. Desai said.Insurers are beginning to add on-demand services to their plans and even forming managed care partnerships with start-ups to visit people at home with chronic conditions, like hypertension and diabetes. Anthem, Health Net, Blue Shield, Aetna, CareFirst, United Healthcare, Cigna and Medicare are among the insurers that cover Heal visits in many of their P.P.O. plans, Mr. Desai said.As their businesses expand, owners must navigate complex health care regulations, which can vary from state to state.“Every state acts as their own country, with their own kooky laws, and understanding those rules and regulations costs an obscene amount of money in legal fees to understand how to operate one’s business,” Dr. Nadelson said.Before Amazon bought PillPack, it tried to enter the world of prescription drugs with a deal to acquire a stake in Drugstore.com. But it ran into regulatory challenges, and the effort was derailed. Amazon found a solution in PillPack, which has pharmacy licenses in 50 states and relationships with the major pharmacy benefit managers and insurers.Despite the barriers, experts believe on-demand health services are here to stay.“This has the potential to be life-altering,” said Dr. Griffin Myers, a co-founder and the chief medical officer at Oak Street Health, a network of primary care practices for people on Medicare.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byThe language portraying second jobs as liberating or glamorous masks the reality of the insecure working lives of many Americans. By Alissa QuartMs. Quart is the author of “Squeezed: Why Our Families Can’t Afford America.”An attractive woman behind the wheel of a gray car says to the camera, “These days anyone can have a side hustle.” She then whisks off to the gym, for her other job as a personal trainer, beaming as she goes from one gig to another. This ad for the ride-share company Uber seeks to entice new drivers to join their ranks by using the “side hustle” come-on. The company isn’t alone. Similarly laborious “side hustles” are celebrated in popular media and advertising, from self-help articles and other web content that exhort us to, say, work for a design studio part-time or sell CBD oil (great as a side hustle for moms, supposedly). Even pastors can use a side hustle, according to one evangelical blogger. During tax season, you will also find filing suggestions for side hustlers. (Report all of your income! Deduct expenses!)The truth is, working multiple gigs creates complications when you do your taxes. Compared with those with salaried jobs, who pay their taxes seamlessly through withholding, for side hustlers “the process will be a lot messier,” according to Steven Dean, the faculty director of the Graduate Tax Program at New York University Law School. You have to estimate and pay taxes on your own, he notes, and your expenses may not be reimbursed by your employer. In other words, paying quarterly tax estimates gives workers with side hustles yet another side hustle — being their own accountant, although this gig doesn’t even pay.Nevertheless, this nouveau moonlighting continues to be exalted ­as cool, empowering or freeing. This mantra is false: Side hustles are not simply a new version of working as a “wage slave” so that we can do what we love in our off hours. Instead, far more often, people take on second or third side hustles because of wage stagnation or low pay at their full-time jobs. Over the past few years, I have interviewed dozens of people who work a full-time job or close to it — teachers, professors, administrators and nurses, among others — and supplement their incomes by driving for Lyft or serving as a barista. They are not doing it for the glamour. They need these second jobs because their first jobs don’t cover astronomically rising rents, record health care costs or swelling college tuition. A full 30 percent of Americans do something else for pay in addition to their full-time jobs, according to an NPR/Marist survey last year.Yet this sales pitch for the “side hustle” takes what we once called, more drably, another job and gives it a gloss, with a tiny shot of Superfly, disguising unstable working hours and a lack of bargaining power as liberation. You can see the twisted alchemy of what Reddit’s founder Alexis Ohanian has called “hustle porn.”Commercial websites like Side Hustle Nation extol the joy of the new unstable labor, although its payoff actually arrives for only a few. As Nick Loper, the site’s “chief side hustler” writes, “My escape route was a side hustle business I built in my spare time — and you can do it too.” Medium has a whole Side Hustle publication. It bears the legend “You’re more than your day job.”This language tries to make the dreary carousel of contemporary life sound more fun. “The phrase the ‘side hustle’ has gained a strange kind of prestige from downwardly mobile, college-educated tech workers,” said John Patrick Leary, the author of “Keywords: The New Language of Capitalism,” a sharp recent book on this troubling new lingo. Its glitz and energy derives from “a hip-hop genealogy,” although the side hustles name-checked in that genre are perhaps not the same as those imagined by Uber.The “side hustle” is one of a growing roster of trendy corporatized idioms, like ordinary household appliances that are now “smart” or plain vanilla businessmen and women remade into the more exotic “entrepreneurs.” Our jobs are now “flexible,” although we are the ones contorting ourselves to work at all hours, or we are professionally “nimble” because we are trying to survive on freelance gigs. Ultimately, like so much of this lexicon, the “side hustle” describes the overworked outsiders to privilege, who are forced into informal vocations by the absence of a legitimate economy. They are then told that suffering is valiant and also groovy. In a recent viral BuzzFeed piece describing millennials as the “burnout generation,” side hustles are listed as one of the main culprits.There are some surprising benefits to side hustles. The 2017 tax reform introduced the qualified business income deduction, which provides side hustling workers with a rate reduction. But some people may not understand it, and this small benefit doesn’t make up for an uncertain work life. So what can we do? For starters, anyone writing about work, whether as a journalist or as a social media exhibitionist, should stop glorifying long hours at work or juggling multiple workplace identities. Instead, we could be more open about what all these “side hustles” are really doing to our minds and bodies.As workers, we might acknowledge that “side hustle” is an insidious term and resolve never to use it again. More broadly, we must fight other forms of this falsifying new jargon and seek out more truthful language. We could follow Raymond Williams, the cultural theorist, who once wrote that we should interrogate the language of contemporary society and “change as we find it necessary to change it, as we go on making our own language and history.” Most important, we can agitate to raise wages. If we do that, we won’t need cute euphemisms to cloak the chaotic truth of working life in today’s America.Alissa Quart, executive director of the Economic Hardship Reporting Project, is the author of “Squeezed: Why Our Families Can’t Afford America.”The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

By Sarah AmandolareThe first challenge you face on arriving somewhere new is usually how to get around, but the right technology can make it easier. There are tools suited to specific destinations, or to modes of transport, whether you want to hail a ride in Tel Aviv, explore Paris by scooter or catch a bus from Bangkok to Chiang Mai.Here are some free transportation apps, beyond the usual Google Maps and Google Translate, to consider downloading before your next trip.Sometimes walking is faster than taking the bus, or the most direct route includes a tram and a bike ride. Citymapper helps you figure all that out, and it works in 39 cities around the world, including Tokyo, Copenhagen and Sydney. Plug in your starting and ending points, and get a list of possible routes organized by mode of transport. The app also displays trip duration and any applicable prices (like estimated cab or subway fares), along with tips for where to sit on the train and which station exit to use to reach your destination faster.You can receive alerts when it’s time to disembark, and when there are line delays or closures. You can even use it to plan your daily commute, and get a warning to leave before you’re late for work, or estimates on when you’ll get home depending on when you leave the office. The app also shows how many shared bikes and free bike spaces are available at a given location in real time, making pickup and drop-off more efficient.Depending on your destination, you may have to break your Uber or Lyft habit when you arrive: the former is banned in several European countries and parts of Australia, and operates in a gray area in others, like in Hong Kong . The latter only operates in the United States.You may also prefer to hail rides from licensed taxis. You don’t have to give up the convenience of an app to do it, though. Gett will get you a cab in Israel, Russia and the United Kingdom; and in New York City, the company has merged with ride-sharing platform Juno. Gett allows you to book a ride with an economy or higher-end car up to two weeks in advance, or on-demand. Like any good ride-sharing app, your driver’s location is displayed in real time while you wait to be picked up, but with Gett, you can pay in cash or through the app. Taxify is a similar option that’s available in 60 cities across 29 countries, including throughout Europe and Africa. Like Uber or Lyft, its drivers are not actual taxi drivers however; the company is called Txfy in France to avoid confusion. Taxify offers different vehicle tiers, displays real-time driver location and it lets you pay through the app. Some destinations offer alternatives to cars. For example, you can hail motorcycles and auto-rickshaws in East Africa, and rent GPS-enabled scooters in Paris.If you want to explore Europe or North America without renting a car, Wanderu can help you find and book bus, train and ferry tickets instead. The app aggregates options from big-name carriers like Amtrak and Deutsche Bahn, as well as niche brands, like FlixBus and the Tallink Silja Line, a Baltic Sea ferry service.You can quickly sort options according to your schedule, budget and preferred mode of transport — maybe you want the cheapest overnight bus or the earliest luxury train.Currently, Wanderu has a separate flight finder powered by Skyscanner, but flights will be integrated into overall search results next year, so you’ll be able to see airfares along with ferries and ground transportation options in one place.A website called Bookaway provides a similar service in developing countries, including throughout Southeast Asia. You can search for bus, train and ferry options, and see whether a carrier offers amenities such as bathrooms and Wi-Fi before booking your tickets.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy ReutersVIENNA — As carmakers push ahead with self-driving vehicles, an Austrian aerospace company and its Chinese partner showed off their pilot-less "flying taxi" for the first time in Europe on Thursday.The drone's 16 propellers hummed loudly as it rose above the pitch at Vienna's Generali Arena, home to soccer club Austria Wien. The slim plane, which weighs 340 kg (750 pounds), circled in the air briefly and came down within a few minutes. The EHang 216, which can seat two passengers, has been tested comprehensively and is essentially ready for mass production, said Derrick Xiong, co-founder of Chinese drone maker EHang.Joining the race for new autonomous aircraft services that do not require runways, EHang entered a strategic partnership with Austria's FACC, owned by Chinese aerospace group AVIC, last year, aiming to offer short-haul services for passengers, industrial equipment and urgent medical deliveries.The drone can fly at up to 150 km per hour (90 mph) for almost half an hour, FACC Chief Executive Officer Robert Machtlinger said. "It can travel between 50 and 70 kilometers depending on the payload."The passenger cabin is small, with leg room that taller passengers might find less-than adequate, an Austrian photographer who took part in a demonstration flight told Reuters.FACC says it has already received several thousand orders for the 300,000 euro ($336,000) drone, with the highest demand in China.Competitors working toward offering autonomous flying cars early in the next decade range from aerospace giant Airbus to Uber, and AeroMobil. "Technically... urban mobility, flying without a pilot is possible, it's not a dream, it's existing," said Machtlinger."What is hindering us to go into larger volumes is regulation," he added. A future legal framework for autonomous flying vehicles should regulate communication with other planes and helicopters and provide traffic rules, he said.Austria supports international efforts to quickly establish the necessary regulation, said transport minister Norbert Hofer."I hope that Austria will be the place where thousands of these drones, of these air taxis will be built and I hope that very soon we will see a lot of these air taxis in the air," Hofer said.

President Trump is famously an avid consumer of Fox News. And The Sun, a British tabloid, was one of the most influential voices in favor of Britain’s withdrawal from the E.U.Their power is strongest in Australia. Murdoch properties in the country have both pushed to repeal a carbon tax and helped topple a series of prime ministers.Seeing Fox News as an arm of Mr. Trump’s White House misses a larger picture. “It may be more accurate to say that the White House — just like the prime ministers’ offices in Britain and Australia — is just one tool among many that this family use to exert influence over world events.”The clan is fracturing. Lachlan Murdoch, who is now C.E.O. of the Fox Corporation, which controls the family’s remaining holdings, fought the effort to sell most of the company to Disney. He suspected his brother, James, of putting himself above the family. The two now barely speak to each other.Several siblings wanted to get out altogether. James and two sisters, Elisabeth and Prudence, offered to sell their holdings in Fox to Lachlan. Rupert Murdoch is said to have encouraged the move, but Lachlan ultimately backed off — raising questions about his commitment to the company.David Solomon, the Wall Street bank’s chief, was spotted in Saudi Arabia recently, according to Bloomberg. It’s the latest sign that American businesses are ready to work with the kingdom again, months after the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.• Mr. Solomon is “the first head of a global U.S. bank known to have traveled to the country” since the outrage over Mr. Khashoggi’s death last year, according to Bloomberg.• It shows a change in attitude within American companies toward Saudi Arabia.

Much progress has reportedly been made, but the I.M.F. and the W.T.O. both say that missteps could prove costly for the global economy.“Officials have resolved most of the issues standing in the way of a deal to end their long-running trade dispute,” according to the FT. Later today, Liu He, China’s vice premier, is to meet Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative, and Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, to continue discussions.Crucial details need to be hashed out. “The two sides remain apart on two key issues — the fate of existing U.S. levies on Chinese goods, which Beijing wants to see removed, and the terms of an enforcement mechanism demanded by Washington to ensure that China abides by the deal,” the FT adds.Striking an effective agreement is important, according to Christine Lagarde of the I.M.F. “Nobody wins a trade war,” she said in Washington yesterday. “That is why we need to work together to reduce trade barriers and modernize the global trade system.” And the W.T.O. said that a slowdown in global trade would continue through this year. “It is increasingly urgent that we resolve tensions,” said Roberto Azevêdo, the body’s director general.If there is a breakthrough, President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China could sign a deal as soon as this month. Otherwise, the two countries could extend the negotiations until the G-20 meeting in Japan in late June, the FT says.Prime Minister Theresa May said yesterday that she planned to cooperate with the opposition Labour Party to avoid a disorderly Brexit, Stephen Castle and Ellen Barry of the NYT report.With only 10 days left until Britain is set to leave the E.U., Mrs. May is effectively turning her back on Brexit hard-liners in her own party. She will instead try to develop a plan with cross-party support. She added that she would ask European leaders for an extension.Canceling Brexit is not an option. “Closer economic ties with the bloc through a customs union or membership in its single market are up for discussion and even a referendum confirming any deal has not been excluded, Mrs. May’s aides said,” Mr. Castle and Ms. Barry write.But the Labour Party’s cooperation — and E.U. approval for another delay — are not certain.Brussels is expected to put strict conditions on an extension. They might include “the need to hold European Parliament elections and a possible ‘gentleman’s agreement’ over Britain’s future conduct as a member state,” according to the FT.The world’s biggest ride-hailing company spent $2 million backing a campaign to impose tolls on vehicles entering Manhattan below 60th Street, the FT reports. New York State adopted the measure this weekend.• “Uber lobbied lawmakers, ran television ads and contributed $700,000 to the advocacy group Fix Our Transit — more than the Real Estate Board of New York, which put in $500,000,” the FT reported.• Uber and its main competitor, Lyft, have been criticized for increasing congestion and undermining public transit. “The companies have zeroed in on congestion pricing as their preferred solution rather than efforts to tax car-booking or limit the number of cars on the road,” the FT notes.• Congestion charges have other benefits for Uber: They will make ride-hailing services more efficient, and may encourage people to use its other transportation services, like bikes and scooters.Executives at the casino company helped hide sexual misconduct allegations against Steve Wynn, according to Massachusetts’s gambling regulator.Senior executives knew about the accusations but didn’t follow company policy, the NYT reports.

The best are exported across the Middle East.But the crop of shows currently in production for Ramadan are being subjected to suffocating controls. Mr. el-Sisi’s officials are dictating scripts and capping wages, directors and actors say. A military-linked production company has taken charge of some of the biggest shows.Filmmakers have been told their stories should follow approved themes, like praising the army and the police, or vilifying the banned Muslim Brotherhood. Those who don’t play by the rules don’t get on the air.“For Sisi, this is not just about politics or power,” said Ezzedine Choukri Fishere, a writer and former diplomat whose novels have been adopted into TV serials. “He wants to re-educate the Egyptian public.”The soap opera clampdown is the cultural edge of a far-reaching and intrusive brand of authoritarianism that has taken root in Egypt under Mr. el-Sisi, reaching new levels even for a country that has been governed by military-backed strongmen for decades.Hosni Mubarak, who governed for 30 years until his ouster in the 2011 Arab Spring, also presided over an oppressive, often cruel system. Even so, he allowed space for other centers of power, like his political party and the senior judiciary, which could result in surprising actions. Now and then, judges issued rulings that discomfited him. Newspapers could criticize him to a point. In 2005, the opposition Muslim Brotherhood won a fifth of the seats in Parliament.That space, limited as it was, has been virtually shut down under Mr. el-Sisi, who came to power in a 2013 military takeover. He governs through a small clique of advisers, mostly drawn from the military, the security services and his family, that enjoys huge economic clout, sees the world through a security prism and has sought to stamp out every breath of dissent. Egyptians can be arrested for politically incorrect Facebook posts.“I would frankly feel safer talking politics in Damascus than in Cairo,” said Yezid Sayigh, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut. Mr. el-Sisi’s personalist autocracy, he continued, “tries to dominate the public space so completely that nobody dares say anything, even in private, that might be deemed dissent by those in power.”“That fear is what all totalitarian systems try to instill: that even when the system cannot eavesdrop on you, it can hear you.”A government spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.Mr. el-Sisi’s approach has met with little resistance from President Trump, who is scheduled to host him at the White House next week. Where Washington once was a modest brake on the excesses of Egypt’s strongmen, Mr. Trump has lavished praise on Mr. el-Sisi in previous encounters — even complimenting his taste in footwear — but has said little about the tightening vise of repression in Egypt.The United States has not had an ambassador in Cairo since July 2017.Mr. el-Sisi’s governing circle is dominated by military men he trusts. The army’s Engineering Authority has been charged with overseeing ambitious projects worth billions of dollars, including an extension of the Suez Canal that was completed in 2015 and a new administrative capital that is under construction in the desert east of Cairo.Military courts operate with little public oversight, prosecuting actors and political opponents as well as terrorism suspects. Mr. el-Sisi’s intelligence agencies quietly manipulate the workings of Parliament, which is currently debating sweeping constitutional changes that would extend Mr. el-Sisi’s term until 2034 and could also bring the senior judiciary directly under his authority, a power Mr. Mubarak never had.Television talk shows, once a ferment of raucous debate, have become so predictably pro-government that many Egyptians are tuning out. The foreign ministry, once a bastion of Egypt’s proud diplomatic tradition, is viewed as a much reduced force.“Sisi is not Kim Jong Un or Saddam Hussein,” said Amy Hawthorne of the Project on Middle East Democracy in Washington. “But he’s inching Egypt toward that kind of regime.”The hand of the security agencies also extends deep into the economy, often blurring the line between national security and commerce.As the ride-sharing company Uber has expanded in Egypt, it has faced government demands to provide access to personal information about its customers. In February, as the security agencies stepped up those demands, the Uber app started to crash in Egypt, said an official with knowledge of talks between Uber and the Egyptian government.But it is in his pursuit of culture and the arts that Mr. el-Sisi has really stood out.Last month the celebrated author Alaa al-Aswany, who wrote The Yacoubian Building, said a secret military court had prosecuted him for “inciting hatred against the regime” — a prosecution all the more striking because Mr. al-Aswany was once an avowed el-Sisi supporter.In January, Amr Waked, an actor who starred in the Hollywood movie “Syriana,” said in a Twitter post that he had been sentenced to eight years in prison for criticizing Mr. el-Sisi. Last week, the Egypt’s Actors Union expelled Mr. Waked, who lives in Europe, and another prominent actor for “high treason” after they attended a congressional briefing in Washington that examined Mr. el-Sisi’s plans to amend the Constitution.Then there are the soaps.Mr. el-Sisi first weighed in on them in 2017 with a speech in which he praised the “positive principles” of older, state-produced TV shows, and criticized recent productions. In the following years, state officials started to press filmmakers through both censorship and quiet pressure.This season, though, the meddling has created an industry crisis, by several accounts.With Ramadan just a month away, the number of mini-series currently under production has been cut in half, to about 12 or 15, one director said.The Egyptian Media Group, a company with links to the General Intelligence Service, has established the dominant TV production company and bought several of the biggest TV networks, according to Mada Masr, one of the last independent news outlets left in Egypt.A senior director, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said scriptwriters were ordered this winter to follow certain guidelines: to glorify the military, to attack the Muslim Brotherhood and to promote conservative family values that encourage young Egyptians to obey their elders — and presumably avoid the kind of questioning that led to the 2011 Arab Spring, the director said.The directive is a sign of another major difference between Mr. el-Sisi and Mr. Mubarak, said Mr. Ezzidine, the analyst, who lives in the United States.While Mr. Mubarak often seemed content to simply manage Egypt’s dysfunction, Mr. Sisi appears intent on reshaping the country’s moral and intellectual fiber. He has lectured citizens on their manners and their physical fitness. Now he wants to purge what he views as dangerous currents of thought.Mr. el-Sisi’s defenders say Egypt needs a strong leader to protect the country from the chaos that has engulfed Libya, Syria and Yemen, and to enact long overdue yet unpopular, harsh economic reforms, like recent cuts to fuel and electricity subsidies. Egypt’s stability has contributed to a 16 percent increase in tourism in the past year, and the energy sector is booming after major gas discoveries in the Mediterranean.Even so, many Egyptians are straining under the combination of austerity and repression. The day after a train barreled into Cairo’s main station in February, killing at least 22 people, a man named Ahmed Mohy walked into the middle of Tahrir Square, scene of the 2011 protests, with a sign that read ”Step down Sisi.”Mr. Mohy, 34, a pharmacist, was outraged by the train crash, which he saw as a sign of mismanagement of basic services. He hoped to attract more protesters. But he was arrested within minutes and bundled into a police van alongside a friend who had filmed his solo protest.In the back of the van, Mr. Mohy recorded an impassioned, sometimes tearful video message that was posted on Facebook. He would probably be tortured for speaking out, he said, but he insisted it had been worth it.“Maybe they will inject us, maybe they will kill us, maybe they will burn us,” said Mr. Mohy, whose Facebook page is filled with his poetry. “But we are facing our destiny as men.”With tens of thousands of opponents already in jail, such acts of public resistance are rare, and Mr. el-Sisi’s authority faces few obvious challenges for now.Mr. el-Sisi’s view is that his strength comes from divine providence.In a 2013 interview, he told a journalist that a voice had come to him in a dream and said, “We will grant you what no one has had before.”But some analysts warn that, in seeking to exert such tight control over the Egyptian state and society, Mr. el-Sisi might be sowing the seeds of his eventual undoing.Presiding over such a top-heavy system that has alienated so many sectors of society could leave Mr. el-Sisi vulnerable on the day his system inevitably faces an unforeseen shock, said Mr. Sayigh, the senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center.“Sisi and the army have painted themselves into a corner by destroying anyone they could talk to,” Mr. Sayigh said. “When the day comes where they need others in government or business, they may have nobody to support them.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Kate CongerSAN FRANCISCO — Lyft’s debut on the stock market is off to a bumpy start.The ride-hailing company went public in a blaze of glory on Friday, as its stock jumped 8.7 percent from its initial public offering price of $72 a share. On Monday, in its second day of trading, Lyft’s stock plunged nearly 12 percent to below $72, closing the day at $69.01.The rapid decline raises questions about investors’ appetite for fast-growing but unprofitable tech companies. While Lyft has been expanding and gaining new revenue, it lost nearly $1 billion last year. Ride-hailing companies often subsidize the cost of rides and pay incentives to drivers, which is expensive. And Lyft is also spending heavily on initiatives including electric bikes and self-driving technology.Other tech companies that went public while recording large losses, such as Snap, Twitter and Groupon, also eventually fell below their offering prices.“Everyone is taken up with the idea of the ride-hailing business; it’s exciting and high-growth,” said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital, which manages an I.P.O.-focused exchange-traded fund that will include Lyft later this week. “But it’s hard to figure out their valuation.”Lyft declined to comment.[Not everyone who invested in Lyft is reaping the spoils.]Lyft’s performance could sway other high-profile tech companies that are planning to go public.Uber, the world’s biggest ride-hailing company, is planning to go public in the next few months; it is also deeply unprofitable. Others stampeding toward the public market include Pinterest, the digital pin board; Slack, the messaging company; and Peloton, the home-fitness company.“The ones following in the wake of Lyft will be priced more reasonably,” Ms. Smith said.Even if Lyft eventually makes money, its margins might be low, she cautioned. Lyft is constantly dealing with new competitors, which means that it may have to continue subsidizing its drivers and cutting the prices that it charges passengers. That makes profits a faraway prospect.The volatility in Lyft’s stock was not unexpected, said Tom White, a senior vice president at the wealth management firm D. A. Davidson. “Nothing has changed on the fundamental outlook for the business in the last few days,” he said.Follow Kate Conger on Twitter: @kateconger.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byChrysler, Ford and General Motors saw a booming Chinese driving culture and cheap labor. Now the market is slowing, competition is rising and the Trump administration wants limits.By Keith Bradsher and Ailin TangCHONGQING, China — For Detroit, China once meant opportunity. The country’s growing ranks of drivers bought cars by the millions. Its cheap labor gave American automakers dreams of someday exporting their Chinese-made cars to the United States. The Big Three bet billions of dollars there.Now China’s place in the world is shifting, and that bet is starting to sour.Chinese consumers are buying fewer cars as the country’s economy slows. Local competitors have raised their game. Many young people would rather use ride-sharing services similar to Uber than own vehicles themselves.And if the Trump administration’s trade hawks have their way, China won’t make many cars for Americans. As Washington and Beijing haggle over a deal to end their trade war, the hawks are defending tariffs, imposed by President Trump last year, that would make it expensive to sell Chinese-made cars — including those with American brands — in the United States.China’s slowdown presents the most immediate problem. Some of Detroit’s Chinese factories have slowed to a crawl. In the inland metropolis of Chongqing, where Ford builds cars like the compact Focus, three big assembly plants have been running at less than one-fifth of capacity. Ford’s joint venture in Chongqing has quietly begun dismissing thousands of its 20,000 workers.Seven Zhou, a 32-year-old worker who assembled transmissions, lost his job last month. His paychecks had already shrunk by two-thirds because he was working fewer hours. He quit smoking to pay for food and rent, and the family is struggling to pay for the after-school English and math lessons his son needs for a chance at college.“I do not have much education,” Mr. Zhou said. “I had hoped my child would not be like me, the bottom level of labor.”As China transforms, many global businesses are struggling to adapt. China’s economy has matured and can no longer match the sky-high growth rates of its go-go years. The Chinese government is trying to cope with all the debt accumulated to pay for that growth. Initiatives that could juice the economy have slowed. The rest of the world has begun to fundamentally rethink its dependence on China to make much of what the world consumes. Some within the Trump administration see China as an existential threat to core American industries like autos, much as it has come to dominate production of solar panels, steel and aluminum. There have long been doubts among automakers and consumers about whether cars made in China could measure up to those produced in America. But with the gap in quality narrowing, companies in China and the United States have begun to explore the possibility.General Motors, which began exporting the Buick Envision from China to the United States in 2016, has been pleading since last summer without success for the Trump administration to exempt it from a 25 percent tariff imposed on Chinese-made cars. Ford announced in the summer of 2017 that it would move Focus production to China from Michigan, only to cancel those plans as the political landscape changed in the United States. Exports from China to the United States of Detroit-brand cars are “a no-fly zone,” said Michael Dunne, the chief executive of ZoZo Go, an automotive consulting firm in San Diego. “It’s just too politically sensitive.”Detroit’s fortunes in China could still improve. A final trade deal could leave the door open to Chinese exports. The Chinese government could take steps to rev up domestic growth or empower its consumers to buy cars. “A stronger economy will lead to stronger auto sales,” said Irene Shen, a General Motors spokeswoman.But for now, Detroit’s Big Three are struggling in China — particularly Ford.Business from Detroit has helped China become both the world’s largest maker and its largest buyer of cars. Much of the global auto parts industry has moved there as well, making it especially convenient to manufacture cars in China. Drawn by the country’s rapid development and consumer revolution, G.M. invested about $10 billion. It now makes and sells more cars through its Chinese joint ventures than it does in the United States. Ford, which came later, invested as much as $5 billion. China’s car-building capacity is now roughly equal to those of North America and Europe combined. More car factories are being built to meet regulators’ demands for more electric cars.But a slowing economy and an end to tax breaks for car buyers have brought the industry back to earth. In January, car sales in China fell 18 percent from a year earlier. The average car factory in China, already operating at a little more than half capacity, has slowed even more amid the sales slump, according to LMC Automotive, a consulting firm.American brands are also being squeezed. The Chinese elite still prefer premium German brands like Mercedes, BMW and Audi. More frugal families buy cheaper Chinese and Japanese cars and are increasingly buying used.The ride-hailing business has dealt automakers an unexpected blow. The global auto industry has worried for years that companies like Uber and Lyft could eat into demand, particularly among young customers. That appears to have happened in China, experts say, where dense urban cities have enhanced the appeal of Didi Chuxing, the Chinese ride-hailing giant. Didi now carries twice as many riders in China each year as Uber carries in the rest of the world combined.“None of the multinational automakers foresaw how disruptive that would be to demand,” said Bill Russo, a former chief executive of Chrysler’s operations in China.Young people in China are also more open to Chinese brands, thanks in part to their improved quality. “They’re a lot more favorably disposed towards Chinese brands, and they have a pride in the Chinese brands,” said Nigel Harris, the president of Ford’s main joint venture in China, Changan Ford.This winter has been difficult for American brands in China. Sales of G.M.’s Chevrolet and Buick models have faltered (though Cadillacs continue to sell well), and Chrysler’s Jeeps face stiff competition from cheaper sport utility vehicles made by Chinese companies. After a dismal autumn, Ford sold 70 percent fewer cars in China in January than it did in the same month a year earlier.The automakers are tweaking their lineups to improve sales. G.M. and Ford are ramping up production of their respective Cadillac and Lincoln brands to tap the luxury market. G.M. has expanded its bargain Chinese brands, Baojun and Wuling. In a potentially risky move for its brand, Ford has put its blue oval logo on an inexpensive S.U.V., the Territory, that is mostly designed and built by a Chinese automaker, Jiangling Motors.It is too early to tell how well Ford’s move will go. But at a Ford dealership in Chongqing, the $16,000 Territory was selling briskly, while a number of Focus cars, priced at $22,000, have sat unsold since 2017. “As soon as one arrives,” Li Pengfei, a salesman, said of the Territory, “someone picks it up.” Nowhere are the problems of Detroit automakers more apparent than in Chongqing, an often foggy city built on steep slopes overlooking the confluence of two broad, muddy rivers, the Yangtze and the Jialing. When a local hiring hall held an automotive-themed day last week, it was mobbed with former Ford employees who had accepted severance payments and were looking for their next jobs. The company has changed from running factories on up to three shifts, almost around the clock, to just a single shift.Mr. Harris declined to discuss layoffs in detail, saying, “Organizational fitness is a critical part of China cost, so we are working night and day to make sure that we are fit.”In Chongqing, some workers do not see the industry ever recovering.Du Wen, a 28-year-old in a green hoodie and jeans who had assembled car doors for Ford’s joint venture partner, Changan, for the past four years, said that he was going to leave the auto industry entirely. So he was applying to work at a factory making instant soup, even though that would mean a sharp pay cut.“Everyone needs to eat,” he said, “even when the economy slows down.”Keith Bradsher is the Shanghai bureau chief.

"It's uber important for us to play for our community and then to see the community give back to us as well - it just creates a really nice energy that we actually end up being in this together and we're all one team."The team will hold a minute's silence before kickoff on Saturday. More than 10,000 tickets have already been sold for the match and Mooar said the team were determined to bring a little joy back for the home fans at such a difficult time."(We can) go out and put on a performance and allow people to take a couple of hours out of the stuff that's been happening and put a smile on faces and just have a time enjoying themselves watching us go about our work," he said."It's been really clear when we've won a trophy over the last couple of years its been a trophy for the people as much as ourselves."Amid debate over the appropriateness of the team's name, given its links to the medieval religious wars between Christians and Muslims, the Crusaders have embarked on a review of their name and branding.The pre-match tradition of horsemen dressed as knights riding around the perimeter of the ground has also been abandoned.On the field, the Crusaders have included All Blacks captain Kieran Read in the starting lineup, something of a surprise given he only lasted to halftime in his comeback last week when he suffered bruising to his right leg in their 32-8 win over the Wellington Hurricanes."Don't know if you've ever had a dead leg, that gets followed up by another dead leg in the same spot?" Mooar asked."It's pretty painful, but he got through the week well."Tighthead prop Owen Franks will also make his 150th Super Rugby appearance after a neck injury kept him out of the last two games.The defending champions lead the standings on 24 points and look on course for a 10th title. (Editing by Peter Rutherford)AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Adam SatarianoLONDON — Apple responded on Friday to antitrust claims made by the music streaming service Spotify, saying its policies are fair and accusing its rival of being motivated by a need to bolster financial results.Spotify filed a complaint with European regulators this week, accusing Apple of using its App Store to undercut companies that compete with its own services, like Apple Music.In a statement published on its website, Apple said that Spotify was not treated any differently from the millions of other developers that use the App Store.Apple accused Spotify of trying to use the advantages of the App Store, which provides access to millions of Apple users, without having to pay fees that Apple says are necessary to keep the marketplace thriving. Apple charges a fee of up to 30 percent for anything sold through the App Store.“Spotify is asking to keep all those benefits while also retaining 100 percent of the revenue,” Apple said. “Spotify wouldn’t be the business they are today without the App Store ecosystem, but now they’re leveraging their scale to avoid contributing to maintaining that ecosystem for the next generation of app entrepreneurs.”The dispute highlights a larger debate about the role of large tech platforms like Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google, and whether their size and power impede competition. Amazon is the subject of a European antitrust investigation related to its treatment of independent sellers on its marketplace. Google was fined by the European Commission last year for antitrust violations stemming from its Android operating system.“When the company that runs a platform also competes with businesses that depend on that platform, we face the risk that it could use its power to drive out competition in not one market but dozens,” Margrethe Vestager, Europe’s antitrust chief, said in a speech this week.Apple said the App Store had created millions of jobs and generated more than $120 billion for developers since its introduction in 2008. It ushered in a new era of mobile computing, allowing companies like Instagram, Uber and others to reach users.Spotify’s app has been downloaded more than 300 million times, according to Apple.“The App Store is a safe, secure platform where users can have faith in the apps they discover and the transactions they make,” Apple said. “And developers, from first-time engineers to larger companies, can rest assured that everyone is playing by the same set of rules.”AdvertisementAdvertisement

Andrew M. Cuomo and lawmakers agreed upon early Sunday morning.New York will become the first American city to charge such fees, though congestion pricing has been in place for years in London, Stockholm and Singapore, among other communities. The fees are expected to raise billions of dollars to fix the city’s troubled subway system and thin out streets that have become strangled by traffic.The new fees will be imposed on vehicles that enter Manhattan below 60th Street.Congestion fees are not expected to start until 2021, and no actual fee amounts have been decided. A plan proposed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo would establish a panel of experts who would set the fees. The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, which is part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, would collect the fees.Samuel I. Schwartz, a traffic expert known as Gridlock Sam, says drivers will probably pay $12 to $14 for cars and around $25 for trucks entering the city during peak business (and traffic) hours, and less at night and on weekends. Mr. Schwartz was on a state task force on congestion pricing that last year recommended fees of $11.52 for cars and $25.34 for trucks.His estimates are based on state leaders’ goal to raise $1 billion annually from congestion fees, which would then be used to secure bonds totaling $15 billion for repairs and improvements to public transit.Drivers who already use tolled tunnels or the Henry Hudson Bridge from the Bronx to Manhattan would receive a credit toward the congestion fees. Drivers crossing the Brooklyn Bridge and headed directly north on the F.D.R. Drive past 60th Street would not be charged.State legislators are considering several possible exemptions for drivers who are low income, have disabilities or are going to medical appointments. Assemblyman David I. Weprin, a Democrat from Queens and a leading opponent of congestion pricing, has called for an exemption for all city residents, which seems unlikely.Though details are being worked out, fees are expected to apply to people driving into the congestion zone from elsewhere in the city, including parts of Manhattan north of 60th Street and other boroughs, as well as beyond.Drivers who live in the congestion zone would not pay when they drive within the zone or when they leave the zone, but they will when they return from elsewhere.Of course, that could change if an exemption or discount is granted to residents of the congestion zone. For instance, London offers a 90 percent discount for registered residents of its congestion zone.But more exemptions could mean higher tolls for everyone else.After all, the fees are supposed to generate $1 billion a year. “Every exemption you provide is less revenue coming into the system,” said Kate Slevin, a senior vice president for the Regional Plan Association, a research and advocacy group that supports congestion pricing.Alex Matthiessen, the head of a grass-roots campaign to support congestion pricing, said too many exemptions could hollow out the plan, making it ineffective. “Now we must guard against a race to the bottom as legislators seek carve-outs and exemptions for every class of driver.”Instead, he suggested taking other measures, such as offering discounts on commuter railroads for city residents and subsidizing ride-app services like Uber for those with disabilities, to ensure more people benefit from congestion pricing.The new fees will be charged through an electronic tolling system, most likely expanding upon existing E-ZPass technology used for cashless tolling at the city’s bridges and tunnels.Drivers entering the designated congestion zone would be automatically charged fees through E-ZPass tags in their cars. If they did not have a tag, a camera would snap a picture of the license plate to bill the driver later.“All the technology is proven; it’s used in New York today,” said Bruce Schaller, a former city transportation official who directed the development of a plan to bring congestion pricing to the city more than a decade ago under the mayor at the time, Michael R. Bloomberg. “It will work the same way as we had planned.”One of the biggest challenges, Mr. Schaller said, will be finding places to mount all the E-ZPass readers and cameras so that they are not “visually intrusive.” Gantries might have to be installed over wide avenues. Interstate agreements might also be needed so the city could track down drivers with out-of-state license plates.London, Stockholm and Singapore have been held up as international models for congestion pricing. In each city, the fees were greeted with skepticism and anger from many commuters and civic and business leaders. But the fees later proved effective in reducing traffic, congestion and air pollution.Within a year of the fees being charged in 2003, the number of vehicles entering an eight-square-mile area of London dropped by 18 percent, according to city officials. Traffic delays went down 30 percent. The average speed of vehicles in the zone rose to 10 miles per hour from 8.8 m.p.h.Air quality improved, too, with a 12 percent reduction in emissions of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter from vehicles in the zone.In all three cities, the fees have also raised millions for transportation and infrastructure, including for new buses, bikes lanes and other public transit services to accommodate drivers who leave their cars at home.But, still, many drivers have complained, especially as the fees have gone up over time — more than doubling in London from when the fees were first instituted.And one important reminder is that even with congestion pricing, traffic problems do not simply go away. London’s gridlock has returned in recent years, in part because of an influx of Uber and other ride-app cars.Subway riders stand to see more reliable service and fewer headaches with hefty new investment in the transit system. Those riding commuter trains and buses outside Manhattan should also benefit from extra spending.Fewer cars will also mean cleaner air, more room for cyclists and less fraught crossings for pedestrians.Even drivers could get something out of it, with Mr. Schwartz pointing out that they will no longer be trapped in as much traffic.“It will cost them the toll charge,” he said. “But it will save them the cost of gas and time.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Erin GriffithSAN FRANCISCO — Pinterest is preparing for its debut on Wall Street with a claim that few other “unicorn” start-ups can make: It is not a financial sinkhole.While the company is unprofitable, according to an offering prospectus made public on Friday, its losses are nowhere near as high as those of other well-known start-ups like Uber and Lyft, which are also getting ready to list their shares. That makes Pinterest — which lets people create digital “pin boards” — one of the rarer unicorns, a term applied to start-ups valued at more than $1 billion by private market investors.The deep losses afflicting many high-profile start-ups have cast investor doubts on the herd of companies that are stampeding toward the public market. Lyft recently revealed that it lost $911.3 million last year. Uber previously disclosed that it lost $842 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 alone. PagerDuty, a software start-up valued at $1.3 billion that also filed to go public this week, said in its prospectus that it was losing money. Only Zoom, a video conferencing company last valued at $1 billion, showed that it was making money, in an offering prospectus it filed on Friday.Pinterest’s filing reported that the company had lost $63 million in 2018. But that was much narrower than a year earlier, when it lost $138 million.At the same time, Pinterest is growing quickly. The company’s revenue, which came from advertising, totaled $756 million last year, up 60 percent from a year earlier. It listed a cash stockpile of $628 million.Pinterest also said in the filing that it had 265 million monthly active users in the fourth quarter of 2018, compared with 216 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Its number of users has grown steadily over the last two years, particularly as people outside the United States have begun to gravitate to its service.In its prospectus, Pinterest called itself “a productivity tool for planning your dreams.” The San Francisco company emphasized the visual, image-driven nature of its product, as well as its ability to capture people’s intent to buy things related to their pins. It said its mission was to “bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they love.”The document provides the first detailed look at Pinterest’s balance sheet. The company confidentially filed to go public in February, with Goldman Sachs, J. P. Morgan and Allen & Company underwriting the offering. It plans to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol PINS.The filing did not say how much money Pinterest hopes to raise in the offering and did not specify potential share prices. Private market investors, who have poured around $1.5 billion into the company, last valued it at $12 billion. Its largest shareholders include Bessemer Venture Partners, FirstMark Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity Investments and Valiant Capital Management, according to the filing.In a move that has become common among tech firms, Pinterest plans to divide its stock into two classes, giving its founders, top executives, employees and directors 20 votes per share. New investors will get one vote per share.Because Pinterest makes money from online advertising, it is a competitor to Facebook, Instagram, Amazon, Google, Twitter and Snap. In its prospectus, Pinterest listed those companies as competitors, as well as Allrecipes, a recipe website; Houzz, a home-improvement website; and Tastemade, a cooking content company.Some rivals are not increasing their revenue as quickly as Pinterest, said Kathleen Smith, a principal at Renaissance Capital, a manager of exchange-traded funds for I.P.O.s.“Like Snap, Pinterest is in the cross hairs of Facebook, and Facebook has always fought a nasty battle against Snap by copying everything it did,” she said, adding that anyone evaluating Pinterest’s stock should consider that competitive threat.Pinterest was started in Silicon Valley by Ben Silbermann, the company’s chief executive; Evan Sharp; and Paul Sciarra. Mr. Silbermann, 36, previously worked at Google. Pinterest grew out of Cold Brew Labs, a tech incubator founded by the three men in 2008.Although many unicorns made rapid growth their top priority, Mr. Silbermann favored what he calls “quality growth.” That meant he tried to build Pinterest slowly and steadily, even as its growth started to soar in 2011. “Pinners,” as users are known, essentially used Pinterest to create collagelike mood boards that expressed their aspirations.Today, pinners pin activities such as what they wear or what they are making for dinner, as well as ideas for remodeling a home or their wedding, or passions like bookmarking and other craft projects.Mr. Silbermann also deliberately took several years before turning Pinterest into a moneymaking enterprise. In 2014, the company began selling ads. For a spell, its growth appeared to be slowing and it lost executives, until Mr. Silbermann brought in a new chief operating officer, Francoise Brougher, and a new head of sales, Jon Kaplan, both formerly of Google.Unlike many of its social media peers, Pinterest has mostly avoided the proliferation of conspiracy theory and extremist content on its platform, moving quickly to tamp down on such content when it has bubbled up. In February, Pinterest began removing search results for anything related to vaccines in an attempt to stop anti-vaccination memes from spreading across the site.In contrast to many hard-charging and brash tech chief executives, Mr. Silbermann has kept a low profile. He rarely sat for glossy magazine covers or showed up at tech industry conferences. At one point, Pinterest was called an “anti-unicorn” because of how it shied from the spotlight. The timing of the unveiling of its prospectus — late on a Friday afternoon — was also in keeping with Mr. Silbermann’s style.Despite Mr. Silbermann’s low profile, the I.P.O. is expected to generate lots of attention from investors and market observers. “Significant revenue growth and popularity among users is going to be a pretty good recipe for — at a minimum — creating significant buzz around an IPO,” said Barrett Daniels, a partner at Deloitte who focuses on I.P.O. advisory work.Mr. Silbermann also avoided another trapping of tech founders with the prospectus: He did not publish a founder’s letter on Friday to carry on about his company’s mission and history, something that had become de rigueur among other entrepreneurs.Follow Erin Griffith on Twitter: @eringriffith.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byThe automakers need each other, but they also need a bold leader to secure their future.By Amie TsangRenault, Nissan and Mitsubishi, on their own, aren’t among the top handful of the world’s auto manufacturers. Together, in a unique alliance, however, they outmatch the sales of giant automakers like Volkswagen.But the happy confederation has been threatened since its leader, Carlos Ghosn, was arrested on suspicion of financial wrongdoing. He’s no longer in power, and sits in a Tokyo jail cell. Mr. Ghosn personified the alliance, drawing together disparate auto cultures by the force of his personality. Can it survive without him? A leadership vacuum has opened since Mr. Ghosn’s arrest. Without their longtime leader, Renault and Nissan have blamed each other for trying to tip the balance of power. The French government, which holds a 15 percent stake in Renault, has weighed in with concerns that Nissan is maneuvering to prevent Renault from participating in the alliance’s decision-making. Mr. Ghosn and Greg Kelly, an aide who was also arrested, occupied seats on the Nissan board. But Nissan had declined a request to hold an immediate shareholder meeting, meaning the French carmaker cannot replace its representatives there. (On Thursday, Nissan said a meeting would be held in April.) The grouping gives the three companies scale, allowing them to operate as one large group with sales that dwarf those of other carmakers. The alliance sold 10.6 million cars in 2017, compared with the 10.1 million sold by Volkswagen and under nine million vehicles by Toyota. Renault and Nissan teamed up in 1999 to share purchasing and design expertise. They acted as one entity with Mr. Ghosn at the helm, but did not formally merge. Mitsubishi joined in 2016, and the alliance has worked with the German carmaker Daimler on projects like the Mercedes-Benz pickup truck and the production of compact cars. Renault owns a 43 percent stake in Nissan, while Nissan has a 15 percent share in Renault without voting rights. Renault exercised more power than the other carmakers in the alliance, but Nissan sold more cars. The situation stirred resentment on the Nissan side. The Japanese carmaker saw Renault as unfairly piggybacking on Nissan’s technology, research and brand. Renault, for its part, accused Mr. Ghosn of favoring the Japanese and Nissan, and blocking the French manufacturer’s expansion into China, the world’s largest car market, to help Nissan. Mr. Ghosn was trying to push Renault and Nissan to cooperate further, proposing to save $5.7 billion with more coordinated design and manufacturing. His plan involved having all vehicles produced by the automakers be based on four combinations of chassis, engines and transmissions.The Nissan-Renault alliance was seen as innovative early on. But now the auto industry is facing technological disruption. Companies are realizing that joining forces with rivals may be the only way to compete and cut costs in developing electric and autonomous cars. Ford and Volkswagen announced an alliance this month to speed the development of electric and self-driving cars. Until recently, Fiat Chrysler (itself the result of a merger of carmakers that dates to 2014) has been upfront about its desire to merge with another big carmaker. It has been working with BMW since 2017 to develop self-driving cars. Daimler and BMW have merged their car-sharing businesses to compete with the efforts of companies like Uber and Alphabet, Google’s parent company. And a number of car companies have working with technology companies, such as Volvo, which provided the chassis for driverless car tests by Uber. Nissan quickly dumped him as head of its board. Renault had been waiting for Mr. Ghosn to be released on bail — but court decisions have kept him jailed in Japan, and the French carmaker has decided to move on.Jean-Dominique Senard, the chief executive of the French tire maker Michelin and a veteran businessman, was named chairman of Renault. Thierry Bolloré, Renault’s chief operating officer, was named chief executive.Renault said it planned to supervise the “functioning of the alliance,” but it is unclear whether anyone can fill Mr. Ghosn’s role as its head. The partnership is considered essential to the success of these automakers. Industry experts believe the carmakers are in desperate need of a strong leader. The companies in the partnership are facing falling demand in the world’s biggest markets — China, the United States and Europe — and rising challenges with the emergence of electric cars. And they are grappling with the effect of a trade war on their supply chains.Ollivier Lemal, the managing director in France for EIM, a management consulting firm, said the group needed “someone who is going to devote all his time and energy to restore dialogue between the manufacturers.” ​Amie Tsang is a general assignment business reporter based in London, where she has covered a variety of topics, including the gender pay gap, aviation and the London Fatberg.  @amietsang AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBreakingviewsBy Antony CurrieGet the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines — and the power-brokers who shape them.__________Elon Musk might just talk himself into a discounted Tesla buyout.The electric-car maker’s chief executive is in a battle with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission — not for the first time — over a tweet. At worst, the S.E.C. could force him out of his role at the company.But what then? Tesla’s stock would tumble, putting the company in play — potentially allowing Mr. Musk to revive the buyout idea that first got him into trouble.Mr. Musk has until March 11 to explain to U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan why a social-media post, in which he wrongly suggested Tesla would make 500,000 cars this year, wasn’t a breach of an earlier promise to have his tweets vetted by the company’s lawyers. If she rules against him, the S.E.C. may impose a heavy fine. But at worst, it could force him out.Two things could then happen:• First, the stock would almost certainly tumble. How much is anyone’s guess, but since Mr. Musk is closely associated with the brand, let’s assume Tesla’s value halves to $26 billion.• Second, the company might become a takeover target. At a discounted price it would be enticing for carmakers like Toyota or Daimler and for the likes of Apple, Waymo and even Lyft or Uber. Or maybe even Mr. Musk himself.Being ejected from Tesla would leave Mr. Musk free to revive his plan from last summer to take the company private. The infamous tweet in which he said he was “considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured” is what prompted the S.E.C. to accuse him of fraud. And it led to the October court-approved agreement that the regulator on Monday accused him of violating.He has a number of advantages over rival potential bidders, not least his 20 percent ownership stake. The board may be amenable: It’s still packed with his friends, business partners and family. Meanwhile, if his putative backers really were prepared to help buy Tesla at $72 billion — the valuation implied by his tweet — they certainly should be at $26 billion.Mr. Musk might even feel inclined to send the S.E.C. a thank-you note.

It involves industry disruption and crisis management, with my own soulless twist.This is high-tech stuff, so let me define a few technical terms.First, by unicorns, I’m talking about fantastic beasts: privately held companies worth at least a billion dollars. (Insert your joke here about who can catch a unicorn.) Unicorns like Lyft are sold to investors in  initial public offerings of stock (also known as I.P.O.s), enabling insiders to make a ton of money. The precise terminology for these lucky people is “obscenely rich.”As always, I’ve been wondering: How can I become even naughtily rich? The trick is to find a business I can bootstrap to billions.Disrupting established industries seems to be the way to go: Even children know that Lyft and Uber have disrupted taxi service and Airbnb has disrupted hotels.Now it’s my turn to make a fortune. The crisis management business seems to be ripe for disruption.Crises are everywhere, especially in the business world. A company called Theranos failed so spectacularly that it has generated a best-selling book, an HBO documentary and a big podcast. Theranos claimed to have revolutionized blood tests. It has been a disaster, like the Fyre festival, but with pricked fingers.Then there’s Boeing, not to mention a number of current presidential campaigns. You get the idea.Crisis managers are already in great demand, but I intend to do something different: I’ll create crises, then solve them, leading to a staggeringly successful unicorn I.P.O.Lyft just had its I.P.O. and may soon be followed by some of the biggest names in tech, including Uber, Airbnb and Slack, the annoyingly ubiquitous program for sharing messages in the workplace.Exciting, right? Hope you like roller coasters: Lyft’s shares dropped below their offering price by their second day of trading, which means the stock price could use a … well, you know.The point with an I.P.O. is to be an insider, not a chump who gets fleeced by the insiders. Lyft’s founders, employees and early backers are getting quite a payday. Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital firm, comes away with about $900 million in instant profit. Carl C. Icahn apparently made about $550 million, according to The Wall Street Journal, by selling his stake to George Soros.That’s the life for me: mogul. I’ve been driving the same car for 10 years. It’s time to move up to something that extravagantly shows how much I love the planet. Not a mere Tesla, but the Jaguar electric E-Type Zero, which costs about $400,000.That kind of ride requires I.P.O. money. So, fellow insider, here’s my plan.I formulated it with invaluable help from Eric Dezenhall. He runs Dezenhall Resources, which, among other things, does crisis management. In an email, I told him that my life is an unmanaged crisis, so I need advice if I am to build a future in his field.His response was promising: “You do realize that the whole discipline is a farce, don’t you?” That convinced me that crisis management would be a good fit.He added: “All you need is a sport jacket and a cliché (such as ‘Get ahead of the story,’ a great-sounding phrase that has no meaning.)”This was getting better and better. As a veteran journalist, clichés are my métier. And, as it happens, I own a sport jacket. There are some moth holes, but I’ve gotten pretty good at using a felt-tip pen to match the jacket color with the lining. Mr. Dezenhall was impressed by my inventive use of the felt-tip pen. That, in itself, “is crisis management,” he said.But he cautioned that crisis management is no longer a matter of simply altering perceptions so that a bad situation looks like something good. “What people think we’re going to say is, ‘We didn’t dump PCBs in the river, we’re shampooing the fish!’ and people will say, ‘Ooh, that’s good,’” he said. But, no. That’s old thinking, he said. His trade has evolved.Instead of just changing perceptions, he said, the great crisis managers provide “operational solutions” that address root causes. That way, he said, a company can transcend the fickle and uncontrollable emotions that dominate the 24-hour news cycles and waves of Twitter outrage.So he would not, for example, advise the chief executive of Boeing to go on a televised apology tour for  two recent crashes and the loss of hundreds of lives. (And, in fact, the company’s public response has been notably muted.) These days, he said, such gestures are instantly deemed inadequate. Instead, he said, it’s better to help companies actually fix their problems, which will do more to vindicate them than any snappy patter.That sounded hard.“What you’re saying,” I said, “sounds like it takes actual management ability.” I was beginning to despair. And that’s when the thunderbolt hit me: I could work the other side of the market. Crisis creation!I’d ferret out dire problems and make them much worse. Corporate executives already do that routinely, of course; I mean, just look at the series of apologies from Mark Zuckerberg over … well, almost everything. But hotshot executives have been calling those problems “mistakes.” I’d call them “my strategy.”Mr. Dezenhall ran with the idea: He said I could get paid by short sellers, or work directly with him to concoct scandals that expose companies to reputational crises, which he — and I — would be paid handsomely to relieve. Most of the time, we’d do nothing but wait for the situation to resolve itself and celebrate our success.Ideally, he said, we would cause problems that look like random events and that don’t besmirch the character of the company. He pointed to a spate of syringes found in Pepsi cans in the ’90s. (The Pepsi problem, which I covered a lifetime ago, earning mere workingman’s wages, turned out to be a hoax, with a splash of copycat effect.)Our corporate slogan would be this: Plant a problem, find the problem, claim to fix the problem. All in a profitable day’s work.“The future is in crisis creation!” he said. “I am happy to secretly finance this, and we’ll work together, and hopefully we’ll be on the Forbes 400 list in a few years.”It sounded exciting. It sounded like big money. Also, it sounded like he was joking. Unfortunately, he was. He turned out to be one of those people burdened with a sense of ethics and even a conscience.I need another partner.It could be you! This is a can’t-miss opportunity: We’ll capture a unicorn, throw it into crisis, and reap unfathomable rewards.It will definitely happen, though for now, I’ll keep my day job: describing crises without capitalizing on them.If I save my pennies, who knows? I might be able to get a new sport coat.John Schwartz is a New York Times reporter and author of “This Is the Year I Put My Financial Life in Order.” Follow him on Twitter: @jswatzAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byGood Tuesday morning. (Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up here.)The catastrophic fire at Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris yesterday badly damaged the 850-year-old building, but some of France’s richest moguls are stepping up to pay for repairs.Around 500 firefighters battled the blaze for nearly five hours, Adam Nossiter and Aurelian Breeden of the NYT write. By 11 p.m. Paris time, the structure had been “saved and preserved as a whole,” the city’s fire chief, Jean-Claude Gallet, said. But two-thirds of the roof was destroyed and the main spire collapsed. So far, it’s unclear both how the fire started and how much survives of the interior, but nobody was killed or injured, officials said.“We will rebuild Notre-Dame,” President Emmanuel Macron said last night. “Because that is what the French expect.”So far 300 million euros, or $339 million, have been pledged for rebuilding, Bloomberg reports:• François-Henri Pinault, the C.E.O. of the luxury goods conglomerate Kering, and his father, François Pinault, will donate €100 million from their investment company, Artemis.• The Arnault family, which runs the rival luxury goods conglomerate LVMH, responded with a pledge of €200 million, plus its architectural and design resources.If you want to donate, Fast Company explains three ways.More: An algorithmic error by YouTube served up information about the Sept. 11 attacks alongside live video of the fire.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York, and Michael J. de la Merced and Jamie Condliffe in London.____________________________Two House committees demanded documents about President Trump’s finances from Deutsche Bank, his longtime lender, yesterday.It’s the latest effort to gain insight into Mr. Trump’s financial records, as the president resists demands for access to his tax returns and other documents.Lawmakers also subpoenaed records from JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup related to potential money-laundering in Russia and Eastern Europe, the NYT reports.“The potential use of the U.S. financial system for illicit purposes is a very serious concern,” Representative Maxine Waters, the chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, said in a statement.Deutsche Bank says it’s cooperating. “We remain committed to providing appropriate information to all authorized investigations in a manner consistent with our legal obligations,” a spokeswoman for the firm said.But the Trump Organization condemned the moves. Eric Trump, one of Mr. Trump’s sons, called the subpoenas “an unprecedented abuse of power.” A lawyer for the company said it was considering options for preventing Deutsche Bank from complying.More: Two Pulitzer Prizes were awarded yesterday to reports investigating Mr. Trump’s finances. The NYT won for its investigation into how the Trump family avoided paying a half-billion dollars in taxes, while the WSJ was recognized for revealing hush-money payments made to two women who claimed to have had affairs with Mr. Trump.This year promises to be one of the biggest for public offerings in recent memory. And that’s created a scheduling problem, Erin Griffith and Michael de la Merced of the NYT report.If all the big tech I.P.O. candidates went to market, they could issue over $100 billion in new stock, according to Renaissance Capital. At the peak of the dot-com era, in 2000, the figure was $96 billion.I.P.O.s are already running into each other. Pinterest wanted to go public before Good Friday — and wound up scheduling its offering on Thursday, the day also chosen by the video conferencing company Zoom. Uber ensured that there were at least 30 days between Lyft’s prospectus filing and its own.“I do think there’s going to be some potential indigestion,” Kathleen Smith of Renaissance Capital told the NYT. Barrett Daniels of Deloitte added, “There could end up being I.P.O. fatigue because it is going to be overwhelming.”Uber is a special concern. Its offering is expected to to be the biggest in years, raising $10 billion — which bankers working on rival offerings fear will suck the air out of the markets that week. They’re giving it a wide berth.Perfect timing could be important, because some bankers worry that a single bad debut could taint the batch. Lyft’s shares popped straight after their I.P.O., but two weeks later they’re down 22 percent. We’ll see if that is destined to hurt other unicorns when Pinterest goes public this week.France and Belgium refused to support a new round of trade negotiations between the European Union and the U.S. yesterday, suggesting a bumpy road ahead for those discussions.It’s a striking break in European unity. Trade measures normally pass unanimously. The European Commission had initially proposed a new round of trade talks in January.French and Belgian officials cited climate change, and specifically the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, as an objection.But the talks are expected to proceed anyway, with a focus on eliminating tariffs for industrial goods, excluding agricultural products, and making it easier for U.S. and E.U. companies to meet the other side’s technical requirements.Expect agriculture to be a point of contention. Congress and Mr. Trump both say it has to be addressed; but Cecilia Malmstrom, the E.U.’s chief negotiator, has called it “a red line for Europe.”U.S. companies are disclosing the pay ratio between bosses and median workers in proxy filings for the first full year since the S.E.C. demanded the metric. The FT and Equilar, a compensation consultancy, dug into the numbers, looking at the 100 largest companies by revenue that had published 2018 data by April 1, the midpoint of the annual reporting calendar. Three notable findings:• “Of the 100 CEOs, 11 made more than 1,000 times as much as their median employee.”• “Elon Musk was paid 40,668 times more than the median Tesla worker,” though that company was not part of Equilar’s analysis.• “Warren Buffett earned less than seven times as much as the median Berkshire Hathaway employee.”Skepticism remains about the usefulness of the metric. It might cause a day or two’s bad publicity, critics say, but it will have much less effect on companies’ compensation decisions than their financial results.German prosecutors filed aggravated fraud charges yesterday against Martin Winterkorn, who was Volkswagen’s C.E.O. when it deceived regulators about emissions levels, Christopher Schuetze of the NYT writes.• “The charges are the first criminal indictment in Germany against an individual in connection with the diesel scandal.”• The indictment “includes charges of breach of trust, tax evasion and false certification, either directly or by aiding in such crimes. If convicted, Mr. Winterkorn could be sentenced to up to 10 years in prison.”• “In charging Mr. Winterkorn and four Volkswagen managers whose names were not released, the public prosecutor’s office in Braunschweig tied the five to events reaching as far back as 2006.”• “The timeline is significant because it rejects initial claims by Volkswagen that senior management became aware of the so-called defeat devices used to cheat emissions tests only after being confronted by the United States environmental authorities in 2015.”• “Even after paying $33 billion in fines and settlements related to the scandal, the carmaker continues to face legal challenges and investigations from authorities in the United States and Germany.”Best Buy named Corie Barry, its chief financial officer, as its next C.E.O. The current C.E.O., Hubert Joly, will become executive chairman.The P.R. firm Prosek Partners plans to announce this morning that it has hired David Wells, who most recently led marketing and communications for Goldman Sachs’s consumer and investment management division, as a partner.Daniel Daniel, a former senior investor at BlackRock, has left to start Twenty Acre Global, an investment firm that will take stakes in tech companies.BlackRock has reportedly moved to hire Tang Xiaodong, most recently a senior executive at GF Securities, to oversee its mainland China operations.Deals• AT&T sold its 9.5 percent stake in Hulu back to the streaming service at a $15 billion valuation.

To do that, Mr. Wunderman said, the group needed to better understand what was at stake.The report found:• Roughly 28,200 people were homeless across the Bay Area, according to point-in-time counts in 2017. That was the third largest population in the country, after New York (76,500) and Los Angeles (55,200). The next largest overall number was 11,600 in Seattle and King County.• But the Bay Area has a relatively large percentage of homeless people without shelter (indicating there’s a shortage of subsidized housing, short-term shelters and transitional housing). That was 67 percent. That’s compared with just 5 percent in New York and 47 percent in Seattle and King County. Once again, though, Los Angeles had the largest percentage of unsheltered homeless people: 75 percent.• The analysis found that spending on services for people experiencing homelessness or people who were at risk varied widely across the region. Part of that stems from the fact that the costs to build vary widely.For instance, the report said, building new permanently supportive housing costs $730,560 on average per unit in San Francisco County, compared with $393,580 per unit on average in Solano County.However, Mr. Wunderman said that particular finding shouldn’t be taken as a sign that services, housing and emergency shelter should be concentrated in the least expensive parts of the Bay.“We’re going to continue to need to develop programs locally,” he said. “I think this is a burden that has to be shouldered by everyone.”Mr. Wunderman suggested one way to persuade communities to do their part: Tie state money to initiatives.[Here’s what Californians said about our state’s housing affordability.](We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

Reuters reported the funding target earlier on Monday."We basically received a very strong vote of confidence. And Masa shared that SoftBank is very happy with Grab and that SoftBank will provide unlimited support to power our growth," Tan said, referring to SoftBank founder and CEO Masayoshi Son."SoftBank continues to believe that Grab deserves its unwavering support," a SoftBank spokeswoman said. Funding, to be raised from strategic investors, including SoftBank, will be a mix of debt and equity, Tan said.Grab's ongoing massive financing round started soon after it bought the Southeast Asian operations of U.S. peer Uber in March last year.The Singapore-headquartered firm, like its regional rival Go-Jek, has been raising billions of dollars to bring ride-hailing, food delivery, e-commerce and banking to a populous region with a growing number of consumers that use smartphones to commute, shop and make payments.Both companies started out in ride-hailing and have since amassed millions of users with cut-rate prices. Backers for Go-Jek include Temasek Holdings, Tencent and Alphabet Inc's Google.Grab counts Toyota, Microsoft, China's Didi Chuxing and Hyundai among its backers. People with direct knowledge of the matter said Grab has raised about $8 billion since its launch almost seven years ago.Last month Grab's president Ming Maa, a former SoftBank executive, said the ride-hailing company was considering raising more funds in its ongoing financing round, in which the SoftBank Vision Fund has invested $1.5 billion.Tan said: "With the amount of funding we have raised, and the support from strategic investors like SoftBank, we are so well-funded to execute on our expansion and investment plans, so there is really no need to IPO." Grab wants to make at least six investments or acquisitions this year and plans to add 1,000 tech staff globally, Tan said.In Singapore, it will double staff to 3,000 when its $134 million headquarters is complete by the end of 2020.SoftBank's support will help Grab to "grow very aggressively this year across our verticals - transport, mobility, food and payments", Tan told Reuters in an interview.

Want this by email? Sign up here.The next generation of computer and phone networks, known as 5G, is expected to connect cities around the world and fuel a future run on robots, autonomous vehicles, artificial intelligence and other technologies.But it may also rely on an infrastructure vulnerable to hackers and spies, one that the U.S. wants to stop China from building.The Trump administration has conducted a campaign to pressure allies such as Britain, Poland and Germany to banish Chinese companies, especially the telecommunications giant Huawei, from participating in the 5G buildup, according to the NYT:The administration contends that the world is engaged in a new arms race — one that involves technology, rather than conventional weaponry, but poses just as much danger to America’s national security. In an age when the most powerful weapons, short of nuclear arms, are cyber-controlled, whichever country dominates 5G will gain an economic, intelligence and military edge for much of this century.What’s next? President Trump is expected to issue an executive order prohibiting American companies from incorporating equipment originating from China in critical telecommunications networks, extending current rules that apply only to government entities. His administration, which has also waged a trade war with China, says that it is motivated by concern for national security, not just by competitive defensiveness. China’s economic czar, Liu He, will meet with the American trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, in Washington on Wednesday for two days of trade talks, which is likely to cover issues of cyberprotection and the proliferation of state-owned companies.What do officials think? Beijing’s ambassador to the E.U. threatened “serious consequences” if Huawei and other Chinese companies were excluded from 5G projects. In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau fired the country’s ambassador to China after he said that a senior Huawei executive had “strong arguments” to fight extradition to the U.S.And businesses? Tech manufacturers are diversifying outside China as trade tensions fester and the country’s economy slows. Foxconn and Pegatron, two Taiwanese companies that assemble iPhones, are expanding production capacity in India and Vietnam. American industrial companies with exposure to China have said that their sales there are weakening. But Apple is unlikely to bring production closer to the U.S., where manufacturers struggle to “match China’s combination of scale, skills, infrastructure and cost,” according to the NYT.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________The law firm Paul, Weiss is more diverse at its top ranks than most of its peers. But after the announcement of its new partner class, people across the industry began to comment that all of the faces were white, and that only one was a woman’s, the NYT’s Noam Scheiber and John Eligon write.Paul, Weiss has said that it regretted the “gender and racial imbalance” of its 2019 class. But the episode underscores how big law firms are still falling short when it comes to elevating women and people of color.Mr. Scheiber and Mr. Eligon interviewed more than 20 women and people of color who described obstacles to achieving diversity at Paul, Weiss. Many said that opportunities to be groomed for partner were harder to come by for women and minorities.“I fear that African-American partners in big law are becoming an endangered species,” said Theodore Wells, a black partner at Paul, Weiss and one of the country’s most prominent litigators.The former chief executive of Starbucks told Andrew yesterday that he was preparing to run for president in 2020 as an independent.Denouncing the “broken political system,” Mr. Schultz said he had already begun the groundwork to get on the ballot in all 50 states.Long-shot bid: Despite his considerable wealth, Mr. Schultz would face a difficult road. Few independent candidates have mounted significant challenges for the White House.Political jabs: In an interview with “60 Minutes,” Mr. Schultz said Donald Trump was “not qualified to be the president” and that lawmakers from both parties were engaged in “revenge politics.”Swift response: The announcement was condemned by top Democratic operatives, who said they were worried that Mr. Schultz would split votes in a general election.Logan Green, the chief executive of Lyft, is known to be reserved, usually letting his second-in-command speak for their ride-sharing service. But now, he’s in a race with Uber to take the companies public, write the NYT’s Mike Isaac and Kate Conger.That means Mr. Green may have to give up some up his reserve and step into a more public role.The back story: Both Lyft and Uber have filed regulatory papers to list their shares on the stock market in the coming months. The offerings are likely to create a bonanza in Silicon Valley.Why it matters: Lyft, which was last privately valued at $15.1 billion, is tiny compared with its rival and could be overshadowed if Uber debuts first. Uber could go public at a $120 billion valuation.Stocks sank at the end of last year on fears of an imminent recession, but those concerns have largely abated, with global markets now rallying at the fastest pace in months. But investors are still cautious ahead of a busy week.The next few days bring an onslaught of quarterly earnings reports from the likes of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Tesla — many of which are considered to be representative of the broader economy. The Federal Reserve is also holding policy meetings this week, which come after central banks in Europe and Japan sounded cautious notes. And on Friday, the monthly U.S. jobs report will be released.The world economy “is not in crisis,” writes Neil Irwin. But, he adds:What the last few months have made clear is that the forces that have held back the global economy for the last 11 years are not temporary, and have not gone away. And that, in turn, makes the world uncommonly vulnerable to a bout of bad luck or bad policy.The work force is still aging. Productivity growth remains weak, as is consumer demand. Low interest rates could constrain central bankers trying to engineer an escape from a downturn. And a “nasty feedback loop” could result in more political dysfunction, leading to risks of economic disruption like the type posed by the recent government shutdown.Speaking of which: After a 35-day stalemate, the government is open again, much to the chagrin of some of President Trump’s conservative supporters. The 116th Congress will consider Democratic wage proposals in the house and a Middle East policy bill in the Senate. Lawmakers may also consider whether to ban future shutdowns entirely.

They scribbled notes at long tables, sipping coffee and LaCroix while a stack of pizza boxes emanated the odor of hot garlic. One by one, they gave testimonials taking aim at something nearly sacred in the technology industry: venture capital.Josh Haas, the co-founder of Bubble, a software-writing start-up, told the group that he and venture capitalists “were pretty much totally on different wavelengths” about the trajectory of his business.Seph Skerritt, the founder of Proper Cloth, a clothing company, said that the hype around raising money was a trap. “They try to make you feel inferior if you’re not playing that game,” he said.The event had been organized by Frank Denbow, 33, a fixture of New York’s tech scene and the founder of T-shirt start-up Inka.io, to bring together start-up founders who have begun to question the investment framework that has supercharged their field. By encouraging companies to expand too quickly, Mr. Denbow said, venture capital can make them “accelerate straight into the ground.”The V.C. business model, on which much of the modern tech industry was built, is simple: Start-ups raise piles of money from investors, and then use the cash to grow aggressively — faster than the competition, faster than regulators, faster than most normal businesses would consider sane. Larger and larger rounds of funding follow.The end goal is to sell or go public, producing astonishing returns for early investors. The setup has spawned household names like Facebook, Google and Uber, as well as hundreds of other so-called unicorn companies valued at more than $1 billion.But for every unicorn, there are countless other start-ups that grew too fast, burned through investors’ money and died — possibly unnecessarily. Start-up business plans are designed for the rosiest possible outcome, and the money intensifies both successes and failures. Social media is littered with tales of companies that withered under the pressure of hypergrowth, were crushed by so-called “toxic V.C.s” or were forced to raise too much venture capital — something known as the “foie gras effect.”Now a counter movement, led by entrepreneurs who are jaded by the traditional playbook, is rejecting that model. While still a small part of the start-up community, these founders have become more vocal in the last year as they connect venture capitalists’ insatiable appetite for growth to the tech industry’s myriad crises.Would Facebook’s leadership have ignored warning signs of Russian election meddling or allowed its platform to incite racial violence if it hadn’t, in its early days, prized moving fast and breaking things? Would Uber have engaged in dubious regulatory and legal strategies if it hadn’t prioritized expansion over all else? Would the tech industry be struggling with gender and race discrimination if the investors funding it were a little less homogeneous?“The tool of venture capital is so specific to a tiny, tiny fraction of companies. We can’t let ourselves be fooled into thinking that’s the story of the future of American entrepreneurship,” said Mara Zepeda, a 38-year-old entrepreneur who in 2017 helped start an advocacy organization called Zebras Unite. Its members include start-up founders, investors and foundations focused on encouraging a more ethical industry with greater gender and racial diversity. The group now has 40 chapters and 1,200 members around the world.“The more we believe that myth, the more we overlook tremendous opportunities,” Ms. Zepeda said in an interview.Some of the groups are rejecting venture capital because they’ve been excluded from the traditional V.C. networks. Aniyia Williams, who started the nonprofit Black & Brown Founders, said a venture-funded system that encourages many failures for every one success is particularly unfair to black, latinx and women founders who “are rarely afforded the opportunity to fail, period.” Members of these organizations, she added, see more value when whole groups in their communities thrive, rather than venture’s winner-take-all model.Other founders have decided the expectations that come with accepting venture capital aren’t worth it. Venture investing is a high-stakes game in which companies are typically either wild successes or near total failures.“Big problems have occurred when you have founders who have unwillingly or unknowingly signed on for an outcome they didn’t know they were signing on for,” said Josh Kopelman, a venture investor at First Round Capital, an early backer of Uber, Warby Parker and Ring.He said he was happy that companies were embracing alternatives to venture capital. “I sell jet fuel,” he said, “and some people don’t want to build a jet.”Right now, that jet fuel seems unlimited. Venture capital investments into United States-based companies ballooned to $99.5 billion in 2018, the highest level since 2000, according to CB Insights, a data provider. And the investments have expanded beyond software and hardware into anything that is tech-adjacent — dog walking, health care, coffee shops, farming, electric toothbrushes.But people like Sandra Oh Lin, the chief executive of KiwiCo, a seller of children’s activity kits, say that more money isn’t necessary. Ms. Oh Lin raised a little over $10 million in venture funding between 2012 and 2014, but she is now rebuffing offers of more just as her company has hit on a product people want — the very moment when investors would love to pour more gas on the fire. KiwiCo is profitable and had nearly $100 million in sales in 2018, a 65 percent increase over the prior year, Ms. Oh Lin said.“We are aggressive about growth, but we are not a company that chases growth at all costs,” Ms. Oh Lin said. “We want to build a company that lasts.”Entrepreneurs are even finding ways to undo money they took from venture capital funds. Wistia, a video software company, used debt to buy out its investors last summer, declaring a desire to pursue sustainable, profitable growth. Buffer, a social media-focused software company, used its profits to do the same in August. Afterward, Joel Gascoigne, its co-founder and chief executive, received more than 100 emails from other founders who were inspired — or jealous.“The V.C. path forces you into this binary outcome of acquisition or I.P.O., or pretty much bust,” Mr. Gascoigne said. “People are starting to question that.”Venture capital wasn’t always the default way to grow a company. But in the last decade, its gospel of technological disruption has infiltrated every corner of the business world. Old-line companies from Campbell Soup to General Electric started venture operations and accelerator programs to foster innovation. Sprint and UBS hired WeWork to make their offices more start-up-like.At the same time, start-up culture — hoodies and all — entered the mainstream on the back of celebrity investors like Ashton Kutcher, TV shows like “Shark Tank” and movies like “The Social Network.” Few questioned the Silicon Valley model for creating the next Google, Facebook or Uber.Those who tried to buck the conventional method experienced harsh trade-offs. Bank loans are typically small, and banks are reluctant to lend money to software companies, which have no hard assets to use as collateral. Founders who eschew venture capital often wind up leaning on their life savings or credit cards.Jessica Rovello and Kenny Rosenblatt, the entrepreneurs behind Arkadium, a gaming start-up founded in 2001, initially avoided raising venture money. It took four years before the business earned enough to pay them a salary. The sacrifices were “very real and very intense,” Ms. Rovello said. Nevertheless, the business grew steadily and profitably to 150 employees.By 2013, though, as investors poured capital into some rivals, the lure of easy money became too tempting to pass up, and the company raised $5 million. Tensions ensued as Arkadium’s investors expected the company to continue raising money with the goal of selling or going public. Ms. Rovello wanted to keep running the company profitably, growing revenue at 20 percent per year and developing a new product that could take years to pay off.In September, Arkadium used its profits to buy out the investors, allowing the company to remain independent and grow on its own terms. Ms. Rovello said she had no regrets about stepping off the venture-funded path.“If your end game is having a business that you love and continuing to thrive and making careers for people,” she said, “then I’m winning.”In September, Tyler Tringas, a 33-year-old entrepreneur based in Rio, announced plans to offer a different kind of start-up financing, in the form of equity investments that companies can repay as a percent of their profits. Mr. Tringas said his firm, Earnest Capital, will have $6 million to invest in 10 to 12 companies per year.Hundreds of emails have poured in since the announcement, Mr. Tringas said in an interview. “They’re almost entirely from people who assumed there was no form of capital that matched any version of their expectations,” he said.Earnest Capital joins a growing list of firms, including Lighter Capital, Purpose Ventures, TinySeed, Village Capital, Sheeo, XXcelerate Fund and Indie.vc, that offer founders different ways to obtain money. Many use variations of revenue- or profit-based loans. Those loans, though, are often available only to companies that already have a product to sell and an incoming cash stream.Other companies are inspired by the investor buyouts executed by Buffer, Wistia and Arkadium, and are asking investors to agree to similar deals — at potentially lower returns on their investments — in the future.Indie.vc, based in Salt Lake City and part of the investment firm O’Reilly AlphaTech Ventures, offers start-ups the option to buy back the firm’s shares as a portion of their total sales. That caps the firm’s return at three times its investment. In the typical venture capital model, the earnings for a home-run deal are limitless.When Indie.vc started three years ago, it saw two or three applications a week, mostly from venture capital rejects. Now it gets as many as 10 applications a week, mostly from companies that could raise venture capital but don’t want to, said Bryce Roberts, the firm’s founder.“We think there is going to be a tsunami of entrepreneurs who have experienced the one-size-fits-all venture model and want to cherry-pick the pieces of it that work for them,” Mr. Roberts said.Some venture capitalists have applauded the shift; their style of high-risk investing is not right for many companies. In a recent blog post, Founder Collective, a firm that has invested in Uber and BuzzFeed, praised Mr. Roberts’s offerings while warning founders of the dangers of traditional funding. “Venture capital isn’t bad, but it is dangerous,” the post reads. The firm created ominous warning labels and brochures to send to its companies.Privately, some venture capitalists have bemoaned the way they’re locked into rigid investment mandates with perverse incentives. “We heard from many investors who said, ‘I can’t say this publicly, but I’m in the machine and I know it’s broken, and I know there is a better way,’” Ms. Zepeda said.Others have dismissed the trend, according to Mr. Roberts. “It’s amazing how thin-skinned and threatened V.C.s tend to be around people who question their model,” he said.Even if venture capitalists ignore the companies rejecting their model, some of their investors — endowments, pension funds and mutual funds — are exploring ways to participate. The tech industry’s year of bad headlines has inspired some soul-searching.“I think we should, as investors, take seriously our role in driving some of these destabilizing forces in society,” said Rukaiyah Adams, chief investment officer at Meyer Memorial Trust, an investor in venture capital funds and nonprofits. “As one of the controllers of capital, I’m raising my hand and saying, ‘Wait a minute, let’s really think about this.’”Still, the new growth models represent a tiny percentage of the broader start-up funding market. And venture capitalists continue to aggressively pitch their wares — even to companies that aren’t interested.Notion, a collaboration software company based in San Francisco, has just nine employees and close to one million users, many of whom pay $8 a month. The company is handily profitable. Aside from a small seed round in 2013, it has avoided outside funding.Venture capitalists, desperate to get a piece of the company, have dug up Notion’s office address and sent its founders cookie dough, dog treats and physical letters, company executives said. Every few months, a new investor inevitably shows up unannounced at Notion’s gate.Notion’s ambitions are big — the company wants to replace Microsoft Office. But its executives don’t believe they need hundreds of millions of dollars in financing to do it, nor do they want the strings that come attached.“We’re not anti-V.C.,” said Akshay Kothari, the company’s chief operating officer. “We’re just thinking for ourselves, rather than for them or other peers.”An earlier version of a picture caption with this article misstated the order in which members of Zebras Unite appeared.

Gina Scigliano, a Google spokeswoman, confirmed the changes.In November, the company agreed to scrap forced arbitration in individual cases of sexual harassment or assault after 20,000 Google workers staged a walkout demanding changes to how it treats employees. The walkout was prompted by a New York Times article that revealed Google had given a senior executive, Andy Rubin, a $90 million exit package even after it found he had been credibly accused of sexual harassment.The employee organizers behind the walkout demanded that Google also stop forcing employees into arbitration for other types of disputes. Google said it had decided to make the blanket change after comparing its policies with those of other companies. Employees who prefer to arbitrate privately will still have that option.“This victory never would have happened if workers hadn’t banded together, supported one another and walked out,” Google Walkout for Real Change, the organizer behind last year’s employee walkout, wrote on Twitter. “Collective action works. Worker power works. This is still just the beginning.”Google had 98,771 employees globally at the end of December.For years, Google’s employment contracts have included a clause requiring staff to hash out grievances behind closed doors instead of suing the company in the public court system.Arbitration is a common practice among technology companies to resolve disputes outside the courts. It has been especially controversial in cases of sexual harassment because it tends to limit victims from speaking out about their experience.But under growing pressure from employees, companies are eliminating forced arbitration. Over the last year, Uber, Lyft and Facebook have done away with the policy totally or in part.Google said the policy change would not apply to former employees with unresolved disputes, although current Google workers with open disputes will not be forced into arbitration.The company said it would also do away with the practice for temporary staff, contract workers and vendors it hires — although it would not force third-party staffing companies that supply the vast majority of contractor staff used by the company to adhere to the policy.Follow Daisuke Wakabayashi on Twitter: @daiwaka.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Winnie Hu[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]Driving in Manhattan may never be the same again.It will soon cost more — well over $10 — to drive into the busiest neighborhoods, from 60th Street in Midtown all the way to the Battery.The fees are part of a groundbreaking congestion pricing plan in the new $175 billion New York State budget, which Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and lawmakers agreed upon early Sunday morning.New York will become the first American city to charge such fees, though congestion pricing has been in place for years in London, Stockholm and Singapore, among other communities. The fees are expected to raise billions of dollars to fix the city’s troubled subway system and thin out streets that have become strangled by traffic.The new fees will be imposed on vehicles that enter Manhattan below 60th Street.Congestion fees are not expected to start until 2021, and no actual fee amounts have been decided. A plan proposed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo would establish a panel of experts who would set the fees. The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, which is part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, would collect the fees.Samuel I. Schwartz, a traffic expert known as Gridlock Sam, says drivers will probably pay $12 to $14 for cars and around $25 for trucks entering the city during peak business (and traffic) hours, and less at night and on weekends. Mr. Schwartz was on a state task force on congestion pricing that last year recommended fees of $11.52 for cars and $25.34 for trucks.His estimates are based on state leaders’ goal to raise $1 billion annually from congestion fees, which would then be used to secure bonds totaling $15 billion for repairs and improvements to public transit.Drivers who already use tolled tunnels or the Henry Hudson Bridge from the Bronx to Manhattan would receive a credit toward the congestion fees. Drivers crossing the Brooklyn Bridge and headed directly north on the F.D.R. Drive past 60th Street would not be charged.State legislators are considering several possible exemptions for drivers who are low income, have disabilities or are going to medical appointments. Assemblyman David I. Weprin, a Democrat from Queens and a leading opponent of congestion pricing, has called for an exemption for all city residents, which seems unlikely.Though details are being worked out, fees are expected to apply to people driving into the congestion zone from elsewhere in the city, including parts of Manhattan north of 60th Street and other boroughs, as well as beyond.Drivers who live in the congestion zone would not pay when they drive within the zone or when they leave the zone, but they will when they return from elsewhere.Of course, that could change if an exemption or discount is granted to residents of the congestion zone. For instance, London offers a 90 percent discount for registered residents of its congestion zone.But more exemptions could mean higher tolls for everyone else.After all, the fees are supposed to generate $1 billion a year. “Every exemption you provide is less revenue coming into the system,” said Kate Slevin, a senior vice president for the Regional Plan Association, a research and advocacy group that supports congestion pricing.Alex Matthiessen, the head of a grass-roots campaign to support congestion pricing, said too many exemptions could hollow out the plan, making it ineffective. “Now we must guard against a race to the bottom as legislators seek carve-outs and exemptions for every class of driver.”Instead, he suggested taking other measures, such as offering discounts on commuter railroads for city residents and subsidizing ride-app services like Uber for those with disabilities, to ensure more people benefit from congestion pricing.The new fees will be charged through an electronic tolling system, most likely expanding upon existing E-ZPass technology used for cashless tolling at the city’s bridges and tunnels.Drivers entering the designated congestion zone would be automatically charged fees through E-ZPass tags in their cars. If they did not have a tag, a camera would snap a picture of the license plate to bill the driver later.“All the technology is proven; it’s used in New York today,” said Bruce Schaller, a former city transportation official who directed the development of a plan to bring congestion pricing to the city more than a decade ago under the mayor at the time, Michael R. Bloomberg. “It will work the same way as we had planned.”One of the biggest challenges, Mr. Schaller said, will be finding places to mount all the E-ZPass readers and cameras so that they are not “visually intrusive.” Gantries might have to be installed over wide avenues. Interstate agreements might also be needed so the city could track down drivers with out-of-state license plates.London, Stockholm and Singapore have been held up as international models for congestion pricing. In each city, the fees were greeted with skepticism and anger from many commuters and civic and business leaders. But the fees later proved effective in reducing traffic, congestion and air pollution.Within a year of the fees being charged in 2003, the number of vehicles entering an eight-square-mile area of London dropped by 18 percent, according to city officials. Traffic delays went down 30 percent. The average speed of vehicles in the zone rose to 10 miles per hour from 8.8 m.p.h.Air quality improved, too, with a 12 percent reduction in emissions of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter from vehicles in the zone.In all three cities, the fees have also raised millions for transportation and infrastructure, including for new buses, bikes lanes and other public transit services to accommodate drivers who leave their cars at home.But, still, many drivers have complained, especially as the fees have gone up over time — more than doubling in London from when the fees were first instituted.And one important reminder is that even with congestion pricing, traffic problems do not simply go away. London’s gridlock has returned in recent years, in part because of an influx of Uber and other ride-app cars.Subway riders stand to see more reliable service and fewer headaches with hefty new investment in the transit system. Those riding commuter trains and buses outside Manhattan should also benefit from extra spending.Fewer cars will also mean cleaner air, more room for cyclists and less fraught crossings for pedestrians.Even drivers could get something out of it, with Mr. Schwartz pointing out that they will no longer be trapped in as much traffic.“It will cost them the toll charge,” he said. “But it will save them the cost of gas and time.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayBy Jill CowanGood morning.(Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.)In yesterday’s newsletter, we explored why Montebello, a solidly middle class suburb of Los Angeles, was an unexpected target for Gov. Gavin Newsom’s ire over unaffordable housing.Today, my colleague Nellie Bowles takes us to a city where the housing landscape has been the target of way more outrage — and it’s about to get worse. We’re talking about San Francisco. I’ll let her explain why:Booms usually follow busts. But not in San Francisco today.A new fleet of huge start-ups — among them Uber, Airbnb, Lyft, Slack and Pinterest — is preparing to go public, and the employees who have patiently waited for their stock options to turn to cash will finally have their day.The trouble is: The city still hasn’t quite caught its breath from the last boom, which saw clashes between protesters and tech buses. There’s still not enough housing, still jarring inequality on the streets. And now thousands of the newly cash rich are going to be looking to put their stake in the city. Familiar issues are boiling up again.So I spent a few days talking to local business owners, financial managers, real estate agents, housing activists, tech workers, ice sculptors and bike shops about what they’re expecting from the I.P.O.-palooza this year.One note: A fair number have read it and told me, “Oh this is why San Francisco is over.” I would push back on that. When I was reporting this story, and as news came that even more of Silicon Valley’s engines are moving north, the realization I kept having is that San Francisco’s financial and cultural power is only beginning.So what do you think?

If anything, MedMen, on Santa Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood, Calif., looks just like an Apple Store. It’s decked out with blond wood tables on which a range of products are artfully displayed — the Puffco Peak portable vaporizer, an electronic Dosist vape pen, the latest issue of Ember magazine and, of course, so much weed delivered in an astonishing variety of ways, from tinctures to gummy bears to cookies to just plain joints. A crowd of customers is attended to by cheerful staff members decked out in jaunty red hoodies and carrying iPads. “Let’s be buds” urges a sign on one table.It certainly looks like it’s going great at this chain of weed dispensaries. But — like a lot of businesses around the newly commercialized marijuana industry in California — MedMen is struggling. The latest quarter of this publicly traded company showed a net loss of $66 million on revenues of $21.5 million. It had lost $79 million the previous quarter.Not enough weed supply and too much expansion are among the reasons given for MedMen’s problems, but the disconnect between the company’s promise and reality made me think hard about some other terrible news this week: Apple’s announcement that it was going to miss its projected revenue by billions of dollars this quarter.[Kara Swisher answered your questions about this column on Twitter.]Apple has hung the moon for investors for so long now that the idea of the company struggling sent the entire global stock market into a paroxysm of fear and plunging indexes. It is, to use an old California trope, going to be a real bummer for Silicon Valley.Now stick with me here, because what’s happening across what are considered fast-forward industries like cannabis and tech is worrisome. Where is the next great boom of innovation going to come from, when even the strongest brands and products might not be sure things anymore?Apple is not only a bellwether company in tech but also the most expertly managed one under Tim Cook. He, of course, was preceded as chief executive by Steve Jobs, who had brought the company back from the brink of bankruptcy in 1997. Since then, it has been all uphill, to the point this summer when Apple reached a $1 trillion valuation — the first publicly traded American company to reach that high — with a price of $207.39 a share.Today it’s trading at $142.64, and analysts are predicting it will settle around $135. Yipes. Part of the problem is the meltdown of the economy in China, where Apple products are popular, and the Trump administration’s trade war. But as Ina Fried of Axios noted: “The problems Apple saw in China go far beyond just Apple. But Apple’s iPhone problems extend far beyond China, too.”Indeed. The last big innovation explosion — the proliferation of the smartphone — is clearly ending. There is no question that Apple was the center of that, with its app-centric, photo-forward and feature-laden phone that gave everyone the first platform for what was to create so many products and so much wealth. It was the debut of the iPhone in 2007 that spurred what some in tech call a “Cambrian explosion,” a reference to the era when the first complex animals appeared. There would be no Uber and Lyft without the iPhone (and later the Android version), no Tinder, no Spotify. Now all of tech is seeking the next major platform and area of growth. Will it be virtual and augmented reality, or perhaps self-driving cars? Artificial intelligence, robotics, cryptocurrency or digital health? We are stumbling in the dark.Apple has dabbled in a lot of these areas, but it still makes its money by selling mobile phones and the accessories around them. And while I love my AirPods and lose them weekly, my forking over $159 to Apple for my sloppiness is not going to help compared with buying a cool new phone.That business has surely leveled off, as no one upgrades quite as quickly as they did before, because of everything from the price tag and being worried about a recession to the simple fact that the new phones don’t offer that much more than the old ones. There is no question that Mr. Cook and his team have done a tremendous job taking advantage and managing this last cycle of innovation, but it’s apparent that it’s now winding down.This is a big issue not only for Apple but also for all of tech. There is not a major trend that you can grab onto right now that will carry everyone forward. The last cool set of companies — Uber, Airbnb, Pinterest and, yes, Tinder — were created many years ago, and I cannot think of another group that is even close to as promising.Well, rental scooters. O.K., they’re cool, but they are a derivative of the car rental business and are not going to make the big jumps in innovation that need to occur now. How innovation happens is a much more delicate thing than people imagine, a dance involving money, opportunity, timing, execution and, most important, one great idea behind it all.Where is that next spark that will light us all up?Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram, and sign up for the Opinion Today newsletter.

The acquisition values HotelTonight in the vicinity of its last private valuation, $465 million, said two people who were briefed on the deal and were not authorized to disclose the price. That would make it Airbnb’s biggest acquisition.In a statement, Brian Chesky, Airbnb’s chief executive, emphasized the company’s desire to expand into all aspects of travel. “A big part of building an end-to-end travel platform is serving every guest, whether they plan their trip a year or a day in advance,” he said.Airbnb, which is valued by private investors at $31 billion, is preparing to go public, though it has not specified a time frame. Ahead of that, it has expanded beyond home stays to appeal to a broader range of travelers. The company now lists boutique hotels, luxury hotels, activities and a hotel-like service called Airbnb Plus. In February, Airbnb hired Fred Reid, former chief executive of Virgin America, to strike more partnerships in the transportation industry.The San Francisco company is part of a coterie of highly valued start-ups, often called “unicorns.” Many of these unicorns are now moving toward the public markets, including the ride-hailing firms Uber and Lyft. Last week, Lyft unveiled its public offering prospectus, which showed that the company was growing quickly but was also losing money. Airbnb has turned a profit, excluding certain costs, for the past two years, the company said in January.Founded in 2010, HotelTonight has raised $127 million in venture funding, according to Crunchbase. It began as an app that listed discounted rooms to last-minute travelers. But the company put a priority on growth over profits in its first five years of operation, burning as much as $30 million a year, according to a blog post by Sam Shank, HotelTonight’s chief executive and co-founder. In 2015, HotelTonight laid off 37 employees, or 20 percent of its staff.In 2017, HotelTonight expanded the time frame in which customers can book hotels to 100 days, putting it in direct competition with the likes of Expedia and Booking Holdings, the $80 billion travel behemoth that owns Priceline and Booking.com.Airbnb is also locked in competition with Booking Holdings. The two companies have taken turns announcing ever-larger numbers of home listings in the last year; Airbnb currently touts six million. Buying HotelTonight gives Airbnb access to even more properties. Airbnb said HotelTonight would continue to operate as a stand-alone business.Because of an editing error, an earlier version of this article misstated the name of an airline that Fred Reid led as chief executive. It is Virgin America, not Virgin American.Follow Erin Griffith on Twitter: @eringriffith.Advertisementlike a bossThe fitness start-up’s vice president of programming, who hydrates three different ways by 8 a.m., is essential to the company’s $4 billion valuation.CreditCreditLandon Nordeman for The New York TimesSupported byAs told to Natalie KitroeffRobin Arzón is a fitness instructor, but that label undersells her star power. She works at Peloton, a New York start-up that sells $2,245 bikes and $4,295 treadmills and streams live exercise classes to their internet-connected screens. Peloton prefers to call instructors like Ms. Arzón “talent” — because they are. From personal experience struggling through her classes, I can attest that Ms. Arzón is more like a cult leader than a coach; having weighed the options, I would rather die from cycling too fast than disappoint her. The company, which has sold 450,000 pieces of exercise equipment and may go public this year, last raised capital at a valuation of $4 billion. Some inestimable chunk of that is tied to Ms. Arzón.Part of her draw is a slate of catchphrases. “What’s six intervals” — of horrifically fast pedaling up the equivalent of a mountain — “to a queen?” she yells during class. “That little bit of panic that sets in,” she chirps, “that just means you care!” Her Instagram following tops 200,000, and the company says each of her workout sessions is taken 15,000 times.When Ms. Arzón, 37, whose official title is vice president of fitness programming, is not teaching or vigorously hydrating, she is also an Adidas brand ambassador and an author. Her book, a New York Times best seller, is “Shut Up and Run.” This month, I spent a week trying to keep up with her via text message.6:05 a.m. Make and guzzle H2O cocktail: room-temperature filtered water, dash of sea salt, quarter lemon, splash of apple cider vinegar. I don’t drink coffee, ever. I immediately feel replenished and energized. 6:30 a.m. Twenty-minute Vedic meditation. The second bedroom in my apartment is a Zen den with a plant wall, a small desk, books and cushions for meditation. 7 a.m. Cup of Onnit King Tea (Kenyan purple blend). I drink three or four cups of tea a day, ranging from matcha to herbal varieties. I spend the next 90 minutes on emails, reviewing my schedule, and get the most important messages out of the way. I really try to “eat the frog” with my most difficult task during this time so I can feel freer later in the day.I’m also multitasking by researching new music to play in class. I have over 1,000 Spotify playlists saved, organized by themes such as beat, mood, genre, running, spinning, lifting. 8 a.m. My husband and I have a 17-ingredient smoothie for breakfast. He created this monster smoothie, which is a staple of my day. Ingredients: vegan protein powder, magnesium, Athletic Greens, aloe vera, chlorophyll, glutamine, B.C.A.A.s, fresh kale/spinach, matcha powder, baobab, maca, nut butter, cacao nibs, chia seeds, moringa, water, ice. I have no idea how many calories are in this, and I don’t care. 8:50 a.m. Pick my looks. Between multiple workouts and being in front of the camera a few times during the day, I often have to style and pack two to five looks a day. Today I pack three outfits, including body wipes and on-the-go products to efficiently change in between meetings and workouts. 9 a.m. Pack all the snacks and all the food. I’m vegan, and I consume a lot of food to get me through the day. Today I’m bringing almonds, a Vega bar, an Athletic Greens packet (which I throw into a water bottle), Nuun tablets and a banana. I’ll probably eat all of that before lunch.9:30 a.m. Do my own workout at a private training facility. I dedicate five to seven hours a week to strength, conditioning and running on my own. Nothing keeps you raw like picking up heavy things.10:27 a.m. Lungs are burning so badly from my workout, it feels like I ingested fire. Quick shower and outfit change: I’m the master of being ready in under seven minutes. My hair is currently in braids, which marries style and efficiency.10:42 a.m. Uber to Tread studio listening to “Nice for What,” by Drake.11 a.m. Weekly senior staff meeting with Peloton’s chief content officer. I am snacking and hydrating. I drink more than a gallon of water a day.1:40 p.m. Uber home while listening to music and making my playlist for my ’90s Pop Run tonight.2 p.m. Continue researching music, making playlist for tonight, writing detailed class notes and creating the class plan. Each class playlist and class plan takes up to two hours of preparation. Peloton instructors are part D.J., part coach, part training partner. The class notes detail the workout, the songs, the exact timing of every part of the workout from warm-up to cool-down. There’s an art to it, just like a composer at an orchestra.5 p.m. Check my blood sugar. I’m a Type 1 diabetic, so I’ve been checking it once an hour all day. I also adjust my insulin depending on how I’m moving and what I’m consuming throughout the day.5:30 p.m. Showtime: 45 minutes of ’90s jams fuel the run on the Peloton Tread. After class, take photos with Peloton members and answer some of the 300 comments on my Facebook and Instagram posts today.7 p.m. Quick second shower, and then eat all the food. I’m hangry by this point. I cook most of my meals, but tonight it’s a veggie tofu curry with brown rice that’s left over from Sunday dinner.8 p.m. Watch “The Bachelor,” unapologetically. The physical energy expenditure from coaching while working out is obvious, but the psychic drain is very real. I need something at this point that demands absolutely nothing. 10 p.m. Bed. I’m in bed by this time every night, even on the weekend. Maybe 10 minutes of reading before I pass out. I just started “Brave, Not Perfect,” by Reshma Saujani. We are both former lawyers, and I love a good reinvention story.7 a.m. Wake up. I aim for nine hours a night religiously, and it’s the reason I have no social life.8 a.m. Do my own workout. Don’t bother showering because I’m running again in an hour and a half. I just use a baby wipe and keep it moving.10:30 a.m. Record Pop Fun Run and a marathon race prep class for 90 minutes.Noon My hair stylist, Tiffanie, is meeting me now to do my braids. I get my hair done once or twice a week.12:20 p.m. Review offers for branded sponsorships that came in to my agent, William Morris Entertainment. “Robinnyc” (my Instagram and Twitter name) is a brand within itself, so I’m always aware of that.3 p.m. Physical therapy session. I get P.T. or acupuncture every week. I really train, fuel and recover like a high-level athlete.5:30 p.m. Peloton cycling class for 45 minutes. My ride tonight was bought out by PwC.6:55 p.m. Stuck in traffic with a chatty Uber driver. I need to eat right now before I jump out of this vehicle. There’s no desire for small talk after performing in front of people all day. I’m an introvert by nature, actually. I once heard Amy Schumer describe her “outgoing persona” vs. an “introverted energy system” on “Oprah” and thought, “Aah, that’s me.”It’s an interesting job, to work out in front of a camera. There’s no room for an off day when you’re the source of energy, instruction and entertainment.6:47 a.m. Pack for a Denver speaking engagement with the Integer Group, a marketing agency.8 a.m. Work out. Pro athletes don’t only work out during a game. I train like a pro to be able to teach. It requires being able to host a show, coach and work out.12:30 p.m. Two-hour meeting with all treadmill instructors. We are workshopping ways to keep content fresh. We discuss everything from social media activations, music themes, combo movements, loading variations, tempo and proprioception.4:30 p.m. Teach two cycling classes for a total of 40 minutes. Powerful energy in those riders.7:16 p.m. Board a plane to Denver. I love flying. I almost never do work on flights and consider it a mini-vacation to read and listen to podcasts. I listen to Joe Rogan, Tim Ferris, “Modern Love,” “Stuff You Should Know,” Oprah and “GaryVee.”6 a.m. Gym for an hour. My days “off” are Thursday and Sunday, but I always have shoots and speaking engagements on Thursdays because they won’t disrupt my teaching schedule.7:50 a.m. Avocado toast for breakfast. Half my carry-on is food (salad, noodles, trail mix, bars). If I’m in a pinch and there’s nothing healthy, I eat oatmeal, which most hotels have. I also travel with Greens powder, a great nutrient boost. I refuse to eat like crap or I will have no energy.10 a.m. Give my speech.11:08 a.m. Off to the airport while working on social media for Adidas’s “She Breaks Barriers” campaign.12:30 p.m. In the airport, I am stopped by five different Peloton members. I love those interactions. People are so excited, and it’s palpable to feel the impact we have being in their homes. One time, someone took a photo of my shopping cart at Whole Foods, and that was odd, but it’s been mostly positive encounters. Even dogs and babies know and respond to our voices.4:25 p.m. On the plane, reviewing the weekly report that distills all of our workout data. Similar to a TV network, we look at the numbers and see what’s trending: What do our members want more or less of, exhibited by workouts taken daily/monthly/yearly.5:31 p.m. Just found out Shonda Rhimes is following me on Instagram. I very much love her work (ethic), so that’s a nice surprise.8:47 p.m. Back home in Manhattan. Soup, salad and bed. I’m totally drained!7 a.m. Make a full breakfast of tofu scramble and avocado toast while I look over instructor audition videos. It’s a small bull’s-eye that we are looking for. Peloton instructors need to be fitness experts but also be able to essentially host a live TV show while working out. It’s definitely not an open casting call, and never will be.1:30 p.m. Teach a women’s history cycling ride. People flew in from Kansas, Hawaii and Alaska to take it in person. One woman told me the bike saved her marriage because she and her partner now have a common hobby.4:30 p.m. Meet with my producer. Every instructor has a producer to watch, review and plan his or her content, marketing and social media for Peloton.7:30 p.m. Make jackfruit taco bowls for dinner. Friday night ritual is a movie with husband. Tonight it’s “Free Solo.” I’m a sucker for athletic feats — shocker.Interviews are condensed and edited.An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a television producer and writer. She is Shonda Rhimes, not Rimes.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Bruce FrettsIn Hollywood, the circle of life has its own meaning. As evidenced by this week’s most interesting trailers, studios keep returning to properties that worked in the past. Here’s the new crop, ranked from most to least derivative.The second promotional clip for Disney’s remake doesn’t answer the questions raised by the initial teaser in November, like: If it’s computer-animated, what sets it apart from the original cartoon? Is it a musical? (It is, although oddly only a snippet of “The Lion Sleeps Tonight” can be heard at the trailer’s end.) And what do Donald Glover and Beyoncé Knowles-Carter sound like as Simba and Nala? Sorry, but we’re not quite feeling the love for this one yet.Technically, this thriller from Luc Besson is a piece of original intellectual property, but it appears eerily reminiscent of the director’s “La Femme Nikita” (1990) and “Léon: The Professional” (1994), which also both followed young women trained to be assassins. (In this case, the title role is played by Sasha Luss, a model raised in Moscow.) It also looks a lot like “Hanna” — the 2011 film directed by Joe Wright that Amazon recently turned into a series — not to mention the Jennifer Lawrence movie “Red Sparrow” and the Jennifer Garner TV drama “Alias.” In the trailer, Anna is compared to a Russian doll, and this similarly seems like a copy of a copy of a … you get the point.“Every family is different, but some families are more different than others,” the narrator notes in the first trailer for the animated film inspired by Charles Addams’s New Yorker cartoons. Scored with the ’60s sitcom version’s finger-snapping theme, the spot doesn’t promise a fresh take on the material, aside from a sly inside joke as Morticia (Charlize Theron) observes of a red balloon, “Strange, there’s usually a murderous clown attached to the end of these.” Finn Wolfhard, the “Stranger Things” actor who also appeared in the clown shocker “It,” voices son Pugsley, and the ensemble also includes Oscar Isaac (father Gomez), Chloë Grace Moretz (daughter Wednesday) and Nick Kroll (Uncle Fester).As in “The Big Sick,” Kumail Nanjiani plays an Uber driver, but that’s the only parallel between his Oscar-nominated 2017 rom-com and this pedal-to-the-metal action comedy. Nanjiani’s hence-the-title character, Stu, picks up a Los Angeles cop (“Guardians of the Galaxy” behemoth Dave Bautista) and finds himself in hot pursuit of a murderer. The odd-couple setup feels a bit hackneyed, but if the film’s gags are as clever as the trailer’s tagline, “Prepare for the Rideshare of Your Life,” “Stuber” could earn a five-star rating.Director-co-star Amy Poehler casts a bevy of fellow “Saturday Night Live” veterans (Maya Rudolph, Rachel Dratch, Ana Gasteyer and Tina Fey as well as writers Paula Pell and Emily Spivey) in this boozy comedy about a group of women who travel to the Napa Valley for a 50th-birthday party. With its mix of physical shtick and raunchy one-liners (“I did Molly in college, but she went back to her boyfriend”), the rollicking trailer for “Wine Country” suggests a middle-aged “Bridesmaids.” And that’s a trip we’ll happily take.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported bySUNDAY VARIETY COLUMNSam Ezersky practices his punditry on us.By Caitlin LovingerVARIETY PUZZLE — Puns and Anagrams play faster and looser than straight cryptic puzzles, and Sam Ezersky improvises riffs on top of that, so to completely finish a grid like this you’ve got to unfurrow your brow a little bit, go with the flow, and promise not to YELL AT yourself or him for any oddball inclusions. On the plus side, this makes it easier to smile at those same oddball inclusions, if and when you suss them out.If you’re at all new to this game (or even if you’ve been solving “Pandas” forever) start with the anagrams to get a toehold. There are always some easy ones, like DAUBER at 9A (for “One painting an earbud” — rearrange the letters in “earbud” to get “one painting”). The clue beneath this at 16A is much the same, as are 23D, 65A, 62A, 54A, 37D, and so on.For the anagrams, I especially liked 9D for the “Deb” reference, today, and 35D because it made me think of Minnie the Moocher.After you’ve exhausted those more straightforward options, the fun really begins. Every constructor (or setter, as they say in cryptics — I guess a maker of Pandas could be a consetter) has their own style and preferences for the infinite variety of puns that we can encounter. Mr. Ezersky uses some tried and true mechanisms. One involves letters running either through the middle of a clue — see 36A, “N.B.A. star” (Julius) ERVING, from the letters in “Much-deserving,” or around the edges — see 21D, “Place to ski around Alberta,” or ALTA.A few straight puns, which are de rigueur in puzzles like this: “Sends junk, etc.” is SHIPS, which means both “sends” and “junk, etc.” and UTILE is a “Useful draw” — a U TILE — “in Scrabble.” There are also some visual and auditory gags. One involves deducing missing letters in passages like 25A, “D_b_i’s home_” which is, if you realize you’re looking at “Dubai,” the UAE. One involves recognizing one big missing letter in a sequence, “MNOPQST” — NO R. Another makes you translate numbers to letters (like “10” to TEN) or letters to words (like “Q” to CUE) to help with anagrams — or vice versa, “Em” goes to M, whose neighbors are L and N (in the alphabet), which become ELLEN. A tough little nut in this vein was 19A — think of V, the roman numeral for five, to get this one.There’s also more endearing and personalized cluing, I think, that marks a puzzle with the name Ezersky. I’d say that product placements like the Cadillac ESCALADE and an UBER RIDE count as flourishes (especially, for the latter, crossing OUT OF GAS). I found YOUTUBE deliciously squicky. Mr. Ezersky also counts on us to know a little scifi, but just a little — like the fact that Ewoks come from ENDOR, SEE? I also attribute the cute “Cook’s corner” at the bottom left to the wiles of today’s consetter, with a GRATIN, a PUREE, a GELATO and a PITA. Similarly, I found the crossing of names from 80s music and television — SEACLIFF and FILLING IN — to be personable.

"It's reflecting people waiting more information, like corporate earnings." On the economic front, initial jobless claims dropped last week to their lowest level since 1969, while in March, producer prices made their biggest gain since October, according to separate reports from the U.S. Labor Department.The upbeat data could ease worries of a sharp global economic downturn reaching U.S. shores, a concern reflected in minutes from the Federal Reserve's March meeting released on Wednesday.As reporting season begins, analysts expect S&P 500 first-quarter profits to have dropped 2.5% year-on-year, their first contraction since 2016.But Carlson wonders if those estimates are overly pessimistic. "Does (the market) think earnings are going to be better than analysts think? We'll get a first taste of that from the banks tomorrow." Financial stocks were up 0.6% ahead of a string of earnings reports from six major U.S. banks. JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co are due to report on Friday, followed by Citigroup Inc and Goldman Sachs Inc on Monday and Bank of America Corp and Morgan Stanley on Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 14.11 points, or 0.05%, to 26,143.05, the S&P 500 closed flat at 2,888.32 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 16.89 points, or 0.21%, to 7,947.36.Of the 11 major sectors of the S&P 500, seven closed in the black.Healthcare stocks were by far the biggest drag, falling 1.2% a day after U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders introduced a "Medicare for All" plan to Congress, and the Senate Finance Committee concluded a hearing to discuss the role pharmacy benefit managers play in drug pricing."I'm a bit surprised we're seeing that kind of reaction to these proposals that for the time being aren't going anywhere," Carlson added. "Maybe it's foreshadowing a change."UnitedHealth Group Inc weighed heaviest on the Dow, falling 4.3%. U.S. Steel Corp dropped 3.2% after Bank of America Merrill Lynch cut its rating on the stock to "underperform." Peers AK Steel Holding Corp and Steel Dynamics Inc dropped 8.3% and 2.5%, respectively.Home furnishings retailer Bed Bath & Beyond fell 8.8% as its bleak first-quarter profits raised doubts about its turnaround plan.Shares of Lyft Inc reversed course, rising 1.5%. Still, the stock is currently trading about 15% below its $72 offer price since its March 29 debut, casting a shadow over rival Uber Technologies' impending IPO.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.10-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.21-to-1 ratio favored decliners.The S&P 500 posted 31 new 52-week highs and 3 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 64 new highs and 30 new lows.

By Kim VelseyBlake Bejan knew that moving from San Francisco to Manhattan would be an adjustment, but he never imagined that owning a queen-size bed would be a problem. Or that having the space for a dresser and some shelves could be considered a luxury.That’s what he discovered last October, when he was considering a studio in Chelsea. Time was running out, as he had to move out of the temporary housing his employer, Uber Eats, had arranged for him. “I really, really liked the spot. I really wanted it to work,” said Mr. Bejan, 25. “So I eyeballed it. I said, ‘I think I can make this work.’ I jumped into the decision because I was feeling rushed.”But then Mr. Bejan compared the apartment’s measurements to those of the bed, dresser and shelves he was having shipped from California, where he had shared a two-bedroom apartment, and realized they wouldn’t fit.“My bed alone would have come right up to the edge of the kitchen island,” Mr. Bejan said. “I would have been climbing over my furniture just to move around.”He didn’t want to buy all new furniture: It wasn’t as if his furniture was preposterously proportioned; it wasn’t even particularly large. “For me, an apartment is not just a place to store my body at night,” Mr. Bejan said. “I didn’t want my bed to be the primary surface in the apartment.”He got out of the deal, but then had only one day to find a new place before leaving for a vacation in Amsterdam. As he worked in West Chelsea, he had been looking on the West Side, but most of the apartments he had seen were small walk-ups with challenging layouts. Consulting a transit map — which he had used to guide his search, an easy commute being his only other priority — he decided to change tack and head east.$2,325 | Murray Hill, ManhattanOccupation: Marketing manager, Uber EatsApartment hunting in New York vs. California: “I had to consider air-conditioning for the first time in my life,” said Mr. Bejan, who is from San Jose and has lived in San Francisco since college.On using a broker: The broker’s fee gave him pause, but using a broker turned out to be a big help. “I was so overwhelmed seeing apartments,” he said, “and they kept certain things in mind.”Good and bad surprises: A dishwasher, which he wasn’t expecting, and noise from the Queens-Midtown Tunnel. “At 6 a.m., it’s loud as hell,” he said. “I made a sound dampener out of a board and foam, and bear-cage myself in most mornings.”The best things about New York: “I really like the people. I think they’re really genuine here; people in San Francisco can be fake.” Plus, the music scene in Brooklyn and the food. “I love Levain Bakery. I recently took visiting friends through Central Park and strategically navigated us through the park to end up there.”As he and his real estate agent, Marien Richardson of Citi Habitats, toured listings around Murray Hill and Kip’s Bay, they kept bumping into another apartment seeker and his broker.“Sometimes we’d be there first, sometimes they’d be before us. I was like, ‘O.K., you’re my competition.’” Mr. Bejan said. “It was really intense.”At a building in the East 30s, the unit they had come to see wasn’t available for viewing — the tenant was in the midst of moving out — but the one below was empty.For $2,325 a month, the apartment was not too small but not too large. There was a small entrance hall and space for not only all the furniture he owned, including the bed, but also for a small sofa. Plus, there was laundry in the building and an unexpected bonus, a dishwasher. And if the view was nothing much — the one window faced a brick wall — at least the wall was on the other side of a street, so there was natural light.He was told that the apartment above had a newer floor and stainless steel appliances, but it also cost about $75 more a month. “I don’t need that stuff that bad. This floor is fine; it’s not like it’s ruining my life,” he said of his older parquet.He put in an application and hoped for the best. The response came fast: Because he didn’t meet the landlord’s income requirements and neither of his parents lived in the tristate area, so they couldn’t act as guarantors, the landlord wanted four months’ rent as security deposit.“I was like, ‘I don’t have that much money!’” Mr. Bejan said. The first month’s rent was being offered free, but he still had to come up with last month’s rent and the broker’s fee. He offered two months’ rent as a security deposit and the landlord countered with three. The discussion stopped there.“I really wanted it, ” Mr. Bejan said. “But I didn’t have the three months, so I was like, ‘Oh well.’”He was on his way to the airport the next afternoon when he got a call. The landlord would take two months’ security deposit, but he needed to sign the documents in person and bring a check. Waiting until he got back was not an option. After much pleading, they finally agreed to a virtual document signing and a wire transfer, followed by a visit to the office upon his return.In November, when Mr. Bejan moved in, his furniture fit even better than he had expected it to: The alcove along one wall is the perfect size for his bed. And the bed isn’t the primary surface in the apartment; it’s not even the first thing people see when they walk in.The apartment is spacious enough to have a few friends over for a drink before going out on Friday nights. And it doesn’t feel claustrophobic on Saturdays, when he likes to be a homebody.The only thing he is not in love with is Murray Hill. “It’s fine. It’s convenient, but it feels a bit generic,” he said. “In the future, I’ll look at a transit map, but also do a neighborhood overlay.”For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

What foods would you suggest they eat?In “A Day in Houston: 3 Meals, 3 Cultures, One City,” Sebastian Modak describes a one-day eating adventure in this Texas city. Houston’s diversity led him to eat dim sum, barbecue and Afghan cuisine. He writes:At first glance, much of Houston looks alike. Making your way out of the “Loop,” the I-610 highway that circles the city center like a shirt collar, skyscrapers give way to manicured office parks and strip malls, each seemingly a carbon copy of the last. But when you look a little closer, you notice that in one of those strip malls, all the business names carry the tonal accents of written Vietnamese. In another, two Indian restaurants sit on either side of a service specializing in money transfers to Central America. In a nearby parking lot, a family — the men wearing skullcaps and knee-length agbada shirts and the women in brightly patterned hijabs — loads up a sedan with the ingredients for a meal that I imagine tastes like another home, thousands of miles away.Houston is widely considered to be one of the most culturally diverse cities in the world. According to the city’s planning department, 48 percent of residents speak a language other than English — and more than 145 languages are spoken in the city. Twenty-nine percent of the population is foreign-born.… So, feeling a kind of kinship with all those Houstonians who live between worlds based on my own unmoored and multicultural background, I leaned into it. I ate more than I should have and blew my Uber budget pretty quickly, but over three meals in a single day, I found a Houston I never imagined existed in the cracks between SUV-clogged freeways and oil-boom money.Students, read the entire article, then tell us:— If Mr. Modak visited your hometown, where would you send him to eat? What foods would you recommend that he try? What do you hope he would learn and appreciate about your hometown by eating like a local for just one day?— Are there dishes or cuisines that are popular where you live that you simply don’t like or rarely, if ever, eat? Would you still suggest them to visitors for the sake of having “the local experience”? Why or why not?— Have you ever traveled to a new place and ate dishes that, though popular there, were unfamiliar to you? If so, recount your experience.— What stops, if any, that Mr. Modak made at Houston restaurants are places you’d also like to visit? What would you eat there?Students 13 and older are invited to comment. All comments are moderated by the Learning Network staff, but please keep in mind that once your comment is accepted, it will be made public.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byGood Wednesday morning.

But instead of expressing concern about the mounting losses, executives argued that they were a sign of the company’s giant ambitions.“We can very much, if we chose to, moderate our growth and become profitable,” Artie Minson, WeWork’s president, said in a telephone interview. “But it’s a time for us to continue to accelerate.”Michael Gross, the company’s vice chairman, added, “We’re looking at building this business out, not just maximizing profitability over the next one to two years.”WeWork’s valuation of about $42 billion makes it one of the world’s most valuable privately held companies. Begun as a co-working space in Manhattan eight years ago, it has also become one of the biggest corporate landlords in the world. It has continued to expand rapidly into new markets around the world.But the costs of the company’s rapid growth stand out, even among the crowd of technology darlings that run huge losses to expand their empires. Uber lost $1.8 billion last year, an improvement over the $2.2 billion it lost in 2017, while Lyft lost $911 million last year.Such companies argue that for now, they are willing to tolerate red ink because the cost of slowing down is too high. But several companies that went public with huge losses, including Groupon and Snap Inc., now trade well below their initial public offering prices. And many shareholders expect the businesses they invest in to eventually make money.WeWork’s ambitions to overhaul the working world have drawn the backing of deep-pocketed investors like SoftBank, the Japanese technology giant, which believes the company represents the future of work.The company now has 401,000 paying members in 100 cities, up significantly from 2017. And it has continued to expand its base of corporate customers, including businesses like Amazon and PepsiCo. (Corporate memberships now make up roughly a third of WeWork’s overall subscriptions.)And the company is spending more to add more amenities to its work spaces, which already include coffee and beer in many places.Mr. Minson also played down the $1.9 billion loss, which was calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles, in favor of a number of nonstandard measures. One measure, called adjusted Ebitda, strips out costs like taxes and stock-based compensation. That led to a $665.7 million loss last year, compared with $193.3 million in 2017.And then there is “community-adjusted Ebitda,” which excludes those expenses — as well marketing, administrative and other costs of growing the business. By that measure, WeWork earned $467.1 million last year, double what it earned in 2017.WeWork executives argued that the company was in a strong financial position, with $6.6 billion in cash and committed capital. It also raised $702 million from its first-ever bond sale last year.Mr. Gross added that the company could issue more debt or take on another investment if necessary.“We have no need to tap the equity capital markets, but there’s a lot of interest and demand in our story,” he said.And while critics of WeWork worry that the company might suffer in an economic downturn — particularly by being trapped in long-term leases — Mr. Minson argued that the company could draw more customers looking to downsize and wanting cheaper office space.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byLet us help you start your day. By Melina Delkic(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning. Britain’s Parliament looks for more Brexit alternatives, President Trump threatens to close part of the U.S. border, and Slovakia elects its first female president. Here’s the latest:Late Monday in Britain, lawmakers will try again to come up with an alternative to Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan, which they have rejected three times.Chances of success appear minimal. None of the eight options on the table last week fetched a majority in Parliament.Failure would leave the country with two unappealing options: leave the E.U. in a little over a week without a deal or delay Brexit further.Analysis: “In interviews, many Britons expressed despair over the inability of the political system to produce a compromise,” our London correspondents Ellen Barry and Benjamin Mueller write. “No one feels that the government has represented their interests. No one is satisfied. No one is hopeful.“It has amounted to a hollowing out of confidence in democracy itself.”The winners: One industry that seems to be booming amid the Brexit chaos: law firms dealing with client concerns about the legal ramifications of the divorce with the E.U. Live from our London newsroom: What does this divided moment mean for the future of Britain? Times subscribers can join a conference call at 2 p.m. G.M.T. for a discussion of Brexit with our Europe editor, Jim Yardley; the London-based chief international correspondent Ellen Barry; and the London correspondent Stephen Castle. R.S.V.P. here. The president, emboldened by his attorney general’s public characterization of the Mueller report, has threatened to close off parts of the U.S. border with Mexico this week. He also ordered the State Department to cut off aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, saying the countries were not doing enough to stop migrants from pushing north.In recent weeks, Border Patrol facilities have been strained by an influx of migrants — the largest annual surge in years — ahead of the arrival of the deadly summer heat.Impact: Sealing the border would effectively close off the U.S. from one of its largest trading partners, and could leave American citizens who travel back and forth stuck in limbo.Conditions: Processing stations across the 1,900-mile border with Mexico were not expanded despite projections of the influx, and makeshift additions have been overwhelmed. American immigration officials cleared out a holding pen under a bridge in El Paso, Tex., after an outcry over conditions at the site. Russia has been steadily expanding its military influence across Africa, alarming Western officials by increasing arms sales, security agreements and training programs for unstable countries or autocratic leaders.The effort reflects President Vladimir Putin’s vision of returning Russia to its former glory and illustrates the country’s opportunistic strategy.What Russia wants: The country is seeking more strategic bases for its troops, according to an analysis by the Institute for the Study of War, a research organization in Washington.Scope: Russia is helping a former general in Libya fight for control over his government and vast oil market. Sudan’s president brought in Russian mercenaries in January to help shore up his rule against protests. Last spring, Mali, Niger, Chad, Burkina Faso and Mauritania appealed to Moscow to help their overtaxed militaries and security services combat terrorism.History: Russia was entrenched in Africa during the Cold War’s violent East-West rivalry but largely retreated from the continent after the collapse of the Soviet Union. In the past two years, however, Moscow has rekindled relations.Others in Africa: American political consultants with ties to President Trump have become regular fixtures in African political campaigns, seizing on the region’s turn toward democracy.With about 900 million voters, almost 2,000 registered parties and five weeks of voting, the Indian elections can seem cacophonous. Even for this briefing writer, a diaspora Indian, they’re difficult to follow. The country’s myriad states, cultures and socioeconomic segments can’t be sliced into left or right, red or blue. It’s a kaleidoscope, and each prism illuminates a different aspect of the political spectrum.But it is also heartening to watch this young democracy exercising a right denied to many in the surrounding region. And it is important: What happens in India can end up shifting the global economy and geopolitical landscape.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his right-wing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party are seeking to retain power, facing a surging challenge by the opposition Congress Party. The briefing will be regularly unpacking aspects of the race. Voting unfolds from April 11 until May 19 and results are announced on May 23.Keep in mind that the backdrop for the campaigning is a flammable mix of economic, religious and national security issues. Unemployment is high, sectarian violence has risen, farmers across the country are increasingly frustrated and there’s broad disillusionment with politicians.Send us your feedback and any questions you have about the elections here.— Alisha Haridasani Gupta Algeria: The army chief kept his post in a newly named government despite his call to have the ailing president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, declared unfit for office. Critics accused the army chief of trying to orchestrate a coup. On Friday, tens of thousands of Algerians marched in a broad show of anger against the government in the sixth mass protest in a row.Italy: The country’s interior minister, part of the anti-immigrant League party, criticized an Italian rap tune with a Middle Eastern flavor. Now the song’s artist is at the center of a national debate about what it means to be Italian at a time when critics say the country’s most powerful politician seems intent on stoking racism and xenophobia.Uber: A college student in South Carolina was found dead after she apparently got into a car that she mistook for an Uber she had called, the authorities said. In a statement, the president of her university said, “Times like these leave me searching for words of wisdom and comfort.”Women as leaders: In Opinion, Tina Brown writes about women who shine as leaders when they stop pursuing male paths to power, and instead lead like women: “Women have learned and taught lessons about how to cope with seeming impossibilities in ways that men traditionally — and to this day — have not.” “Salvator Mundi”: The location of the famed painting attributed to Leonardo da Vinci has been a mystery since last year, shortly after a Saudi royal, most likely the crown prince, paid $450 million for it.The Kardashians: For more than a decade, the family has turned its feuding on reality TV into business opportunities. “People don’t know how much work goes into it,” the family matriarch, Kris Jenner, said in an interview with The Times.Slovakia: Zuzana Caputova was elected as the country’s first female president, and the 45-year-old lawyer, activist and political newcomer vowed to return a sense of decency to Slovakia’s often toxic political climate. Tips for a more fulfilling life.Recipe of the day: Alison Roman’s spicy noodle soup with mushrooms and herbs is a deeply flavored vegetarian dinner.Time management can only get you so far. The true key to productivity, according to Adam Grant, a Wharton School expert, is attention management.Hostels are the best way to travel cheaply all over the world.The Bauhaus art school celebrates the centennial of its founding today.The Modernist school (whose name inverts “Hausbau,” the German word for “house building”) was among the first to combine the teaching of crafts, design, architecture and fine art.Walter Gropius, the architect who established the school in 1919 in Weimar, Germany, wrote in the Bauhaus’s program that the ultimate aim was the “unified work of art.”And he enlisted masters of various artistic disciplines, such as Wassily Kandinsky, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy and Paul Klee, to join the Bauhaus faculty.The school survived for little more than a decade before it was shut down in 1933 under pressure from the Nazis.But its legacy of uniting art and functional design in everyday life is long-lasting, and Bauhaus principles were spread worldwide.Anna Schaverien, from our London newsroom, wrote today’s Back Story.Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings.Check out this page to find a Morning Briefing for your region.

Ries starts off our solving weekend with “boomsticks.”By Deb AmlenFRIDAY PUZZLE — Confession time: I used to be terrified of themeless puzzles. Who was I to think that I could conquer a Friday or Saturday puzzle, the hardest ones of the week?Now I really enjoy them, both for the challenge and for the palate cleanser they provide after a week of themed puzzles and the constraints they contain. And here is the deep, dark secret of how I eventually became a regular solver of those frightening, late-week grids:I became a regular solver of those frightening, late-week grids.That’s really it. It boils down to practice, and to evicting that voice in your head that says, “I am strictly a Monday-Wednesday solver, and I can’t do anything else.”Well, it also boils down to getting a foothold so you can eventually solve the whole thing, but it’s not that hard. The clues are written and edited to make sure that no matter who you are or where you come from, there will be something that you know. My first gimme in Friday’s fabulous puzzle, by Andrew J. Ries, was our Friend of the Crossword LISA LOEB, the singer who also collaborated on a celebrity puzzle with the constructor Doug Peterson in 2017. And thank Heaven for her, because between Ms. Loeb and the Down entries in the northwest, that was the only way I was going to get 13A’s ICE BOWL (clued as “Nickname of the subzero 1967 N.F.L. Championship Game”). I also knew the “Old Asian capital,” EDO (the old name for Tokyo), and a few more entries on which I could build.What was your gimme? Take a look back at the clue list and let me know in the comments. If nothing else, it will prove to you that you can at least get started in a tough puzzle.Once you’re in, you’re in. Pat yourself on the back. Reward yourself with a piece of chocolate or some other meaningful treat. Tell your dog or cat how smart you are. They will agree with you, I promise.Because here’s the thing: If you don’t even try, you’re missing out. Remember those constraints I was talking about before in the themed puzzles? Themes are great. I love them. But because they have to be placed carefully in a grid, it lowers that chances that you’re going to find those elegantly long, crunchy entries like LEAD BALLOON, TETRAHEDRA, BONE TIRED, PAPER TOSS, UBER DRIVER or ESCAPE ROOM.So give a Friday puzzle a go. You don’t have to finish it at first, and there is no shame in that. You can always pick it up and try again. But the only way you’ll prove to yourself what a good puzzle solver you are is to try.26A: A “Farm extension” is not more land. It’s an extension of the word “farm,” and the answer is STEAD, as in farmSTEAD.29A: We’re not thinking of budgetary overspending in the clue “Overspent?,” unless it’s your budget of physical energy. In this puzzle, the answer is BONE TIRED.41A: Back before we were supposedly a paperless society, I once shared an office with a man who liked to play PAPER TOSS. He was also a smoker, and one day, as I was coming back from a meeting, he ran past me in the hallway holding his trash bin in front of him, which just happened to be on fire. He got promoted shortly after that, which taught me a lot about the business world. Also, PAPER TOSS makes its New York Times Crossword debut today.43A: Wordplay alert! “Did crew work” in this puzzle refers to rowing crew, and the answer is OARED.49A: Do you know about Sporcle and its fun quizzes? Go NERD out. (Yes, I know the answer in the puzzle is NERDS: I’m calling it artistic license.)59A: I have to admit that this was also a gimme for me. I’m used to thinking of the word “locks” as hair in wordplay clues, and with the clue “One strengthened by locks?,” it was easy enough to remember the story of SAMSON.3D: The “Cuban bread” that you eat is delicious, but the “bread” in this puzzle is slang for money, so the answer is PESO.9D: Even after I got the answer TAIPEI I had to think about this one, because I mis-parsed it. I got the answer to “Foreign capital whose name sounds like a blood grouping” through the crossings, and then I sat there thinking “TIE PAY is a blood grouping?” No, Deb. It’s “Type A.”17D: Notice the space in the clue “Needle point?” The craft of needlepoint is spelled without the space, and there is a question mark in the clue, so we need to think about something else. Where do you point a needle? You point a needle at a BLOOD VESSEL.47D: “Double, double toil and trouble; Fire burn and caldron bubble.” So sayeth the HAGS who stirred the fetid pot in Act IV, Scene 1 of that Scottish play.56D: More wordplay! I had a tough time deciding what “Work on hooks, say” should be. Once I had filled in two of the letters, I realized the answer was BOX because we were not talking about metal hooks, we were talking about throwing hooks, as in punches.This grid started with the northwest corner. I had to edit it out of another themeless I was working on, but repurposed it as a block of seed entries here. I wanted to make sure to include some nice 10s going down in the northeast and southwest. I especially liked UBER DRIVER and ESCAPE ROOM when I wrote the puzzle back in July 2017, because neither had been used in The Times at that point. Both have been used in The Times since; this is now the fourth appearance for ESCAPE ROOM, in fact, so it’s arguably more overused than fresh at this point. Them’s the breaks sometimes.A tip of the hat to the editing team on the cluing, as always; I especially liked their clues at 30- and 52-Down. I love it when clues appear to hint at a plural entry, but the answer is singular (and vice versa). Among my original clues, I probably like 17-Down the best.I hope solvers enjoy!Almost finished solving but need a bit more help?

He told reporters on Tuesday that the House Judiciary Committee’s broad inquiry into his activities was merely an effort to overshadow his achievements.“No administration has accomplished — probably you could say this with absolute surety — in the first two years anywhere near what we’ve accomplished,” Trump asserted.By now, Stephen Colbert is used to hearing Trump speak in superlatives — but he couldn’t countenance that claim.“Really? I just want to point out, on Day 149 of George Washington’s presidency, they passed the Bill of Rights — and it’s taken you almost two years to violate all of them.” — STEPHEN COLBERTColbert also riffed on a recent Twitter post in which Trump said Democrats had gone “stone cold CRAZY.”“Trump, on the other hand, is sweaty hot crazy.” — STEPHEN COLBERTAt an event on Monday, a reporter asked Trump whether he would cooperate with Representative Jerry Nadler, the head of the House Judiciary Committee, who is investigating whether the president committed obstruction of justice. Trump shot back: “I cooperate all the time with everybody.”James Corden cried foul.“He’s right, unless you count the special counsel, the F.B.I., every single Democrat, half his own cabinet and every country in the United Nations except Russia.

And you’ll never guess where he lives.By Deb AmlenMONDAY PUZZLE — Alert the media! The crossword puzzle constructor Thomas van Geel makes his New York Times Crossword debut today, but that’s not even the best part. The best part is that he lives in Natick, Mass. I don’t remember the last time I was this excited about a debut for entirely geographic reasons. This is too good to be true.As some of you know, a Natick in puzzle solving is when two obscure proper nouns cross each other with little hope of the solver getting either one. It was coined by Rex Parker, and is based on the Massachusetts town.Anyway, we begin our solving week with a theme that may present a challenge for beginners on a Monday, but there have been enough themes like this early in the week for it to be something you’ve run into at least once. The upside of this is that early-week solvers get more of an “Aha!” moment.So we’re already off to a good start. Which, as always, is a hint but not a spoiler.Easy, easy, easy. You’ve got this. Just a couple of things:30A: “Extra job in the gig economy,” like driving for Uber or Lyft, is familiarly known as a SIDE HUSTLE, which makes its New York Times Crossword debut today. Great, crunchy phrase.60A: “Mind’s I?” is playing on the phrase “mind’s eye,” but by substituting the word “I” for “eye” (Ha! An “I” for an “eye”), we are supposed to be thinking of the self, or the EGO.49D: Don’t know Latin? Neither do I. Not to worry, get IN ESSE through the crossings. It means “Having existence.”Mr. van Geel offers us three theme phrases, and the revealer KICKSTARTER, at 62A, is a great hint at what you need to do to make sense of the seemingly disparate list of theme entries.The first word in each theme phrase can be put before the word KICK to make a different phrase. For example, the answer to 17A is FREECYCLING (a debut), and you can put KICK after the word FREE to make FREE KICK.I was absolutely thrilled to get the nod from Will on this puzzle last summer. I’ve been constructing puzzles for some years now, but never broke through until this one.

I live in Natick, Mass., with my wonderful wife and two children, all of whom kindly tolerate my crossword construction binges (when I come up with a theme I like, I tend to disappear into my computer until it’s done). I was introduced to crossword solving by my grandmother, who I imagine is smiling down on me from on high, with her clipboard of cut out newspaper crosswords and trusty ballpoint.Almost finished solving but need a bit more help? We’ve got you covered.Warning: There be spoilers ahead, but subscribers can take a peek at the answer key.Trying to get back to the puzzle page? Right here.

Even the Saturdays.  @NYTimesWordplay AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressWASHINGTON — As she heads out the door, departing Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen will confront the odd dynamics of the post-Trump job market.Sure, opportunities await — but also perhaps some closed doors.Outgoing top administration officials typically have a wide array of options in both the public and private sector — including speaking engagements, TV contracts, book deals, academic posts and corporate gigs. But some former Trump aides have found their options more limited than did their predecessors, in part due to controversy surrounding President Donald Trump's policies on issues such as the environment and immigration, as well as his record of racially-charged language.Nielsen, who resigned Sunday, has a resume offering expertise in managing a massive cabinet agency. But she also may face scrutiny as the public face of the administration's family separation policy."It's a totally different environment than a normal cabinet secretary leaving a normal administration, especially with her overseeing a lot of very controversial policies that have upset a lot of people," said Matt Lattimer, who served under President George W. Bush and is co-founder of the Javelin literary agency. "She's going to have to answer questions about those policies."Already, some critics are pushing to prevent Nielsen from cashing in on her tenure in the Trump administration. A collection of advocacy groups has written an open letter to executives, calling on corporate America to block any administration officials associated with family separations, including Nielsen. The letter was signed by the National Immigration Law Center, Southern Poverty Law Center, NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice and others."This is about making sure these administration officials, as they enter the revolving door of our government to private life, that they are not allowed to profit from the misery they inflicted on thousands of families," said Karl Frisch, a spokesman for Restore Public Justice, which is organizing the effort.Frisch said the group was also readying a digital ad buy targeting Nielsen.Some speculated that Nielsen would be a strong candidate for consulting jobs with companies that get government contracts, particularly as long as Trump is in office, when her knowledge and insight will be marketable.Plenty of former Trump aides have found reasonably soft landings, though there have been some bumps along the way.A number of formers have signed up with speaking agencies, among them Trump's most recent chief of staff John Kelly, former Press Secretary Sean Spicer and Trump's original chief, Reince Priebus. Priebus also returned to his former law firm, while Spicer wrote a book and serves as a consultant to a Trump-supporting PAC. Still, Spicer did not score a TV contributor deal after he left the West Wing in 2017, though he recently signed on as a contributor to the syndicated entertainment show "Extra."Also writing a book was Omarosa Manigault Newman. Top communications official Hope Hicks took on a similar role at the new Fox company and Dina Powell, deputy national security adviser, returned to Goldman Sachs.But corporate America has proven more elusive, compared with aides to President Barack Obama. Press Secretary Jay Carney is at Amazon, senior adviser David Plouffe is at Uber and Press Secretary Josh Earnest is at United Airlines. Tom Ridge, the first Homeland Security secretary under President George W. Bush, has served on a slew of private and public boards. While Trump officials have found lucrative options, those corner offices have not come their way.To be sure, many Trump aides do not have the years of experience typically associated with top White House officials, which may also affect their prospects. And given the rapid turnover in the administration, they often are not able to conduct a methodical job hunt before making an exit.Nielsen's carefully worded resignation letter suggests she is unlikely to break with the White House as she returns to private life. A former official in the George W. Bush White House who previously ran her own consulting firm, she had little public profile before taking the job.For now, she is working to wind down her role with the department before a Wednesday exit, and evaluating options for the future.___Associated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this report.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byAviation unions have raised concerns about the shutdown’s effect on the safety of the nation’s air travel system. By Patrick McGeehan and Thomas KaplanUnions representing air traffic controllers, pilots and flight attendants offered an urgent warning on Wednesday that the lengthy government shutdown had created serious safety concerns for the nation’s air travel system.“In our risk averse industry,” their presidents said in a joint statement, “we cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at play, nor predict the point at which the entire system will break.”The partial shutdown, nearing five full weeks, has caused strain across the air travel system. For more than a month, thousands of transportation security officers and air traffic controllers have been working without pay. Union officials have been warning that the additional stress the shutdown has put on the workers could have dangerous consequences.“We are less safe today,” Sara Nelson, the international president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, said on Thursday.The nature of the concern being expressed by aviation union leaders is more general than specific. In effect, they are warning that the complex system intended to keep air travelers safe is being seriously tested by the shutdown and its consequences, from staffing changes to the financial stress it has inflicted on workers who do not know how long they will have to survive without a paycheck.Still, the Federal Aviation Administration insisted on Thursday that “the traveling public can be assured that our nation’s airspace system is safe.”“The F.A.A. continually reviews and analyzes the performance of the national airspace system to assess its safety and efficiency,” the agency said in a statement. “We have not observed any appreciable difference in performance over the last several weeks compared to the same periods during the previous two years.”Air traffic controllers, who are responsible for keeping planes from colliding, have been working without pay.It’s more complicated for safety inspectors, who are responsible for oversight of commercial aircraft, pilots and maintenance facilities.Last week, the F.A.A. announced it was bringing back furloughed inspectors and other employees in order to ensure safety. Its revised shutdown plan called for having 3,113 employees responsible for aviation safety designated as essential to protect life and safety, meaning that they would work without pay during the shutdown rather than be furloughed.The F.A.A.’s original shutdown plan called for only 216 aviation safety positions to be considered essential for life and safety. The union representing inspectors had warned that furloughing those workers was hurting the safety of the air travel system.There are still plenty of F.A.A. employees who have been sidelined. Over all, about 14,000 of the F.A.A.’s 45,000 employees are furloughed under the revised shutdown plan.More than 40,000 transportation security officers — employees of the Department of Homeland Security who screen passengers at the airports — have worked through the shutdown. But they have been failing to show up for their shifts at a rising rate — about one in 10 were absent on Sunday. On average, they make less than $40,000 a year and many of them have had to borrow money, seek side jobs or turn to food pantries to get by.Despite reassurances from Transportation Security Administration officials, the agency did have a lapse in early January that frightened travelers. A woman passed through a screening checkpoint at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport with a gun that she carried onto a flight that landed Jan. 3 in Tokyo.The agency later said that any perception that the shutdown caused the failure to detect the gun, which was in a carry-on bag, “would be false.” No similar lapses have been reported during the shutdown.Staffing was already an issue even before the shutdown, their union said.The number of certified controllers is at a 30-year low, according to the National Air Traffic Controllers Association. The centralized radar facility for the airports that serve New York City, which is known as a Tracon, has only about 130 controllers, far short of its full complement of 228, said Rich Santa, a regional vice president of the controllers’ union. And 50 of them are eligible to retire now, he said.Many of the controllers were already working the maximum of 60 hours per week — 10-hour shifts, six days in a row — before the shutdown, said Mick Devine, a Boston-based regional vice president of the controllers’ union. Having received their second biweekly statements showing pay of $0.00 on Thursday, the controllers are worrying about how they will pay their mortgages and school loans when they “need to be 100 percent focused 100 percent of the time,” Mr. Devine said.Paul M. Rinaldi, the president of the union, said he was “starting to see routine mistakes in clearances being made because controllers are distracted.”Citing the large number of controllers who can retire, he asked how long they would continue to work without pay "before they just fill out their retirement paperwork and then go wait tables or drive Uber or Lyft so that they could put food on the table."The shutdown has also caused the F.A.A.’s training academy in Oklahoma City to close, prompting concerns about disruptions to the pipeline of new controllers.A 2017 report from the Transportation Department’s inspector general found that the F.A.A. had fallen well short of its hiring goals for air traffic controllers from 2013 through 2015. The report concluded that the agency would “continue to face challenges in meeting its hiring goals and ensuring it hires and trains enough new controllers to offset retirements.”The F.A.A. said in a 2018 report that it had hired more than 6,500 controllers in the previous five years. In 2017, it exceeded its annual goal by hiring 1,880 controllers, the report said.So far, according to the F.A.A., the shutdown has not driven air traffic controllers to quit. The F.A.A. said it has seen “no measurable increase” in unplanned retirements or resignations by air traffic controllers.Many transportation security officers have been accepting handouts from food pantries and free meals from airport concessions. Some said they had resorted to selling possessions on eBay or seeking out odd jobs like delivering food. Mr. Devine said controllers are barred from side jobs that could be considered a conflict of interest. To avoid running afoul of the rules, he said, they are taking low-skill, low-pay gigs, such as driving for ride-sharing services or tending bar.“Some people just hop in their cars as they’re leaving the airport and head to the Uber stand and pick someone up on their way home,” Mr. Devine said, describing how some controllers are earning money on the side.At a news conference on Thursday, Mr. Rinaldi, the president of the controllers’ union, was asked directly if the flying public was safe.He answered, “The flying public is safe.”Air traffic controllers, he said, “are going to make sure that you get from Point A to Point B safely.” But he could not promise that travelers would be on time or would make their connections, and he expressed concern about how the departure of controllers would affect flights.“We cannot hold this schedule when we lose that many controllers,” he said, “and we’re about to lose a lot of controllers.”Patrick McGeehan writes about transportation and infrastructure for the Metro section.

Here's the sign-up.]It’s Wednesday. Weather:  A day that starts crisp, then warms to near 50, but with gathering clouds.Alternate-side parking: In effect until March 21 (Purim).Ten states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational marijuana. Now New York and New Jersey could join them.In New York, there is widespread support among lawmakers to legalize marijuana, but there is a complex debate over how exactly to do it.In New Jersey, lawmakers may vote on the issue this month, according to a deal announced Tuesday.What’s the status of marijuana?• New York: Marijuana possession was decriminalized in 1977, but arrests for having small amounts of it continued for decades. Medical marijuana has been legal since 2014.• New Jersey: The state has not decriminalized the drug. Medical marijuana has been legal since 2010.When could things change?• New York: Not in the next few months. Governor Cuomo wanted to include legalization in the state budget in April but recently acknowledged that he was likely to miss that deadline.Black lawmakers want assurances that money from the potentially $3 billion industry would benefit communities disproportionately affected by the war on drugs.• New Jersey:  Gov. Philip D. Murphy said Tuesday that his “best guess” was that legal marijuana sales would begin early next year.Who are the crucial players?• New York: The main fight is not about whether to legalize marijuana, but how. Shaping that debate are people like the Assembly majority leader, Crystal Peoples-Stokes of Buffalo. She wants a guarantee that people of color will receive licenses to sell marijuana. She also wants a plan for how revenue from sales will be reinvested in minority communities. New Jersey: The governor and two legislative leaders, all Democrats, have a broad compromise to legalize the drug, expunge some drug-related criminal records and help incentivize businesses owned by people of color.Craig Coughlin, the Assembly speaker, said he had the votes to pass a bill. Stephen Sweeney, the State Senate president, has said he was short some votes.Who will profit?• New York: Legalization could yield $772 million in tax revenue for the city and state annually, according to the New York City comptroller, Scott Stringer. A top aide to Mr. Cuomo said details about who would get access to licenses, and how the state would spend revenue from the industry, should be written into regulations after legalization takes place.• New Jersey: The state estimated that it could bring in $210 million in state taxes annually.What is the downside?Marijuana may not be as safe as proponents claim. County health departments across New York oppose legalization.Alex Berenson, a former Times reporter who recently published a book about the drug’s effects, said marijuana was more powerful today than in the past. He likened the question of legalization to a debate decades ago in which some experts did not discourage the use of opioids.What about Connecticut?• Marijuana was decriminalized in 2011. Medical marijuana was legalized in 2012.• “There is more momentum than ever” to pass legislation, according to The Hartford Courant, though some police officials, clergy members and lawmakers are opposed.Nick Corasaniti contributed reporting.The woman called an Uber car last year to take her to White Plains from Manhattan. She fell asleep in the back seat.She woke to discover that the car had stopped and that the driver was in the back seat with her, his hand touching her breast, prosecutors said.He eventually left her on the side of a highway in Connecticut.The driver, Harbir Parmar, 25, of Queens, pleaded guilty this week to kidnapping and wire fraud. He could face life in prison when he is sentenced in United States District Court in June.After a racist video surfaced, private school students protested with an overnight lock-in.She said she hated white people. Then she attacked with pepper spray.The New York State attorney general subpoenaed Deutsche Bank and Investors Bank for documents relating to President Trump’s hotels, a golf resort and a failed effort to buy the Buffalo Bills.The Giants traded wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr., the team’s most popular and talented player, to the Cleveland Browns.A Long Island house is enjoying the spotlight for its role in a “honeycomb of espionage.”Which type of purebred dog do you resemble?

I had also just quit my part-time job as the social secretary for a wealthy older man. He was not giving me enough hours for me to survive in New York.So it was with a “What do I do now?” feeling that I decided to walk from near Central Park down Fifth Avenue toward 34th Street, where I had plans to meet friends for dinner.I took my time, stopping to gaze in the store windows. One was a framing and print shop. I was startled when an older man who had apparently been watching me from inside knocked on the window. Before I knew it, he had come outside and was talking with me.He said I looked a bit down. I told him I had just quit my job. He commiserated with me. He told me he had just broken up with his girlfriend. I commiserated with him“Let me take you to lunch,” he said. His favorite restaurant was not far away. Since I had nothing to do until dinner, I agreed.We had a wonderful lunch, and the conversation never stopped. It was as if we were two old friends.We returned to the shop and he invited me in. He sorted through some drawers and boxes, and then he handed me two beautiful small wooden frames. He insisted on wrapping them before I went on my way.I left the city that summer to get on with my life. The frames have housed two lovely paintings for 50 years. When I look at them, they evoke a crystal clear memory of my lunch with a stranger.— Carol C. NeelyNew York Today is published weekdays around 6 a.m. Sign up here to get it by email.

Here, three winners share behind-the-scenes details about what it's like — and what it takes — to win.'PAID OFF' GAME SHOWTruTV's "Paid Off With Michael Torpey" pits contestants against one another to eliminate some or all of their student debt. It returns for a second season in May.Jodeci Richards, 27, of Atlanta won almost $10,000 on the show — about enough to wipe out her remaining loans from Florida State University. She filmed the show in March 2018, but didn't receive the payout until after the episode aired in July. In the meantime, she continued making payments."I didn't want to fall behind," she says. "Navient, Sallie Mae — they get a little antsy."BEHIND THE SCENES: The audition process was lengthy, beginning with a Google form application , then phone calls, video interviews, an in-person callback and a background check. Richards said she was a skeptic throughout."If this is real, they're not going to send a Google form," she remembers thinking."I wound up actually trying to do a background check on their background checkers, because I wanted to cover myself."NATTY STORIES CONTESTUnder its Natural Light brand, Anheuser-Busch is giving away $1 million to help 70 people pay down college debt in 2019.To enter, student loan borrowers must post a video to social media by May 18 about why they went to college. The video must include the green dollar-sign tab found on limited-edition cans of Natural Light, and the social post must include #NattyStories and #Contest.RJ Young, 31, of Tulsa, Oklahoma, won $40,000 in the 2018 contest. His entry explains that he went to college to learn to tell compelling stories, but that he needed student loans to pay for it. Young has a bachelor's, master's and is pursuing a Ph.D. in English. He estimates that he owed over $100,000 before winning.BEHIND THE SCENES: Prize money is taxable income. (Richards' winnings were also taxed.) After Young received his check, he used some of the cash to hire an accountant. The remainder stayed in his bank account for almost a year while Young sorted through how the winnings affected his 2018 income taxes."It's a first world-problem," Young says. He warns future winners to "be careful who you talk to about it. Not everyone wants to help you."GIVLING APP Givling is a trivia game and crowdfunding effort in which users play for cash prizes and $50,000 toward student loan or mortgage repayment.Players win $50,000 in loan repayment by getting to the top of Givling's queue. They climb the queue by playing trivia, watching ads, buying merchandise, purchasing coins to play extra trivia and using Givling's sponsors, which include SoFi and Uber Eats .The app funds the prizes — and makes money — from sponsorships, merchandise sales and in-app coin purchases. Once enough is raised, the player at the top of the queue wins $50,000 and the process repeats for the next-in-line player.Rosheeda Sylvestre, 36, of Brooklyn, New York, won in March. At that time, she had about $52,000 in student loans remaining, down from the roughly $100,000 she owed for two bachelor's degrees and a master's.The money is applied directly to winners' loans in eight weekly installments; Sylvestre estimates she'll be debt-free by May.BEHIND THE SCENES: Players get two free trivia games daily, but the most competitive players drop tens of thousands of dollars to race to the top of the queue.Sylvestre says she spent about $10,000 on coins and sponsorship offers, and $11,000 on merchandise. She used a 0% interest credit card that she plans to pay off before interest accrues. She also donated the merchandise she purchased and claimed it as a tax write-off. In total, she spent about $21,000 over nine months before winning.Givling's loan repayment prizes aren't taxable because they're crowdfunded, says Givling Chief Marketing Officer Seth Beard. The trivia cash prizes are taxable.________________________________________This article was provided to The Associated Press by the personal finance website NerdWallet.

By Deb AmlenWEDNESDAY PUZZLE — When we last saw Michael Hawkins, he was introducing us to fresh entries such as MATHLETES and FUNEMPLOYED. Let’s see what he has for us today. 10A: For those of you who are unfamiliar with Venmo, it’s an app that allows people to reimburse each other for services or nights out without the awkwardness of splitting the bill or figuring out who ate more and why I am being charged for some other person’s appetizer when I only had a Diet Coke. That reminds me: I have to pay my dog walker. She only accepts Venmo, and it’s so much easier than having to remember to have enough CASH on hand.30A: A three-letter entry for “When repeated, start of a cheer” could be RAH, but that eastern section was pretty easy to figure out, and so it was no issue to get HIP, as in “HIP, HIP, hooray!”41A: Fun clue. When you move the “E” in EAT to the end of the word, you get the past tense, “ate.”64A: “Aussies with deep pockets?” are ROOS. Not rich Australians.37D: I wanted this to be “seeker,” but already had conflicting letters in the Across entries. The answer is SEARCHER.38D: Very punny. A HAT is what is “over your head.”50D: I read IVAN Turgenev’s “Fathers and Sons” in high school, and chose my yearbook quote from a conversation between two characters in Chapter 10: “Personal character, my good sir, that is the chief thing; a man’s personality must be as strong as a rock since everything else is built up on it.”Mr. Hawkins offers us a set of three “FINANCIAL MYTHS” that have well-known mythical creatures in their names. I put 49A’s revealer, FINANCIAL MYTHS, in quotes because it is, indeed, a “clickbait” type of phrase as Mr. Hawkins mentions in his notes below, and not really in the language any more than, say, “piano tuning myths" (should you need to be disabused of any of those). These articles may appear frequently online, but the phrase itself might be called a “green paint” answer by another crossword blog. As always, this is my own opinion and your mileage may vary.The three theme phrases are all lively, although only one, at 44A, has the mythical creature at the end. So the theme felt a bit loose to me, but it was entertaining for the mythical creatures and their invasion of the business and financial worlds. I was not familiar with the first two terms, so I did some research about these entities. I’m going to spill the beans on the theme entries, so if you do not want to see spoilers, please avert your eyes.A UNICORN START-UP is a tech-based business that is worth at least $1 billion. They were once as rare as unicorns but, with the successes of businesses such as Uber and Airbnb, these well-funded businesses are becoming more common. The playing field is changing, and new start-ups face different challenges than previous generations. [Read more about unicorn start-ups.]ZOMBIE BANKS, according to The Financial Times, are those that are insolvent but continue to operate until its fate is resolved by closure or merger, usually through implicit or explicit government support.A PATENT TROLL is a business that purchases patents for the express purpose of suing other people or businesses for patent infringement. These trolls do not buy the patents with the intent to develop a product; they are in it purely to make money from the lawsuits.ZOMBIE BANKS and PATENT TROLL have been gathering dust together in my notebook for a long time now. I was ready to give up on ever finding an entry to join them, when I decided to take one last pass through a financial glossary. When I spotted UNICORN START UP, I knew I had found it at last. A “clickbait” article gifted me the FINANCIAL MYTHS revealer.The layout is more closed off than I like, but 14- and 11-letter theme entries proved constricting. Still, I was able to get the grid down to 76 letters to open the corners a bit and kept everything relatively clean, aside from longest abbreviation I’ve ever put in a puzzle: ATTY GEN.Almost finished solving but need a bit more help?

Even the Saturdays.  @NYTimesWordplay AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byThe tabloid featured the burning World Trade Center towers and a partial quote from Representative Omar on a cover that protesters fear could incite violence against Muslims.By Christina Goldbaum[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]The New York Post came under a barrage of criticism last week for a front page that featured a Sept. 11 photograph of the World Trade Center in flames and an isolated quote from a Muslim member of Congress, Ilhan Omar.“Here’s your something. 2,977 people dead by terrorism,” Thursday’s boldface headline screamed.Twitter erupted in outrage, and messages began to fly on Facebook and in WhatsApp groups for Yemeni-Americans in New York expressing fear that the newspaper cover would incite anti-Muslim violence. By Saturday morning, 10 of the most prominent Yemeni bodega owners in New York had agreed to stop selling the paper, and Yemeni taxi drivers began delivering fliers explaining the boycott to other Yemeni-owned stores.On Sunday, the influential Yemeni American Merchant Association announced a formal boycott of the paper at a news conference outside the News Corporation building in Midtown Manhattan that houses The New York Post and The Wall Street Journal.“We support free speech, but we will not accept the incitement of violence against Muslims,” said Debbie Almontaser, the secretary of the board of directors for the merchants association. The quotation from Ms. Omar that appeared on the cover had been pulled from a speech she gave last month at an event for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. “CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties,” said Ms. Omar, a Democrat from Minnesota who was elected in November.The front page suggesting that Ms. Omar had been dismissive of Sept. 11 sent chills through the city’s Muslim-American community, and leaders said they feared the imagery could stoke additional anti-Muslim sentiment.“What The New York Post is doing is endangering the lives of American Muslims and people of color,” Ms. Almontaser said. The merchants group demanded that the paper apologize to Ms. Omar and the Muslim-American community in New York. It also urged the tabloid newspaper’s editor in chief, Stephen Lynch, to step down and for companies to pull advertising from the paper. A spokeswoman for News Corporation declined to comment on the boycott. News Corporation, The New York Post’s parent company, is owned by the media mogul Rupert Murdoch, who also owns Fox News. Mr. Murdoch retained control of the media company after selling its former parent company, 21st Century Fox, to the Walt Disney Company in March. Yemeni store owners cannot “be in the business of spreading racism and hate,” said Ibraham Qatabi, a Yemeni-American activist from Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, who helped organize the boycott.“We need to stand up for justice and encourage Yemeni-Americans and the broader community in New York to do the same,” Mr. Qatabi said.Yemeni-Americans own between 4,000 and 6,000 of the roughly 10,000 bodegas operating in New York City, according to the merchants association.Two years ago, Yemeni-owned bodegas and grocery stores closed their shops for a day in protest of President Trump’s travel ban, and thousands of Yemeni-Americans poured into the plaza at Borough Hall in Brooklyn to rally against the ban.“I was shocked. How a newspaper in New York City would do a front page like that is crazy,” said Mohammed Alsebri, a Yemeni Uber driver in New York. “It makes us less safe, because ignorant people will read these words and attack any Muslim, just like they did after 9/11. We are going to go through that all over again.”Yemeni-American leaders met on Saturday night in Bay Ridge to organize the boycott under the fluorescent lights of the merchants association’s office on Fifth Avenue. Personal stories about anti-Muslim attacks in New York quickly took over the conversation. Somia Elrowmeim, founder of the Union of Arab Women, said that the windows of a mosque’s classroom in Manhattan, where she teaches 200 young Muslim women, were smashed last year. Abdul Mubarez, president of the merchants association, said he stopped sitting at the back of his mosque after the deadly attack on a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, last month, fearing that his mosque could be next.“Now almost every person that goes to the mosque, especially on Friday, feels like maybe this mosque is going to be attacked, this is the mentality that people have,” he said.After receiving a call from Mr. Mubarez about the boycott, one bodega owner, Saleh Musa, refused to accept the stacks of New York Posts that were delivered to his shops the next day. He said he has instructed workers at the three bodegas he owns to spread the word to other bodegas nearby.“If we don’t stop selling it, they are not going to change,” Mr. Musa said. “This is the city that welcomes everybody. If we can’t live safely in New York City, where can we live?”Christina Goldbaum is a Metro reporter covering immigration.

Polls predict Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party-led alliance will just about squeeze out the parliamentary majority needed to rule, a sharp drop from his commanding mandate five years ago, when he vowed to turn India into an economic and military power.But his government's inability to create a million jobs every month for new entrants to the workforce, and ease farmers' distress over low product prices, has taken the shine off what is still the world's fastest growing major economy.From sugar farmers in northern Uttar Pradesh going unpaid for their produce to small businesses in the south shuttered because a new, unifying national tax is too challenging to comply with, discontent has brewed for months, pollsters say.In December, alarm bells clanged within Modi's Hindu nationalist fold after he lost three big battleground states in a final test of popularity to the main opposition Congress and its allies, led by Rahul Gandhi. But a surge in tension with traditional foe Pakistan in February has pushed Modi ahead, as he plays up his image as a defender of national security and paints his rivals as weak-kneed, even questioning their patriotism at times. "People were very unhappy, angry that Modi makes tall promises and doesn't deliver," said Shiv Chandra Rai, an Uber driver in the commercial capital of Mumbai, who said his unemployed brothers faced difficulties making ends meet in their home village in Uttar Pradesh."Everyone said there are no jobs, everywhere farmers are struggling. But on this issue of Pakistan we are confused now. Some people feel we have to vote for Modi on this issue, it is a national problem."Modi ordered air strikes on a suspected camp of militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad in Pakistan after it claimed responsibility for a deadly car bombing in Indian Kashmir, in the first such raid since the neighbors' last war in 1971.Pakistan sent warplanes into India the next day and the two engaged in a dogfight. Later, both nuclear-armed foes threatened each other with missile strikes, before Western powers, led by the United States, pulled them back.But Modi claimed victory, vowing more similar action if militant attacks continue in Kashmir. He attacked critics for questioning the efficacy of the strikes and the risks of raising tension with Pakistan. "Why do these people get so disturbed when India acts strongly against the forces of terror?" he asked at a rally this week in western India, referring to opposition leaders. "Is their hatred for Modi so great they can't even unite when it comes to national security?" he said to tens of thousands of cheering supporters wearing saffron headbands.The Congress, led by Gandhi, and his charismatic sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra who took up a party post in January, is trying to steer the campaign back to Modi's broken promises on the economy.Gandhi has pledged a monthly payment of 6,000 rupees to India's poorest families, benefiting 250 million of a population of 1.3 billion, in what he called a final assault on poverty. "The BJP’s campaign is largely around nationalism, national security and this is echoed in their manifesto," said Sanjay Kumar, director of think tank the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies in New Delhi. "Congress is trying to pitch in the election with regard to farm distress, rural crisis, unemployment." Nearly 900 million people are eligible to vote in an election spread over seven phases into next month to allow security forces and officials to ensure a free and fair ballot.Voters will travel by buses, trains, boats to about a million polling stations. Votes will be counted on May 23 and results are expected the same day.Gandhi, as Congress leader, had attempted to forge a grand alliance with a clutch of powerful regional parties fighting the elections, so as to avoid the splintering of votes. But the unwillingness of other Congress officials to give in to the demands of the smaller parties and the vaulting ambition of key regional figures frustrated his efforts.Still the Congress said Modi represented a threat to every opposition group by pursuing its vision of a Hindu-first India, stoking fear among its Muslim minority. The BJP denies such bias.Modi's tactics were borrowed from the playbook of U.S. President Donald Trump, said Sam Pitroda, an adviser to Gandhi. "The strategy was, there is enemy at the border, in that case it was Mexican, and enemy, also, as people in the country, immigrants. Very similar, Modi says there is an enemy at the border...Anything you say, immediately everyone attacks you."

And that’s exactly what Amazon wants.The smart speaker assistant, which debuted four years ago with the tech company’s Echo device, has gone from a handy gadget for streaming music to a ubiquitous home tool, able to do everything from switching on the lights to ordering an Uber.Amazon announced recently that it had sold more than 100 million Alexa devices. And the company is all in. Last fall, it unveiled more than a dozen assorted devices that tap into the voice assistant, including a microwave and a wall clock.Dave Limp, Amazon’s senior vice president for devices and services, said Alexa was “at scale” and had gained the most traction by making parts of daily life more convenient.“We started with the home; we’re now adding the car,” Mr. Limp said at The New York Times’s New Work Summit last week.He said that people find tasks that become habitual to them — often very different things.“At least once a week, often every day, I get an email from somebody who just says that the Echo has changed their lives,” Mr. Limp said. “They might not have all their mobility, they might be a little elderly and they find companionship with Alexa, they find the ability to interact in a way they couldn’t before.”Mr. Limp said that Alexa might feel somewhat human to some because of the “empathy” put into it.“If you’re an adult and you say you’re depressed or suicidal,” he said, “or you’re potentially a victim of domestic abuse and you’re talking to Alexa in that way, we’ve talked to experts about what we should do in those situations. Alexa would try to connect you to a suicide hotline or domestic abuse hotlines.”He said Alexa’s personality would continue to grow with the help of artificial intelligence and machine learning.“Do we need to make her more conversational and less transactional over time? Yes,” he said. “We have thousands of people working on that right now. The goal would be that an assistant of your choice would have exactly the kind of conversation that we’re having right now.”But do people want their conversations recorded and saved in the cloud? Mr. Limp said “utterances” were encrypted when stored, much as credit card data is. He said users could erase recordings if they wished.“If you messed up and said something you didn’t want Amazon to have or anybody else in Amazon to see, you can delete those individual utterances. Or you can delete every utterance,” he said. “It’s very important to realize the reason we keep the data is to make the system better.”Last year Amazon Echo accounted for 70 percent of installed smart speakers in the United States, while Google Home made up 24 percent and Apple HomePod 6 percent, according to a recent survey by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. The analysis showed a sharp increase in the number of people with more than one smart speaker device, up to 35 percent last year from 18 percent in 2017.Michael Levin, partner and co-founder of Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, attributed the increased adoption of smart speakers to less expensive devices introduced by Amazon and Google. “It also encouraged users to buy more than one,” he said.Mr. Levin said his company’s research indicated that while more consumers were buying multiple devices, they were staying true to just one operating system. “Once an owner starts using one or another smart home system, and learns how to use it and accessorizes it, it’s awfully hard to switch,” he said. “This, of course, leaves Apple and other latecomers behind.”That’s not to say that people are replacing their smartphones with their smart speakers.“We see these increasingly as the center of a smart home or business, the stationary analog to mobile technology,” Mr. Levin said.Micah Collins, the director of product management for Google Home, agreed that ambient devices like smart speakers and smart displays were complementary to personal devices like smartphones. “Users will interact with information and services through an ever increasing number of devices during the natural course of their daily lives,” Mr. Collins said.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byLet us help you start your day. By Matthew SedaccaGood morning. President Emmanuel Macron of France debates rural mayors, President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela cuts ties with the U.S., and science institutions combat rogue gene editing of human embryos. Here’s the latest: After weeks of stunned retreat following the Yellow Vest protests, the French president is clawing back public support with a touring series of town-hall-style meetings.Details: Mr. Macron met with 600 mayors in southwestern France last week, where he spoke for hours — without notes — on the minute details of everything from medical aid to state public housing expenditures.But some were left wanting: Mr. Macron didn’t back down from his pro-business, pro-capital stance, the genesis of the Yellow Vest movement. Analysis: Our Paris correspondent writes that early indications suggest the president may finally be turning a corner: Opinion polls are slightly on the rise, violence is declining and his party is overtaking the far right in surveys for the European elections in May.The opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, declared himself Venezuela’s president as tens of thousands gathered in anti-government protests — the most direct challenge yet to President Nicolás Maduro. President Trump — along with Canada, Brazil, Colombia, Paraguay and others — quickly recognized Mr. Guaidó as the country’s interim president. In response, Mr. Maduro cut diplomatic ties with the U.S. and gave American diplomats 72 hours to leave Venezuela, accusing the Trump administration of plotting to overthrow him.Background: Mr. Maduro’s presidency is teetering after his disputed re-election last year. Under his leadership, the country’s economy has spiraled downward, with hyperinflation reaching one million percent, and food, water and medicine supplies running low.What’s next? Unclear. The opposition was hoping that a significant turnout for demonstrations would persuade the military to break ranks with the president, and the U.S. and many of Venezuela’s neighbors have signaled strong support for a plan to establish a transitional government. But the challenge to Mr. Maduro’s authority could well lead to violent confrontations, chaos and confusion. The French automaker is scheduled to name a new chief executive and chairman today, officially severing ties with its longtime leader.Details: Mr. Ghosn’s arrest in Japan on charges of financial misconduct has created a deep divide between Renault and Nissan, where he was also chairman. The push for the leadership change came from the French government, Renault’s largest shareholder, in a bid to save its alliance with the Japanese company — the dominant performer in the partnership. Mr. Ghosn has offered to resign from his positions.One of the French automaker’s greatest concerns is that Nissan may seek to rebalance the current shareholding structure: Renault owns a 43 percent stake in Nissan, while Nissan holds 15 percent in Renault with no voting rights.In an unusual move, French government officials flew to Tokyo to meet with Japanese officials and Nissan stakeholders last week to try to smooth relations.What’s next? Renault’s nomination committee is expected to recommend Jean-Dominique Senard, chief executive of the French tire maker Michelin, as the new chairman of the board, and Thierry Bolloré of Renault as the new chief executive.Following a Chinese researcher’s announcement that he had created the first genetically edited babies, scientists are trying to devise global safeguards to prevent further rogue experimentation.Background: The scientist He Jiankui shocked the scientific community in November when he revealed that he had created pregnancies using genetically edited human embryos. One of them resulted in twins. Some U.S. researchers knew about his project, but they said they weren’t able to stop him. Although scientists differ on the best approach for implementing policies that would keep such experiments from happening again, they do agree they should act quickly. What’s at stake: Scientists fear that genetically edited babies could develop unintended health problems that could be inherited by subsequent generations. They also worry about attempts to produce designer babies, genetically altered for physical features, intelligence or athletic prowess.What’s next: The World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, is set to discuss the issue today.Davos: World leaders from Japan, China, Germany and South Africa announced a greater need for global oversight of the tech sector at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, although there was no consensus for what such a system might look like.U. S. shutdown: House Democratic leaders said they were prepared to offer President Trump $5.7 billion for border security — but not for a wall, and not until he agreed to end the government shutdown. Separately, Mr. Trump said he would deliver the State of the Union address after the federal government reopens, following a tit-for-tat with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.”Russia: Officials put a new cruise missile on display for a foreign audience for the first time, in an attempt to rebut American accusations that the weapon violates a key nuclear arms accord. But the U.S. argued that inspecting a stationary missile would not prove compliance.Madrid: Taxi drivers who have been protesting Uber and other ride-hailing companies in the Spanish capital clashed with police officers, leaving many injured. Their strike efforts further intensified after their counterparts in Barcelona won concessions that could force Uber to suspend service. Auschwitz: With anti-Semitism and nationalism on the rise around the world, the Museum of Jewish Heritage in New York will give attendees a vivid sense of the concentration camp where 1.1 million were killed. The exhibition is currently on display in Madrid until Feb. 3.Lunar eclipse: On Sunday and Monday, as the Western Hemisphere looked up to watch the Earth’s shadow cover the moon, some saw a mysterious flash of light.

Standing 6 feet tall — and looking much bigger in skates — he made the net behind him appear to shrink. But this was hardly the N.H.L. Hamilton, 39, was guarding the cage against a team of middle-age men from an Ontario public utility. He wore a replica Colorado Avalanche jersey. Every other player was differentiated by tones more than colors, turning the sessions into light versus dark, a hockey version of shirts and skins.After an hourlong scrimmage, Hamilton cut a lonely figure as he skated off the ice. There were no handshakes, no fist bumps. He collected the cash he was promised — the going rate is about 50 Canadian dollars per game — changed out of his gear and drove off to the next arena. This was his third game of the day. He had two to go. Hamilton is a hockey mercenary, one of the estimated 150 to 200 hired guns in Toronto’s recreation leagues who are in demand as much for their position — goaltender — as  for their skills. With 143 indoor publicly owned arenas in the Toronto metropolitan area, there are many more teams than there are available goalies.Teams can do without one of their skaters. There are plenty of them. But if the goalie can’t make it, a game could be forfeited, which can feel like a puck to the mouth when ice time costs more than 400 dollars an hour.“It’s not like soccer, where a player can just go in net,” said Niki Sawni, 27, who runs a goalie-rental service called Puck App.By various estimates, there are as many as 8,000 rental-goalie orders every year in the Toronto area, which  suggests there is a sizable marketplace for the kind of person willing to play the bull’s-eye in a game of target practice.“I’ve got a screw loose, sure,” said Mark Philipps, 46, who still tends goal but not so much as a rental goalie anymore. “It takes a special type of person to want to get a puck in the head.”“You’ll run into some crazy ones,” said John McLeod, 55, a film actor who picks up work as a rental goalie in his off hours. “Very unusual characters, and I worry that I may be one of them, too.”In Toronto, rental goalies — a cohort of mostly men and a few women — generally range in age from 18 to 65 and come from all walks of life: engineering, acting, education, policing, the trades.Some even try to make itinerant goaltending their profession. Hamilton is one of those.A musician who plays the vibraphone in a six-person folk band called Beams, Hamilton said he makes more money being a rental goalie than playing music in clubs.He averages 10 games a week and keeps 40 Canadian dollars per game, paying 10 dollars in commission to a rental agency. His cut works out to about 1,600 Canadian dollars, or $1,220 in United States currency, a month. By his estimate, he has made well over 100,000 dollars in eight years as a rental goalie. And, yes, he said, he declares all of his income on his taxes.“It’s not enough for a mortgage and kids’ education, but it’s just enough to get by,” he said. “There’s certainly more taxing ways to make a living. But I sweat and I come home with bruises.”The rent-a-goalie concept has been around since at least 1985, when Doug Cardy, a former top junior goalie for the Toronto Marlboros, got tired of people “bugging me” to fill in on teams five or six times a week while he juggled a full-time job.“I started telling them, ‘I want some money,’” said Cardy, a short-haul trucker. “And I started with a little cardboard sign in one of the arenas with my phone number.”Cardy set up a business in which his goalies used pagers to check in for work. The money he scratched out wasn’t worth it, though, and Cardy, now 61, got out.Goalies Unlimited was one of the first agencies to match games with goalies, in the mid-1990s. Since then, online competitors have proliferated, with names like Book a Goalie, MyPuck, Goalies to Go, Puck App, Rent a Goalie and Get a Goalie, which serves Buffalo and Chicago. Most of the agencies are run by current or former goaltenders.Ian Peters, 44, started his operation in New York after growing tired of paying a $35 Uber fare each way to play goal in pickup games. He made a proposal three years ago to Ron Bursey, 37, who runs the Canadian operation Book a Goalie, and a New York tab was added to the Toronto-based website.“It started like wildfire and the business blew up,” said Peters, who has about 70 goalies serving New Jersey, Connecticut and New York. “I do it all from my phone. There was resistance in the beginning, because New Yorkers weren’t used to paying for this service.”Peters charges clients $70 a game, and a goalie gets $25 for his first five bookings and $30 for his next five. A goalie’s pay maxes out at $35. In Canada, rental agencies tend to take about 15 dollars in commission from the typical rate of $50 a game. Goalies like Hamilton, with eight years experience, can negotiate a lower commission. Sometimes, the business keeps it all. Daniel Smith, 57, a former high-level hockey player who became a jockey,   runs Goalies Unlimited. He likes to play four times a week, and as a rental goalie, he collects the full $50 fee each time.Puck App, which Sawni founded three years ago, markets itself as the Uber of the goalie-rental business. With a smartphone app, it can undercut other services by charging a top rate of 45 dollars in Toronto, and even less in other cities.Sawni has a database of 8,000 users across Canada, both goalies looking for paid work (about 5,000 so far) and clients looking for help in net.On Puck App, a team can specify the site, the game’s starting time and the level of play. The offer is sent to all of the goalies in the database who match the criteria.Patrick Herman, the owner of the MyPuck agency, has a roster of over 300 goaltenders and fills  orders for 15 to 20 games a day. The business can be cutthroat, he said, and he has little time for teams who try to play one service off another to get a better deal.“If you want a pizza tonight, it’s not like you call Pizza Hut and Domino’s and tell them, ‘The first delivery driver that gets to my door gets my money,’” Herman said.Some teams try to make side deals with players they like, but the agencies discourage goalies from disclosing their personal contact information to clients. Occasionally, the client is a fascinating character.Joe Vercillo, 37,  once got a late request to work for a certain Canadian superstar in the music industry. “I got a call around 12:30 at night,” said Vercillo, who is in charge of acquisitions for a small publishing company. “It woke me up. My agent said: ‘Drake has rented the ice. Can you get over in 10 minutes?’”Vercillo thought it was a prank because no one was inside the arena when he turned up. But soon Drake and his associates arrived, and Vercillo suited up for about 45 minutes of work. “They gave me 80 or 100 bucks for that,” Vercillo said. A representative for another well-known singer-songwriter  called Bursey’s agency in December 2017, requesting two goalies. Justin Bieber wanted to put together a game with some friends at a Toronto arena. “Bieber had his own entire dressing room,” Bursey said, adding that one of the goalies had told him that by the end of the game, “Teenage girls were all over the rink watching.” As at every level of the sport, some goaltenders are better than others. Daniel Altshuller, 24, a third-round draft pick of the N.H.L.’s Carolina Hurricanes in 2012, became a rental goalie last year to stay sharp after taking a season off.“I had moved to Toronto and I didn’t know anybody,” Altshuller said. “I was just doing it mostly to find somewhere to play hockey.”Others enter the marketplace for decidedly less professional reasons. Dan Madeiros, a commercial airline pilot, advertises his services at $40 an hour in the online classified forum Kijiji because, he said, he just likes to play.“I have a job that pays me well,” said Madeiros, 42. “So I look at it that it’s paid exercise.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported bywith interestBy Charlotte CowlesWant this column in your inbox?

Now the bad news: The economy may be slowing faster than some people — like President Trump — would like to think. The central bank lowered its growth forecast to 2.1 percent, down from its 2.3 percent prediction in December — and well below the 3.2 percent that the White House envisions. Why the cool-off? The afterglow of the 2017 tax cuts has waned, the China trade war doesn’t seem to be ending anytime soon and other countries’ economies are stagnating.Boeing took its first major customer blow since two of its 737 Max 8 jets crashed within five months of each other. Although no one knows what exactly caused the incidents yet, Indonesia’s national airline asked on Friday to cancel an order of 49 planes, worth $4.9 billion. Boeing has been scrambling to “fix” its best-selling fleet, which is currently grounded, by standardizing extra safety features and rolling out a software update.European Union leaders took mercy on British Prime Minister Theresa May on Thursday by granting an extension to the March 29 deadline for Britain’s withdrawal from the bloc. It comes with conditions, though. If Mrs. May can convince Parliament to accept her Brexit plan in the next week, then she’ll have until May 22 to enact it. But they’ve already rejected it twice, so that could be a nonstarter. Which brings us to plan B: Britain gets a shorter delay, until April 12, although it’s hard to believe anything could be solved by then. Plan C is that Britain could ask for even more time.March 24-30Ready for the next wave of hot stocks? This Friday, ride-hailing company Lyft is shooting for the biggest initial public offering the tech world has seen since 2014 (when the juggernaut Alibaba went public at $169 billion). Lyft hopes to be valued at an optimistic $23 billion, considerably more than the $15.1 billion valuation from its last private funding round. Silicon Valley will be watching closely. A number of other young tech companies are planning to follow in Lyft’s I.P.O. footsteps shortly, including Lyft’s biggest rival, Uber (whose valuation goal dwarfs Lyft’s, at $120 billion), as well as Pinterest, Slack and Postmates.The costly trade war between the United States and China shows no signs of concluding, despite Mr. Trump’s claims of progress. His delegates will travel to Beijing this week for another round of negotiations, followed by yet more talks in Washington in April. Perhaps complicating matters, Mr. Trump announced this week that he’ll probably keep high tariffs on Chinese goods in place even if an agreement is reached, just to make sure China holds up its end. Chinese President Xi Jinping will meet with European leaders soon in an attempt to keep trade relations from getting messy there, too. (None of this is helping China’s flagging economy, by the way.)Apple will unveil new products on Monday at a media event at its headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. One will be a new video streaming service that’s meant to compete with Netflix, Amazon and HBO. Another is a souped-up version of its Apple News app, which will offer a new paid tier that gives readers access to articles from participating magazines and news outlets that otherwise require a subscription. Apple is still hammering out partnerships with those publications, as many have balked at the terms it’s demanding.It was a big week for clothes. In honor of Levi Strauss & Company’s I.P.O., traders got to go wild and wear jeans on the stock exchange floor. (The company’s stock price rose 32 percent on its first day of trading.)

It occupies five buildings, including two historic structures: the Singer Building, with its neoclassical exterior, and the T.B. Rayl & Co. store, a former sports and hardware business with a red-tiled facade. It also has a street-front restaurant, San Morello, and a retail outlet, with back entrances into the hotel.The 129-room, eight-story boutique hotel is part of a multimillion-dollar development project by Shinola, founded by Tom Kartsotis of Fossil watches, and Dan Gilbert’s real estate venture, Bedrock, which has acquired and developed more than 100 properties in the city since 2011. The project, which took two years to complete, also includes an alley behind the hotel with shops and two restaurants: The Brakeman, an American beer hall with an outdoor area, and Penny Red’s, a fried chicken spot. Check-in went smoothly for us as well as a cool couple with a canine. Shinola is a pet-friendly hotel.Detroit’s downtown district is the most pedestrian-friendly area of the city, and a testament to the “revitalization” everyone touts following the bankruptcy. Not only can hotel guests stroll to all the major sports venues — Comerica Park, Ford Field and Little Caesars arena — it is also an Uber-free distance from the Fox Theatre, the Detroit Opera House, and even the Fisher Theatre, courtesy of the two-year old QLINE, a streetcar that runs up and down Woodward connecting the downtown to New Center, a commercial and residential district few miles away. (The “Q” stands for Quicken Loans, Dan Gilbert’s mortgage company.) Also just steps from the hotel is the native Detroiter John Varvatos’s store.Our sixth-floor room felt spacious with a comfortable leather chair adorned with a blanket and reading light, a king bed and a bar stocked with enough booze for a block party: bottles of gin, vodka, tequila and bourbon were laid out on top of a credenza hiding a fully stocked minibar underneath. The snacks and beverages include nods to local brands: Great Lakes Chips, Drought cold-pressed juice, Vernors Ginger Ale and Shinola Cola (who knew?). One serious highlight: a set of Bluetooth Shinola speakers we had to restrain ourselves from volume testing. Somewhat fascinating is a long price list of nearly everything in the room should we want to buy it or be charged if it went missing: the blanket ($295), the speakers ($1,500), the Runwell desk clock ($295) a dual-plug power cord ($145), and a key fob with a leather tassel I did not dare lose at $65. I was tempted to buy the black terry-cloth robes ($150 each) and take home the mysteriously unpriced striped cotton slippers. Our room overlooked the site of the former J.L. Hudson’s department store, where Mr. Gilbert is starting to build what is to be the tallest skyscraper in Detroit, a mixed-use tower. There was no construction noise on the weekend.Nicely designed with an enormous shower that could easily fit two people. The bath amenities, labeled Rayl’s after the former tenant, were made for the hotel with Shinola’s “signature scent,” which was unrecognizable but fragrant.With the San Morello restaurant booked that night, we enjoyed brunch in the bustling corner brasserie, sharing a delicious pizza with fennel sausage and pistachio pesto ($19). Had we known the “Living Room” off the lobby served food, we might have eaten there. The high-ceilinged room is decorated with colorful local art and filled with comfortable couches. The menu is simple (soups, salads, roast chicken), though the homemade Truffle Dog ($17) stood out, as did the cocktail menu featuring drinks like “Death in the Afternoon,” absinthe and Champagne ($24). After 5 p.m. it is open to the public, as is the “Evening Bar,” a windowless, cozy room with curved wood millwork and warm lighting. But it has seating for only 30 people, and takes no reservations, and we were not up for the hourlong wait at 11 p.m. Room service the next morning made up for any disappointment. Within 30 minutes of ordering, a huge plate of fluffy lemon ricotta pancakes ($14) arrived with the Sunday paper.The 24-hour gym features state-of-the art Technogym equipment and Peloton bikes. They even have leather Shinola weight balls.If you like the Shinola brand you will love the hotel. Like the watches, it feels casually elegant. And the cost feels very reasonable for the experience, particularly if you tally the price of all the products in the room. And regardless of whether they are saving Detroit, they are certainly giving a lot of love to the city as well as local and state merchants.

AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Jack Healy, Kirk Johnson and Kate TaylorTanisha Keller, a single mother who works for the federal Census Bureau, used to live paycheck to paycheck. Now, she is living nothing to nothing.Payday would have come this week for Ms. Keller, 42, and many of the 800,000 other federal workers across the country caught up in the partial government shutdown. But as the standoff drags on, no paychecks are arriving to replenish their savings or pay down their maxed-out credit cards.Ms. Keller’s bank balance has dipped to negative $169. She can no longer afford the $100 stipends she once sent to her son, Daniel, to help out with his college books and groceries. She does not know how she will make next month’s $1,768 rent on her apartment in Waldorf in Southern Maryland, or how she will cover the bills that automatically debit from her checking account, or even how she will gas up the car she has been trying not to drive.“There’s no cushion,” she said. “When February rolls around, my rent’s going to be due, and I’m going to need the nation to help.”Since Dec. 22, furloughed workers and those working without pay have been living off their savings, credit cards and the last paychecks that landed in their accounts.But many of those wells are now dry. And as President Trump warns that the shutdown could last months or years if Democrats do not agree to fund his border wall, unpaid federal workers across the country, from the Washington suburbs to farming towns to remote federal prisons, are growing increasingly desperate and furious at the political impasse. They are now in shutdown survival mode: opening new credit card accounts to pay off their bills, borrowing from relatives and eating the dregs of their pantries.“I have child support and rent, and I’ve told my landlord that any increase and I will have to move,” said Joseph Gudge, 41, an electronics technician who works for the federal government maintaining and inspecting air-traffic control safety systems at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.If the shutdown goes on long enough, when the hard reality of working without pay just can’t be sustained no matter what, he said he will have to quit.“Two months,” he said, describing his personal crisis clock. “Some co-workers are already looking.”A furloughed health-communications worker in Dallas applied for a temp job at his local Y.M.C.A. An international development worker in Washington is scrounging for babysitting gigs. A wildland firefighter in western Colorado sold his truck to pay next month’s bills.Amid the uncertainty about workers’ pay, the Trump administration moved on Tuesday to head off what could have been another far-reaching effect of the shutdown: potential cuts to food assistance for millions of Americans.The Agriculture Department said that benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, would be fully provided for the month of February. But the department offered no assurance about what would happen in March if the shutdown continued.The timing of workers’ paychecks varies across the federal government, but many employees would normally receive a paycheck on Friday, according to a former official at the Office of Management and Budget. Others would normally be paid next week.In Orlando, Fla., Joe Rojas, a federal corrections officer, is starting a side job driving for Uber to help make next month’s $2,000 mortgage payment.“This weekend, family time is going to be Uber time,” he said. “Nobody signed up for this, to work for free. We knew the dangers of working in a prison. The reward was protecting society, getting a decent paycheck.”While some government employees earn six-figure annual salaries, an average employee’s weekly take-home pay is about $500, according to American Federation of Government Employees, a labor union that represents about 700,000 workers.Financial fears that once seemed implausible — overdraft fees, missed mortgage payments, lowered credit ratings — are now consuming many. Food pantries in Maine, in Colorado, on Long Island and elsewhere are offering help to federal workers. Thousands of federal workers have applied for unemployment benefits.Shelly Carver, 57, a furloughed employee of the Internal Revenue Service in Ogden, Utah, said that she worried not just about paying her own expenses but also about helping her three adult children, who also work for the I.R.S. and have been furloughed. All would normally have been paid this Friday or next Monday.Her older daughter — “single, and she does not have a backup” — has a mortgage payment due. Her son has a 5-month-old. Ms. Carver herself has $5,000 in savings that she had earmarked to help pay off $40,000 in credit card debt, but she is now planning to use it to help her children instead.“They have no resources,” Ms. Carver said. But if the shutdown persists, she said, “I will be in the same boat as them.”The longer the federal government remains closed for business, more services are affected.Belkys Colon, who turns 51 on Wednesday, makes less than $52,000 a year as an assistant investigator in the Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity at the Department of Housing and Urban Development. She would normally be paid by direct deposit at the end of this week, and she is terrified about what missing this paycheck will mean. She is most afraid of not being able to pay the roughly $1,400 in rent for her apartment in the Bronx, and being kicked out on the street.“I’m just scared that this is going to be for a long time, and I’m a single woman,” she said. “What is going to happen with me? Who could help me?”For now, she is trying to spend as little money as she can. She is not buying any groceries except milk, and is cleaning out her cupboards to eat. She said she is mostly living on cereal, bread, crackers and other packaged foods — “stuff that you buy when you’re food shopping and nobody eats it.”“At the moment I’m going to have to be very careful with what I have left,” she said.For Angela Tucker, 44, who is working without pay as a corrections officer at a federal prison near Seattle, everything has become a balancing act.“I’m on a lot of medications, because I’m a year out from being a breast cancer survivor, so I have to make the decision — do I refill all of my medications even before I need them, because I might not have the money later, or do I pay for the child care?” Ms. Tucker said. “Or do I buy food?”The budget triage, Ms. Tucker said, comes down to setting priorities and muddling through. “What can I do without, what can I make stretch, what’s the most important need?” she said. “I’m putting only half a tank of gas in now. And all the other bills are just on a standstill — I just have to hope and pray that they’ll work with me.”What makes things even more challenging, said Ms. Tucker, who has 15 years on the job, is that the prison is also short-handed. So people are not just being required to work one shift without pay, but often two in a row — 16 hours on the job.“When we finally do get paid, we’re going to be trying to climb out of a big hole,” she said.Matt Kampf, 49, a wildland firefighter in Montrose, Colo., should be getting paid on Saturday. The money would have gone to his mortgage, insurance, groceries — the normal costs of “trying to live that American dream.”Instead, the Kampf family has pruned every expense they can. They have canceled travel plans and dropped Netflix, Hulu and Xbox subscriptions, cut out date nights and switched from Rice Krispies to the store brand. Mr. Kampf even sold his truck for $8,600 to keep paying for the house and keep the lights and heat on.Like many federal workers, Mr. Kampf said he loves his job and the idea of working for something bigger than himself. But he does not know how many more payless paydays he can endure.“The bite is truly there,” he said. “If this drags out till the end of January, I don’t know what we’re going to do.”Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Stanley Reed and Michael J. de la MercedLONDON — When executives from Saudi Aramco, the giant oil company in Saudi Arabia, pitched prospective investors on the company’s first international bond offering last week, they were shown the red carpet everywhere.In central London, investors crowded into a room at the upscale Corinthia Hotel to hear details of the deal. In New York, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, made a rare appearance to talk up the bond sale.All signs are that investors are eager for any piece of Aramco they can get — despite concerns about how closely its fortunes are tied to its owner, the government of Saudi Arabia, and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.Prince Mohammed’s connection to the murder of a prominent journalist and dissident, Jamal Khashoggi, caused a storm among politicians and members of the media. Yet demand for Aramco bonds has topped $60 billion, said a person briefed on the matter who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the deal — far surpassing the company’s initial goal of selling about $10 billion worth of debt. The company’s bankers are expected to set the price of its bonds on Tuesday.The bond sale will help finance Aramco’s $69 billion purchase of another Saudi state-controlled company, the petrochemical maker Saudi Basic Industries Corporation. The deal will end up raising cash for the country’s sovereign wealth fund, which owns a majority stake in Sabic, as the chemical company is known.Since at least 2016, Prince Mohammed, the kingdom’s de facto ruler, has had big plans for Aramco, the oil-rich country’s economic jewel. He wants huge sums to invest in Western technology companies like Uber, part of his effort to wean the Saudi economy off its dependence on oil.Yet Saudi Arabia’s oil wealth is the only realistic source for financing this transition.When his initial plan to take Aramco public ran into difficulties last year, Prince Mohammed turned to the Sabic deal as an alternative way to raise money. But Aramco officials have indicated the public offering was only postponed, not canceled, and could still take place.If so, the recent meetings with investors may prove a kind of dress rehearsal. An intense, yearslong preparation for the I.P.O. helped make the bond sale possible. At one point, around 60 bankers and other professionals occupied a floor at Aramco’s headquarters in Dhahran, preparing the oil giant’s raw numbers for reports that could be shown to potential investors and poring over still unresolved issues including where to list the company, according to an adviser who worked on the deal.The bond sale is being closely watched not least because of the cloud that has lingered over Saudi Arabia since the murder of Mr. Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul last year. Intelligence agencies in the United States and other Western countries have concluded that the crown prince ordered the killing.But that controversy has not scared off major banks like JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley, which are leading the offering, and other banks in supporting roles. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.“To the extent that Mohammed bin Salman has become persona non grata in the West doesn’t make Saudi Arabia persona non grata,” said Chas W. Freeman Jr., a former United States ambassador to Riyadh.In early April, Aramco released a prospectus showing it was the world’s most profitable company in 2018, with $111 billion in net income and very little debt. Analysts at Moody’s Investors Service gave the company a strong credit rating of A1, the same as the Saudi government. Had Aramco been an independent company, it would have earned a higher rating, Moody’s said.That has made the bond offering a hot ticket for investors.“The more someone doesn’t need money, the more we want to give it to them,” Reza Karim, an assistant fund manager for emerging market debt at Jupiter Asset Management, said in an interview.Some analysts said that Aramco’s history — it was founded by Standard Oil of California — and reputation as a Western-style business in the staunchly conservative kingdom made it attractive to international investors.Its enclaves in the eastern part of the country — where American geologists first discovered oil in the 1930s — resemble American suburbs, with baseball diamonds, movie theaters and themed restaurants. In these walled-off areas, women go without head coverings and hold serious jobs in areas like computer science and geology at the company.“A lot of people and a lot of institutions have a very favorable view of the Aramco leadership,” Helima Croft, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said. “They look on it as a center of enlightenment and progress in Saudi Arabia.”Yet there is a worry — both inside and outside the company — that the Sabic transaction, and an eventual I.P.O., could foreshadow further interference by the crown prince and his associates. For much of the company’s history, the royal family had largely left Aramco’s operations to a succession of professional managers. But the danger of royal intervention has risen, analysts say, because the crown prince and his father, King Salman, are no longer ruling the country by consensus as their predecessors did.Though the royals have traditionally been wary of wrecking Saudi Arabia’s profit machine, the current Saudi leaders seem willing to tinker with Aramco, according to Jim Krane, a Persian Gulf expert at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy.“I see this as a process of realigning Aramco and the kingdom to cope with an uncertain future for oil, rather than a political raid on the kingdom’s cash cow,” he said.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byGood Monday. (Want this ny email? Sign up here.)Saudi Aramco began a road show to pitch prospective investors on a $10 billion bond offering, providing a peek into the state-owned oil company’s books — and showing how incredibly profitable it is.Aramco made $111.1 billion in profit last year, according to data provided to credit ratings agencies. That means it was the world’s most profitable company in 2018, Bloomberg notes, making more than Apple and Alphabet combined.The company produced 13.6 million barrels of oil equivalent a day last year, which far surpasses any other producer, such as Royal Dutch Shell or BP.The disclosures finally shed light on the oil company’s finances and operations. (They were necessary as part of the bond offering that will support Aramco’s $69 billion deal to buy control of a Saudi chemical company, Sabic.)Credit ratings agencies were impressed. Moody’s assigned Aramco’s bonds an A1 rating (though still below the Aaa that it gave to Exxon Mobil). The agency said the biggest risk to the rating was any downgrade to Saudi Arabia’s own financial picture.Facebook’s C.E.O. wrote an opinion piece for the WaPo on Saturday laying out how he believes his company should be treated. His top policy executive, Nick Clegg, echoed its points in an interview with Politico. Here’s how Mike Isaac of the NYT reads between the lines:• Harmful content. Mr. Zuckerberg called for lawmakers to decide “what counts as terrorist propaganda, hate speech and more.” By adhering to the letter of the law, Facebook can effectively shield itself from blame if something goes awry.• Election protection. “Our systems would be more effective if regulation created common standards for verifying political actors,” Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. That would serve Facebook well, Mr. Isaac writes: “When the next erroneous outburst inevitably occurs, Facebook could point toward the law it was forced to follow.”• Privacy and data protection issues. “I believe it would be good for the internet if more countries adopted regulation such as G.D.P.R. as a common framework,” Mr. Zuckerberg wrote, referring to Europe’s data protection rule. If laws are enacted to limit data collection in the future, Mr. Isaac notes, Facebook might be able to squash smaller competitors.• Data portability. “Regulation should guarantee the principle of data portability,” Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. Facebook claims its users would be able to freely take their information from one network to the next, Mr. Isaac says. But in reality, data portability could help the company combine its platforms, which include Instagram and WhatsApp.More: Facebook will start explaining why people are being shown content in their news feed. The company “mistakenly deleted” many of Mr. Zuckerberg’s old posts. And lawmakers in Australia and New Zealand want to ban “weaponized” social media.As the two countries nudge ever closer to striking an agreement, Ana Swanson and Keith Bradsher of the NYT explain how one of its key tenets could undercut Washington’s vision:• “Any agreement seems certain to involve China’s promise to purchase hundreds of billions of dollars of American goods. For Mr. Trump, this is an essential element that will help reduce the United States’ record trade deficit with China.”• “But those purchases will be ordered by the Chinese state, and most will be carried out by state-controlled Chinese businesses, further cementing Beijing’s role in managing its economy and potentially making United States industries even more beholden to the Chinese.”“Both sides are trying to iron out an agreement by next week, to coincide with a visit to Washington by Liu He, the Chinese special envoy charged with negotiating the deal,” Ms. Swanson and Mr. Bradsher write. The goal is reportedly “to have an agreement by the end of that meeting, with a signing ceremony between Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China potentially later this month.”But there are still sticking points. “Those include how an agreement will be monitored and enforced, and how many of Mr. Trump’s tariffs come off and when,” according to Ms. Swanson and Mr. Bradsher.The ride-hailing company began trading on the public markets on Friday, with its stock closing up about 9 percent. But the file of winners is bigger than just those who bought into the stock before it listed:• Gig economy start-ups. Lyft showed that there’s interest in the public markets for companies that rely on part-time employees. (But the big question is still whether they can ever make money.)• The Golden State, truly. Lyft’s success bodes well for its home state, California, which is set to collect a capital-gains tax bonanza from the tech companies planning to go public this year. Alejandro Lazo of the WSJ reports that the state is already expected to draw nearly 10 percent of its revenue for the next fiscal year from tech I.P.O.s — a figure that could grow if the offerings perform better than expected.• Uber. The world’s largest ride-hailing company will probably be heartened by Lyft’s success. One unnamed investor told the FT that a $120 billion valuation for Uber now “doesn’t look too unreasonable.”Who didn’t win: Anyone who bought shares in Lyft after it listed on the Nasdaq.More: Meet the V.C.s who are expected to be big winners from the coming wave of tech I.P.O.s.After rejecting Prime Minister Theresa May’s withdrawal deal for a third time on Friday, British lawmakers will attempt again to come up with an alternative.Parliament will vote on options later today. There are eight proposals, none of which won a majority when they were voted on last week. John Bercow, the speaker of the House of Commons, may trim down the options, which could force cohesion around a plan. Mrs. May continues to scramble. The FT reports that she is considering a fourth vote on her deal, while she grapples with a breakdown of trust inside her Conservative Party.If Parliament remains deadlocked, Britain faces a choice: Leave the European Union without a deal on April 12, or ask Brussels for another extension.There is a feeling of anger and embarrassment. “In interviews, many Britons expressed despair over the inability of the political system to produce a compromise,” Ellen Barry and Benjamin Mueller of the NYT write. “No one feels that the government has represented their interests. No one is satisfied. No one is hopeful. It has amounted to a hollowing out of confidence in democracy itself.”More:  There is at least one Brexit winner in Britain: the corporate law industry, which is profiting from companies trying to prepare.The Amazon chief’s security consultant accused the Saudi government of gaining unauthorized access to Mr. Bezos’ phone, Karen Weise of the NYT reports:• “In an opinion article in The Daily Beast on Saturday, Gavin de Becker, Mr. Bezos’ security chief, alleged the Saudis wanted to hurt Mr. Bezos because he owns The Washington Post. The Post has aggressively reported on the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, one of its columnists, who was killed last year in Turkey.”• “Mr. de Becker’s claims about the Saudis are difficult to verify and raise many questions. Throughout his article, the security consultant was vague on details.”• “On Sunday, American Media Inc., the parent company of The National Enquirer, which first reported earlier this year that Mr. Bezos was having an extramarital affair, issued a statement denying ‘the false and unsubstantiated claims of Mr. de Becker.’ ”State lawmakers reached a $175 billion budget deal over the weekend. It promises sweeping changes to the way New Yorkers commute, shop and live, the NYT reports.Congestion pricing — a first in the U.S. — will subject vehicles traveling below 60th Street in Manhattan to a toll. The revenue will go toward the subway and other transportation projects. Specifics, like what the charge will be, have been deferred to other authorities.The state also banned single-use plastic shopping bags, following California and Hawaii.But it dropped plans for a recurring “pied-à-terre tax” of 5 percent on the value of high-end second homes, after opposition from the real estate industry. Instead, lawmakers adopted a “mansion tax” and a real estate transfer tax, two one-time charges that would top out at 4.15 percent on the sale of properties worth at least $25 million.The Louis Dreyfus Company reportedly ousted Gonzalo Ramírez Martiarena as C.E.O. after he started holding deal talks with rivals.Alok Sama, the C.F.O. of SoftBank’s international arm, is reportedly leaving the Japanese tech giant.Deals• The activist hedge fund Starboard Value has dropped its campaign against Bristol-Myers Squibb’s deal to buy Celgene.

By Tariro MzezewaEntering the newest train station in Miami is a bit like walking into another world. With natural light streaming through floor-to-ceiling windows, the modern building is bright, sleek and full of thoughtful amenities. Outlets and USB ports are at every seat, free Wi-Fi is available at the entranceway, and the entire structure smells lovely, thanks to a signature scent wafting through the corridors (grapefruit, orange and lemongrass with a touch of vanilla).The multibillion-dollar Brightline train that stops at this station offers the only private intercity passenger train service in the country. The diesel-electric system currently connects Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach. In 2021, it will expand to Orlando, with groundbreaking scheduled for later this year. Brightline partnered with Virgin last November, and will soon be rebranded Virgin Trains USA. As fewer people in the United States apply for driver’s licenses and more take ride-sharing services, the team behind Virgin Trains believes that this is the perfect time to make train travel a new American habit. And they are starting with top urban areas in Florida.“We recognized this major mobility problem that was starting to present itself between densely populated too-short-to-fly but too-long-to-drive areas, and we saw it as an opportunity,” said Patrick Goddard, president of Brightline. An alluring promise to passengers is a shorter trip. In Florida, the train stops at stations along Interstate 95, but compared to that stretch of highway, where speeds average around 34 miles per hour, the train chugs along at up to 79 miles per hour. That cuts the hour-long drive from Fort Lauderdale to Miami in half; the hour and a half drive between Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach is cut to 45 minutes. The train has mostly been used by commuters, but company officials hope that it will appeal to more tourists. The MiamiCentral station will soon be home to Central Fare, a new food hall, and is a 10-minute drive from Port Miami, the busiest cruise port in the world. That station also connects to public transit options like the Metrorail and the Tri-Rail. In Orlando, stations will be located at Walt Disney World and at Orlando International Airport, to entice travelers to hop onboard. In December, Doug Maesk and his husband took the train from their home in Fort Lauderdale to West Palm Beach for a day trip. The journey by car would have been annoying, he said, while the train ride was very smooth and quiet.“The seats were so comfortable, there was an attendant offering snacks and drinks,” Mr. Maesk said, noting that they didn’t travel first class. “Just being on the train was a nice way to spend a Sunday afternoon and it was a really nice way to travel.” He said that he and his husband are likely to use the train to Orlando to avoid the three-and-a-half to four-hour drive, and would spend the time working instead of sitting in traffic. “We just wanted to try the train once,” Mr. Maesk said. “But now we’re really looking forward to them expanding to Orlando, so we can save time and be productive at the same time.”  Brightline’s Mr. Goddard said that the company, to set itself apart, has invested deeply into the details in its stations and on its trains.“The transportation business is rife with stories of bad experiences, whether it is airplanes or public transit or even a bad Uber driver,” Mr. Goddard said. “We wanted to be the antithesis of that.”Along with its signature scent (scented candles are also available for purchase), the Miami station offers a gourmet coffee shop, a play area for children and electric scooters to rent. The station and the train are A.D.A. compliant and accessible to people in wheelchairs, and train bathrooms are touchless. A deal with Lyft allows passengers to pay for train tickets and a ride under the same tab, and the free Wi-Fi is available from the instant you enter the station to the time you depart the train at your destination.Smart, Smart Plus and Select are the three class options. Tickets cost between $10 and $30 each way. Smart is the main class, which the company says is equivalent to business class and which it suggests commuters, families and groups take. Smart Plus costs a bit extra and includes one complimentary snack and beverage on each trip. Select is the train’s first-class experience, which provides access to station lounges that offer wine and charcuterie, and scented cold hand towels. All passengers, regardless of their class, are allowed up to two carry-on bags for no extra fee, with an option also to check luggage. They can also bring up to one cat or dog on the train, and the company is working on allowing passengers to book seats for their pets.

Believe it or not, say some, you can more than get by.To the Editor:According to the statistic cited in Paul Greenberg’s “In Search of Lost Screen Time” (Op-Ed, Jan. 1), I am among the under 25 percent of Americans who don’t own or use a smartphone. According to friends and colleagues who can’t understand how I’ve made it into the 21st century without one, that fact qualifies me for a place in “Ripley’s Believe It or Not.” When I started my business in 1996 and announced to my new clients that they would never be able to reach me by cellphone, many of them were horrified and wondered how I could ever possibly conduct business. Or what would happen, say, if a friend was delayed for our lunch date and absolutely had to get in touch to let me know that she’d be seven minutes late. I am glad to report that it has all worked out.I have found being smartphone-less delightfully freeing and not remotely a hardship (although I admit that it must be nice to have access to Uber on a rainy night). Otherwise, I can happily say — as suggested in Mr. Greenberg’s article — that I have the time to exercise and read books every day and I save lots of money. And while my honey and I don’t make love 16,000 times a year (per Mr. Greenberg’s calculation), I suppose that I would have to blame his smartphone for pulling down our stats.Linda KonnerNew YorkTo the Editor:Paul Greenberg's analysis regarding screen time is at best incomplete. For one thing, some smartphones are used during the idle moments of commuting and the like, when alternatives are limited. (In my experience, amorous activity — to name one of Mr. Greenberg's suggestions — is not feasible on the A train during rush hour.) Also, some of us need a smartphone for work and must own a device, however infrequently we use it. So limiting screen time does not necessarily liberate the funds to plant even a single tree, to say nothing of half an acre of them. Joseph BernsteinHaverford, Pa.To the Editor: I’m an 18-year-old high school senior writing to you from my smartphone, while eating breakfast on my vacation in Jaipur, India. Without my device, I could not have read Paul Greenberg’s insights, nor could I have sent you this letter. To stay motivated in my busy life, I rely on my smartphone to deliver the daily news, even when I’m halfway across the world. I’m now going to email my congressman on my smartphone, in response to the morning briefing on the government shutdown delivered to me via smartphone. After that, I’m going to put down my phone, make the trip to the Taj Mahal and enjoy the sight without distraction. Thank you, smartphone!Brian SilversteinJaipur, IndiaTo the Editor:Thanks to Paul Greenberg for providing suggestions to support the New Year’s resolution many of us doubtless made: to reduce screen time and renew connections to the physical world. Simple pleasures, rich rewards. I like to think of my day in terms of digital hours and analog hours. Usually, it’s the analog hours that bring more fulfillment. For those of us who prefer a less ambitious goal than those Mr. Greenberg lays out, perhaps starting with analog minutes is a good idea. My day begins each morning with a few analog minutes enjoying the rustling of the newspaper above a steaming cup of coffee.

The announcement met with immediate blowback: Sixteen states are suing, and on late-night TV on Monday, various hosts attacked the president for it.Stephen Colbert and Seth Meyers pointed out that Trump had said on Friday that he “didn’t need to do this,” but was declaring the emergency in order to build the wall “much faster” — a statement that seemed to contradict the very definition of an emergency.“You didn’t need to do this? Then it’s not an emergency! That’s the exact opposite of an emergency. That’s a choice. That’s like saying, ‘I’m having emergency surgery to get butt implants.

Its transformation from urban war zone in the early 1990s to shining metropolitan destination has long been a point of pride for the Police Department. For two decades, murder rates have continued to plummet.But in the first three months of this year, that trend took a concerning turn in the opposite direction, driven by a steep spike in murders in Brooklyn. As of March 24, the borough had recorded 28 homicides so far this year, compared with 17 in the same period last year, a 64 percent increase.During the same period, police officials said the number of murders in the rest of the city fell slightly, from 43 to 41. Murders went up in significantly in Manhattan, but fell in the Bronx, Queens and Staten Island.Crime rates rise and fall periodically and it is too early to tell if the increase in killings foretells a new crime wave that would challenge the sense of security that has become part of the city’s identity. Over time the increase may be offset by quieter periods, and trends that appear worrisome in March often level off by August.“There are month to month fluctuations, not necessarily indicative of a trend,” said Chief Lori Pollock, who oversees crime control strategies.Still, the spike in murders in Brooklyn — particularly in the 10 precincts in the Brooklyn North command — has left police officials scrambling to contain it. Senior commanders said a small number of people linked to street gangs appear to be responsible for the recent wave of shootings.“They’re gang-related shootings, and it’s the same related individuals who are showing up,” said Chief Terence A. Monahan, the department’s highest-ranking uniformed officer. He added that some of the people detained in connection with recent shootings were facing gun charges in other boroughs and had been released on bail.There have been 21 killings so far in the Brooklyn North precincts, compared to 12 at this time last year. Many of those killings have been clustered in neighborhoods like East New York and Brownsville. Others have occurred on the edges of rapidly gentrifying areas like Bushwick and Bedford-Stuyvesant, where there were four murders within a five-block radius earlier this year.To counter the violence, the police commissioner, James P. O’Neill, announced in March that the department would add officers to four of the city’s problem precincts, including the 79th Precinct, which covers parts of Bedford-Stuyvesant and south Williamsburg. The department is also shifting officers from Queens into public housing complexes in northern Brooklyn, where much of the violence has flared.The addition of officers has already led to a significant increase in gun arrests in Brooklyn, the police said.“This is how we’ve reduced crime, by focusing our resources,” Mr. O’Neill said. “I think we’ve turned a corner in Kings County. We understand what the mission is, and that’s to keep people safe.”The violence in Brooklyn is still a far cry from the crest of the murder wave of the early 1990s. By April in 1993, for instance, the same 10 precincts in Brooklyn North already had more than 80 killings.Still, the memory of the days when the city was known as one of America’s most dangerous places haunts the police and elected officials. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the police department was employing a number of strategies to counter the violence, including programs to forge tighter bonds with the community in high-crime precincts.“We’re not going to stop until we make more fundamental changes, and make people safer and make sure they feel safer at the same time,” Mr. de Blasio said.Many residents and business owners in Bedford-Stuyvesant and Clinton Hill said they were aware of recent shootings, yet do not feel as if their communities are under siege.Denise Davis, 52, said a shooting in January inside the Lafayette Gardens public housing complex stood out in her mind because the neighborhood had become safer in recent years.“There used to be a lot of shooting over here — especially right here,” Ms. Davis said as she stood near the intersection of Franklin and Lafayette Avenues. “It has quieted down a little bit, but you’ve still got robberies going on.”There were some signs of insecurity and unease. “Drugs, guns and noise,” was the neighborhood portrait offered by one man as he walked along Franklin Avenue. He declined to give his name.“Things have gotten shadier lately,” said Hannah Weikert, a senior at Pratt Institute who shares an apartment in Clinton Hill.In Bedford-Stuyvesant, Henry Miller, 51, a retired sanitation worker who runs a volunteer program to help steer neighborhood students toward college, said that few weeks ago a man climbing into an Uber car was fatally shot just outside his window on Bedford Avenue, near Greene Avenue.But Mr. Miller said he took a long view, having lived in the neighborhood since childhood, and through a period of drug-fueled violence in the 1980s and 1990s.“You’re not scared at night any more walking home,” he said. “Although I say to friends of mine, ‘This is still Bedford-Stuyvesant.’”Sean Piccoli contributed reporting.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Sebastian ModakOur columnist, Sebastian Modak, is visiting each destination on our 52 Places to Go in 2019 list. He arrived in Houston after stops in Puerto Rico and Panama. At first glance, much of Houston looks alike. Making your way out of the “Loop,” the I-610 highway that circles the city center like a shirt collar, skyscrapers give way to manicured office parks and strip malls, each seemingly a carbon copy of the last. But when you look a little closer, you notice that in one of those strip malls, all the business names carry the tonal accents of written Vietnamese. In another, two Indian restaurants sit on either side of a service specializing in money transfers to Central America. In a nearby parking lot, a family — the men wearing skullcaps and knee-length agbada shirts and the women in brightly-patterned hijabs — loads up a sedan with the ingredients for a meal that I imagine tastes like another home, thousands of miles away.Houston is widely considered to be one of the most culturally diverse cities in the world. According to the city’s planning department, 48 percent of residents speak a language other than English — and more than 145 languages are spoken in the city. Twenty-nine percent of the population is foreign-born. Diversity wasn’t the main reason Houston was on 2019’s 52 Places to Go list, but food and culture were. There’s the addition of the Drawing Institute to the brilliantly curated Menil Collection; a wave of new trendy Downtown food halls; the glitzy Post Oak hotel, home to a Rolls-Royce showroom and Frank Stella art — all rising out of the devastation left behind by Hurricane Harvey in August 2017. But unless you sequester yourself in the chic apartments of Downtown or the mansions of River Oaks, that diversity is everywhere you look — and everywhere you eat. [Houston is Seb’s third stop on his worldwide tour. Read about his previous adventures, dancing in Puerto Rico and scuba-diving in Panama.]6102 miles10CafezaPost OakHoteltexasTheAfghanVillagedowntownRiverOaksMontrosewestparktollwayMenilDrawing InstituteHillcroftGulftonLittleSaigonChinatownBellaireOceanPalaceRestaurantaliefBloodBros.BBQ610RaizesMexicanKitchenHoustonALT90Stafford288Street data from OpenStreetMapBy The New York TimesSo, feeling a kind of kinship with all those Houstonians who live between worlds based on my own unmoored and multicultural background, I leaned into it. I ate more than I should have and blew my Uber budget pretty quickly, but over three meals in a single day, I found a Houston I never imagined existed in the cracks between SUV-clogged freeways and oil-boom money.“You’d fit in perfectly out here,” Robin Wong said to me, referring to Southwest Houston, home to Alief, where Chinatown blends seamlessly into Little Saigon; the Hillcroft area, recently named the “Mahatma Gandhi District” where South and Central Asians share retail space and public schools; and a host of other ethnic enclaves. “In this area, everyone’s a minority,” he said.We had just sat down for a midmorning feast at Ocean Palace, a dim sum hall that in scope more resembles a castle (moat included) than a restaurant. I joined Robin, 43, and his brother Terry, 45, to learn about this neighborhood, Chinatown, where they had grown up. I also wanted to hear about their restaurant, Blood Bros. BBQ, which they run with their childhood friend, Quy Hoang, 46, who carries the distinction of being the first Vietnamese-American pitmaster in the city. (Mr. Hoang had celebrated his birthday the night before and for reasons that you can probably figure out, couldn’t make it for our allotted 11 a.m. time slot.)The two brothers took control of the ordering, conferring in low tones as they checked items off a piece of paper. Over a spread of slick cheung fun rolls, scalding shrimp-filled har gow dumplings, chicken feet, turnip cakes, and more, the Wong brothers told me what it was like growing up in the most diverse section of the most diverse city in the U.S.“My best friends, my childhood friends, are Chinese, Indian, Mexican, black, white—— You get exposed to so much growing up in Alief,” Robin said. “And people here, they love it; they love trying new things. It’s part of being from this neighborhood.” Much of the attention around Blood Bros., which opened late last year in the suburb of Bellaire, has been on the owners’ backgrounds: Two Chinese-Americans and a Vietnamese-American pitmaster hitting the Texas trinity of BBQ — brisket, pork ribs, sausage — does not make for your average BBQ joint. That attention only increased when they started thinking more outside-the-pit. Some days, they will do a smoked turkey banh mi, which I can say firsthand is just as good as it sounds, the charcoal accents of the turkey providing a counterweight to the tanginess of the banh mi’s traditional fixings. They’ve experimented with Thai green curry boudins, a Cajun sausage traditionally stuffed with rice, liver, and aromatics, and their brisket fried rice is one of the restaurant’s most popular sides.“It’s not about Asian-inspired whatever. We just make what we like,” Robin said, after pointing out some theoretical riffs he could pull on the dim sum spread out before us, only half joking. “We love the har gow dumplings. But what if we smoked them?”Houston might be the least pedestrian-friendly major city I’ve ever encountered. You will spend a lot of time in cars. Besides the relatively dense Downtown area, the city is very spread out. I didn’t rent a car and probably should have. If you choose to go carless, you’ll be taking a lot of Ubers and Lyfts, which thankfully are more affordable than in many cities in the United States.That being said, I found Downtown a great place to stay. While, with the exception of some new food halls, there’s not all that much to do in the area if you’re not part of the business casual crowd, I found myself 15 minutes from everything, whether it was dim sum in Chinatown, the quirky bars and cafes of Montrose, or Cafeza, in the First Ward, which hosts a killer open jam session every Monday night. The first thing I noticed when entering Afghan Village, an unassuming restaurant in a strip mall in Hillcroft (a k a the Gandhi District) was the flags. Side by side, Afghan and American flags filled most of the free space behind the counter; a vertical American flag was draped across one corner of the restaurant, and another small one stood tucked into a corner just above the tandoor. The green, black, and red of the Afghan flag provided the color scheme for the whole space.Omer Yousafzai, 41, opened Afghan Village over six years ago. He came to the United States in 2001, following his brother, studied law, and then spent years working with the U.S. military in a linguistics recruitment program. That brought him back to Afghanistan where American and Afghan soldiers alike craved home-cooked Afghan meals instead of the frozen food shipped in from the U.A.E. and elsewhere.“That’s when I started thinking, ‘An Afghan restaurant could be a good idea,’” he told me as we dug into bowls of finely balanced lamb and chicken karahi (a lightly spiced curry), lamb chops, and fluffy naan fresh out of the tandoor.There was never any question where he would open that restaurant. “There’s something about Houston that attracts so many people,” he said. “It takes you in.”When I asked him to try and pinpoint the reason for that, he identified the city’s diversity as a kind of self-perpetuating system.“I think the reason is its diversity,” he said. “You can blend in here. You can claim this place is home and nobody questions that.”A childhood friend connected me with Iveth Reyes, 30, a social worker in Houston’s public school system, saying that she would know where to find legitimate Mexican food. Ms. Reyes told me to meet her at Raizes Mexican Kitchen in Stafford, just outside Houston’s city limits, which she said was the place to try the real deal from Michoacán, the Mexican state where she was born before being brought over the border by her parents at the age of two.The restaurant’s owner, Aristo Gaspar, 50, also from Michoacán, has been in Houston for more than 30 years and now operates three restaurants around the city. He brought out plates of carnitas tacos and enchiladas smothered in a chile reduction that more closely resembled mole than the salsa you’ll find at Tex-Mex spots. Looking up at the menu, I noticed that the Mexican dishes were listed right alongside chicken and waffles. Mr. Gaspar has learned to adapt to many tastes.“This food still tastes like home,” Ms. Reyes said, as we spread habanero sauce on the plate of enchiladas.She works in an elementary school in Gulfton, Houston’s most densely populated neighborhood, which has long been a first stop for new immigrants to the city. She didn’t have the same utopian view of cross-cultural harmony that I had encountered in others. “The younger kids all get along; it’s like they don’t even know there’s a difference between them,” she told me. “But as they grow older they start forming cliques.”Ms. Reyes told me that in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Harvey people put their differences aside and got to work repairing what was broken.“You really saw how close-knit this city is and how it can come together,” she said. “People were out helping neighbors, or bringing their boats into different neighborhoods to help people get around.”She pointed to her mother, Olga Farías, as an example. With electricity out after the hurricane, Ms. Reyes’s mother was called into the school cafeteria, where she worked, to clean out the freezers. Disobeying orders to throw away all the leftover food, she loaded up her car instead and drove around the city looking for people in need of a meal.“It sucks that it took a tragedy to bring that out of the city, but it did,” Ms. Reyes said.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Erin GriffithSAN FRANCISCO — Slack, a workplace messaging company, said Monday that it had confidentially filed paperwork for an initial public offering, joining the growing number of technology start-ups heading to the stock market.Slack, which is based in San Francisco, gave no details about the offering’s timing and said it was awaiting a standard review of its paperwork by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The move was expected given that Slack’s chief executive, Stewart Butterfield, had long indicated that he planned to take the company public. Slack recently hired Goldman Sachs to lead the offering.Slack’s confidential filing comes amid a rush by privately held companies to go public this year. Many of these start-ups, which have been highly valued by private investors, are part of a generation of technology companies known as unicorns. Public share sales by the companies are expected to create a bonanza of riches in Silicon Valley for entrepreneurs and venture capital investors.In December, the ride-hailing companies Uber and Lyft filed confidential paperwork for their own public offerings. Their efforts stalled temporarily last month when a government shutdown hampered the S.E.C.’s ability to review the companies’ registration documents. Other tech companies expected to go public this year include the online scrapbooking firm Pinterest.Slack declined to comment beyond its statement about the confidential filing.There is likely to be a strong demand for Slack stock. The company was valued at $7.1 billion by private investors last year, but in recent weeks investment firms have offered to buy its shares at a price that values Slack at $13 billion, according to a person with knowledge of the details who was not authorized to speak publicly.Slack also plans an unusual form of public offering called a direct listing, the person added. Unlike most I.P.O.s, in which firms sell stock to public market investors in advance, direct listings let a company begin trading its shares on an exchange without raising new funds. Spotify, a provider of streaming music, went public in 2018 in a direct listing, paving the way for other high-profile start-ups to follow.With a direct listing, shareholders can also sell their stock immediately after the public offering, instead of waiting for what is known as a lockup period to expire.Slack has little need for cash. It raised $427 million in new financing in August, a year after raising $250 million. The company has collected a total of more than $1 billion from investors that include the SoftBank Vision Fund, General Atlantic, Dragoneer Investment Group and T. Rowe Price Associates.Mr. Butterfield began Slack out of a gaming start-up, Tiny Speck. While the company’s game products failed to take off, its internal communication tool showed promise. In 2014, the company began selling that communication tool, called Slack.Start-ups quickly adopted Slack, and larger companies followed suit. The company offers free and paid versions of Slack and counts more than 85,000 paying customers, including 65 Fortune 100 companies. Last month, Slack said 10 million people now used its product every day. The company generated more than $350 million in revenue last year, said the person with knowledge of the details.Some companies that have filed to go public have never reached that finish line. Over the last year, a number of high-profile business software companies that took steps to go public were snapped up by a tech giant at the last minute. In November, for example, Qualtrics, an analytics start-up, sold to SAP for $8 billion just days before it was set to ring the opening bell at Nasdaq.Google, Microsoft and Amazon have previously expressed interest in acquiring Slack, but the company has demurred. Now some of them have increasingly begun to compete with the start-up. When Microsoft introduced its own workplace messaging company, Microsoft Teams, in 2016, Slack took out a newspaper ad directed at its new competitor.“We’re genuinely excited to have some competition,” it read.In January, Microsoft announced that 420,000 organizations used its Teams product, including 89 of the Fortune 100.Follow Erin Griffith on Twitter: @eringriffith.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byNo woman is responsible for harassment or any other violent act against her. But experienced travelers and government agencies show how to travel as safely as possible.By Tariro Mzezewa and Lela MooreOn Tuesday, Google unveiled a Doodle in honor of Chen Mao Ping, the renowned Chinese-born author known as Sanmao, on what would have been her 76th birthday. She traveled the globe and wrote of her adventures, inspiring generations of women to see the world beyond their own homes.Sanmao died in 1991 in Taiwan, but it’s not hard to imagine that while traveling she had encountered some risk, as many women who travel today do.After the publication of a New York Times article about the dangers women face while traveling alone — a thread in a broader fabric of harassment and violence — readers had lots of suggestions about how to keep women safe. Jessica Nabongo, who appeared in the article, says she stays in hotels with 24-hour security or in Airbnbs that have achieved Superhost status. She tries to always take Ubers so that her location is tracked, especially at night.Paramount among the suggestions were calls for men to be allies.Many readers noted that men can do much to help women — and others — who travel alone by simply not ignoring the bad behavior of others. If something seems amiss, check on another traveler, and if need be, intervene safely or alert the authorities.Below are other suggestions.“Bring a basic rubber doorstop and use that to wedge under the inside of your hotel/lodging door while you’re in your room. It’s almost impossible to push open a door while that’s in place.”— Allison Lane, 38, San Francisco. Has traveled to Sierra Leone, Ghana, Kenya, Uganda, Egypt, India, Nepal, Jamaica, and Russia.Many women said they practiced self-defense tactics like martial arts. But they also said that above all: Heed your gut; trust your instincts. Carry pepper spray, a pocketknife, a laptop or anything that can be used as a weapon or to summon help. There’s nothing to lose by going on group tours or guided excursions. Others also stressed the same tactics they used at home: not walking alone in the dark, never taking a drink you haven’t seen poured and being aware of the “friendly” stranger.Some women suggested carrying two phones in case one is stolen. Others said to divide up your belongings and your cash in case you’re robbed, so that you do not lose everything.Free applications like Chirpey, RedZone, MayDay, Tripwhistle and Noonlight let women flag incidents and areas of danger, and show how to contact local law enforcement.“Be prepared to be bombarded as you step off the bus, train, or out of the airport. These can be some of the most intense moments of solo travel. It’s good to already know what you want and where you are going next. If you don’t, then just walk away a short distance, observe, and take a little time to get your bearings before making a decision. “Overnight buses are the worst when you’re traveling alone as a woman! More than once I’ve woken up with the hand of the man next to me wandering over between my legs. Now I put a bag in between me and the next person, and the first time he tests the waters, even if I’m not sure he has bad intentions, I make a point to overreact a little.”— Kelsi Lyon, 37, Portland, Ore. Has traveled to India, Indonesia, Burma, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Tanzania, Rwanda, Uganda, Peru, Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Philippines, Spain, France and Italy.Many readers stressed that dressing according to the local customs, including wearing modest clothing, simply made sense and was not a way to blame women for the acts of others. The United States State Department notes: “When it comes to health and security, women travelers are more likely to be affected by religious and cultural beliefs of the foreign countries they visit. The truth is that women face greater obstacles, especially when traveling alone.”“In moments between the wonder, awe and privilege of traveling through the world, I have been followed and harassed by men who assume I’m a sex worker, not a solo black female traveler simply trying to see a bit of the world. “When I’m traveling solo through Southeast Asia, I try to increase my visibility and underscore my humanity by making friends with locals. I chat with the older male and female hawkers, guards and food sellers I pass, buy a thing or two and let them know how long I’ll be around. In many cultures, elders are respected, and when you connect with them, they take you under their wing. Learning a few words of conversation, greeting, thanks and emergency go a long way in this regard.”— Martha Mukaiwa, 33, Windhoek, Namibia. Has traveled to Thailand, Malaysia, Ghana, Indonesia, Germany, France and Italy.“I will often hire a local guide to accompany me:you are far less likely to be trifled with when you are with one. They speak the language and pave the way. “I tip at hotels as soon as I get there in countries with a high poverty rate. Concierge, desk, servers, maids and luggage, I give to them all. That way if I need a rescue or anything else, I am covered. This has often paid off for me. “I once needed assistance to get back to my hotel during a riot in Ecuador. I could not take a taxi — it was the taxi drivers who were rioting. I couldn’t get back to the hotel and it was the only time I went out without a guide. I had tipped everyone at my hotel so when I called for assistance, I was covered.”— Caroline Vroom, 63, Sarasota, Fla. I have traveled to South America, Europe, Asia, Egypt — 75 countries. Not always alone. But alone quite a lot. I sometimes prefer it. Many governments issue travel advisories for other countries for their citizens. The State Department, for example, publishes a list of safety levels by country. Its website, Travel.State.Gov, has information on every country and contact information for the closest American Embassy or Consulate.The State Department also has advice specifically for female travelers, and other groups.Consider enrolling in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program, a.k.a. STEP, or its equivalent in your country.Unicef has data on violence indicators that may be telling for travelers, including domestic violence, female genital mutilation and female homicide. The World Bank has a gender data portal that provides statistics that can signal to women whether it’s a safe location over all.“Try to stay in places where other travelers are staying, i.e. try not to stay in a place where you are the only guest. Try to be sure you can lock your door when you go to sleep. As useless as this may seem, I have even locked the zippers of my tent together and slept with the key in my hand.“Use your voice: scream and yell when you feel threatened. I have even run from an isolated street where I was being surrounded and threatened by a group of men straight into the arms of a random man and woman walking together on a more populated street, screaming how happy I was to see them again.”— Elena Steigman, 41, Valencia, Spain. Has traveled to Israel, Palestine, Egypt, Jordan, Greece, an army base in Lebanon at the Lebanon-Israel border, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Peru, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Philippines, Austria, Slovakia, Czech Republic, Germany, Croatia, Spain, the Netherlands, Scotland, Denmark, Italy, France, Poland and Portugal.“Plan ahead as much as possible. As much as spontaneity can make a trip, there are certain things that are better not left to chance, like airport transfers and other transportation. Most of all, saving some money isn’t worth putting your safety at risk. I feel that lack of reliable and safe transportation in many countries poses the greatest risk to traveler safety.”— Juliet DeMasi, 25, Providence, R.I. Has traveled to Canada, Washington, D.C., New York, Iceland, London, France. Italy, Greece, Thailand and Australia.“Don’t be afraid of publicly shaming someone who is harassing you. If you suddenly find yourself in a dangerous neighborhood or situation, be erratic, drool, laugh out loud and mutter to yourself. These are all things I’ve done while traveling by myself all around the world for the past 35 years. “When on a train in Italy, the conductor was trying relentlessly to get me into bed. After “trying to be nice” for a while and fending him off physically, I screamed as loudly as I could in Italian, and he ran to another part of the train. Unsettling because I knew he was somewhere on the train. I didn’t go to sleep.”— Amanda Franzoni, 49, Portland, Ore. I’ve been traveling by myself all around the world for the past 35 years. Japan, China, Italy, England, France, Spain, the Netherlands, Panama, Canada, Mexico and the United States, including Puerto Rico.“Travel safety sites will advise women on what ‘appropriate female travel behaviors’ look like: don’t go out at night, don’t drink alcohol, don’t explore isolated areas or engage in sexual encounters. Personally, I’d like to see a list of ‘appropriate male travel behaviors’ also added to these websites. Women are taught from the beginning that the world is a scary place for us. This construct desperately needs to change if equality is ever to be possible.“Here are some of my tips: Pay for your safety even if it means spending a bit more. Take an Uber, stay in centralized accommodations and buy a local SIM card so your mobile works internationally. “If there are other solo female travelers around, introduce yourself to them, as you will naturally look out for one another along the way and make a new friend. “Most importantly, don’t succumb to the fear. In my experience, the world contains far more kindness and good than bad. Book the flight and strap on that backpack — traveling solo is the best decision a woman will ever make for herself.”— Heather-Rose Cahill, 36, London. I have traveled as a solo female to 16 countries spanning three continents: Vietnam, Cuba, Montenegro, Malta, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Italy, Spain, Croatia, Portugal, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Mexico, Cambodia, the Netherlands and Scotland.As the writer, filmmaker and activist Susan Sontag is quoted as saying, “I haven’t been everywhere, but it’s on my list.”Correction: An earlier version of this article misquoted a woman who described her experiences being followed or harassed while traveling alone.

Now Tani, as he is known, has a home, a six-figure bank account, scholarship offers from three elite private schools and an invitation to meet President Bill Clinton.“I think I am still dreaming,” said Tani’s dad, Kayode Adewumi. “I hope I don’t wake up.”I wrote in my column last weekend about Tani as a reminder of the principle that talent is universal, even if opportunity is not. A Nigerian refugee who had learned chess only a bit more than a year earlier, he had just defeated kids from elite private schools to win the New York state chess championship for his age group. He lugged a trophy nearly as big as he is back to the homeless shelter.Now the story gets even better.After my column about this hard-working family, a GoFundMe drive raised more than $200,000 for Tani, his parents and his brother. A half-dozen readers offered housing — in a couple of cases, palatial quarters. Immigration lawyers offered pro bono assistance to the Adewumis, who are in the country legally and seeking asylum. Three film companies are vying to make movies about Tani.[Follow Nicholas Kristof as he travels around the United States and the world, shedding light on crises and hailing unsung heroes. For a behind-the-scenes look at Nick’s gritty journalism, sign up for his newsletter.]The family settled on one of the more modest and practical housing offers: An anonymous donor paid a year’s rent on a two-bedroom apartment near Tani’s current school. The apartment is clean, comfortable and freshly painted, without being luxurious, and the Adewumis gaze adoringly at their new kitchen.“I want my mom’s cooking again!” Tani mused as he explored the apartment. It was bare, but another donor had offered furniture, sheets and towels. Someone else was sending 100 chess books.Heartfelt thanks to all my readers for this generosity: I truly have the best readers.[Watch: Nicholas Kristof visited Tani and his family in their new apartment.]And now the story gets even better.The Adewumis have decided that they will not spend a cent of the $200,000 GoFundMe money on themselves. They will take out a 10 percent tithe and donate it to their church, which helped them while they were homeless, and the rest will be channeled through a new Tanitoluwa Adewumi Foundation to help African immigrants who are struggling in the United States the way they were a week ago.“Anybody who is coming from Africa who is in the position we were in, we will help them,” Mr. Adewumi said, acknowledging that details need to be worked out.I asked them how they could turn down every penny of such a huge sum. Didn’t they want a celebration dinner? New iPhones? A vacation?“I’m a hardworking guy,” Mr. Adewumi explained. He has two jobs: He drives for Uber with a rented car and sells real estate through Brick & Mortar. Someone has now offered him a free car so that he can keep more of the money he makes driving, and Tani’s mom was just offered a job as a health care aide at a hospital.I asked Tani if he was O.K. with seeing the $200,000 disappear. He shrugged. “I want to help other kids,” he said. “I don’t mind.”Surely, I pressed him, there was some material object he coveted. There was a long silence. “Maybe a computer,” he acknowledged.The family was tempted by the offers of full scholarships at top private schools. But Tani and his parents decided that while he might accept such a scholarship for middle school, he would be loyal and stick with the public elementary school, P.S. 116, that taught him chess and waived his fees for the chess club.“This school showed confidence in Tanitoluwa,” his mom, Oluwatoyin Adewumi, told the P.S. 116 principal, Jane Hsu. “So we return the confidence.” And then, overcome with emotion, the mom and the principal hugged.There’s a risk that a triumph like this leaves the impression that charity is the solution rather than a way to fill gaps: Fundamentally we need comprehensive systems in place to support needy kids. We would never build a bridge or subway with volunteers and donations, so why entrust an even more urgent cause — homeless children — to charity?Tani thrived because everything fell into place: a good school, a dedicated chess teacher and devoted parents committed to taking their son to every chess practice. The challenge is to replicate that supportive environment for all the other Tanis out there with public services and private philanthropy alike.One challenge I face is that readers often want to donate just to a particular individual I write about, without addressing the larger social problem. So it’s thrilling to see Tani and his parents use their good fortune to help other anonymous kids in need. In that, there’s a lesson for all of us.“God has already blessed me,” Mr. Adewumi told me. “I want to release my blessing to others.”The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

We thought it was a great product so we said let's dig into this and we made an acquisition with our friends at AMF," Bo Selling, Alecta's head of equities, told Reuters.Swedish pension funds Alecta and AMF saw their 2016 investments in Spotify nearly triple in value when it listed in 2018. This success has helped fuel demand from other pension funds and encouraged some to change their investment parameters in order to be able to seek out the region's next big hit.As part of this shift, Sweden said earlier this year it will allow some of its largest state public pension funds, named APs 1, 2, 3 and 4, to allocate up to 40 percent of the about $140 billion they manage to illiquid investments, removing a 5 percent limit for unlisted instruments."We will most likely do more investments in private equity and venture (capital)," said Jenny Askfelt Rudd, head of alternative investments at AP4, which has about 3 percent of its assets in private equity.Around a quarter of all assets raised in Europe so far in 2019 have gone to funds based in the Nordics, data from industry tracker Preqin showed, part of a global surge in demand that has seen total undeployed capital in the sector pass $2 trillion.This is driven by institutional investors looking to shore up returns as global economic uncertainty roiled stock markets.But it is not all one-way traffic. Last year, Norway's government recommended against allowing its $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund to expand into private equity.The ball is now in the hands of the country's parliament, with the fund arguing the move could help improve its balance between risk and return, and naming Uber and Airbnb among missed opportunities due to the current restrictions.For interactive versions of the graphics, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2Fby9bT and here https://tmsnrt.rs/2O77Fv9.Norway's sovereign fund posted a negative return on investment of 6.1 percent in 2018, while AP4 posted its second negative result since 2008 last year and warned it faced significant challenges in delivering returns at levels achieved in the past decade.A Swedish parliamentary committee that worked on the pension rule changes found that where listed equities generated returns of an average 6.9 percent, alternative investments have delivered a combined 12.3 percent.Denmark's PFA, which runs 75 billion euros ($85 billion) in assets, is already active, growing its alternatives investments from 1 billion euros in late 2015 to 5 billion euros now."We have an ambition to grow that significantly over the coming years," Peter Tind Larsen, head of alternative investments at PFA, said.Despite concerns that demand is fuelling a valuation bubble, Selling said Alecta believes there are still opportunities to grow its private equity portfolio, with just 0.5 percent of its 860 billion Swedish crowns ($93 billion) in assets in unlisted equities."A good company with a good model and good growth prospects can be deemed interesting even if it is priced at a higher multiple on the earnings," Selling said. GET WITH THE PROGRAMMERSOn the flipside, private equity firms are seeking partnerships with pension funds to bump up the valuation of assets without having to seek a market listing, bankers say.Independent Vetcare (IVC), Europe's largest veterinary services firm, was valued at 3 billion euros when Alecta and AP6 - a specialist in unlisted investments - bought 20 percent in February versus the roughly 500 million euros EQT paid to buy it in 2016, sources told Reuters.So far in 2019, five Nordic-based funds have raised a combined 4.2 billion euros in assets, 22 percent of the total for Europe as a whole, Preqin data showed. That compares with 16 percent last year and 6 percent in 2017. For an interactive version of the graphics, click here https://tmsnrt.rs/2VMu8jZ and here https://tmsnrt.rs/2Xeeaja.EQT is the local sector leader and has seven of the ten biggest funds raised in the region, including EQT VIII, which last year raised 10.8 billion euros. Others include Nordic Capital, Altor, IK Investment Partners, Creandum and Northzone.Much of their focus is on the region's vibrant digital start-up scene. The European Digital City Index ranks Stockholm second to London in terms of support for digital entrepreneurs. Helsinki and Copenhagen also make the top ten."Being a programmer is the most common job in Stockholm, so it's everywhere," Ted Persson, operating partner at EQT Ventures, said.Swedish payments company Klarna is seen by bankers as one of the hottest local firms to invest in ahead of a likely IPO, and pension funds seem primed to take a slice in its external fundraising this year.Valued by bankers with knowledge of its recent internal fundraising at around 32 billion Swedish crowns, the firm counts private equity firms Sequoia and Permira, as well as rapper Snoop Dogg, as investors."A number of the largest pension funds have hired additional people with strong corporate finance expertise, and we ... expect to see these funds taking the lead on larger transactions," Klaus Thune, co-head of Nordic banking at JP Morgan, said.

Las comunidades de la Cordillera Blanca en el país andino viven temerosas de las avalanchas e inundaciones que está provocando la desglaciación relacionada con el cambio climático. En las últimas dos décadas, por ejemplo, la cantidad de agua en la laguna de Palcacocha, cerca de Huaraz, ha aumentado en 3400 por ciento.Luciano Lliuya, vecino de la laguna, ha presentado una demanda en una corte alemana contra la mayor empresa energética de ese país exigiendo una compensación de 19.000 dólares por los gastos de contener las inundaciones. La suya forma parte de una nueva ola de demandas civiles que intentan que las empresas de combustibles fósiles paguen por la devastación climática. La historia de Lliuya sirve para ilustrar las dificultades legales y las estrategias de los abogados que arguyen que quienes resulten más responsables del calentamiento global deben pagar por los daños.• Los primeros cien días de Bolsonaro. Tres meses son muy poco para evaluar el desempeño de un mandatario, pero Jair Bolsonaro ha logrado en ese corto periodo desperdiciar una gran parte del capital político que lo llevó a la presidencia de Brasil. Aunque ha cumplido algunas de sus promesas de campaña, Bolsonaro tiene la popularidad más baja que cualquier presidente brasileño en su primer mandato desde los años ochenta, según una encuesta de Datafolha. Uno de cada tres encuestados dijo que le parecía que su presidencia era mala o pésima. “Ya estamos en un periodo de estancamiento”, comentó el legislador Kim Kataguiri, cuyo partido respaldó la candidatura de Bolsonaro. “Los mercados pronostican que Brasil no podrá cumplir con sus obligaciones, controlar su deuda pública ni recibir inversiones”.Por otro lado, las autoridades brasileñas investigan si las candidaturas de cinco mujeres fueron un modo ilícito del Partido Social Liberal de Bolsonaro para conseguir financiamiento político. Varios dirigentes del partido han sido acusados de registrar candidatas desconocidas para cobrar fondos destinados a aumentar la participación femenina El escándalo ya provocó la destitución de un miembro del gabinete de Bolsonaro.“El gobierno colombiano debería considerar que sus ciudadanos merecen el mismo cuidado que los ciudadanos de Estados Unidos. Cuando la ciencia ha demostrado que el glifosato causa problemas de salud, el gobierno colombiano tiene una responsabilidad ética: si existe alguna posibilidad de que la fumigación dañe la salud de las poblaciones campesinas que viven rodeadas de cultivos de coca, su uso debe prohibirse”.El periodista colombiano Jorge Eduardo Espinosa analiza las implicaciones del uso de glifosato para combatir los cultivos de coca en su país y advierte en esta columna sobre sus riesgos.Como parte del proyecto Times Past, el equipo de nuestro archivo preparó este especial, en el que tenemos como editora invitada a la bailarina Misty Copeland.

Cerca de quinientos bomberos franceses intentaron sofocar el incendio que envolvió en llamas a la icónica catedral parisina, una construcción de más de 800 años de antigüedad. Según las autoridades, ayer todavía no se habían determinado las causas del devastador incendio. Sin embargo, monseñor Patrick Chauvet, rector del templo, dijo que parecía que las llamas comenzaron en la red interior de vigas de madera, muchas de las cuales se remontan a la Edad Media y son conocidas como “el bosque”.La catedral estaba en un proceso de renovación, un asunto sobre el que reportamos en 2017. El incendio acaparó la atención alrededor del mundo y llevó a cientos de usuarios a reflexionar sobre esta obra arquitectónica que durante siglos ha ocupado la imaginación popular: desde Victor Hugo hasta Disney pasando por escritores latinoamericanos como Julio Cortázar y César Vallejo se han inspirado en Notre Dame, una estructura arquitectónica que ha sido al mismo tiempo refugio, atracción turística y fuente de devoción religiosa. ¿Qué te recuerda esa catedral?• El declive de la economía china se siente en el distrito financiero vacío y el endeudamiento de Tianjín. En una de las principales ciudades portuarias del noreste de China, el crecimiento inmobiliario no ha creado la derrama económica esperada.

Se esperaba que la empresa recaudara 100.000 millones de dólares; de ser así, la venta de acciones podría superar a la mayor de los últimos años, que se dio cuando Alibaba abrió operaciones en la bolsa de Nueva York en 2014. Sin embargo, un análisis [en inglés] indicaba que es poco probable que Uber tenga ganancias en el futuro cercano.

Un reporte de Bloomberg Intelligence calculó que las demandas y reembolsos derivados de los accidentes y la suspensión de vuelos en los aviones 737 Max podrían costarle a la empresa casi 2000 millones de dólares en seis meses.En el primer trimestre del año la empresa solo había recibido 32 nuevos pedidos del 737 Max, una caída brutal comparada con las 122 órdenes que recibió en el mismo periodo el año anterior.

His myth-busting television show, “Adam Ruins Everything,” is in its third season on TruTV.Mr. Conover’s episode on air travel led him to some interesting findings. “I, like so many people, a few years ago got sucked into the frequent flier-mile game,” he says. “I started getting credit cards and trying to figure out how to maximize my miles. And now I’m switching to all cash-back because I have recognized what a labyrinthine scam it is. The airlines have devalued all of their miles for economy travelers to such an extent that if you’re just the average person going to visit your family a couple times a year on an economy ticket, you’re going to earn so few miles it would take you decades to ever earn one of those mystical free first-class flights.”Another thing he learned while researching the episode is the illusion of the so-called Golden Age of flying. “Everyone uses ‘Mad Men’ as an example. You know: Don Draper taking his elegant cross-country flights, and the stewardess bringing him a neat scotch, and he looks all classy. “We dispel that image by sharing what flying really looked like back then. In the ’60s planes flew a little lower than they do now. In the ’30s and the ’40s, they flew much lower to the ground. It was a horrible experience. There was a lot more turbulence and it was a lot more dangerous. People were much more likely to die in a plane crash. But the cabins were also full of the smell of cigarette smoke and fuel fumes because they weren’t as good at separating the fuel fumes. “The main reason that barf bags are on planes today is because the cabins were constantly full of the smell of jet fuel and cigarette smoke, and there was so much more turbulence, so people were just constantly throwing up.”Here’s what he can’t travel without:“There is nothing better than getting to just dig in and seriously play a video game for a six-hour flight from New York to L.A. ‘Into the Breach’ is a wonderful strategy game where you play that you are trying to stop an alien invasion. But of course, ‘Zelda: Breath of the Wild’ and ‘Super Mario Odyssey’ are just two of the most superlative games ever made, and so when I have time to completely lose myself in those, it’s really, really a joy.” “I find that I have a lot of suppressed energy when I’m on a plane for a long period so when I’m holding a fidget spinner, being able to play with it and just sort of run my hands over it helps me out quite a lot; it helps me relax. I’ve gotten into an Uber and then said, ‘Oh wait, hold on one second,’ and run back in to get the fidget spinner because I knew I would need it on the plane.”“My domestic partner, Lisa Hanawalt, is a cartoonist and the designer of BoJack Horseman. I’ve noticed when she’s in a situation where she’s trying to distract herself with her hands, she just has a sketchbook to draw in, and I started doing that too. Now the problem is that I’ve run out of stuff to draw on a plane, so I’ve drawn the back of the head of the person sitting in front of me about five or six times. Those are some of my best pieces. Lisa looks at these and goes, ‘Oh my God, you’re a very good artist.’ Maybe I’ll do a gallery show one day of the drawings of the backs of people’s heads.”“I find that a really restful, relaxing way to spend time on a plane is to listen to an audiobook while drawing. I use the Libby app to check out audiobooks from my public library. Right now, I’m listening to “Evicted,” by Matthew Desmond, which is a really incredible set of stories of poverty in Milwaukee, and about the underreported epidemic of eviction that is contributing to the cycle of poverty. The cool thing is, it’s the rare piece of nonfiction that isn’t just dumping the policy problem on you. It’s incredibly, beautifully reported personal accounts of individual families and what their lives are like on a day-to-day basis.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byGood Thursday.

It suggested similarities between Sunday’s crash in Ethiopia and one involving a Boeing 737 Max 8 in Indonesia in October. Boeing’s C.E.O. said the company was “supporting this proactive step out of an abundance of caution.”The cost to Boeing could be huge. Airlines have “begun to demand compensation for their losses during the grounding,” Natalie Kitroeff of the NYT writes. And one analyst estimated that the company may have to spend nearly $1 billion to resolve issues with the 737 Max fleet. It could also face lawsuits from the families of passengers who died in the disasters.“But the bigger financial unknown is whether airlines lose confidence in the Max,” Ms. Kitroeff adds. If that happens, orders for the 737 Max — the company’s best-selling jet — could dry up, handing an advantage to Boeing’s European rival, Airbus, which makes a similar plane, the A320neo. But outright cancellations of orders seem unlikely, because airlines typically put down large deposits.The British Parliament voted last night to oppose the prospect of Britain’s withdrawal from the E.U. without an agreement with the bloc, writes Stephen Castle of the NYT.“The vote was another harsh blow” to Prime Minister Theresa May, Mr. Castle writes. “A critical part of her strategy has been to play for time and use the fast-approaching threat of a chaotic, disorderly and economically damaging exit as leverage.”“Mrs. May said that if lawmakers can support a deal in the next few days, she could request a Brexit delay until June 30 to put it in place,” he adds. “But that appears unlikely. Parliament rejected the agreement she negotiated with the European Union in a humiliating 432 to 202 vote in January, and defeated it again on Tuesday, 391 to 242.”“Without an approved agreement, a longer extension would be needed, forcing Britain to take part in European Parliament elections in May. That suggests Mrs. May might make one more effort to get her unpopular plan through Parliament, threatening hard-line Brexit supporters that, if it fails, she will seek a long delay that could, potentially, mean Brexit never happening.”Brookfield Asset Management announced yesterday that it had agreed to buy most of Oaktree Capital Management for about $4.8 billion, creating an alternative asset manager giant that will rival the likes of Blackstone.Brookfield and Oaktree would control $475 billion of assets under management, including debt, according to Reuters. Blackstone, the industry leader, has at least $650 billion including debt, according to a spokesman of the firm who spoke to the news agency.“The deal is a bet by Brookfield, which currently focuses on private equity, real estate, infrastructure and renewable power, on the prospects for investing in debt, which makes up around 70 percent of Oaktree’s assets under management,” Reuters adds.The purchase is “the latest sign of how Toronto-based Brookfield has quietly come to dominate the alternative asset management industry,” according to the FT.Just one day after the White House’s chief trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, said that a result from trade talks with China would be agreed “before too long,” President Trump undermined his efforts.“I’m not in a rush whatsoever,” Mr. Trump told reporters yesterday, according to Bloomberg. The WSJ reports that Mr. Trump said that President Xi Jinping of China knows that the U.S. would walk away from a poor deal, and that he said, “China very much wants to make a deal.”This could be a negotiating tactic. “Trump can use this for leverage and could also be mindful he would be criticized for a weak deal,” Christopher Adams, a former official in the Treasury Department and U.S. trade negotiator in Beijing, told the WSJ.But it suggests there will be no deal in March. Mr. Trump spoke in February of a possible summit meeting at his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, with Mr. Xi this month to sign an agreement. But unidentified officials told the WSJ that an April date now looks more likely.More: President Trump’s former economic adviser, Gary Cohn, told the podcast “Freakonomics” that Mr. Trump’s trade adviser, Peter Navarro, is in his view the only Ph.D.-holding economist in the world who thinks that tariffs do not hurt the economy. The former C.E.O. of Starbucks, Howard Schultz, still hasn’t officially decided whether to enter the 2020 presidential race. But during a speech at Miami Dade College yesterday, designed to drum up support for such a bid, Mr. Schultz did outline what his independent presidency might offer. WaPo reports his remarks:• “I would not sign any legislation — none — into law that does not have bipartisan support. … We need to be candid with the American people and admit, yes, that both sides have good ideas if we work together.”• “The courts have become yet another battlefield in the ongoing war between Democratic and Republican leaders. … These battles have undermined our faith in the rule of law and the impartiality of the entire judicial system. All of this has to change.”• “I will do everything I can to fight for the center, where the vast majority of Americans stand.”A grand jury in New York has subpoenaed records from at least two prominent smartphone and device makers that had entered into partnerships with Facebook, gaining access to the personal information of hundreds of millions of users, according to the NYT:“It is not clear when the grand jury inquiry, overseen by prosecutors with the United States attorney’s office for the Eastern District of New York, began or exactly what it is focusing on.”“We are cooperating with investigators and take those probes seriously,” a Facebook spokesman said in a statement. “We’ve provided public testimony, answered questions and pledged that we will continue to do so.”“Facebook was already facing scrutiny by the Federal Trade Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission.” And the Justice Department’s securities fraud unit started an investigation last year in the wake of the company’s Cambridge Analytica data scandal.Renault has removed Mouna Sepehri, an ally of its former chairman, Carlos Ghosn, from her role as general secretary and placed her in advisory role. It is part of broader shake-up of the company’s senior management.At Mitsubishi, two other allies of Mr. Ghosn — Trevor Mann, the C.O.O., and Vincent Cobee, the head of product — have resigned.Aurora Cannabis hired Nelson Peltz, the founder of the activist hedge fund Trian Partners, as a strategic adviser.The U.S. Senate confirmed Neomi Rao to take Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s empty seat at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.Deals• Uber is in talks to sell a stake in its self-driving technologies unit to SoftBank and other investors for as much as $1 billion.

In fact, the sketch wasn’t even particularly political. (But don’t worry, there was still a surprise celebrity guest.)Beginning with a fake voice-over for MSNBC — “Now that the Mueller report turned out to be a big fat zero, we’re back to prison shows” — the sketch set up an episode of “Lockup: Chino Correctional Facility,” in which inmates played by Chris Redd, Kyle Mooney and Kenan Thompson boasted about the crimes that had put them behind bars.Enter Kate McKinnon, playing the actress Lori Loughlin. “Oh yeah?” McKinnon told the gang. “You think that’s insane? I paid 500 grand to get my daughter into U.S.C.”She added: “That’s not including the 300 grand I blew on tuition.”(She also said she owned the prison guards because “I helped their kids get into a really competitive pre-K,” and boasted that she was a Nation of Islam member because she’d “bought my way in for 100 grand.”)Next in the prison cell was Pete Davidson playing the lawyer Michael Avenatti,  who was indicted this week on dozens of charges.“I’m accused of crimes you can’t even conceive of,” he told the other inmates. “Like blackmailing a sneaker company.

I’m the scourge of the cleaning staff at the Ecuadorean Embassy.”“Here’s how crazy I am,” he explained. “I’m wanted in the U.S. and Sweden; I’m from Australia; I live in London, in Ecuador — you try figuring that one out.”Keaton added: “I’m an actual James Bond super villain, and I’m one step away from destroying the [expletive] moon.

Leslie Jones played the host Whoopi Goldberg (“I’m as surprised as you that this show is a fit for me”), while Cecily Strong and Villaseñor played her round-table partners Abby Huntsman and Ana Navarro. But the sketch focused mainly on the recent bickering between the hosts Joy Behar (McKinnon) and Meghan McCain (Aidy Bryant).As Bryant declared in a meandering rant: “Can I just say something? As the princess of Arizona, there is a crisis at the border, and the border is right up in my Arizona, which was founded on sunburned women selling turquoise jewelry, not rando Mexicans. And that’s not racist, because my makeup artist is gay.”The night’s host, Emma Stone, played the former “View” host Jenny McCarthy, who has been an outspoken critic of vaccinations.“I don’t believe in vaccinations,” she said. “My doctor is Google; my scientist, Twitter; and my religion is Donnie Wahlberg.”At the “Weekend Update” desk, the anchors continued to riff on Assange’s arrest and on President Trump’s announcement that his administration was considering releasing migrants detained at the border into so-called sanctuary cities.“WikiLeaks founder and reason I put tape over my computer camera, Julian Assange, was arrested at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, and this dude did not go quietly,” the anchor Colin Jost began. A video played of the arrest, in which Assange shouts, “The U.K. has no civility!”Jost resumed:That is not how you’re typically removed from an embassy. That’s how you’re removed from the F train. But it was so satisfying to see an internet troll get dragged out into the sunlight. Like, you can be lord of darkness on the internet, but when seven cops have you pinned to the sidewalk, you can’t be like, “I summon the power of emails!”Jost went on to note that Trump had been asked about Assange’s arrest, showing a video in which the president says: “I know nothing, really, about him. It’s not my deal in life.”“What is your deal in life?” Jost asked. “I’m just genuinely curious, since you brought it up. Also, you cannot say that WikiLeaks is not your deal, because at some point it was like your whole deal.”Playing numerous clips in which Trump praised WikiLeaks, Jost responded with a reference to the night’s musical guest, a Korean boy band: “You’re more obsessed with WikiLeaks than this audience is with BTS.”The anchor Michael Che picked up the Trump thread:President Trump is considering releasing detained immigrants into sanctuary cities to send a message to Democrats. What’s the message? Have some more voters? Yeah, man, that’ll show ’em. I don’t know how they’re going to handle a bunch of immigrants in a city like … New York. You can’t scare us with more immigrants. That just means faster Ubers and more Elmos.“Or, maybe he should send immigrants to New York,” Che continued, prompting an image of Trump Tower. “I know a huge building on Fifth Avenue where nobody wants to live anymore.”This week’s show featured performances by BTS, the first K-pop band to play on “Saturday Night Live.”If you’re wondering why their fans spent days camped outside NBC headquarters or why “S.N.L.” audience members burst into hoots, screams and applause any time the band’s name was mentioned, watch the video above, in which BTS performs “Boy With Luv” from its new album, “Map of the Soul: Persona.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byWhy more merit might not be what elite education needs.By Ross DouthatOpinion ColumnistIn the last year elite college admissions has been touched by three different but related scandals. The newest one is also the most entertaining, because it includes pretend water polo players, staged standardized tests and outright bribery, all to help desperate rich people and TV stars buy their progeny into a top-flight school.The other scandals are less amusing, involving dilemmas of race and meritocracy with no celebrity leaven. One involves revelations from the latest affirmative-action lawsuit, which has exposed how Harvard’s rejection of qualified Asian applicants seems to uncomfortably resemble the old Jewish quotas of the 1930s and 1940s. The other involves a brace of Ivy League admissions offices being taken in by a tough-love Louisiana school that produced fraudulent transcripts for its African-American students, while its founder treated the kids brutally behind the scenes.In their different ways all these scandals feed into two critiques of elite academia, one more left-wing and one more right-wing, which take different routes to the same condemnatory claim: These schools claim to be meritocratic, but they aren’t.[Listen to “The Argument” podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]The left-wing critique focuses on class, noting that the desperate-rich-parents scandal is just an exaggerated and criminal version of the general way that legacy admissions and athletic programs boost wealthy applicants, making elite schools into havens of privilege despite their best-and-brightest boast.The right-wing critique focuses on race, arguing that racial preferences are corrosive to merit-based admissions, because the quest for racial balance creates unfair and discrediting results — a “not too many Asians, please” quota system, a seeming tilt against lower-middle-class white applicants, and a bias (to the point of credulity, in the Louisiana case) in favor of African-Americans and Hispanics.You can blend the two critiques by noting how racial bias in admissions and economic privilege interact — the tilt against lower-middle-class whites may reflect the fact that schools want richer kids (and their tuition dollars) to take up the “white” slots, while affirmative action can benefit the children of wealthy immigrant families as much as the descendants of slaves.Blending the two critiques can get you the centrist prescription for reform: Elite schools should emphasize class-based rather than race-based affirmative action, the argument runs, while phasing out preferences for jocks and legacies that give privileged whites their own leg up — a combination that might yield a still-diverse, more authentically meritocratic upper class.I used to believe in this prescription. But lately my skepticism about meritocracy itself has made me doubt whether we need more of it.Elite institutions, by their very nature, are not a mass-opportunity system. Even (especially?) in a democratic society they exist to shape a ruling class. And the tension between legacy admissions and affirmative action and merit-based admissions is really a tension between three ways that a ruling class can be legitimated –— through intergenerational continuity, through representation and through aptitude.The “more meritocracy” argument against both legacies and racial quotas implicitly assumes that aptitude — some elixir of I.Q. and work ethic — is what our elite primarily lacks.But is that really our upper class’s problem? What if our elite is already diligent and how-do-you-like-them-apples smaht — the average SAT score for the Harvard class of 2022 is a robust 1512 — and deficient primarily in memory and obligation, wisdom and service and patriotism?In that case continuity and representation, as embodied by legacy admissions and racial quotas, might actually be better legitimizers for elite universities to cultivate than the spirit of talent-über-alles. It might be better if more Ivy League students thought of themselves as representatives of groups and heirs of family obligation than as Promethean Talents elevated by their own amazing native gifts. It might be better if elite universities, in being open about seeking a specific ethnic mix and encouraging an intergenerational tradition, ceded a certain amount of talent to public universities, and even saw their average SAT score go down.And who knows — the Ivies might even teach undergraduates a little more rigorously if they weren’t so determined to prove they admitted the smartest kids by never ever letting anyone flunk out.This is all admittedly fanciful, because to be open about racial quotas would require private schools to sacrifice federal funds, and to emphasize legacy advantages would cost them in the U.S. News rankings. And it might be culturally impossible, given the sway of the meritocratic idea, for elite schools to lean into their aristocratic profile rather than insisting (in whatever defiance of reality) that they are offering opportunity to all.But the “more meritocracy” world — the world where bipartisan criticism produces a Harvard class of 2032 with fewer legacies and non-Asian minorities and an average SAT of 1570 — could be worse than what we have. Because such a change’s essential premise, that intelligence alone really merits power, is the premise that has given us many present difficulties, and if extended may only give us more.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

The boy is a Nigerian refugee with an uncertain future, but he is beaming.He can’t stop grinning because the awkward load is a huge trophy, almost as big as he is. This homeless third grader has just won his category at the New York State chess championship.Much of the news of the last week has focused on wealthy families buying access to great universities, either illegally through bribes or legally through donations. There is no question that America is a tilted playing field that gives wealthy children huge advantages.So we should all grin along with Tanitoluwa Adewumi, the newly crowned chess champion for kindergarten through third grade. He went undefeated at the state tournament last weekend, outwitting children from elite private schools with private chess tutors.What’s even more extraordinary is that Tani, as he is known, learned chess only a bit more than a year ago. His play has skyrocketed month by month, and he now has seven trophies by his bed in the homeless shelter.“I want to be the youngest grandmaster,” he told me.Tani’s family fled northern Nigeria in 2017, fearing attacks by Boko Haram terrorists on Christians such as themselves. “I don’t want to lose any loved ones,” his father, Kayode Adewumi, told me.So Tani, his parents and his older brother arrived in New York City a bit more than a year ago, and a pastor helped steer them to a homeless shelter. Tani began attending the local elementary school, P.S. 116, which has a part-time chess teacher who taught Tani’s class how to play.Tani enjoyed the game and prodded his mom, Oluwatoyin Adewumi, to ask if he could join the chess club.“He is interested in the chess program, which he will like to be participating in,” Mrs. Adewumi, who is working hard to master American English, emailed the club. She explained that she could not pay the fees for the program because the family was living in a shelter.Russell Makofsky, who oversees the P.S. 116 chess program, waived the fees, and a year ago the boy took part in his first tournament with the lowest rating of any participant, 105.His rating is now 1587 and rising fast. (By comparison, the world’s best player, Magnus Carlsen, stands at 2845.)Tani has an aggressive style of play, and in the state tournament the coaches, watching from the sidelines, were shocked when he sacrificed a bishop for a lowly pawn. Alarmed, they fed the move into a computer and it agreed with Tani, recognizing that the gambit would improve his position several moves later.“It’s an inspiring example of how life’s challenges do not define a person,” said Jane Hsu, the principal of P.S. 116, which held a pep rally to celebrate Tani’s victory. Hsu noted that while Tani lacks a home, he has enormously supportive parents dedicated to seeing him succeed.Tani’s mom can’t play chess but takes him every Saturday to a three-hour free practice session in Harlem, and she attends his tournaments. His dad lets Tani use his laptop each evening to practice. And although religion is extremely important to the family, the parents let Tani miss church when necessary to attend a tournament.“Tani is rich beyond measure,” in the strength, love and support of his family, Makofsky told me.Tani’s dad has two jobs: He rents a car that he uses to drive for Uber, and he has also become a licensed real estate salesman. Tani’s mom has passed a course to become a home health aide. Meeting them, it’s easy to see where Tani’s scrappy diligence came from.It is sometimes tough for Tani. His parents say that he once came home from school crying after classmates teased him for being homeless. And at an immigration hearing last fall, he burst into tears when he misunderstood the judge to say that the family would be deported.“I feel American,” he explained. In fact, the family’s asylum request is dragging on, with the next hearing scheduled for August.Tani tries to put that out of his mind. He lies on the floor of the shelter and practices chess for hours each evening — now preparing for the elementary national championship in May.“He is so driven,” said his school chess teacher, Shawn Martinez. “He does 10 times more chess puzzles than the average kid. He just wants to be better.”Makofsky shook his head wonderingly. “One year to get to this level, to climb a mountain and be the best of the best, without family resources,” he said. “I’ve never seen it.”Tani is a reminder that refugees enrich this nation — and that talent is universal, even if opportunity is not. Back in Nigeria, his parents say, his brilliance at chess would never have had an outlet.“The U.S. is a dream country,” his dad told me. “Thank God I live in the greatest city in the world, which is New York, New York.”Update: Many readers have asked if they can help Tani and his family.

Amazon declined to say when the change would happen.There is no federal law that requires stores to accept cash, so lawmakers are working on the issue at the state and city level.Earlier this year, Philadelphia became the first city to ban cashless stores, despite efforts by Amazon to dissuade it. New Jersey passed a statewide ban soon after, and a similar ban is working its way through the New York City Council. Before this year there was only one jurisdiction that required businesses to accept cash: Massachusetts, which passed a law nearly 40 years ago."The potential societal cost of a cashless economy I think outweighs the potential benefits for businesses," said Ritchie Torres, a New York City councilman for the South Bronx who introduced the bill.Policymakers argue that while cashless enterprises aren't widespread now, the practice could expand to more services, including some that cater to lower-income people.Walmart-owned Sam's Club opened its first cashier-less store in Dallas last year, using technology that allows customers to scan and pay for items with their smartphones. Kroger has installed similar technology in about 400 stores nationwide.Stadiums in Tampa Bay, Florida, and Atlanta have started to go cashless, or nearly cashless, and the Barclays Center, where the Brooklyn Nets play, is now effectively cashless as well.Advocates for cashless bans worry technology is moving too fast for the 6.5% of American households — 8.4 million — who do not have a bank account, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.Figueroa is among the much larger group considered "underbanked," meaning they have a primary bank account but regularly rely on alternative financial services like check cashers. More than 24 million U.S. households are underbanked, according to the FDIC.The issue disproportionately affects African-American and Hispanic communities. About 17% of African-American and 14% of Hispanic households have no bank accounts, compared to just 3% of white households, according to the FDIC.Figueroa, an immigrant from the Dominican Republic, only opened a credit union account two years ago. It took another year to build up enough funds to use his debit card regularly.He still occasionally relies on a check casher if he needs money quickly, and much of his income comes in cash from his weekend job as a busboy. He has no credit card and no apps on his phone and has only shopped online three times.Business owners who go cashless say they are following the lead of the majority of customers who are abandoning cash payments. Retailers are under pressure to cater to customers with heightened expectations for fast and seamless service, driven by companies like Amazon, Uber and Grubhub.Leo Kremer, co-owner of Dos Toros, said the volume of cash transactions at his stores fell from about 50% a decade ago to 15% last year. That made the cost and logistics of handling cash especially onerous. Before going cashless, Dos Toros locations were robbed twice.Still, Kremer said the company would adjust if legally required to accept cash."There are no bad guys on this issue. Everyone is trying to do the right thing and make sure there are no unintended consequences," he said.Critics say banning cash-free stores is an over-reaction.There are no overall estimates on how many U.S. stores have gone cashless, but it remains a rarity. In New York City, the trend appears to be gaining traction mostly with "fast casual" dining establishments like Dos Toros. Far more common are stores that require a minimum purchase for non-cash payments."To call this a trend is a bit of an exaggeration," said J. Craig Shearman, a spokesman for the National Retail Federation in Washington. "It's not something the average customer would expect to see at every store at the mall any time soon."In testimony to a New York City Council committee, Kremer argued that businesses that "consistently serve the unbanked and underbanked population aren't going to go cashless. It wouldn't make sense for them."But financial experts who work with low-income people caution against making assumptions about the shopping preferences or buying power of those who rely on cash."I'm uncomfortable with the idea that certain people don't shop here so it's fine to exclude them," said Justine Zinkin, CEO of Neighborhood Trust Financial Partners, a financial counseling nonprofit affiliated with the credit union where Figueroa banks.___AP Retail Writer Joe Pisani contributed to this report from New York.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Daisuke WakabayashiSAN FRANCISCO — Alphabet’s board of directors agreed to pay a former top Google executive as much as $45 million when he resigned from the company in 2016 after being accused of groping a subordinate.The previously undisclosed sum was in the separation agreement for Amit Singhal, a senior vice president who ran Google’s search operations until February 2016. The amount was revealed on Monday in a shareholder lawsuit accusing the board of directors of Alphabet, the parent of Google, of shirking their responsibilities by agreeing to pay executives accused of misconduct instead of firing them for cause.The suit was part of the fallout over how Google has handled sexual harassment cases. The New York Times reported in October that Google had handsomely paid several high-ranking executives in separation agreements after they were credibly accused of sexual harassment, even though the men could have been fired for cause. In one case, Google handed a $90 million exit package to Andy Rubin, who used to head its Android division, after he was accused of sexual misconduct.The shareholder lawsuit was filed in January in California Superior Court with redactions in the passages referring to board discussions. An amended version was filed on Monday without the redactions.Frank Bottini, an attorney for the shareholders, said the board-approved payments were an “abdication of responsibility.”A Google spokeswoman said Monday that the company had “made many changes to our workplace and taken an increasingly hard line on inappropriate conduct by people in positions of authority.” She added, “There are serious consequences for anyone who behaves inappropriately at Google.”According to the amended suit, Google agreed to pay Mr. Singhal $15 million a year for two years and between $5 million and $15 million in the third year as long as he was not employed by a competitor. He agreed to take a job at Uber about a year after his departure, then resigned from the ride-hailing company a few weeks later when the sexual harassment claim at Google became public.Mr. Singhal left Google after an employee said he had groped her at an off-site event. Google investigated the allegation and found that Mr. Singhal had been inebriated. The company also concluded that the employee’s account was credible. At the time, Mr. Singhal said he wanted to spend more time with his family and focus on his philanthropy.Mr. Singhal did not respond to a request for comment.The suit also cited board meeting minutes confirming The Times’s report of the $90 million exit package for Mr. Rubin. A Google employee with whom he was having an extramarital relationship accused him of coercing her into oral sex. She filed a complaint, and the company’s investigation found her account to be credible. The separation agreement for Mr. Rubin was also contingent on his agreeing to refrain from working with rivals.“This lawsuit simply repeats much of the recent media coverage, mischaracterizes Andy’s departure from Google and sensationalizes claims made about Andy by his ex-wife,” Mr. Rubin’s lawyer, Ellen Stross, said in a statement Monday. “Andy acknowledges having had a consensual relationship with a Google employee. However, Andy strongly denies any misconduct, and we look forward to telling his story in court.”The payout for Mr. Rubin sparked widespread outrage at Google and, last fall, prompted a walkout of 20,000 employees who demanded that the company improve its handling of harassment claims. After the walkout, Google ended its practice of forced arbitration for claims of sexual harassment or assault.Google Walkout for Real Change, the organizer of the walkout, said a statement Monday: “The details of these outrageous exit packages, signed off personally by Google’s executives, are a symptom of a culture that protects and awards all harassers. Google is badly in need of accountable leadership and real, systemic changes.”The lawsuit also provided a window into the workings of Alphabet’s board and the power exerted by Larry Page, a co-founder of Google and Alphabet’s chief executive.According to the suit, the board’s compensation committee proposed paying Mr. Rubin a salary of $650,000 in April 2014 with the opportunity for him to get a bonus of more than double his salary. At the time, Mr. Rubin was an adviser to Google and no longer running the Android business.The lawsuit said Mr. Rubin had declined to accept that pay package until he had spoken to Mr. Page. In August 2014, Mr. Page awarded a $150 million stock grant to Mr. Rubin.Eight days after the $150 million grant was awarded, a Google official emailed the board committee asking for approval of Mr. Rubin’s compensation. Without any additional documents, the committee members — Paul S. Otellini, Intel’s former chief executive, who died in 2017; John Doerr of the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins; and Ram Shriram of the venture firm Sherpalo Ventures — said they had approved it, according to the suit.Mr. Doerr and Mr. Shriram did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Google awarded Mr. Rubin the grant even though there was an active investigation into his misconduct. When Mr. Page ultimately decided to part ways with Mr. Rubin, the $150 million stock grant was a sizable bargaining chip that Mr. Rubin used to negotiate his exit package since an executive’s stock compensation is often taken into consideration during settlement talks.Through an Alphabet spokesman, Mr. Page declined to comment.Follow Daisuke Wakabayashi on Twitter: @daiwaka.Kate Conger contributed reporting.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byThe Vermont socialist is suddenly rich. Is he any wiser?By Bret StephensOpinion Columnist“I wrote a best-selling book. If you write a best-selling book, you can be a millionaire, too.” With those insouciant words, Bernie Sanders acknowledged on Tuesday that he has joined the ranks of the “millionaires and billionaires” he has vilified for most of his career.Condolences, senator.Sanders has plenty of company. In 2018 there were 10.23 million American households with a net worth of between $1 million and $5 million, not including their primary residence. That’s an increase of about 250,000 from 2017. Another 1.4 million households are worth between $5 million and $25 million, and 173,000 households are still north of that.Nor is Sanders alone in Congress, even — or especially — among Democrats. About half of all Senate Democrats in 2018 were millionaires. That includes Virginia’s Mark Warner (worth $90.2 million, according to Roll Call), Connecticut’s Richard Blumenthal ($70 million), and California’s Dianne Feinstein ($58.5 million). At the time, Sanders’s net worth came to zero, a sum that was at least consistent with his worldview (though he did somehow manage to own three homes). But now he’s flush, and destined to pay higher taxes, so maybe his opinions will change. In his biography of Harry Truman, David McCullough noted that the 33rd president was shocked by how little money was left to him after he had to pay 67 percent of his hard-won earnings in state and federal taxes.With Sanders, I won’t get my hopes up. But his experience of sudden wealth ought at least to temper the hard and ugly edges of his class-war politics. Getting rich is not a form of theft. As often as not, it’s the result of a service. Being rich is not a sin. Typically, it’s the result of long labor, patient saving, prudent investment, gutsy risk-taking, and some stroke of originality.And becoming richer is no shame. Wealth and philanthropy tend to correlate. Of America’s 10 richest people, four have given away at least $1 billion and/or 20 percent of their net worth to charity. In terms of charitable donations by individuals as a percentage of G.D.P., the United States is by far the most generous, giving $410 billion to charity in 2017. The average American gives nearly twice as much to charity as the average New Zealander, the runner-up among giving nations. A Sanders supporter might concede some of this, while rejoining that great wealth is inherently corrupting (and unnecessary), and that great inequality is inherently dangerous to democracy (and just plain wrong). That’s the thinking that now animates the movement on the left to get rid of billionaires altogether, or at least cut them down to size with punitive taxation. Yet it’s never been clear why it’s immoral to be a billionaire but not a mere millionaire — other than, perhaps, the envy that those whose income is in the 95th percentile (college professors, for instance) tend to feel toward those in the 99th (finance people). Is there a consistent moral principle that distinguishes the relative goodness of five, six or even seven zeroes in your portfolio versus the badness of eight or a full nine?It’s also unclear how Steve Jobs’s or Bill Gates’s fortunes ever denied anyone a penny, except for the dollars voluntarily shelled out to purchase iPhones and Windows. In the U.S., billionaires don’t take wealth, as Russian oligarchs, Saudi princes, or Chinese officials do. They create it. And in creating it, they create jobs, opportunities, services, choice, equity, efficiencies, and sometimes even beauty — the reason why capitalist societies are invariably more attractive and dynamic than non-capitalist ones.Is this an argument for unregulated capitalism? No. Is it a claim that billionaires have superior virtues? No. Does it suggest that the uber-rich should have greater title to our political life than the rest of us? No. Does it mean we can only find earthly fulfillment through profit-maximization rather than joy-optimization?Come on.But the idea that people can be judged as individuals based on the economic class to which they belong is one of the foulest in history, matching if not exceeding in its murderous consequences the legacies of racism and colonialism combined. When Sanders inveighs against billyinaehs (millyinaehs being presumably no longer as odious to him today as they were just a few years ago) he is engaged in a form of stereotyping that is no less bigoted, or dangerous, for being aimed at so few.Still, I won’t give up all hope that Sanders might not come to see the error of his thinking. After leaving the U.S. Senate, the late George McGovern — Sanders’s precursor in many ways — decided he would try his hand in the world of business by operating an inn and restaurant in Connecticut. It didn’t go so well.“My business associates and I,” he wrote in a memorable 1992 Wall Street Journal op-ed, “also lived with federal, state and local rules that were all passed with the objective of helping employees, protecting the environment, raising tax dollars for schools, protecting our customers from fire hazards, etc. While I never have doubted the worthiness of any of these goals, the concept that most often eludes legislators is: ‘Can we make consumers pay the higher prices for the increased operating costs that accompany public regulation and government reporting requirements with reams of red tape.’ It is a simple concern that is nonetheless often ignored by legislators.”The op-ed began with a line from Justice Felix Frankfurter: “Wisdom too often never comes, and so one ought not to reject it merely because it comes late.” For McGovern, wisdom came at the price of bankruptcy. For Sanders, maybe it will come with the rewards of wealth.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Its migration westward offers more convenient shopping for the Frieze and Art Basel set, now nesting part-time in condominiums along the High Line, along with the yet-to-materialize denizens of Hudson Yards.The move comes as 1stdibs continues to expand as a global e-commerce site, a process that has not always been smooth for the dealers that are its lifeblood. Nearly three years ago, they were affronted by changes that added commissions to sales generated through the site and also veiled their names. “We lost 2 percent of our dealers when we changed our policy,” said David Rosenblatt, the company’s C.E.O. “But since we introduced e-commerce, we’ve grown our inventory from 440,000 items to 860,000.” Some dealers still grumble privately. Others who once balked say they are eager to continue a relationship with the company. “We didn’t end up raising prices," said Kiel Wuellner, president of Newel Gallery, in business since 1939, and with a capacious booth in the Terminal Stores building and 7,000 pieces on the site. “What happened is that we are no longer able to pass along our standard trade or discount pricing. But the reason we have invested in 1stdibs is the amount of business it brings us. We’re the largest antiques shop in New York City for the past 80 years, and this makes us global.”There are now 4,000 dealers from 28 countries (more than half of which are outside the United States) on 1stdibs, according to the company; last year, e-commerce sales reached over $250 million, up from zero in 2016. But sometimes you want to see and feel “the most beautiful things on earth,” as the site promises, in person before plunking down the credit card.In the Aero booth, a powder-coated dark green aluminum outdoor chair by Thomas O’Brien with a whorled back is $1050. The polyethylene version of Faye Toogood’s plump Roly Poly chair, priced at $570 and already a best-seller on the 1stdibs website, is a bargain when you consider its bronze incarnation costs $45,000. Among a funky, still-anarchic-looking collection of ’70s-era Italian Radical design by Gufram are contemporary productions of that impish work: anthropomorphic green foam coat racks by Guido Drocco and Franco Mello start at about $4,600; Bocca, the disco-glam lip-shaped sofa by Studio 65, is about $7,500. A slightly grubby, but comfy looking, brown corduroy Danish modern sofa in Nate Berkus’s booth is $4,400. At Assouline, which has a booth here too, you can find Miles Redd’s “The Big Book of Chic” for $85.Last Wednesday, Inga Davidsson of Area ID was hanging an Italian chandelier of florid amber-colored glass ribbons and curlicues tipped in red, Venetian style ($4,950) in her 315-square-foot booth: a north facing spot with a window, prime real estate that she is renting for $3,200 a month. Ms. Davidsson sells an eclectic selection of midcentury furniture artfully styled, like a bergère from the ’50s now covered in a bold Miró-like fabric ($2,950) along with contemporary shagreen pieces. For more than a decade, Area ID had a storefront on Elizabeth Street. But in 2015, a new owner of the building more than tripled Ms. Davidsson’s $10,000 monthly rent, and she had to give it up. “I couldn’t imagine how anyone would be able to pay that amount, unless they were selling drugs or prostitutes,” she said. (Her story is typical: Manhattan is lousy with empty storefronts; remedies like commercial rent control, in place here from 1945 to 1963, are not quite back on the table, but a bill called the Small Business Jobs Survival Act, which would help commercial tenants negotiate new leases, among other protections, has been gathering support.) “I hear there is a men’s bag store there now,” Ms. Davidsson said of her old place. “I wish them luck.”As for the former 1stdibs space at 200 Lexington, you’ll still find more than 50 dealers who’ve signed on with Incollect, the 4-and-a-half-year-old 1stdibs competitor. Others have opened their own showrooms in the building. The beloved antiques store Lost City Arts, which will give up its lease on Cooper Square in March, will have a 4,500 square feet showroom there. It also has a booth at the 1stdibs Gallery.Penelope Green is a reporter for Styles.

Now it needs to make sure the two cultures merge without squelching the energy that made the agency such a standout.Accenture’s deeper push into advertising reflects the ad industry’s rapidly changing competitive landscape. The company’s marketing arm has grown significantly in recent years as broader shifts in consumer behavior have reordered what advertising truly encompasses. In the past, it was about coming up with attention-grabbing ads. Now, it is also about providing broader consumer experiences.That has made the fight for marketing dollars that much more fierce, with traditional ad agencies jostling with Silicon Valley firms, consultants and upstarts for business.“We’re working with clients to reinvent how consumers buy their particular products and services,” Brian Whipple, the chief executive of Accenture Interactive, the company’s digital agency, said. He pointed to the development of wearable devices for Carnival Cruise Lines and new fitting-room technology at clothing stores.“We expect to have an Uber-like, Amazon-like experience when we go to a restaurant or go to a retail store or when we order products online,” he said.As the firm takes on more ambitious consumer experience projects for brands, it must incorporate “media and advertising and brand strategy and the like, and that’s where Droga and team come into play,” Mr. Whipple, 53, said.[Read more about the uncertain future of advertising as we know it.]Terms of the deal, which was announced on Wednesday, were not disclosed. The acquisition was roughly a year in the making and is expected to close by the end of May.Droga5, which employs more than 500 people, will become part of Accenture Interactive.Absorbing an independent agency into a larger entity can pose its own issues, however, said Greg Paull, a principal at R3, a consulting firm that works with agencies and marketers.“It will be a challenge to mix the two cultures together because they are quite different,” he said. Still, he added, “it’s shifting the paradigm from a purely creative-led business to more of a strategic and consulting-led business.”Droga5, which was founded in 2006 by David Droga, has become one of the best-known independent ad agencies in the United States. (The “5” was appended because Mr. Droga, 50, grew up as the youngest of five brothers.) Droga5 last reported annual revenue for 2017, when it exceeded $200 million.Some of its notable campaigns include Under Armour’s with the dancer Misty Copeland; Anna Kendrick’s almost-Super Bowl commercial for Newcastle Brown Ale, a digital campaign in which the beer company imagined the “mega-huge football” spot it would have made if it could have afforded one; and this year’s “Game of Thrones” surprise Super Bowl ad with Bud Light. Droga5 is also responsible for The New York Times’s ad campaign featuring the motto “The Truth Is Hard.”Being subsumed into a larger consulting firm represents a sharp turn. Other prominent independent agencies have steadfastly maintained their autonomy. In 2017, Wieden & Kennedy in Portland, Ore., which is best known for its work with Nike, backed a new agency in Austin, Tex., on the condition that it would remain independent. Colleen DeCourcy, Wieden & Kennedy’s co-president, said at the time, “Our whole abhorrence of controlling interest in anything is that you lose the independence to put the work first.”Mr. Whipple pushed back at the notion that consultants did not understand creativity the way that traditional agencies did, saying that the cultures of Accenture Interactive and Droga5 were more similar than people might expect.“Accenture Interactive has its own culture that is really in no way consulting-like, but I will say if it were to have elements of that, I think that’s a good thing,” he said. Its offices aren’t full of people in suits and ties talking about financials, he added.Accenture Interactive’s revenue rose 30 percent, to $8.5 billion, for the year that ended Aug. 31, accounting for about a fifth of Accenture’s overall revenue. The unit, established in 2009, has acquired dozens of firms in recent years, but Droga5 is its biggest purchase and is expected to give Accenture Interactive new clout in North America.Mr. Droga, who will remain the agency’s creative chairman, said that while he had fielded acquisition offers before, he felt Accenture and his agency complemented each other.“You can have the best advertising out there, but if the e-commerce is not good or the relationship with the customer and the experience isn’t great, then that’s irrelevant,” Mr. Droga said.Mr. Paull said the deal represented a “seismic shift for the industry.”“I really think it’s going to change the mind-set of how consultants are perceived,” he said. While Accenture Interactive has bought several creative agencies overseas, they were “nothing of this scale, and nothing as U.S.-centric as this.”Mr. Droga and Mr. Whipple said they had started acquisition talks about a year ago, using the code name “Stellwagen” for the deal, a reference to a marine sanctuary. (Mr. Whipple is an avid fisherman.) Accenture said it would share more about the internal structure involving Mr. Droga, his executives and Mr. Whipple by the end of May.Analysts and investors have increasingly posed questions to big advertising holding companies about the threat posed by consulting firms. In recent months, executives from the holding companies WPP and IPG have acknowledged their presence in public comments but noted that the firms were not yet big competitors in the creative realm.“They have not made the investment in creativity that we believe is necessary to compete,” Frank Mergenthaler, IPG’s chief financial officer, said of consulting firms at a conference last month.Mr. Whipple said that he viewed Accenture Interactive’s work in customer experience as a new category, and that the firm was more likely to team up with the holding companies than compete with them. Those partnerships may happen less frequently with the acquisition of Droga5, though, he said.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byCredits for Seamless, Uber Eats and the like are a very 21st-century way to support a grieving friend.By Erin Van Der MeerWhen my mother died suddenly last year, at the age of 63, they started coming: gift cards for Seamless, GrubHub and Uber Eats that pinged softly in my inbox. “Don’t forget to eat,” read the note accompanying one credit. Another said, “Because you can’t eat flowers.”Many of these sympathy gifts came from friends living nearby who might have, in an alternate universe, brought over foil-covered baking dishes filled with cheesy casseroles. But in New York City, and in 2019, there are some hurdles to practicing that traditional grieving ritual: tiny kitchens, crowded subway commutes, a 24/7 work culture. Then there are dietary restrictions to consider. For all my loved ones knew, I could have stopped eating dairy or Tom Brady’d tomatoes.Sending a grieving person a gift card instead of delivering homemade food to one’s doorstep may defy the wisdom of Emily Post. But for millions of people who use meal-delivery apps, the funds can come as a welcome gesture of practical kindness.After a memorial service for her mother in Alberta, Canada, Katherine Austin-Evelyn, a philanthropic consultant, returned to her home in Brooklyn to find that a group of friends had sent her a $200 Seamless credit.“When my grandmother died years ago, people brought lasagnas and casseroles,” Ms. Austin-Evelyn, 33, said. “The Seamless gift card felt like my generation’s version of that.”She didn’t mind that the food wasn’t homemade.“It achieved the same outcome,” she said, “which was an expression of care and thoughtfulness, and also being extremely useful.”These apps have made it easier than ever to order takeout, and using them has become a habit for many people. Americans spent $18.5 billion on food delivery services in 2018, up nine percent from the previous year, according to the NPD Group.In addition to their convenience, these credits are an invitation to seek comfort: Order any food you crave, be it pasta from a favorite Italian restaurant or a steaming hot bowl of ramen, without worrying about the cost. Or food waste. Or how long before the Pyrex dishes piling up in your cupboard might constitute hoarding.Catherine Down, 32, an American who has lived in Paris for six years writing about travel and food, said that sending credits helps her to be present for her loved ones living in the U.S. when they experience loss.“When a friend had a miscarriage, I really felt the distance,” Ms. Down recalled. So she ordered snacks for her friend — wasabi peas, mochi, frozen dumplings — and had them delivered to her home. She said that using Instacart and Seamless in these kinds of scenarios makes her feel “proactive, and takes some of the load off the loved one.”All you need to send a Seamless gift card is the recipient’s email, which makes it easy to support even a distant acquaintance. But with its convenience comes the possibility of the gesture seeming generic or lazy, depending on the person and your relationship to them.Amy Cunningham, a funeral director and the owner of Fitting Tribute, a funeral home in Brooklyn, said the gift card should be for a service the person already uses and for a generous amount.“Food is helpful, but give it in abundance,” Ms. Cunningham, 63, said. “You need too much of something when life seems thin and lacking in any kind of pleasure.”Ms. Cunningham suggested spending $125, enough to feed four to six people. It’s also O.K. to ask questions before you spend.“Personalize,” Ms. Cunningham said. “Call someone closer to them to find out what they like and need. It could be groceries, a pot of food or a basket of beautiful fruit. That will do better than $50 on Seamless.”Rebecca Soffer, 42, the co-author of the book “Modern Loss,” lost her mother when she was 30, then her father four years later. “My tiny apartment was filled with at least 14 Edible Arrangements in the days after my mother’s death,” Ms. Soffer said, “so I think Seamless vouchers are a terrific gesture.” She believes a smaller amount — $25 or $50 — is fine, as long as it’s only the first step.“Use it as a catalyst for more meaningful involvement,” she said. “Text, ‘I sent you something, let me know if you want me to come over and share it with you.’ Set weekly calendar reminders to offer something they might need — say, to watch their kids, clean their bathroom or take them out for a stiff drink.”It might also pay to set reminders to check in at three months, six months and a year. While a Seamless credit never expires, the social insulation that immediately follows a death tends to wane after a few weeks. The best thing you can do for someone living with loss is to reach out after the visitors have stopped showing up in waves, while your friend is still stranded on the strange island of grief.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Stanley ReedThe earnings of Saudi Arabia’s giant oil company have long been a mystery, kept under wraps by the country’s government. But on Monday, Saudi Aramco opened its books, revealing that it generated $111.1 billion in net income last year, making it probably the world’s most profitable company by far.It handily beat Apple ($59.5 billion in net income in 2018) and ran laps around other oil companies like Royal Dutch Shell ($23.9 billion) and Exxon Mobil ($20.8 billion). The disclosure reveals a company that is hugely profitable but also tightly bound to one country and the price of oil.Aramco issued the financial data as it prepares to borrow up to $15 billion through a bond sale, in what could signal a more aggressive approach to capital-raising for both the company and Saudi Arabia, which is seeking to cut its dependence on oil and gas revenue.The money will help finance Aramco’s $69 billion purchase of most of a state-owned petrochemical company from Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, whose chairman is Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.The crown prince wants to diversify Saudi Arabia’s economy, and the sovereign wealth fund has been investing in technology companies like Uber and Tesla as a way of doing so. A planned stock sale by Aramco was expected to raise money for that purpose, but it was postponed last year.The sale of a stake in Saudi Basic Industries, the petrochemical company, appears to be an alternative way to raise the funds.While the crown prince pursues new investments and tries to recover from the political fallout caused by the killing of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year, Aramco also appears to be trying to make itself into a broader energy producer and, thus, more attractive if the government decides once again to try to sell a slice of the company.Aramco’s chief executive, Amin Nasser, has said that the company is pursuing international acquisitions in areas like liquefied natural gas, a chilled fuel that can be transported globally on ships like oil.The financial results also show how the company’s fortunes rise and fall with the price of oil. In 2016, for instance, a time of low prices, the company reported only $13.3 billion in net income.For investors, Aramco’s ties to the Saudi government are also a persistent concern. “Unlike Exxon and Chevron, its revenue streams are highly dependent on a single country that could face real instability risks,” Ayham Kamel, an analyst at Eurasia Group, a consulting firm, wrote in a recent note to clients.But analysts said that the financial information revealed on Monday showed that Aramco had plenty of firepower for more deals.Aramco has “a huge amount of room” to issue debt, said David G. Staples, a managing director at Moody’s Investors Service, which issued a credit rating for Aramco on Monday.Mr. Staples and a colleague, Rehan Akbar, noted that the company had already achieved enormous size and profitability without borrowing or selling stock to investors. In 2018, Aramco paid about $160 billion to the government in dividends, taxes and royalties.Moody’s attributed Aramco’s profitability in part to economies of scale stemming from enormous production volumes extracted from oil and gas assets of unmatched size. Aramco has some of the world’s largest oil fields, leading to very low costs.“Aramco’s scale of production in combination with its vast hydrocarbon resources is a very strong competitive advantage,” Moody’s analysts wrote.The prospectus reveals some long-hidden details about the size of Saudi Arabia’s oil fields. Chief among these is a monster called Ghawar, which extends for about 120 miles in the eastern part of the country. The world’s largest oil field, according to the prospectus, Ghawar has accounted for more than half of Saudi Arabia’s cumulative production yet it still has reserves of 48 billion barrels and is capable of producing nearly four million barrels a day, both more than all but a handful of countries.The oil wealth doesn’t stop there. The kingdom has four more fields that dwarf most others.Aramco produced 13.6 million barrels per day in 2018 on average, more than three times the 3.8 million barrels per day reported by Exxon Mobil, according to the report. Over all, its revenue was about $360 billion.Moody’s wrote that Aramco was “conservatively managed” with “very low debt levels.”Mr. Staples said that based on his conversations with Aramco officials, he expected this careful approach to debt to continue, a policy that is likely to find favor with investors if the Saudi government decides to revive its I.P.O. plans.The agency rated the company A1, a strong rating but below that of large Western oil companies including Exxon Mobil and Shell. Mr. Staples said the lower rating reflected the concentration of most of Aramco’s operations in Saudi Arabia, which shares the same credit rating, and the government’s dependence on oil and gas revenue.The thinking is that if Saudi Arabia were to encounter political instability or hard times, the oil company would feel the impact. “We have to take into account the risk profile” of the country, he said.The company, founded by United States oil companies (Aramco is short for Arabian American Oil Company), was nationalized by the Saudi government in the 1970s.In its prospectus, Aramco listed some of the risks and drawbacks that it faced in its operations. The Saudi government, for instance, determines how much oil Saudi Aramco should produce “based on its sovereign energy security goals or for any other reason.” The company also may face litigation over climate change or antitrust issues stemming from its membership in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, especially in the United States, Aramco’s prospectus said.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported bySOCIAL Q’SA grandmother finds her daughter and son-in-law’s P.D.A. unfit for their 5-year-old child’s eyes.By Philip GalanesI am 62 and no prude. Honest! I am also a grandmother with a part-time job, so I help out my daughter with child care twice a week. I am often sitting in the kitchen with my daughter and 5-year-old grandson when my son-in-law comes home and exchanges a passionate, open-mouthed kiss with my daughter. I think it’s terrible to subject a boy to the sight of his parents’ sexualized kissing. (I don’t want to see it either.) I am determined to say something, but my husband, who shies from conflict, suggested I check with you first. Thoughts?CAROLINELet’s talk about modeling — and not the runway variety. I mean the kind where parents show their children, by example, what loving adult behavior looks like. I don’t believe I ever saw my parents exchange more than a purse-lipped peck. Now, add a dollop of gay shame from the ’70s (in my case) and presto! I had a hard time, as a young guy, synthesizing domesticity and sex.Your grandson may be in a better starting position than I was (or than many of us were) by witnessing his parents’ romantic kissing as an ordinary feature of married life. And since these “open-mouthed” kisses are the worst offense you mention, I think you should let it go.Because another big advantage your grandson currently enjoys is having a loving grandmother built into his weekly routine. Do your best to safeguard that — which means holding back, when possible, from criticizing the way your daughter and son-in-law run their household. As a parent of adult children, it often pays to be quiet about the ways their choices differ from yours.I am 18, and I have a younger sister who is 14. Our relationship is tense (to say the least). When I was her age, I had acne. I grew out of it, but she’s just starting to get mild breakouts. Here’s the problem: She globs this cheap concealer on top of her pimples, which only makes them more noticeable (and last longer, in my experience). I’d like to help her, but I think she’d get mad — like I was teasing her. And I’m not! What would you do?STELLAYour letter made me happier than any other I got this week, Stella! It signals that you’re turning a corner with your sister. You may not be BFFs yet (or ever!), but you’re looking out for her, which is kindhearted, and worrying in advance about rubbing her the wrong way, which is thoughtful. All this augurs well for the future.Go to your sister and say, “Listen, I had worse acne than you. It gets better, I promise. But can I tell you some things that worked for me?” If she’s open to hearing your suggestions, go for it! As for the cheap concealer, steer clear of telling her it’s making her look worse. That may only make her more self-conscious. Go with your other point: that it makes blemishes last longer. Good luck and keep at it, big sister!We are a couple in our 70s and good friends with a young couple in their 30s. But when we invite them to dinner, we have a hard time getting them to leave. Being young, they can visit late into the night. But we like to call it quits by 10. Recently, I was having a special meal and wanted to invite them, but I didn’t because of this problem. What can I do?S.Use your words! As hosts, it’s thoughtful to consider our guests’ desires, but there’s no need to cater to them absolutely. (Nor should you put much stock in telepathic messaging or theatrical yawns.) At 10 p.m., say, “Thanks so much for coming! We had a great time. But we have an early morning, so we’ll say ‘good night’ now.” They will thank you, gather their coats and leave. And it won’t be awkward, at all. I promise!A young relative posted on Facebook, asking for an early-morning ride to the airport from her university. Her mom (in another town) responded: “How much is the shuttle bus?” Her daughter answered: “LOL! But Uber is over $40.” So, now we know this young woman values her friend’s time and automobiles at less than $40 and thinks that riding on a bus with peasants is laughable. The poster and her family can afford $40, and the shuttle is comfortable, reliable and safe. (My wife uses it frequently.) Why does she feel entitled to make chauffeurs of her friends?ANONYMOUSI know someone who’s not volunteering a lift! And that’s your right, of course. Who knows, though? Maybe another pal is driving right by the airport that morning and won’t mind dropping her off.But more important, life teaches us lessons over time. It seems as if your young relative has not yet learned how inconvenient and unpopular most requests for airport drop-offs (and pickups) are. After she’s been pressed into duty once or twice, I suspect she’ll figure it out pronto.For help with your awkward situation, send a question to SocialQ@nytimes.com, to Philip Galanes on Facebook or @SocialQPhilip on Twitter.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byGood Monday. (Want this by email? Sign up here.)The special counsel, Robert Mueller, did not find evidence that President Trump coordinated with Russia to influence the 2016 election, Attorney General William Barr said yesterday. But the White House still faces legal challenges.Mr. Trump claimed victory from the report, which concluded Mr. Mueller’s two-year investigation into the Russia issue. Especially comforting to the president: Mr. Mueller did not recommend additional indictments of his inner circle.The president was not found to have obstructed justice, Mr. Barr added, saying that the special counsel did not find enough evidence. But the report did not exonerate Mr. Trump on this accusation, as Mr. Mueller did not provide a verdict either way.Mr. Trump derided the inquiry as an “illegal takedown that failed,” and demanded that those responsible for it face additional scrutiny. That triumphalism ran counter to advice from aides.But the White House isn’t in the clear yet. Congressional Democrats pledged to continue pursuing investigations into Trump and his allies. And prosecutors in New York City are still investigating an array of issues that touch on Mr. Trump’s business and political dealings.The markets may get a small boost from the end of the investigation, according to analysts who spoke to CNBC.China’s top economic policymakers have promised more market-based competition and international trade, in the latest sign that the country is eager to end its trade war with the U.S., Keith Bradsher of the NYT writes.The promises being made were significant. Officials at the China Development Forum, the country’s premier annual economic policy conference, spoke of increasing imports, a desire for more foreign investment and a willingness to allow foreign financial firms to own larger stakes in their Chinese competitors.They may sound familiar, however. “Chinese officials have said for years that they were ready to allow foreign competitors to enter their market on a more equal footing,” Mr. Bradsher writes. “The promises made over the weekend in many cases repeated pledges that have been made before.”But China now has other reasons to embrace openness. “In addition to a trade war that is hitting the country’s exporters, China’s economy has also been hurt by private sector business leaders who have become increasingly cautious in recent months about making new investments,” Mr. Bradsher adds.The promises will most likely feature in trade talks. American and Chinese officials are scheduled to hold trade talks in Beijing in the coming days, and another round of talks in Washington the following week.The airplane maker is taking more steps to convince the authorities and customers that fixes for its 737 Max 8 jets — two of which have crashed in recent months — are near.It tested a software update  for the Max 8 aircraft with pilots from five airlines over the weekend, the NYT reports. Using flight simulators, the pilots were able to safely land planes suffering from problems believed to have brought down Lion Air Flight 610 last year.And the company outlined other software fixes that are meant to eliminate flaws in an automated piloting program at the heart of the crashes. Boeing also said that it would now make two previously optional safety features on the planes free of charge.But Boeing is facing heat from Congress over the safety-certification process that cleared the Max 8 for flight. Lawmakers are concerned about how much responsibility the company held for certifying the safety of its own planes.More Boeing news: How the company rushed to roll out the 737 Max to catch up with Airbus. Why the crashes highlight the challenges of adding modern software to older technology. And why JPMorgan Chase economists worry about broader fallout from Boeing’s problems.The yield curve is essentially the difference between interest rates on short-term government bonds and long-term government bonds. Since 1960, every time that it has inverted — when long-term rates were lower than short-term rates — a recession has followed.It happened on Friday.More on that from Matt Phillips of the NYT:• “The yield on the 10-year Treasury note tumbled to 2.44 percent Friday, its lowest level since January 2018. That was just below the 2.45 percent yield on three-month Treasury bills.”• “Research from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco has cited the yield difference between three-month Treasury bills and 10-year Treasury notes — which inverted Friday — as the most reliable predictor of recession risk.”• “On Friday, the S&P 500 fell 1.9 percent, as stock market investors grew concerned about the outlook for economic growth. It was the second-worst drop for the market this year.”Don’t hyperventilate. Some parts of the yield curve have not yet inverted, and experts say the inversion doesn’t necessarily predict economic collapse. “A model is just a model,” Campbell Harvey, a Duke University finance professor, told the NYT. “It’s not an oracle. It helps us forecast the future, but it might at any point fail.”With smartphone sales stagnating, Apple is making a push to make money from services. And today, we find out what that looks like, as the company makes a series of announcements about its moves into the world of media. Here’s what to expect:• Video streaming. According to the WSJ, Apple has “used a $1 billion budget to buy dozens of original TV shows in hopes it can land a breakout hit,” and plans to announce tie-ups to offer $9.99 subscriptions for channels like HBO and Showtime. Original content would reportedly “be delivered in a new TV app that staff have been calling a Netflix killer,” and also require a subscription.• News. The company’s new news-subscription service is expected to cost $9.99 a month and provide “access to more than 200 magazines — including Bon Appétit, People and Glamour — as well as newspapers,” according to the WSJ.• And maybe games? Bloomberg suggests that the company might even announce “a premium games subscription for its App Store.” This wouldn’t be the cloud gaming of the kind announced by Google last week, but bundles of games for the iPhone and iPad.You can watch the event here, starting at 1 p.m. Eastern.The British prime minister is struggling for control and respect as she tries again to gain Parliament’s support for her Brexit deal this week.Her week starts with a tense cabinet meeting, with her Conservative Party in “uproar after ministers discussed replacing her as leader just weeks before the Brexit deadline,” according to the FT.Lawmakers will then try to undermine her control of Brexit, when they vote later today on a plan “to take control of the legislative agenda for a single day,” Bloomberg explains. “This would allow lawmakers to express support for different options ranging from a second referendum to a customs union with the E.U. and even canceling Brexit.”She’s still hawking her Brexit deal. But meetings over the weekend with high-profile Euroskeptic lawmakers, including Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, failed to gain their backing. That means she still lacks the support needed to win a third vote on her proposal.All this comes against the backdrop of public demand for a second referendum on Brexit. On Saturday, an estimated 1 million people marched through London to demand a new vote on leaving the E.U.As the S.E.C. and Elon Musk continue to fight in court over his tweeting, the Tesla C.E.O. fired back on Friday. His latest argument: the agency is incorrectly interpreting a settlement agreement between the two.Mr. Musk’s insists his tweet review process is O.K. In his view, he is supposed to only run tweets containing material information about Tesla by an in-house lawyer — and he is free to determine what qualifies. An earlier draft of the settlement, offered by the S.E.C., would have required him to run all public statements by a lawyer. He rejected that proposal.He also says the tweet that drew the ire of the S.E.C. wasn’t controversial. His comment about Tesla production forecasts, he argues, contained information that had previously been made public, and was made after stock markets closed for the day. But the S.E.C. says that’s an after-the-fact rationalization.It’s up to a judge to decide whether Mr. Musk violated the settlement and should be held in contempt. The S.E.C. has declined to ask for a hearing on the matter, The Verge reports, since it believes it has already made its case.Silicon Valley’s business model pretty much relies on pervasive screens being a good thing. But Big Tech’s most successful executives increasingly spend lots of money to shelter themselves from the digital reality they helped create, Nellie Bowles of the NYT reports, potentially creating a new class divide.• At first, tech products like Facebook and Gmail were democratic: They were the same no matter who you were, and they were free. Companies extolled the value of widespread laptop use in schools, arguing that they were preparing kids for the future.• But now schools that are short of cash, like those in Kansas, focus on screens, not human interaction. And low-income elderly patients rely on digital avatars to keep them company.• Meanwhile, Ms. Bowles writes, “As wealthy kids are growing up with less screen time, poor kids are growing up with more. How comfortable someone is with human engagement could become a new class marker.”• “The wealthy can afford to opt out of having their data and their attention sold as a product.

Samuel Donaldson is a generous man. I’ve hung out with him at the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament, and the one thing he has never been accused of is being cheap or copping out on buying a round of drinks. Right, Mr. Donaldson? Make mine a martini. Wobbled, not stirred.15A: The “Big farm workers” in this clue are not human farmhands; they’re OXEN.42A: Interesting historical side note: This is the first time the entry NCC has been clued to the Starship Enterprise from “Star Trek,” even though it was used twice before in the late 1980s and early 1990s. 45A: “Speak, hands, for me!” And thus did CASCA stab Julius Caesar in Act III, Scene 1 of Shakespeare’s play. And the first two words of the next line, spoken by Caesar, make up a frequent entry in crosswords: “Et tu, Brute? Then fall, Caesar!”62A: Thank goodness the clue included “The Persistence of Memory.” I knew that one. “‘The Burning Giraffe’ and ‘The Persistence of Memory’” are DALIS, as in two paintings by Salvador Dalí.3D: I honestly thought “Let off the hook?” might have something to do with throwing back a fish, but the answer is UNSNAG. Maybe the “hook” refers to crocheting and we’re unsnagging yarn.9D: ENT. ENT, ENT, ENT. I’m committing that to memory, because it has been in the puzzle 403 times (this time clued as “Tolkien tree being”) and yet I invariably write in ORC.32D: The “Change of locks?” in this puzzle is not about the locks in doors, but the locks on your head. The answer is NEW ’DO.There are many ways to be generous, and Mr. Donaldson offers us four drinks on the house, which is, I think we can all agree, exceedingly nice of him. The trick to this puzzle is to finish solving before you become completely sloshed. I am a professional, so I’m sure that won’t happen. [Uh oh. — Ed.]We have a set of four phrases (the last one is split between two entries) that all mean that Mr. Donaldson is buying the drinks. Let’s imbibe, sorry, examine them, one by one.17A: The clue for all these theme entries is “Welcome comment at a bar.” Well, sure. Who wouldn’t like to hear “IT’S MY TREAT?” I’ll have a lemon drop martini, Mr. Donaldson, thank you.23A: Another? I shouldn’t. When you said “DRINKS ON ME” I thought you were kidding, but if you’re serious, I’ll try one of those cosmos. Is it hot in here, or is it me?35A: You are all such wonderful people. No, really. I don’t tell you that enough. I’m so glad we’re friends. Pass another one of those martoonis over here. Was that Mr. Donaldson saying, “I’LL GET THE BILL,” Officer?49A/57A: Why is there two of everything? I am half as think as you tipsy I am. Pretty sure I heard Mr. Donaldson say “YOUR MONEY’S / NO GOOD HERE.” Okey doke. One more for the … uh ... the way home.Someone call me an Uber. What I don’t do for my job. This is going to hurt like heck tomorrow. The original theme idea was a little too complicated for a Tuesday puzzle — I had the same theme entries, but instead of cluing them straightforwardly as in the published puzzle, I clued them in an unconventional manner. So the clue for YOUR MONEY’S NO GOOD HERE, for example, was along the lines of “Discouraging message to a counterfeiter?” I guess I was unsure whether the theme entries themselves were interesting enough, so I thought upping the wackiness in the clues might make it more entertaining. The more direct clues certainly make the puzzle more Tuesday friendly; hopefully seasoned solvers don't find it too straightforward. If they do, well, there’s always another puzzle tomorrow. As always, I appreciate the work of the editorial team in giving the puzzle some crisper clues — whatever you like in the puzzle is very likely because of their efforts.Almost finished solving but need a bit more help? We’ve got you covered.Warning: There be spoilers ahead, but subscribers can take a peek at the answer key.Trying to get back to the puzzle page? Right here.

Even the Saturdays.  @NYTimesWordplay AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byTimes InsiderBy Luis Ferré-SadurníTimes Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.It was mid-January, and I had just reported that New York City had sued a group of current and former real estate professionals who supposedly used Airbnb to convert more than 100 apartments across the city into illegal hotel rooms for tourists.The allegations were staggering.Over three years, they lodged almost 76,000 guests across 35 residential buildings, including an entire seven-unit building that was unlawfully rented to tourists through Airbnb, the lawsuit said. The city claimed the operation brought in more than $20 million in revenue by violating laws and Airbnb’s own restrictions.How exactly did they pull it off?That was the question posed to me by Cliff Levy, my boss, and Dodai Stewart, my editor. The 2,500-word answer to that question is the basis for my article “Inside the Rise and Fall of a Multimillion-Dollar Airbnb Scheme,” which offers a look at how cunning entrepreneurs exploit Airbnb’s platform to turn a profit.I’ve covered housing for the Metro desk for almost a year, writing mostly about the city’s struggle to fix its crumbling public housing system. I’ve also covered New York City’s continuing clash with Airbnb, one of several regulatory battles the city has had with tech giants, like Uber, as it deciphers the impact of the so-called sharing economy on New Yorkers.Critics of Airbnb argue that many people use the platform to convert residential apartments into de facto hotels for tourists, worsening the city’s tight rental market and affordable housing crisis. There are laws in place to prevent this conduct, but they are often abused and the city has filed several lawsuits to take down unlawful Airbnbs before. This year, the city sued a real estate developer who supposedly used Airbnb to rent out 13 Manhattan apartments to travelers and made $1.1 million in revenue.But the lawsuit I reported on was the biggest yet, seeking more than $20 million from the defendants.As I began to pore over the hundreds of court documents, the inner workings of the operation became clearer. A complex web of corporations were set up to receive payments, about 100 different host accounts were created and dozens of misleading identities were used to book tourists since at least 2015, the documents revealed.I interviewed city officials, questioned landlords whose buildings were improperly used to book guests and spoke to tourists who had stayed at the apartments.It appeared a handful of people had engineered a commercial operation against local regulations, listing more than 100 apartments on Airbnb and using multiple email addresses to circumvent the company’s own rule of one apartment per host.The article was also a collaborative effort. With the help of Sarah Almukhtar, a graphics editor, we mapped out the locations of the Airbnb apartments, which stretched south from Harlem to trendy neighborhoods like Chelsea and SoHo.Doris Burke, a researcher at The Times, dug up old lawsuits against the business partners behind the alleged scheme. That led to me to building owners who claimed they had been deceived by the partners, who supposedly signed leases for apartments in their buildings and then rented them to tourists through Airbnb without the landlord’s knowledge. And Derek Norman, a news assistant, helped me track down tenants who had grown irritated with Airbnbs in their buildings.Ziograin Correa had lived with his wife and children for more than two years at a building in East Harlem. Mr. Correa said he had a recurring leak in his apartment, and he would often knock on the door of the unit above his. He gradually realized it was an Airbnb, believing the leak was never fixed because there was never a tenant who lived there long enough to address the issue.“When I went up there, there was a family from Mexico,” he said. “Then it happened again, and I went up and there was a family from China. Then I started to notice all the luggage. It was ridiculous.”Perhaps the most revealing part of my reporting was landing an interview with one of the men the city had accused: Max Beckman, a 35-year-old former real estate broker originally from Israel.Despite his legal troubles, Mr. Beckman accepted my request for an interview. “You can get all the facts and make a big publication," he told me in an email before our interview at his lawyer’s office.To my surprise, he spoke openly about quitting his job in 2015 to pursue his Airbnb venture full time, despite the legal risks, and described how the operation worked. He also talked about the aftermath of the lawsuit and the pressure of breaking scores of apartment leases after the city forced him to shut down his business.Many people asked me why I thought Mr. Beckman, who described himself as a disruptive entrepreneur, talked to us.Ultimately, Mr. Beckman seemed to genuinely believe that what he was doing should be legal and that the state should consider lifting restrictions on Airbnb so people like him can make money by lodging tourists.“Let’s make New York great again,” he told me. “Put that in your article.”Follow the @ReaderCenter on Twitter for more coverage highlighting your perspectives and experiences and for insight into how we work.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byTechnology meant to save us from distraction is making us less attentive.By Vatsal G. ThakkarDr. Thakkar is a psychiatrist. I was backing my wife’s car out of our driveway when I realized I wasn’t watching the backup camera, nor was I looking out of the rear window. I was only listening for those “audible proximity alerts” — the high-pitched beeps that my car emits as I approach an object while in reverse. The problem was that my wife’s car, an older model, doesn’t offer such beeps. I had become so reliant on this technology that I had stopped paying attention, a problem with potentially dangerous consequences. Backup cameras, mandatory on all new cars as of last year, are intended to prevent accidents. Between 2008 and 2011, the percentage of new cars sold with backup cameras doubled, but the backup fatality rate declined by less than a third while backup injuries dropped only 8 percent. Perhaps one reason is, as a report from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration put it, “Many drivers are not aware of the limitations” of the technology. The report also found that one in five drivers were just like me — they had become so reliant on the backup aids that they had experienced a collision or near miss while driving other vehicles. The fact that our brains so easily overdelegate this task to technology makes me worry about the tech industry’s aspirations — the fully autonomous everything. Could technology designed to save us from our lapses in attention actually make us even less attentive?Uber’s march toward a self-driving car hit a major speed bump last year in Tempe, Ariz., when one of its self-driving Volvos struck and killed a pedestrian. While a lot of focus was on how a vehicle with cameras and radar sensors could completely miss a human being on the road, less has been said about the failure of the most intricately programmed system in the vehicle — the brain of the human in the driver’s seat. An investigation revealed that the driver was watching Hulu until the moment of the crash. Because the human brain is impeccable in its ability to filter out extraneous information, this type of behavior should have been predicted. During normal driving, our brains are in a near-constant state of vigilance. But let someone or something do the driving for us and this vigilance easily fades.Something similar seems to have happened with a handful of fatalities involving Tesla’s Autopilot mode. It seems that the drivers made little to no effort to intervene.The introduction of safety technology has resulted in unintended accidents in other contexts as well. In December 2017, a patient died at a major medical center when a nurse searched for an anti-anxiety medication in an automated dispensing cabinet by typing only its first two letters. She chose the first drug that appeared in the results — Vecuronium, instead of Versed. Vecuronium is a paralytic drug that is sometimes used in executions. When it was administered, the patient’s vitals crashed and she died within days.Technology seems to have turned against us once again in the deadly crashes of two Boeing 737 Max 8 aircrafts. In October, pilots on Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia seem to have struggled against the plane’s supposedly lifesaving technology. Investigators suspect that sensors incorrectly interpreted the plane’s ascent as too steep, causing the plane’s “maneuvering characteristics augmentation system” to kick in. It brought the plane’s nose down, ultimately into the Java Sea at 450 miles per hour. Boeing had begun to develop a software fix, but it wasn’t ready in time for Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, which just this month crashed, possibly because of the same bug, killing all 157 people on board. In these cases, no one can criticize the pilots for failing to pay attention. Still, the crashes were a wake-up call, especially because pilots weren’t required to be trained on the new technology.Though a supercomputer will always surpass the human brain in terms of pure speed, the brain is beyond complex in its ability to reprioritize salient data inputs from multiple sources. If one input becomes less relevant, our cognitive systems shift their attention to the next most relevant one (which these days is usually our mobile devices).But there’s one feature available on some cars today that can increase a driver’s vigilance instead of diminishing it — the manual transmission.A car with a stick shift and clutch pedal requires the use of all four limbs, making it difficult to use a cellphone or eat while driving. Lapses in attention are therefore rare, especially in city driving where a driver might shift gears a hundred times during a trip to the grocery store. I’ve owned a stick-shift vehicle for the last 20 years. I bought my first upon graduating from med school — a used 1994 BMW 325i. Years later, my best man wrote “just married” on the back windshield, and the next year my wife and I drove our newborn son home from the hospital in it.Sadly, sales of manual transmissions are falling, and many automakers, including Audi, are discontinuing the option in the United States. It appears that I’ll have to keep my 2013 S4 model until 2026 if I want to teach my kids to drive a stick.When I bought that first five-speed BMW, my dad cautioned me about safety, thinking that driving a stick would be more distracting and less safe. He was wrong. Though research on the safety of manual transmissions is scant, one study on the driving performance of teenage boys with A.D.H.D. revealed that cars with manual transmissions resulted in safer, more attentive driving than automatics. This suggests that the cure for our attentional voids might be less technology, not more.Vatsal G. Thakkar (@VatsalThakkarMD) is a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at the N.Y.U.

Want this by email? Sign up here.Bipartisan negotiations to forge a border security deal broke down yesterday, potentially setting up the federal government for another shutdown ahead of a Friday deadline.What happened? “The impasse appears to center on Democratic demands for a limit on the number of unauthorized immigrants already in the country who could be detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, according to aides familiar with the talks,” according to the NYT. Republicans wanted an exception to the cap for criminals; Democrats said a proposed 16,500-bed cap left more than enough room for them.What’s at stake? The last shutdown, the longest in U.S. history, cost the American economy $11 billion and tanked President Trump’s political standing with the public. Another shutdown could cause more economic harm, hitting the I.R.S. just as tax season starts.What’s next? Lawmakers could pass another short-term spending bill, though many are reluctant to punt on a final budget agreement again. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump is preparing to hold a rally for supporters in El Paso. (Many in the city aren’t happy with that.) But he really has only two choices, according to Axios: shut down the government or declare a national emergency to get border wall money, and “both options are horrible.”The Amazon founder risked embarrassment by going public with what he said was an extortion attempt by The National Enquirer. So far, he’s scoring big points (“Saturday Night Live” jokes aside).His disclosure has gotten results. Federal prosecutors are reviewing his extortion claim, the NYT reports, citing unnamed sources. If The Enquirer’s parent company broke the law, it would be in violation of a nonprosecution agreement over its paying hush money to help President Trump in 2016. (A lawyer for the publisher’s chairman said yesterday that the company committed no crime.)And he’s winning the P.R. battle. At a time when billionaires are reviled, Maureen Dowd of the NYT writes, “the richest dude on earth has managed to come through a traumatic week inspiring admiration.” (Glenn Greenwald of The Intercept counters that it would be odd for Mr. Bezos to gain pity, given that Amazon “is a critical partner for the U.S. government in building an ever-more invasive, militarized and sprawling surveillance state.”)Where did The Enquirer go wrong? Danny Westneat of The Seattle Times points out that it picked a fight with the head of a company so powerful that it got Seattle to change its tax policies and won $3 billion in tax incentives from New York for office space. “You don’t pressure Amazon. It only goes the other way around,” Mr. Westneat writes.But Mr. Bezos could still lose. Jon Swartz of Barron’s notes that Amazon shares fell 2.6 percent on Friday. “His hands-on management is considered crucial to the success of the company and anything that pulls his attention away from day-to-day management is at least a concern for investors,” Mr. Swartz writes.Fears that Britain’s withdrawal from the E.U. could roil economies have now officially spread across the Atlantic.Wall Street has been warned about Brexit’s impact. “With less than seven weeks to go before the U.K. is due to leave the E.U., several S&P 500 groups have for the first time put Wall Street on formal notice of the risks should London and Brussels fail to reach a divorce deal,” the FT reports. Companies like Lockheed Martin, McCormick, Expedia and Cadbury have all spoken out.Driving the concern are fears that a depressed pound could make American goods unaffordable in Britain, while the costs of imported British goods could rise. There’s also a fear about the broader effect of Brexit on global political and economic stability.American banks are also nervous. “While U.S. banks want Britain to maintain the closest possible ties with the EU after Brexit, U.K. banks and insurers are anxious they don’t become beholden to new laws made by Brussels,” Bloomberg reports.More Brexit news: The E.U.’s chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said that he “will not reopen” the existing Brexit deal, but is open to reworking the political declaration that accompanies it. The British government is trying to secure an extra two weeks in which to win concessions from Europe by promising lawmakers another vote on Britain’s withdrawal options. And Prime Minister Theresa May has also offered concessions to the opposing Labour Party to break the current impasse in Parliament.Americans are getting a rude surprise: Their refunds appear to be getting smaller, despite President Trump and Republicans passing a huge set of tax cuts over a year ago.How big is the drop? “The average refund of $1,865 was 8.4 percent smaller than the average refund in the period last year,” Reuters reports, citing figures from the I.R.S. Heather Long of the WaPo adds that the number of people receiving a refund has fallen by nearly 25 percent so far. (The I.R.S. warns not to read too much into the figures, because this is just part of the data — a result of delayed processing due to the government shutdown.)Why is this happening? It’s not actually a sign that Americans are paying more in taxes. “People generally got a piece of their tax cut last year gradually in the form of lower withholding on their paychecks,” Joseph Rosenberg of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center told the WaPo.People are angry nonetheless. The WaPo reports: “People have already taken to social media, using the hashtag #GOPTaxScam, to vent their anger. Many blame President Trump and the Republicans for shrinking refunds. Some on Twitter even said they wouldn’t vote for Trump again after seeing their refunds slashed.”The last class of tech companies that gained valuations of over $1 billion, including Uber and Airbnb, remade entire industries. Don’t expect the next wave to be nearly as flashy, according to Erin Griffith of the NYT.Who are they? They have names like Benchling, Checkr and Zola, and many create software for specific industries — including data analysis systems for farmers and background checks for gig workers.Why aren’t they as exciting as their predecessors? Ms. Griffith points out that Uber, Airbnb and their peers “built global empires by simply taking existing businesses — like taxis, food delivery and hotels — and making them mobile.” Easy opportunities to disrupt traditional businesses have dried up, forcing new companies to find smaller niches.But don’t underestimate their potential. “Maybe it’s not as sexy as the companies in the first wave,” the venture capitalist Kirsten Green conceded to the NYT. But Anand Sanwal of the data provider CB Insights said they were still growing fast, adding, “If you are one of those high-momentum companies, investors are going to be beating down your door because there is so much interest in investing in the next big winner.”Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, warned yesterday of a global economy “that is growing more slowly than we had anticipated.”She sees four big risks. “Trade tensions and tariff escalations, financial tightening, uncertainty related to Brexit outcome and spillover impact and an accelerated slowdown of the Chinese economy” are all “clouds” on the horizon, she told the World Government Summit in Dubai.And they could spell trouble. “When there are too many clouds,” she added, it takes just one lighting bolt “to start the storm.”But the I.M.F. thinks the Fed is playing smart. “The fact that the Fed has put a pause on raising rates is going to provide a lot of support to the economy,” Gita Gopinath, the I.M.F.’s top economist, told the FT. “We endorse the Fed view of having a data-driven approach.”President Trump is expected to sign an executive order today meant to spur the development and regulation of artificial intelligence, Cade Metz of the NYT writes.The news: Mr. Trump is to introduce the “American A.I. Initiative,” which aims to better educate workers in the field, improve access to the cloud computing services and data needed to build A.I. systems, and promote cooperation with foreign powers.Context: “A.I. experts across industry, academia and government have long called on the Trump administration to make the development of artificial intelligence a major priority,” Mr. Metz writes, adding that they are “concerned that China could surpass the United States” in the development of such technologies.But: “The order does not set aside funds for A.I. research and development,” Mr. Metz adds, “and the administration provided few details on how it will put its new policies into effect.”Steve Mandel has stepped down as the head of the hedge fund Lone Pine Capital.Among the reasons Santander rescinded its offer to hire the investment banker Andrea Orcel?

Maybe you’ve read that Time article that declared cell phones are 10 times dirtier than a toilet seat, or maybe you’re reading this on a phone that’s streaked with visible fingerprints and tiny dots of dried spittle from that sneezing fit you had an hour ago. Or possibly you’re reading this in the bathroom and I needn’t say more!The bad news is that, indeed, your cell phone is disgusting. The good news is that cleaning it requires nothing more than inexpensive, readily available rubbing alcohol. Which will help to sweeten the next piece of news to share: You need to be cleaning your phone way, way, way more often than you are. Once a week would be good; once a day (yes) would be better.While the products are simple, technique is important to preserving the health of your cell phone — don’t spray the rubbing alcohol (or any kind of liquid) directly onto the phone. Rather, apply it to a microfiber cloth and use it to wipe the screen and the back (or case) of the phone. Another good option is to buy a box of pre-moistened alcohol wipes and stash a few individually wrapped packets in a handbag or laptop case for easy cleaning on the go.Tim Herrera is the founding editor of Smarter Living, where he edits and reports stories about living a better, more fulfilling life.

I like to see what she’s doing.” And he uses the touch-screen and Samsung’s Bixby voice assistant on his smart refrigerator to play music, order an Uber, ask for recipes, and even see who’s ringing his doorbell.But it wasn’t the coolness factor that motivated Mr. Petrock. It was all about boosting the value of his home.“It is the wave of the future. I know a lot of families will want it,” he said. “For resale value, it’s great!”Indeed, 59 percent of American adults surveyed in 2018 said they were interested in using a smart home device, according to Forrester Research.For many, the entry into the internet of things (IoT) world has been through the surging popularity of smart speakers, like Amazon Echo and Google Home, whose voice assistants can answer questions, play music, order food, read news, arrange an Uber ride, and control other connected smart devices.Forrester predicts that more than 66 million households in the United States will have smart speakers by 2022, up from 26 million in 2018. The number of homes with other smart devices, like refrigerators, vacuums, yard irrigation systems, and door locks, will more than double to 26.7 million in 2022 — or about 20 percent of households in the United States — from 12.2 million in 2018, Forrester projects.For many people, it’s about convenience and speed. “Consumers don’t just want this convenience, they expect it — they demand it,” said Charles Henderson, global head of X-Force Red, a professional hacking team at IBM Security.But the road to mass adoption of the smart home will likely be a long and bumpy one. Although the number and nature of smart devices is surging by the day, people have been relatively slow to actually buy and install them.“It’s a really messy space and there’s a lot of noise in this,” said Frank Gillett, principal analyst at Forrester.Buying, setting up and connecting smart devices can be costly, cumbersome, and time-consuming. Indeed, as many as one-third of smart speakers are still in their boxes, according to Forrester.“You need people to be patient and comfortable with working through multiple steps of instruction,” he said.Security, privacy and trust remain a big concern among owners of smart speakers. It’s that “big brother is listening” concern, said Charles Golvin, senior research director at Gartner, a research and advisory firm.In a 2017 survey by Gartner of smart speaker owners in the United State, the United Kingdom, and Germany, 44 percent said they would be more willing to use a virtual personal assistant app, like Alexa, Siri or Google Assistant, if all of their personal data stayed on the device rather than being stored in the Cloud.It’s no surprise that familiar names like Google, Amazon and Apple have taken a lead in the smart speaker space, and big brands like Samsung are creating buzz in smart appliances. But the rest of the smart device universe is fragmented.“Much of the innovation is coming from focused start-ups and midsize companies,” said Mr. Gillett.In the smart appliances realm, Samsung has emerged as a leader.With its Family Hub smart refrigerator, for example, you can view the contents of your refrigerator from a smartphone at work, use a grocery app like InstaCart or Amazon Prime Now to order any needed groceries for dinner, and have the food delivered before arriving home. The smart fridge also sends alerts about expiring food and offers recipes through Meal Planner for meals that include those expiring items.The fridge features a large touch-screen, speakers, and the Bixby voice assistant that allows someone to build shopping lists, post photos, play music — and even control the home’s other smart devices, like lights and thermostats, right from the fridge.If the family is watching a show on a smart Samsung TV in the living room, TV Mirroring allows someone to watch the same program on the fridge touch-screen while cooking in the kitchen.“People love this feature, specifically around game-time — where people don’t want to miss a play while preparing food,” said Adnan Agboatwalla, director of innovation programs at Samsung Electronics America.“The key to the whole ecosystem is to make the consumer’s life easier,” he said.Looking ahead, Mr. Agboatwalla said he hopes to add replenishment services, in which a washer and dryer, for example, would anticipate, based on a number of cycles, when the consumer needed detergent and dryer sheets — and would automatically order them from the person’s preferred retailer before they run out.But demand for consumer smart devices goes far beyond smart appliances, lights, speakers and thermostats. Tech giants and start-ups alike are rolling out innovative IoT and artificial intelligence-enabled devices at a breathtaking pace — the quirkier and more eye-catching the better — as they jockey to stand out in an increasingly crowded market.Among the newcomers is MassageRobotics, a company that offers body massages at home — only it’s done by a pair of robotic arms. Founder Christian Mackin came up with the idea after suffering back and neck injuries during a sandrail car accident in California in 2013. He underwent surgery — and then months of physical and massage therapy.“I thought, I’d like to design a robot to do this at home,” he said.So, Mr. Mackin, who owns an engineering firm, acquired a couple of collaborative robots, known as cobots, from Universal Robots, and brought in a physical therapist to program the so-called cobots to give 25 different massages with a robotic arm on each side of the massage table. The robots are artificial intelligence-enabled, responding to voice commands to change the speed, pressure and location of the massage from a light touch to deep tissue massage — depending on the person’s needs and injuries.There’s even a safe word — Stop — which will immediately stop the massage. With each adjustment or change, a new massage is created, which becomes part of the system’s database of massages for all customers to use.“Obviously, it’s not some beautiful masseuse or masseur doing it, but the massage tool feels just fantastic,” said Mr. Mackin. “You cannot tell the difference.” And robots never get tired, don’t expect tips, and can never face sexual misconduct accusations, he joked.But it doesn’t come cheap: A single massage robot will sell for $150,000 when it hits the market later this year, although Mr. Mackin expects the price to come down to between $50,000 and $75,000 within three years.Are you a fan of Jimmy Choo shoes? If so, there’s a smart designer shoe headed your way that’s not only stylish but also can detect signs of chronic diseases, like Parkinson’s, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s, just by measuring the way you walk. Jimmy Choo teamed up with ZhorTech to create the Voyager Boot, a smart boot that currently allows the wearer to control temperature from an app. ZhorTech’s newest insole, which debuted at CES in Las Vegas this month, will also measure cadence, speed, impact force, pronation and other metrics as the person walks to detect diseases. A date has not yet been set for new insole’s addition to the Jimmy Choo smart boot.“There are more than 7,000 nerve endings in each foot directly connected to the brain,” said Karim Oumnia, chief executive and founder of ZhorTech and Digitsole. And medical studies show a direct relation between gait analysis and neurological diseases, he said. “We can even detect the severity level of the diseases” and track progression over time, he said. The Voyager Boot is available in three styles and is priced between $1,795 to $1,895.Then there’s the QUS washable smart sport shirt that collects body data like breathing rate, heart rate, and heart rate variability through sensor threads in the shirt and a device that’s snapped onto the back of the shirt. It collects the data during workouts and compares it with previous exercise sessions.There’s also Hip’Safe which is a wearable airbag belt for seniors priced at roughly $744, and B’Safe, an airbag vest for cyclists, that automatically inflate when motion sensors detect the person is falling, which is priced at roughly $700.Widex makes a smart hearing aid, which uses A.I. to learn and adjust the person’s hearing preferences in real time, and will soon be introducing a battery-free hearing aid.For cat owners, there’s iKuddle, a smart litter box priced at $299, which detects when the feline enters the box, deodorizes the air and packages waste into small bags for easy disposal. And it can all be tracked through an app.Out on the road, there’s EyeLights’ Eyedrive smart device, that allows a driver to see GPS directions, music playlists and incoming calls through a hologram that appears on the car’s window. A tablet-like device sits on the car’s dashboard, and, once connected to the phone’s GPS and music apps, will project the directions or music track onto the windshield — large enough that everyone in the car can see it. Since it’s activated by voice or gestures, the driver never has to look away from the road.Romain Duflot, chief executive and co-founder of EyeLights, dismisses suggestions that the hologram could be a distraction for drivers, saying that taking your eye off the road to check a phone is far riskier. “Phone distraction occurs in 52 percent of all trips that ended in a crash,” he said. EyeLights expects Eyedrive to be available in February and retail for $299 (though it may currently be pre-ordered via its Indiegogo campaign for $199).Then there’s Cupixel Art Box ($59.99), a smart device for the aspiring artist. The kit and app use augmented reality to scan a photo from the person’s iPad, and superimpose the image onto a canvas. The augmented realityimage provides an easy — almost paint-by-numbers — way to trace and paint the image. If you need help or inspiration, there’s a live chat with an artist on the app.“We give our users a foolproof way to create art,” said Elad Katav, co-founder of Cupixel.The choices of fun, cool, quirky smart devices is seemingly limitless — and continues expanding by the day. In the end, no single smart home will likely look the same. It will all come down to personal preferences.Added Mr. Gillett: “There’s no all-dancing home that you can set up and now your home is magic like the Jetsons.”An earlier version of this article implied incorrectly that a version of an app-controlled boot by Jimmy Choo and ZhorTech that detects diseases based on the way a person walks can be purchased now. The version currently available allows the wearer to control the boot’s temperature; the release date of the new version, with an insole that debuted at CES in Las Vegas this month, has not been set.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBitsBy Kate CongerEach week, technology reporters and columnists from The New York Times review the week’s news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.Hello, friends. I’m Kate Conger, a tech reporter in The Times’s San Francisco bureau. It has been another earnings news week, which means we’re learning exactly how much money the local tech companies earned in 2018.The news might not surprise you: Everyone in Silicon Valley is still raking in cash. Apple is the country’s most valuable public company again, after briefly losing the title to Amazon. Facebook has shattered its own considerable records for profit and revenue, despite increasing scrutiny of its business practices.And a flock of companies is set to join the tech giants in the public market. Slack, the workplace chat app that I compulsively check throughout my day, has filed for its initial public offering. It’s now in line behind Uber and Lyft for a 2019 debut on Wall Street. Airbnb and Pinterest are likely to follow, bringing a fresh wave of money to one of the most expensive regions in the United States.New wealth and tech is nothing new, of course. But it is notable that tech companies have done so well in a difficult year for the industry.Executives from Google, Facebook and Twitter were called to Washington to answer lawmakers’ concerns about political bias, privacy violations and excessive market power.In Europe, antitrust worries are on the rise. In 2017, Google paid what was a record fine of $2.7 billion. Last year, Google was fined again, this time for $5.1 billion.Just this past week, Germany announced that it would crack down on the way Facebook collects and combines data on its users as they browse the web. British doctors recommended that parents limit their children’s exposure to screens and social media, while my co-worker Brian X. Chen wrote about “bait apps” that trick kids into spending money online.The tech industry’s honeymoon with the rest of the world seems to be over. Except when it comes to making money.Snapchat and Twitter, two social media services that seemed to be struggling just months ago, posted better-than-anticipated earnings this past week. Google, which is facing down employee protests and regulatory scrutiny in the United States and Europe, posted a 22 percent increase in revenue.Our Google beat reporter, Daisuke Wakabayashi, wrote why it’s possible for tech firms to continue earning record profits even as the public’s perception of them sours. Google, he said, is the “internet’s ultimate beachfront property.” If you want to swim in the ocean, you need to walk across Google’s private beach first.Even if you don’t like the way a tech company behaves, boycotting may be an impossible challenge.I’ve been fascinated by Kashmir Hill’s series at Gizmodo about her struggles to extricate herself from the so-called Big Five: Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple and Facebook. She recounted all the missed texts and wrong turns she made as she tried to get through her day without the technology that I take for granted. The series is a warning about the uphill battle we’d all face if we decided to limit our collective tech addiction.And as long as it remains difficult to quit, tech’s profits will continue to soar.In other news:■ Newsrooms are increasingly relying on artificial intelligence to churn out quick news pieces about earthquakes, sports scores and — of course — earnings. “Robot reporters” are on the rise at Bloomberg, The Washington Post and other publications. Here at The Times, our A.I. experimentation has been limited to newsletter personalization, Jaclyn Peiser reports. Maybe someday soon, a robot reporter will be picking these stories to share with you.■ Did you know the North Pole could move? I learned that the magnetic north pole is heading toward Siberia at a surprising pace, thanks to a fascinating report from Shannon Hall. The pole, which I’d always assumed was a fixed point, is on the move thanks to the “sloshing” of liquid iron in the outer core of the Earth, and we have to continually track it so that navigation systems remain reliable. But we’re a bit behind because of the government shutdown.■ Instacart revised its tipping policy this past week after backlash from the delivery people who pick up items for shoppers and deliver them to their doorsteps. Late last year, Instacart started counting tips against payments to its delivery people, essentially stripping them of their tips.“It’s offensive, it’s unethical, and in this climate it’s a very dumb thing to do,” one Instacart courier told Kevin Roose. Now, Instacart has reversed course and will include tips on top of the delivery fee it pays its shoppers.■ Even though Facebook is banned in China, the company found a way to generate an estimated $5 billion from the country, Paul Mozur and Lin Qiqing report. To tap the market, Facebook has created what sounds like an Ikea floor model that allows interested advertisers to familiarize themselves with the platform while it remains hidden behind China’s Great Firewall.Kate Conger is based in San Francisco and writes about the technology industry.

Here are five ways high school seniors can connect with what matters to them.By Ned JohnsonAs most college-bound high school seniors learn where they’ve gotten in and decide where they’re going, many feel that the pressure is off. Whether they are celebrating acceptances to their dream schools or coping with rejections, nearly all realize at this point that the die has been cast: The push for high school grades that used to drive everything suddenly matters much less.“Senioritis” used to have positive connotations for students. It meant coasting through their last semester in high school in anticipation of college entry in the fall. Today that mood has shifted. Many students — and their parents — have been driven to believe that high school is merely a four-year audition for the right college. A result? Eighteen-year-olds who feel their lives are not really driven by them.Rather than being a time of freedom, the new senioritis is characterized by a sense of purposelessness.Without an external motivator (reward of college admission or threat of college denial), far too many students have little idea of what to do or why.Psychologists use the terms “external” versus “internal” control, which is the sense that someone other than the individual is responsible for his success or failure. School, and especially the college admissions process, very much fosters this tendency. Students look to teachers and parents for cues to what matters and try to imagine what they need to do to meet the approval of admissions officials. It’s a far cry from reflecting on a more pressing question: “What matters to me?”It is common for many students, when denied admission to their dream college, to lament that “it’s not fair” or that they’ve “wasted all of this effort,” as though their work as students in high school and their aspirations for college were merely transactional rather than part of their development as learners and, more so, as people. In the aftermath of a rejection, more students than I can count have told me they should have gone to an easier high school or taken easier (or harder) classes, taken more or fewer AP classes, or should have dropped sports, music or debate “to get better grades.” Typically in this situation, students and their parents cast about for some path or reason that would have delivered the result they wished for. They rarely reflect on the possibility that the sport, class or activity they engaged in may pay off down the road in other ways, through a talent developed or interest kindled. Many of these kids feel that the whole point of working hard in high school is so they can get in to an even harder college, then move on to a future that they know little more about than that it will be hard-charging. It is easy to understand how painfully the rejection hits, since the process has all been framed around the outcome. In the second semester of senior year, students are still engaged with the same people and activities of the last four years, but the terms, pressures and motivations have changed.For the next few months, the rules are very different. Teachers and parents complain that they can’t get teenagers to do anything. Some have even proposed eliminating senior year.But I see the end of senior year as an opportunity for kids to figure out their inner motivation, post college acceptance.For kids who have been grinding for too long, the second semester can be downtime to recharge. But I also encourage students to use this time with intention, as it will help them enormously to be in touch with what matters to them. They can make themselves their senior project. Here are some suggestions.Go deep into things that matter to you, especially what you didn’t have time for or seemed “unimportant” for college admissions. A senior I know who hopes to study medicine used her second semester to train as an EMT. It was a great way to see firsthand whether medicine appealed at a boots-on-the-ground level and whether she was really suited to the field. It also ended up being a well-paying part-time job.Learn how to run your own life. Make a list of adult or college skills you don’t know how to do, like automobile maintenance or cooking. I’ve heard of college kids, clueless as to basic kitchen skills, turning to YouTube videos to learn how to make hot dogs. If you haven’t yet learned to drive, that’s a skill that also belongs on this list. There are real upsides to Uber, but it isn’t yet everywhere. And you may face a situation where a friend is unfit to drive and someone needs to step up.Try looking for a part-time job — on your own. I was visiting a friend’s business recently when he picked up the phone. It was someone calling to confirm the time of a job interview for a recent college grad named Ben. The caller was Ben’s mom. My friend said, “Well, please tell Ben his interview is canceled and that he should have called himself.”Like anything that matters, learning how to enter, manage and (when necessary) exit relationships benefits from experience. A 2017 study in Child Development found that young people today are less likely to have dated than young people did during the ’90s; perhaps they are more focused on passing classes than passing notes. According to the General Social Survey, more than half of young adults, aged 18 to 34, do not have a steady romantic partner. A 2013 New York Times piece recounted the “hookup culture” at Ivy League universities, where students shared views like “A relationship is like taking a four-credit class,” or “I could get in a relationship, or I could finish my film.” A friend who has been an independent college counselor for decades wistfully observes that “Nobody believes me when I tell them, but who you marry will matter much more than where you go to college.” If the first seven semesters of high school were college prep, perhaps let the last one be more about relationship prep.Go technology-free for a week — or even a day. Digital downtime is a challenge but can also be an awakening as to the ways that technology impacts our thought processes and ability to pay attention — a recognition students can take to college and beyond. And, while many believe college is where they will develop a coherent sense of self, it can only help to begin that process in senior year.Ned Johnson is the president and founder of PrepMatters in Washington, D.C., and the co-author of “The Self-Driven Child: The Science and Sense of Giving Your Kids More Control Over Their Lives.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byMETROPOLITAN DIARYWatching two people meet on a downtown No. 1, left behind on New Year’s Eve and other reader tales of New York City in this week’s Metropolitan Diary.Dear Diary:I was headed to work on a downtown No. 1. I was standing in the middle of the car. At 125th Street, a woman in the seat in front of me turned to the man sitting next to her.“I loved that book,” she said.He turned to her and smiled. They began to talk about the book and about the movie adaptation. She pulled a book out of her bag to show him what she was reading.I wondered whether they knew each other. Then they shook hands and introduced themselves. I checked their left hands. No rings.The train continued on. By now, they were laughing. Their shoulders were touching. It was like the beginning to a romantic comedy, a real-life meet-cute.We got to 72nd Street, and they were still chatting away. Would this be the last time they spoke?The train approached 59th Street.“Maybe I could give you my number and we can talk some more?” the man said.They exchanged phones, saving each other’s contact information.I got off at 50th Street. It was no longer just a regular day.— Alliana SemjenDear Diary:On New Year’s Eve, we let our 3-year-old bring his guitar along to a friend’s apartment near Times Square. It was a brand-new mini six-string that he hadn’t put down since getting it for Christmas. He wanted to sing a song after the ball dropped, and I was trying to be a cool dad.It was pouring rain in Brooklyn, and after three canceled Ubers, we found a green taxi. We were soaking wet, two hours late and our son was yapping the whole time to the driver about how he was going to play his song.At West 54th Street and Eighth Avenue, we stepped out of the cab. It drove off just as an officer was telling us we had to walk four blocks north, then cross to the next avenue to come back down.That’s when our son asked us where his guitar was. I realized I had left it in the taxi.Our boy cried. My husband explained that we had lost the instrument, but that an act of kindness might bring it back.Of course, it took more than that: a report with the Taxi and Limousine Commission, calls to two police precincts and, finally, the help of a detective who connected us to the driver, who had been trying to find us.Two days later, he pulled onto our street and jumped out of the cab with the guitar in hand.“I remembered you,” he shouted to my son. “Now you can play your song!”— Corvette Hunt Dear Diary:I was standing on the checkout line at Fairway with a package of smoked salmon and some dry roasted cashews.A man approached me.“Are you in hardware?” he asked.I was totally baffled.He pointed at the items I was holding.“Nuts and lox,” he said.— John LipmanDear Diary:In spring 2009, I was working throughout Chinatown and the Lower East Side as a home-health physical therapist. I did not have an office where I could to write up my notes, use a clean restroom or have lunch.On one particularly exhausting day, I started out at a public housing complex on Rutgers Street before stopping at a tenement on the Bowery and then a beautiful prewar apartment in SoHo.By then, it was lunchtime. I didn’t want to eat alone. Although I saw people every day, and was constantly navigating crowds on the streets, I felt very lonely in the job.I made my way to Henry Street. There, in a corner building, lived two patients of my co-workers. This older couple also happened to be my beloved grandparents. They had lived in Chinatown for more than 25 years.Somehow, it seemed, they had sensed that I would visit that day. They had tea, herbal soup, fried eggs, steamed rice and Chinese sausages and vegetables ready and waiting when I arrived.To this day, it’s still the best work lunch I’ve ever had.— Kat LieuDear Diary:I was walking along Henry Street in Brooklyn. A blind man with a white cane was walking toward me. To my right, a truck was backing into a parking spot.Just as the man with the cane passed me on my left, I heard a bang. I turned and saw a young man poke his head out of the truck to assess the damage to the tree that had just been hit.The man with the cane stopped and turned his head.“What was that?” he asked.I took a couple of steps back.“A truck was just backing up and hit a tree,” I said. “Don’t worry. Nobody’s hurt.”.“So it’s O.K.?” he said.“Yeah, the truck looks fine. I don’t see any damage.”He cracked a grin.“Not the truck,” he said. “The tree.”— Laura LimRead all recent entries and our submissions guidelines.

Yesterday, he finally made good on that promise — but Tesla is making big sacrifices to offer the vehicle.What $35,000 gets you is a Model 3 that can cover 220 miles before needing a charge, along with a cheaper interior than higher-priced versions. The new Model 3 is expected to start shipping in two to four weeks.Tesla expects to sell a lot of them. The announcement led Mr. Musk to raise production estimates to 600,000 cars in 2019.But it will probably post a loss this quarter. Mr. Musk wouldn’t reveal what kind of margins the company would make on its lowest-priced Model 3. But he admitted, “Given that a lot is happening in Q1, we do not expect to be profitable in the first quarter.”And the company will change its business model. Tesla will only take orders online, close some of its showrooms and lay off employees to save money. “There’s no other way for us to achieve the savings for this car,” Mr. Musk said.Shareholders are worried. Tesla’s stock fell 3 percent in after-hours trading. Liam Denning of Bloomberg Opinion argues that’s “because this crowning moment came with more than a hint of a gamble.”More: Mr. Musk hired a new law firm to defend him against the S.E.C.’s attempt to hold him in contempt of court.President Trump and his top economic advisers have sent a series of conflicting messages about the status of trade talks with China, Alan Rappeport and Ana Swanson of the NYT write.• “We’re heading for a historic deal,” Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, said in an interview on CNBC yesterday. “The outlook for a deal is very positive.”• “We are well on our way to doing something special” with China, Mr. Trump told reporters yesterday.• But “I am always prepared to walk. I’m never afraid to walk from a deal,” he added. “I would do that with China, too, if it didn’t work out.”• And “much still needs to be done both before an agreement is reached and, more important, after it is reached, if one is reached,” Robert Lighthizer, Mr. Trump’s top trade negotiator, told House lawmakers on Wednesday.A final deal is being prepared according to Bloomberg, citing unidentified sources. Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China could sign it within weeks.But it may not go far enough. “We don’t look at all close to meaningful, enforced provisions on intellectual property,” Derek Scissors, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, told the NYT.And Mr. Trump has proved he will walk. After he abandoned peace talks with Kim Jong-un of North Korea yesterday, concerns that the president might settle for a poor deal now appear diminished. If he doesn’t like the terms of a China deal, the trade war could continue.More: The U.S. plans to take a hard line in negotiations with Britain over post-Brexit trade.Some of the world’s biggest internet messaging companies hope to succeed where cryptocurrency start-ups have failed by introducing consumers to the world of digital coins, Nathaniel Popper and Mike Isaac of the NYT report.“The most anticipated but secretive project is underway at Facebook. The company is working on a coin that users of WhatsApp, which Facebook owns, could send to friends and family instantly, said five people briefed on the effort who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of confidentiality agreements.”“The Facebook project is far enough along that the social networking giant has held conversations with cryptocurrency exchanges about selling the Facebook coin to consumers, said four people briefed on the negotiations.”Other platforms are working on similar initiatives. “Telegram, which has an estimated 300 million users worldwide, is also working on a digital coin. Signal, an encrypted messaging service that is popular among technologists and privacy advocates, has its own coin in the works. And so do the biggest messaging applications in South Korea and Japan, Kakao and Line.”“The new cryptocurrencies would make it easier to move money between countries,” Mr. Popper and Mr. Isaac write. “But the messaging companies are likely to face many of the same regulatory and technological hurdles that have kept Bitcoin from going mainstream.”The American economy slowed at the end of 2018. But there may be worse to come.Gross domestic product growth slowed at the end of last year. It grew at a 2.6 percent annual rate in the final three months of 2018, Ben Casselman of the NYT reports, compared to a rate of over 4 percent in the middle of the year.“This year seems to be starting at an even slower pace,” Mr. Casselman writes. “Many economists expect growth to drop below 2 percent in the first quarter, in part because of the partial government shutdown, which began in December and extended through most of January.”But the final quarter slowdown wasn’t as severe as many economists had expected. “Even with the loss of momentum late in the year, 2018 as a whole was among the best years of the decade-long recovery from the Great Recession,” Mr. Casselman writes, adding, “Most economists do not expect a recession this year.”And the Fed remains optimistic. “The economy is in a good place,” Jay Powell, the central bank’s chairman, said yesterday.Richard Plepler helped make “The Sopranos” and “Game of Thrones,” two iconic HBO series. But he now plans to step down as the company’s chief executive, in a huge shift under the company’s new owner, AT&T.Mr. Plepler chafed at losing autonomy under his new bosses, the NYT reports, citing unnamed sources. AT&T has been in talks to hire Robert Greenblatt, a longtime TV executive, for a high-level role at Warner Media, which includes HBO, Turner and Warner Bros. Mr. Plepler may have had to report to a former rival.He already had issues with AT&T, particularly John Stankey, the head of Warner Media. Last June, the two men taunted each other uncomfortably in public. Mr. Stankey said that Warner Media needed to make money. Mr. Plepler responded, “We do that” — to which his boss said, “Just not enough.”His departure could precede a larger shake up. Unnamed HBO executives told Peter Kafka of Recode that AT&T wants to further integrate HBO with other Warner Media properties. (Think: early seasons of “Game of Thrones” on TBS.)But it’s a gamble. AT&T believes that it can put good managers into any business and succeed, but Mr. Plepler is beloved by HBO talent.

Sherwin-Williams, a competitor, sells a more limited but still substantial palette of 1,500 hues. To buy either brand, you generally have to visit a hardware store or big-box retailer like Lowe’s, select from an array of color chips and wait while the paint is mixed by an employee. You may have to buy sample cans to test the paint on your walls at home, and make a return trip to the store, before you settle on the right color.It’s not exactly a soulful task, but for decades it was a manageable one. Or perhaps it wasn’t. Because as with so many consumer categories that have been transformed over the past decade by tech entrepreneurs, from mattresses to eyewear to hailing a cab, paint is being “disrupted.”Two new brands — Clare and Backdrop — have emerged in the past eight months, selling paint through their websites. Convenience and a friction-free life, ideally one in which any desire can be fulfilled through clicking and swiping, is the millennial consumer’s utopia, and now that utopia has colors of its own, with generationally appropriate names like Clare’s “No Filter” (a “light beige with warm undertones”). Say goodbye to the hardware store, because now you choose the paint online and have it shipped to your home. Say goodbye to testing paint on your walls, because now the samples are disposable peel-away stickers. Say goodbye, too, to choice overload, because Clare and Backdrop each offer a “curated” selection of about 50 colors. That’s less than half of the 132 colors offered by Farrow & Ball, the high-end British brand that previously marketed an edited palette. (One Kings Lane, with its new direct-to-consumer paint collection, offers an even more edited 32 hues.)Brad Sherman, a designer in New York who specializes in commercial design for tech companies like Casper and Food52, said he was recently served an ad for Backdrop on Instagram and was intrigued. “I felt it was about time somebody looked at disrupting this industry,” Mr. Sherman said. “The branding, the repackaging of the paint can, the tools. Looking at chips, the color is never accurate.”It can be difficult at first to tell Clare and Backdrop apart (just as with Uber and Lyft in the ride-hailing business). Both are New York-based companies founded by young people who wax on about “storytelling” and “pain points.” Both tout their eco-friendly bona fides. Both offer a subdued selection of colors sure to look great on Instagram, and at prices comparable to most midrange paints (about $45 per gallon). And where Farrow & Ball made an art out of twee names (Elephant’s Breath, anyone?), Clare and Backdrop give it an on-trend spin: Clare’s natural green is Avocado Toast; Backdrop’s warm beige is Palo Santo.First-mover advantage, however, goes to Clare, which debuted last July, four months ahead of Backdrop. With its uncluttered design and simple navigation, Clare’s website is perhaps better at conveying the mood of domestic ease, while the brand’s colors “seem to be a little brighter, a littler clearer,” than Backdrop’s, said Annie Elliott, an interior designer and blogger in Washington, D.C., who goes by the nom de plume Bossy Color. “I’m a sucker for kits, and that adorable yellow Clare box — sign me up,” Ms. Elliott said, referring to the brand’s five-piece tool kit, which sells for $25.Clare’s founder, Nicole Gibbons, 37, is a former interior designer who appeared on the TV show “Home Made Simple,” on the OWN network. Working with clients on the show and through her interiors firm showed her how lost people were about painting without an expert guide.“Like white, for example. You would think white was just white. Easy,” Ms. Gibbons said. “But you go to any other company and there are usually a hundred or more whites to choose from. People start to get confused and doubt.”Taking a “hyper-curated” approach, Ms. Gibbons offered only three whites with Clare, and one paint finish for walls (eggshell) and one finish for trim (semigloss). She also developed a “color genius” tool that asks questions about your space and spits out a recommended hue. “The whole premise of Clare is to simplify, so by the time you’re at the end of this process, it’s joy, not hassle,” Ms. Gibbons said. “Sometimes people just want fewer, better choices.”Caleb and Natalie Ebel, the married founders of Backdrop, also espouse fewer, better, but unlike Ms. Gibbons, they celebrate the messiness of painting. Colors are represented on their site as gooey drops of wet paint, and the imagery in their ad campaign is of people ready to paint, not static, furnished rooms. The Ebels, both in their early 30s, have no background in design or color theory. Ms. Ebel worked in marketing and branding for an education nonprofit, while Mr. Ebel, who has a finance degree, touts his early experience at Warby Parker (“I worked at Warby Parker” is the new “I was at Woodstock”). With Backdrop, the Ebels have applied personal branding and style signifiers to a business “void of any emotion,” Mr. Ebel said.Thus, Backdrop’s neutral beige is named Ryokan Guesthouse because two years ago, before their daughter was born, the Ebels spent their babymoon in Japan. They are developing Spotify playlists for each color. Inspired by olive-oil canisters, they redesigned the boring round paint can; the Backdrop can is square, with a rubber stopper that gives what Mr. Ebel called “a beautiful pour.” In addition to paint and tools, the Ebels sell branded work T-shirts, drop cloths and coveralls. Indeed, they say they want to make painting appear so fun and easy that people will be inspired to change their walls every six months.Isn’t that exhausting?“Well, it’s the cheapest way to transform your space,” Ms. Ebel said.Fifty percent of Backdrop’s customers don’t bother testing samples, she added: “They’re commenting on social that they’re purchasing paint because of the names. When your backdrop is Surf Camp, you’re much more able to remember that versus just blue.”Ms. Elliott, the designer, said she is unlikely to buy paint based on a catchy name. At the moment, one go-to is Benjamin Moore’s Simply White, a shade she has used time and again.But, she admitted, “this is for a generation of folks who are probably not going to hire a designer anyway. It’s for someone who wants to spend a Saturday changing the room for not a lot of money. And for that, I see the appeal.”Steven Kurutz joined The Times in 2011 and wrote for the City and Home sections before joining Style.

Erin Griffith, a start-ups and venture capital reporter in San Francisco, discussed the tech she’s using.You focus on start-ups. Do any of the tech products you use come from start-ups?If very old, highly valued pre-I.P.O. companies like Slack, Uber, Lyft, Airbnb and Pinterest still count as start-ups, then yes, every day. Every few minutes! I’m Slacking in between each sentence I write.We’re no longer in an era when hot new social media apps are bubbling up every few months, and if they are, I’ve aged out of the early-adopter demographic. Now whenever I stumble upon a new social media app, my only “friends” using it are the venture capitalists I write about. (Even those apps tend to be copied or bought by Facebook.)I use Nuzzel, which sends alerts for stories my Twitter friends are talking about. This is a good way to catch things that elude push notifications and newsletters, including whatever hate-read everyone is angry about.Pocket, an app for saving articles, lets me feel better about not finishing all the Important Long Reads I encounter throughout the day. I can tell myself I’ll get to them later. (I probably won’t.)Giphy, a search engine for GIFs, allows me to express myself when words, emojis or Bitmojis are not enough.I also use a combination of Swarm, the check-in app that grew out of Foursquare; an IFTTT (If This, Then That) recipe; and Google Calendar to record my whereabouts. It’s helpful for doing expenses or remembering the name of a restaurant I went to last month.And Strava, an app for workouts, lets me track my bike rides and jogs. A lot of this creates a privacy mess, I know.What tech tools do you rely on the most for work?This is least techie answer possible, but aside from email and my phone’s voice recorder, it’s probably paper. (Sorry, trees, including the one this article will be printed on.) For every big story I do, I print out huge stacks of background reading on the executives and industry. They’re good for flights since there’s no danger of bad Wi-Fi or no outlets.When I’m writing a longer story, I print out all my interview notes and spread the pages across my kitchen table (or floor), in the manner of a chef’s mise en place. This helps me organize my thoughts before I dive into the writing. I don’t understand how people can work off 30 different documents on one tiny laptop screen.I also find it very comforting to constantly make and remake to-do lists on whatever paper I can find — old envelopes and junk mail, receipts, notepads shaped like my first initial, Post-its. I leave a trail of these everywhere I go, like the Johnny Appleseed of productivity.Anything that doesn’t contribute to deforestation?To transcribe interviews, I use Temi, a service that relies on artificial intelligence. The quality is not great, but it is very cheap and gets me over the impossible procrastination hump of not starting the article because I don’t want to listen to my own voice. And it presents the messy interview transcript in a way that I can find what I want and easily play it back, sometimes without having to endure any of my stammering.Like every other reporter, I use Signal and way too much Twitter. I also use some of the data services the venture capitalists use to identify and track up-and-coming start-ups: App Annie, Crunchbase, CB Insights, Pitchbook, LinkedIn.The most crucial reporting tool I have is probably a gigantic purse that fits my entire life: laptop, tangled masses of chargers and headphones, numerous snacks and water bottles, a dozen pens, a bunch of notebooks, and at least three half-read New Yorkers that have traveled across the country with me so many times they’re basically my emotional support animals.What trends do you see emerging in the start-up scene? Which of them do you think have potential to be successful, and which ones will be a flash in a pan?Being new to San Francisco (I moved from New York last year), I felt it was important to go full native. I acquired AirPods, downloaded the Mr. Chilly weather app for the city’s “microclimates” and briefly embraced scooters. I have not yet bought a vest from the vending machine at San Francisco International Airport, but given the aforementioned microclimates, I see their appeal.The scooter services rode a wave of hype, and I suspect the severity of the backlash to scooter debris — and the vandalism — was greater than the companies and their investors expected. Between injuries, regulatory scrutiny, higher-than-anticipated replacement costs, potential tariffs and the wearing off of the initial novelty, the companies seem to be experiencing a trough of disillusionment just in time for spring.I stopped riding the scooters because I was spending every scooting second thinking about how this would be an especially embarrassing way for a tech reporter to die. Even imagining myself explaining to strangers that, heavy sigh, yes, these crutches are from a scooter accident was enough to convert me back to a boring old analog bike.You’ve written about hustle culture and toil glamour. Is the idea of work-life balance dead?Unfortunately, a lot of the companies that outwardly promote the concept of work-life balance are the ones with the worst cultures of overwork. Over time, I imagine, hypocrisy will turn people off working at those places. Until then, it’s up to the workers to draw their own boundaries. One way to do that is to understand the difference between taking pride in their work and defining their self-worth by their jobs. And maybe lowering sky-high expectations about their company’s do-gooder missions, and being realistic about how fulfilling their jobs will actually be.Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with in your daily life?I have exactly one useful product endorsement: Everyone should abandon the tyranny of bulky, uncomfortable U-shaped neck pillows for the Trtl sleep pillow.When I covered the tech industry from New York, I traveled to San Francisco all the time, and the Trtl saved me on countless red-eyes. It’s basically a plastic neck brace attached to a Velcro scarf. It looks absurd. It easily fits into a purse. It’s glorious.Erin Griffith reports on technology start-ups and venture capital from the San Francisco bureau.

She left in an Uber after I detached the legs for her.A friend bought a pair of printed fabric chairs for $80. She also took some shelves and a plant. Sam never watered the plants anyway. One time I joked that all of our plants had an absent father. It’s the kind of joke that makes me sad now.The blue couch went to two girls from Crown Heights. They were younger than me, but not by much. I told them it was comfortable enough to sleep on if you removed the back cushions. Sam’s dad slept on it when he visited from California.The bookshelf went to a former co-worker who lives in Manhattan. I kept the books.I sold the night stands to Julia, a hometown friend, someone I knew could handle color. They were bright yellow.I sold the coffee table to a very demanding woman who contacted me through Craigslist. It was the first time I had ever gotten a cashier’s check.A couple bought the curtains. They didn’t need the curtain rod so I left it for the next tenant.The red kitchen chairs were Sam’s. They were harder to sell, but someone eventually bought them for $40. The man who bought them kind of looked like Sam.Is it weird that I’m jealous of our furniture? It found a new life so quickly. I worry that it’s going to take me a long time.— Sarah JoyceDear Diary:I was at the poultry counter at a well-known New York butcher shop in the 1990s. Free-range chickens and organic foods were just starting to become widely available, and I had not yet mastered the associated brand names.The butcher asked what I wanted.“I’ll have the Bell & Howell chicken,” I said.“With or without the automatic shutter?” he said without missing a beat.— Stephanie Brody-LedermanDear Diary:It was summer 1966. I had never been out of the Midwest when I finished college in St. Paul and was accepted to a summer publishing course at Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Mass. One night late in the course, I took a bus to New York City as part of my search for a job. I was quite proud of myself for shaking off the boys at Port Authority who offered to carry my bag for a quarter, and even prouder when I hailed a taxi and gave the driver the Upper East Side address where I was to stay with friends of my Radcliffe roommate. “I’ve never been to New York before,” I said to the cabby, a tall guy whose head was shaved bald long before the look became popular. “Tell me, where’s Manhattan Island?”I remember the city lights glinting off his head as he did the only real-live triple take I have ever seen.“Lady,” he said in a deep, gravelly voice, “you’re in it.”— Victoria ChapmanDear Diary:On the Sunday before New Year’s Day, my son and I drove to Macy’s in Herald Square. He needed to buy some clothes to upgrade his wardrobe for a job that started on Jan. 3.I saw a spot at a corner along Seventh Avenue. I wasn’t 100 percent sure it was legal and I had to drive around the block to get into it, but I figured it was worth a try.I pulled onto the block and approached the corner spot. I noticed a police van parked a few cars back.I slowed down and moved toward the corner space, but decided it was no good and signaled that I was pulling back out into traffic.Just then, a police officer walked from the van toward a trash can on the corner. He waved for me to back up into the space, guiding me until I was an inch in front of the car parked behind me.“I saw you slow down,” he said. “You’re fine.”“I’m just over the crosswalk,” I protested.“You’re fine,” he repeated.“And the pink signs say ‘No parking Sunday’.”“You’re fine,” he said again, his voice rising slightly. “Those signs are wrong. It’s just no parking Monday.

But he did it anyway. 12 PhotosView Slide Show ›By Joanne KaufmanThe house did not immediately grab Harlan Coben by the lapels.It was, to tick off the liabilities, situated on one of the main drags in Ridgewood, N.J. Locally, it was a well-known pile of Second Empire gingerbread, with pink trim and a mansard roof. People would drive by and gawk. Sometimes, they would park down the street and, affecting a casual air, take a nice, slow walk past the property for a closer look. And with three floors and nine bedrooms, it was a lot of house.Perhaps most problematic, it was a touch too on-the-nose for the best-selling author of a few dozen thrillers to live in a spooky Victorian manse. “It’s the kind of cliché I try to avoid when I write,” said Mr. Coben, whose latest work, “Run Away,” the story of a Manhattan money manager’s desperate attempts to save his renegade drug-addict daughter, is out this week.This not being a mystery by the master himself, there is no imperative to keep readers in suspense. Just over 20 years ago, Mr. Coben and his wife, Anne Armstrong-Coben, a pediatrician, were living across town in a center-hall colonial, expecting their third child (they now have four) and looking for more space. “When the house came on the market, it seemed like a good value,” he said, and so the deal was done.“My wife and I were in agreement,” Mr. Coben continued. “It wasn’t like one of those home shows where they have a couple, and she wants something totally modern and he wants something old-fashioned. I watch and always wonder, ‘How did you guys get married?’”But this acquisition might have satisfied even such bickering pairs. The previous owner had preserved and protected its abundant Old World charm — paneled walls and ceilings, wainscoting, crown molding, herringbone floors, beveled leaded-glass doors — while showing an appreciation for modern conveniences of the Sub-Zero kind.“The Victorian had all the structure of a great old house, but it really was homey,” Mr. Coben said. “I couldn’t turn it down. I sort of fell in love.”The love burns as brightly as ever, but now it has a bittersweet tinge. One by one, the children have gone out into the world. With the youngest off to college next fall, Mr. Coben and his wife will be empty nesters in a very big nest. “But the kids like coming back to the house,” he said, smiling gamely. “They all have their favorite nooks and crannies.”Of course, Mr. Coben has his favorite spots, too. The library ranks high both because it provides an ideal background for the author photos on his book jackets and because, plain and simple, it’s a library. It has reading matter and lots of it, as well as treasures like a Maltese falcon statue, a tip of the hat to Dashiell Hammett, one of Mr. Coben’s literary idols. (“It’s kind of a cliché, but it’s here.”) Occupation: writerEdifice complex: “It was hard for me to imagine living in a house this spectacular,” Mr. Coben said. “I had panic attacks about living in a house this cool.”There is also a statue of Boston Celtics legend John Havlicek. “I loved him when I was a kid,” said Mr. Coben, a native of Newark, N.J., who played on the basketball team at Amherst College.Some of the volumes in the handsome built-in bookcases are foreign editions of the Coben oeuvre. Such display is not born of a desire to trumpet the popularity of exhortatory titles like “Hold Tight,” “Play Dead” and “Tell No One” in distant ports. It is all about storage.Storage is something of a theme for Mr. Coben, who has accumulated many items related to his work — both priceless and worthless — and has not the slightest idea what to do with them. Thus, plaques, posters of the film adaptations of his novels, photographs (some sent by fans) and blowup images of the New York Times best-seller list with this or that Coben novel in the top spot lean against one another in the library, just steps from the pool table.For the record, no one in the family picks up a cue stick. Ever. The presence of the table is a puzzle best left to keener minds. Except when reporters are around and there is an attempt to tidy up, the stretch of green felt holds detritus and, when Mr. Coben is sitting in a chair nearby, his feet.He and his wife have made a few alterations to the house over the years. They painted that pink exterior trim blue, added a bathroom, converted a broken-down greenhouse into a sunroom, outfitted the backyard with a pool and a sports court, and in the spirit of D.I.Y., installed a faux-tin ceiling in the kitchen using plastic molding and gray spray paint.Mr. Coben has an officially designated office on the second floor. It was once the bedroom of his younger daughter, Eve, which explains the red-and-purple walls. Providing a sober contrast is the partners desk that Mr. Coben and his wife bought to celebrate their first wedding anniversary.Actually, the office is kind of superfluous. Unlike authors who require a setting with a specific barometric pressure to write even a check, Mr. Coben can work anywhere: a coffee shop, the back of an Uber (seriously). Plot turns have presented themselves during his time on the treadmill desk in the third-floor workout room and in the sunroom, which is just off the kitchen. “I don’t need or want one particular spot,” said Mr. Coben, who signed a deal last year with Netflix to turn several of his thrillers into series and movies.He left the job of furnishing the house to his wife when they moved in two decades ago. And sometimes he may feel a twinge of regret about that decision, particularly about some of the contributions from his mother-in-law, an antiques lover who is now deceased. “Once in a while I see something that’s really ugly, and I don’t know why we’re keeping it, and a lot of it was from her,” Mr. Coben said, hastily adding, “But I do like the player piano that came from her.”It was his mother-in-law who bought him the menagerie of animal-head walking sticks in the stand by the front door. “She thought I should have a collection of something, but I haven’t collected any beyond the ones she got me,” Mr. Coben said, unscrewing one of the sticks to reveal a flask, another to show the dagger tucked inside.Just a weapon looking for a plot.For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

Today in galaxy-shaking news:Astronomers captured this first-ever image of a black hole. The cosmic abyss is in the heart of the Messier 87 galaxy, some 55 million light-years from Earth.The image was years in the making. It took a planet-sized network of radio telescopes.Here’s how a black hole works (and what would happen if you fell into one).Separately, SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy, the world’s most powerful rocket in operation, is set to launch at 8 p.m. Eastern time, carrying a Saudi Arabian communications satellite. You can watch._____2. President Trump sharpened his anti-immigration message through the voices of his base.During a high-dollar fund-raiser in Texas, Mr. Trump urged several donors to stand up and describe finding the bodies of migrants. The president, pictured arriving in San Antonio, said that he had never heard the stories of migrants dying, even from his top immigration and border patrol officials.“Dangerous people are coming here and the good people are dying,” Mr. Trump said, adding that all the donors had told him that building a border wall was the answer.For years, both political parties have tried — and failed — to overhaul the nation’s immigration laws, mindful that someday the system could reach a breaking point. That time may be now, our reporters write in a sweeping analysis._____3. “Spying did occur” on the Trump campaign during the 2016 presidential election, Attorney General William Barr told lawmakers.Appearing before Congress for a second consecutive day, Mr. Barr said he would review “both the genesis and the conduct of intelligence activities directed at the Trump campaign,” including possible improper “spying” by American intelligence agencies.Mr. Barr shifted slightly on when he would make public a redacted version of the Mueller report on Russian interference in the election. On Tuesday, he said “within a week,” but today, he said he hoped to deliver it “next week.”_____4. Benjamin Netanyahu is on course to become Israel’s longest-serving prime minister.With nearly all of the votes counted, the centrist Blue and White alliance led by his rival Benny Gantz conceded, all but affirming a more conservative direction for the country.

Five weeks of phased voting begins on Thursday._____5. Back on the U.S. campaign trail:Senator Bernie Sanders still casts himself as an outsider. But in Washington, he is now part of the inner Democratic circle. And he’s disrupting it with his campaign push for “Medicare for all.”We asked a handful of economists to estimate total American health care expenditures in 2019 under such a plan. The answers varied, but this is clear: It would be the largest domestic policy change in a generation.Separately, as a married gay man and a Scripture-quoting Christian, Pete Buttigieg is challenging the religious right and, not incidentally, Vice President Mike Pence on their own territory._____6. Alaska is the fastest-warming state in the country.In March, temperatures were as much as 20 degrees above historical averages. And when the ice softens early, it can spell serious danger. Alaskans are not just accustomed to hard-frozen winters, they depend on them for essential transportation, subsistence hunting, industry and recreation. Above, Portage Lake, where a namesake glacier is no longer in sight.This weekend, The Times Magazine dedicates an entire issue to climate change, including this story about the intersection of policymaking and economics.Separately, we’re tracking a powerful, though not uncommon, storm in the Midwest.

Mr. Cruz, now 20 and corresponding with pen pals while in jail, faces the possibility of the death penalty in the attack, in which 17 people were killed and 17 others wounded on Feb. 14, 2018.“This is a life sentence for me,” Mitchell Dworet, who lost his 17-year-old son, Nicholas, said at an emotional news conference in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., that was called to announce the lawsuits. Mr. Dworet’s younger son, Alexander, was injured in the shooting.Mr. Dworet’s lawyer, Michael Goldfarb, said at least part of any damages eventually received by the Dworet family would go toward a charitable foundation it created in Nicholas’s name.Many frustrated Parkland residents have accused local government of failures before and during the deadly shooting, and those filing the new lawsuits said they hoped the litigation would help hold officials to account. Over the past 14 months, as Parkland students  began a national youth movement against gun violence, some of the victims’ families focused on the school district and the sheriff’s office. They led a successful push to oust the sheriff, Scott Israel, and an unsuccessful attempt to have the schools superintendent, Robert W. Runcie, fired.“To our family, and our son, this lawsuit will bring some accountability,” said Lisa Olson, whose son, William, was shot in both arms. Speaking through tears, she called every day since the shooting “a struggle.”“My son didn’t go to school today,” she said. “He couldn’t. And we have many days like that now.”Lawsuits have become a sad routine following the country’s deadly mass shootings, with victims’ families pursuing a variety of strategies to try to receive compensation, force the adoption of safety measures and hold private and public entities responsible. That includes lawsuits against gun manufacturers, which have been seen as uphill court battles.Recently, families from the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., employed a legal approach previously used against the cigarette industry to pierce the shield that has protected the gun industry in the past, and going after how gun manufacturers marketed an assault rifle.The F.B.I. identified 27 active-shooter incidents in the United States last year, according to a report the bureau published on Wednesday. The episodes, which spanned 16 states, killed 85 people. None was deadlier than the Parkland shooting.The lawsuits filed on Wednesday on behalf of 12 of those killed in the shooting and 10 others who were injured claim that the Broward County Sheriff’s Office failed to try to stop the gunman during the rampage. The sheriff’s office declined to comment, citing the pending litigation.Scot Peterson, a sheriff’s deputy at the time and the only armed police officer at the school on the day of the shooting, remained outside the building as the attack took place. Mr. Peterson, who retired in the days after the massacre and has maintained that he was unsure of the gunman’s location, is named as a respondent in the lawsuits along with the sheriff’s office, the school district and an unarmed campus security monitor, Andrew Medina.Mr. Medina saw Mr. Cruz get out of an Uber ride with a large bag and walk into the school, but did not confront him or call for a lockdown, an investigation showed. He lost his job last summer.Henderson Behavioral Health, a local clinic that treated Mr. Cruz, is also named in the lawsuits.Mr. Cruz confessed to the police, and his public defenders said he would plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence. But prosecutors rejected that deal, so Mr. Cruz pleaded not guilty and now awaits trial on charges of murder and attempted murder. No trial date has been set.Records released this week by the Broward County state attorney’s office showed that while in jail, Mr. Cruz has been corresponding with pen pals — a woman in Britain and her brother — telling her that he envisions a life after prison in which he would get married, have children and name the boys Kalashnikov, Makarov and Remington, after the gun manufacturers. At the same time, Mr. Cruz acknowledged that he could die by lethal injection.“Its kind of what I want but I’m unsure of myself so I’m just letting people save me from myself, saving me from something that I can never return from,” he wrote on Oct. 13 in a handwritten letter to the woman, identified as Miley, who created a Facebook group for supporters of Mr. Cruz.“Maybe I should get the death penalty,” he wrote in another letter. “I just want love.”The letters, dating from October and November, include stick figures holding hands and smiley faces with hearts. Mr. Cruz has also written to Miley’s brother, identified as Liam.One issue in the Florida lawsuits is how local governments, their former employees and the clinic may be liable for compensating the shooting victims. A sovereign immunity law protects any single victim from collecting more than $200,000 in damages from the government without approval from the State Legislature. Those claims bills can take years to pass.In an effort to avoid such a lengthy process for the Parkland families, State Senator Lauren Book, a Democrat, filed legislation this year establishing a rare compensation fund that would set aside $160 million in public funds for the 34 victims of the Stoneman Douglas shooting. But the bill, which has yet to get a hearing, appears unlikely to be approved before the annual session is scheduled to end on May 3.“This is a huge, huge, huge undertaking in the amount of time that we had to work on this,” Ms. Book said. “It is not an easy lift.”Lawyers for the families said on Wednesday that they suspected that the school district had hired a lobbying firm, GrayRobinson, to lobby against the compensation fund. But both Ms. Book and the district said the accusation was not true; the district said it retained the firm for exactly the opposite purpose: to lobby for the fund’s creation.“At no time has the District or GrayRobinson lobbied against the compensation fund,” Kathy Koch, a spokeswoman for the district, said in a statement.The state continues to investigate the shooting. At the same time that the families announced their lawsuits on Wednesday, a commission that has already identified a range of failures on the part of local officials met to review additional issues, including whether public schools in general underreport criminal and safety incidents, and the manner in which victims’ families in Parkland were told by the authorities that their loved ones had died.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byIt revealed the folly of the president’s approach to politics.By The Editorial BoardThe editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.What a debacle President Trump’s shutdown proved to be — what a toddler’s pageant of foot-stomping and incompetence, of vainglory and self-defeat. Mr. Trump tormented public servants and citizens and wounded the country, and, in conceding on Friday after holding the government hostage for 35 days, could claim to have achieved nothing.He succeeded only in exposing the emptiness of his bully’s bravado, of his “I alone can fix it” posturing. Once upon a time, Mr. Trump promised that Mexico would pay for a wall. He instead made all Americans pay for a partisan fantasy.Maybe you want a wall. Can you possibly argue that Mr. Trump’s shutdown strategy advanced your cause? He made the right decision on Friday — to sign a bill reopening the government through Feb. 15, giving lawmakers time to reach a permanent deal. But he could have had this same outcome without a shutdown. He ultimately agreed to the sort of bill that Democrats have been pitching for weeks — one that contains not one dollar in wall funding.In his announcement, the president struggled to obscure his failure with yet another rambling infomercial about the glory of walls. “No matter where you go, they work,” he said (raising the question of how you can get there if, in fact, there’s a wall in your way). He had nothing of substance to offer beyond the usual specious claims that only his wall can end the border flood of drugs, crime and migrant women who have been duct-taped and stuffed into vans by human traffickers. To repeat: Fewer border-crossing apprehensions were made in 2017 than at any time since 1971; drugs are overwhelmingly smuggled through established points of entry; and the only crisis at the border is a humanitarian one, of people fleeing violence and seeking asylum — again, mostly at established points of entry — under international law.There is nothing to celebrate about this sorry shutdown, though it’s perhaps understandable that congressional Democrats were reveling in Mr. Trump’s collapse. Members of Mr. Trump’s conservative fan base demonstrated that, even if the president continues to insist on alternative facts, they are capable of acknowledging that truth.Within minutes of the announcement, the bomb-throwing pundit Ann Coulter — among those credited with having scolded Mr. Trump into rejecting the temporary funding bill passed by the Senate last month — tweeted her judgment:“Good news for George Herbert Walker Bush: As of today, he is no longer the biggest wimp ever to serve as President of the United States.”The president tried to stand tough for Ms. Coulter and her ilk. Even as federal workers lined up at food banks, sought unemployment benefits and took backup gigs driving for Uber, he insisted he would not give an inch. He stormed out of meetings with Democratic leaders. He indulged in a public spat with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi over his State of the Union address. He tweeted angrily. On Thursday, he was still vowing, “We will not cave!”But on Friday he caved. With a growing number of overworked, stressed-out air traffic controllers calling in sick, staffing shortages at two airports on the East Coast began to snarl air travel. The spectacle of enraged travelers, canceled flights and imperiled safety turned up the heat on the White House and Congress.Republican lawmakers were already in a foul mood. On Thursday, the Senate voted on, and failed to pass, two competing plans for reopening the government. Afterward, there were reports of sniping and finger-pointing within the Republican conference.Along with their concerns about the human cost of the shutdown, Republicans were no doubt antsy about the negative impact the shutdown was having on their president’s public standing. Polls consistently showed that most Americans did not support the shutdown and that most blamed Mr. Trump for it. An ABC poll released this week put Mr. Trump’s approval rating at 37 percent and showed him to have the lowest two-year average approval of any president in the past seven decades. Perhaps he noticed that a poll released on Wednesday found that 59 percent of Americans thought he cared little about their problems. On top of all that, the Russia investigation hit the headlines again, when, in a predawn raid on Friday, F.B.I. agents — working without pay — arrested Roger Stone, a longtime adviser to Mr. Trump. Mr. Stone has been indicted on seven counts related to Russia’s meddling in the 2016 election, including witness tampering, obstruction and making false statements.It was, in short, shaping up to be a very bad day for the president, who really cannot be blamed for wanting to change the story line. Of course, the new narrative — that Mr. Trump got owned by Ms. Pelosi — isn’t likely to sit well with him, either. And who knows what he’ll do next to try to salve his ego, and salvage some political capital with the minority of Americans who still seem inclined to support him.In his Friday remarks, Mr. Trump made threatening noises about declaring a national emergency if Congress cannot reach a compromise by the time this agreement expires. Polls suggest that such a move would be wildly unpopular, causing the president and his party even more grief. Maybe that danger will motivate congressional Republicans to hammer out a deal without him.Here’s hoping that this mess leaves Mr. Trump with a vital lesson — even if he doesn’t care about a functional government, the rest of America does.

I write about the technology industry, from the old titans like IBM to start-ups working on the future of artificial intelligence.In this week’s newsletter, we’re largely taking a break from the consumer internet giants, and the various controversies swirling around them. (Exception: Amazon’s surprise announcement on Thursday to abandon its plans to build a headquarters in New York. See below.)Instead, we’re going to look at recent research and reports that track how digital technology is moving into mainstream industries, and the implications.Let’s start with a smart piece this week by my colleague Erin Griffith, “The Next Wave of ‘Unicorn’ Start-Ups.” Erin asked CB Insights, a research firm that studies start-ups and venture capital, to create a list of the next wave of young companies likely to reach valuations of $1 billion or more. She then reported on some of the 50 companies.The first round of well-known unicorns, led by Uber and Airbnb, she writes, exploited smartphones and cloud computing to upend old-line businesses. The next companies poised to become unicorns are going narrower, deeper and into more fields.“They largely focus on software,” she writes, “for specific industries like farms, banks and life sciences companies.”That kind of broad-based adoption across the nation’s $20 trillion economy is what will deliver growth and higher living standards for many. Yet the advance of data-driven artificial intelligence will also provide real-world evidence of how much and how quickly this technology may widen income disparities and kill jobs.The short answer, it seems, is not as fast as techno-pessimists fear. A.I.’s progress is impressive, but limited. An article this week by Cade Metz, “A.I. Shows Promise Assisting Physicians,”  underlines that point.The piece describes an A.I. research program whose accuracy matched or slightly surpassed human physicians in diagnosing common childhood diseases like influenza. The software was trained on the medical histories, lab tests and other clinical data in more than 600,000 electronic health records of children in southern China.It was an encouraging demonstration. But the experimental system relied on the easy access to personal data in China, where privacy regulations are less restrictive, and was confined to diagnosing common ailments.That step-by-step approach is the counsel for business in a new book by Thomas Davenport, “The AI Advantage: How to Put the Artificial Intelligence Revolution to Work” (MIT Press). Mr. Davenport, a professor of information technology and management at Babson College, is a seasoned expert in using digital data to streamline operations and spot opportunities. And he’s been at it since well before the current A.I. wave, which is both a technological evolution and a branding craze.His advice to mainstream companies is that the best course is often to use basic A.I. tools to automate mundane office tasks in operations like accounting, billing, payments and customer service — and to avoid “moon shots.”One of Mr. Davenport’s prime examples of a misguided moon shot was IBM’s initial efforts to apply its Watson technology to diagnosing cancer. That was a high-profile science project that proved more difficult, time-consuming and costly than anticipated, though IBM continues that work with several leading cancer centers.Speaking of IBM, the company was out in San Francisco this week for its annual Think conference, which attracted more than 25,000 attendees. Its executives presented its Watson and cloud technology as the trusted path for companies across the industrial spectrum that want to embrace A.I.IBM cannot compete head-on with Amazon, Microsoft and Google in the big-spending game of building out massive data centers to provide the infrastructure layer of cloud computing to one and all. So it is seeking to shift the competition.IBM talks about “chapter two” in the cloud market. Increasingly, it says, companies will run not only new applications but also their legacy software on the cloud, either private clouds in their own data centers or on IBM’s cloud. The next stage of cloud computing, Virginia Rometty, IBM’s chief executive, told Jon Fortt of CNBC, “is going to be driven by the modernization of mission-critical apps. That’s our sweet spot.”And in a nod to reality, IBM announced a Watson Anywhere initiative: Its A.I. technology will run on the popular clouds of Amazon, Microsoft or Google as well as IBM’s cloud.In other news:■ J. David Goodman, City Hall reporter for The Times, deftly explained the shifting politics before Amazon withdrew its plan in “Why Amazon Is Caught in an Unexpected Brawl in New York.” But what happened in Queens is part of a broader resistance to the tech boom, and its consequences. After the protests surfaced last year, Fred Wilson, the dean of New York venture capitalists, told me that “it’s partly from a sense that Amazon coming in is not going to help them, and will only drive up their costs. To really be a success in New York, the benefits of the tech sector have to extend to every borough and every neighborhood.”That concern, across the country, as A.I. technology marches ahead, is the subject of  a lengthy analysis this week by Mark Muro, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.■ For a rich, enlightening read, I recommend a piece in this week’s New York Times Magazine, “The Secret History of Women in Coding.” The “secret” is a headline writer’s exaggeration. Anyone with an interest in computing history knows about Ada Lovelace, Grace Hopper and the women who programmed the early Eniac computer. Those stories have been told repeatedly, including in books.But Clive Thompson, the author, elegantly weaves that history around the story of an early female programmer who is alive and recalls it all. His piece captures what it was like in the 1940s through early 1960s, when writing software was a wide-open field, before a male-dominated culture took root.As Lois Haibt — who in 1955, as a freshly minted Vassar College graduate, joined the IBM team that created Fortran, the first popular programming language — once told me: “They took anyone who seemed to have an aptitude for problem-solving skills — bridge players, chess players, even women.”Steve Lohr, based in The Times’s New York headquarters, writes about technology and economics.

So he did what most New Yorkers do. He called his doctor, got a prescription for a Z-Pak, and walked to the Duane Reade near his apartment on the Lower East Side.When he got there, the elevator to the basement pharmacy was broken, and 40 people were in line ahead of him, he said. After waiting for an hour, the pharmacist told him they were out of stock. His phone had died, so he couldn’t ask his doctor to send the prescription elsewhere. “It was so miserable,” said Mr. Kinariwala, 36, who left the drugstore that day without antibiotics. “I’m a pinball in the middle of this thing.”Shortly after this experience, Mr. Kinariwala, who has a background in finance, introduced Capsule, an app-based service that delivers same-day medicine throughout all five boroughs. Since it started in 2016, Capsule has grown to 260 employees, most of whom work at the company’s headquarters in Midtown Manhattan.The company works with 31 pharmacists who verify prescriptions and field customer phone calls, which range from concerns about a lost birth control pill to frequent urination. Though Capsule is designed to be mobile-first, it has a storefront pharmacy in Chelsea, which stocks 5,100 different medications and uses technology to track inventory. They receive deliveries from wholesale suppliers several times a day.Drugstore chains have been considered an aesthetic scourge on the city for decades. In a 1999 Times article about Duane Reade’s takeover of the city, New Yorkers called the pharmacy’s expansion a “plague” and “insane.” Duane Reade currently has 126 stores in Manhattan alone, including locations owned by Walgreens, which purchased Duane Reade in 2010 and has started to spread its own tentacles. Walgreens currently has 88 locations across the city, including its Rite-Aid-owned stores. CVS has 150.But if delivery services like Capsule continue to expand, Mr. Kinariwala said that chain pharmacies in New York might succumb to technology in a similar way that Barnes & Noble and Borders were pushed aside by Amazon or the taxi industry has been challenged by Uber and Lyft.“I think you’ll see,” Mr. Kinariwala said, “in every industry, people that don’t serve the consumer don’t deserve to exist. New York is all about faster, better, stronger.”Linda V. Green, a professor of health care management at the Columbia Business School, is skeptical of that claim. “I think it’s not obvious that a stand-alone pharmacy prescription service is going to make big inroads, particularly in a metropolitan area where you have a Duane Reade on every other street corner,” she said. “The idea of delivering prescriptions is actually old. It’s not clear to me what problem they’re solving here.”Capsule is not the first pharmacy to offer delivery and app services. C.O. Bigelow, a family-owned pharmacy in the West Village that dates to 1838, has a delivery driver, a messenger and an app. Unsurprisingly, Ian Ginsberg, the owner, isn’t impressed by Capsule. “They’re not doing anything we haven’t done for 100 years,” he said. “All they’ve done is taken the human element out of it. They’re trying to scale as fast as possible.”Deliveries, he suggested, can also be dangerous. “Patients don’t have a face-to-face opportunity with the pharmacist so there could be subpar education regarding the medication,” said Arash Dabestani, the senior director of pharmacy at N.Y.U. Langone Health.Walgreens declined to comment but noted that they also deliver same-day in the city for a fee. And it takes two weeks for the first package from PillPack, a national pharmacy and subsidiary of Amazon, to arrive. “PillPack is a mail order pharmacy. It’s a totally different thing,” Mr. Kinariwala said. “I think of the competition as people who continue to tolerate a bad pharmacy experience.” PillPack did not respond to a request for comment.Even though several independent pharmacies in New York offer deliveries, they might not have the means to do so outside of their own neighborhoods. C.O. Bigelow charges $13 to deliver beyond its surrounding area, which is from the Battery to Chelsea. Another pharmacy, Apotheco, with two locations in Midtown, delivers within a 50-mile radius, but patients outside Manhattan have to call early in the morning to secure a same-day arrival.“I would say everyone has been quite slow in delivering,” said Mr. Dabestani, of N.Y.U. He does not think delivery is an appropriate option for those on serious medications who need to be counseled in person. “The model should be patient-specific,” he said.“New York is a great market for Capsule because it is such a dense city,” said Paul Hudson, the chief investment officer at Glade Brook Capital, which has invested in the company, along with Thrive Capital, the venture capital firm founded by Josh Kushner, Jared Kushner’s brother. “There’s a lot of dual-income households,” Mr. Hudson added, “and the pharmacy experience in New York really hasn’t been modernized as far as infrastructure and tech in a long time.”Dr. Seth Finkelstein, an obstetrician-gynecologist in Manhattan who has become frustrated with traditional pharmacies, has been suggesting Capsule to his patients. “Every time a patient calls me telling me a prescription can’t be filled, or I have to call insurance for preauthorization, that’s my time or my staff’s time, and that’s money and time diverted to taking care of other people,” he said. “The pharmacy should be taking care of this.”Capsule’s “insurance specialists,” who help doctors with preauthorizations, are better at dealing with insurance companies than the pharmacists at chain stores, Dr. Finkelstein said. (Although he added that the process is not perfect; sometimes confused Capsule specialists call his office for guidance.)Merlin Chowkwanyun, a professor at Columbia, was drawn to the service after losing his cool waiting in a CVS line for 30 minutes.He found, however, that the deliveries often arrived late. And one time, Capsule dropped off the wrong generic brand of a migraine medication he had requested.For some people, it’s still much easier to run into one of the hundreds of chain drugstores across the city than to wait two hours or more for a delivery. “If I wake up with a sty in my eye, I can walk two blocks and pick up a prescription,” said Ms. Green, the health care management professor. “This is all about convenience, and there’s already a lot of other ways in which these things have become convenient.”But in the age of Seamless and Amazon Prime Now, Mr. Kinariwala seems up to the challenge. He said that he wants to see Capsule become the “flip of Duane Reade” within five years. “It’s everywhere and everyone knows about it and uses it,” he said. “But everyone loves it.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byThe Trump campaign floated a proposal for a wholesale 5G network. It’s politically expedient but still a great idea.By Kevin WerbachMr. Werbach, a professor at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, served as an adviser on telecommunication policy in the Clinton and Obama administrations.The Trump re-election campaign’s wireless open access proposal was a poorly vetted scheme possibly intended to score political points. It was squelched almost immediately after it became public, as shocked White House staff members complained that it contradicted the administration’s support for competing wireless networks. The twist? Open access wireless is actually a terrific idea. Some forward-thinking Democrats and public interest advocates have been pushing it for decades.The concept, promoted by Republican operatives such as Newt Gingrich and Karl Rove, is for a network supporting fifth-generation (5G) wireless technology to operate on a wholesale basis. Carriers such as AT&T, Comcast and Verizon could buy capacity. So could anyone else: Apple, Amazon, Walmart, Uber or small operators serving rural areas. No company could use exclusive control over spectrum to block competition.Last year, a leaked National Security Council presentation called for nationalization of 5G networks to improve cybersecurity and better compete against China. The proposal was ignominiously killed and its author left the White House. The Trump re-election campaign’s proposal wisely dropped the government takeover. It shifted the focus to wholesale access, which could be overseen by an independent nonprofit organization, like the independent system operators that manage electricity markets. Today’s cellphones use fourth-generation wireless technology, or 4G. 5G, a set of standards under development, promises higher speeds, improved coverage and better support for new technologies such as augmented reality, autonomous vehicles and connected sensors in all types of devices. 5G networks require denser construction of towers, reducing the distance between a tower and each device. To make 5G a reality, companies and consumers around the world will have to invest hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade to upgrade hardware, phones and networks. The countries leading the way could reap huge economic benefits.The December arrest in Canada of a top official of Huawei, China’s biggest communications hardware provider, raised the stakes considerably. Meng Wanzhou is accused of committing fraud to help Huawei evade sanctions against Iran. The United States is pressuring its allies to ban Huawei from building their 5G networks on national security grounds.Those moves will not, however, accelerate 5G deployment in the United States. The Chinese government aggressively coordinates and promotes 5G activity, which is proceeding at a breakneck pace. China Tower, for example, added 460 wireless tower sites per day in 2017, more than ten times the rate of American companies, according to a report by Deloitte.The view of American policymakers, which has been consistent through at least four administrations, is that competition among wireless operators is superior to heavy-handed government initiatives. Nevermind that while American wireless providers have a strong track record on innovation, prices for consumers are high by global standards, and the so-called free market is actually an oligopoly of four major carriers that could soon fall to three. Way back in 1995, a Columbia University economist, Eli Noam, proposed an alternative: a wholesale spectrum provider that sold capacity to all. Over the next few years, some progressives (myself included) argued that cable broadband networks should be subject to a similar open access mandate. And in 2010, as the Federal Communications Commission developed the National Broadband Plan, a team led by the Harvard legal scholar Yochai Benkler made a detailed case for wholesale sharing. The idea was shot down each time amid furious industry opposition. Why would the Trump campaign endorse open access? Rivada Networks, a politically connected firm that counts Peter Thiel, a prominent Trump donor, among its investors, appears to be positioning itself for the lucrative contract to provide the technology for such a system. Mr. Trump’s political advisers see the open access plan as a way to improve wireless service in rural areas, a gift to the president’s base.These motivations should not obscure the value of open access. The communications industry has already shown that a competitive open market sometimes can’t develop without government action. The F.C.C. had to prevent phone companies from squelching internet service providers, and many companies that develop online applications face potential blocking of their services and discrimination by broadband operators. The primary way the government makes wireless spectrum available today is through exclusive licensing to the highest bidder. That can make it difficult for companies that provide niche services such as telemedicine and smart electric grids, or that serve less populous areas, which the big national carriers often ignore.Even some architects of the current system are reconsidering. Peter Cramton, for example, helped more than a dozen countries design spectrum auctions. He’s now Rivada’s chief economist. As Mr. Cramton and his co-author, Linda Doyle, wrote in 2017, wholesale open access offers the best hope to break the wireless oligopoly while also using spectrum more efficiently.They were right. Making capacity available in real time at market prices limits hoarding and encourages innovation. Unleashing our brilliant start-up ecosystem through such market mechanisms, along with opportunities for unlicensed access to wireless capacity, is America’s best hope to beat China in 5G.But a poorly managed implementation could create a greedy wholesale monopolist, or turn wireless access into a political football, as is the disastrous fate of Australia’s open access fiber network. And the details of implementation are not this administration’s strong suit.There is also no guarantee that rural wireless providers will rush in to take advantage of the opportunity. A wholesale system will require careful oversight and a long-term commitment by the government. The political campaign’s rapid walk-back does not inspire confidence.Nonetheless, tech-savvy Democrats should welcome the embrace of their open access vision. Even if it means being more supportive of a Trump campaign position than the White House.

Users can also form groups of as many as 500 people on WeChat to discuss and debate the issues of the day.While Facebook users constantly see ads in their News Feeds, WeChat users only see one or two ads a day in their Moment feeds. That’s because WeChat isn’t dependent on advertising for making money. It has a mobile payments system that has been widely adopted in China, which allows people to shop, play games, pay utility bills and order meal deliveries all from within the app. WeChat gets a commission from many of these services.“WeChat has shown definitively that private messaging, especially the small groups, is the future,” said Jeffrey Towson, a professor of investment at Peking University. “It is the uber utility of business and life. It has shown the path.”What is happening in China offers clues to not only how Facebook may carry out its shift, but how the internet more broadly might change. Many of Silicon Valley’s tech giants are dependent today on online advertising to make enough money to keep growing and innovating on new services. Some call online ads the lifeblood of the internet.But WeChat, which has 1.1 billion monthly active users, shows that other models — particularly those based on payments and commerce — can support massive digital businesses. That has implications for Google, Twitter and many others, as well as Facebook.WeChat, of course, has its own flaws. The messaging app is heavily censored because of requirements by the Chinese government.Facebook declined to comment and Tencent did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Mr. Zuckerberg didn’t elaborate much this week on how the change toward private messaging would affect Facebook’s business, which relies on people publicly sharing posts to be able to serve them targeted advertisements. In a blog post, he said Facebook would build more ways for people to interact on top of messaging, “including calls, video chats, groups, stories, businesses, payments, commerce, and ultimately a platform for many other kinds of private services.”Yet it’s unclear whether Mr. Zuckerberg can pull all those features off with Facebook. On WeChat, those services are underpinned by its mobile payments system, WeChat Pay. Because payments is already tied into the messaging service, people can easily order meal deliveries, book hotels, hail ride-sharing cars and pay their bills. WeChat Pay itself has 900 million monthly active users.People also use WeChat Pay to transfer money and to buy personal finance products. More than 100 million customers have purchased WeChat’s personal finance products, which managed over 500 billion yuan, or $74 billion, by the end of last September, Tencent has said. Its users can buy everything from bonds and insurance to money market funds through the app.Facebook lacks such a payments system. So to be more like WeChat, the Silicon Valley company could have to acquire banking and payment licenses in many countries. One sign that Facebook has been thinking about payments is its work on a new crypto coin that is meant to let people send money to contacts on their messaging systems.To make Facebook a private messaging product, Mr. Zuckerberg may have a lot else to learn from Allen Zhang, the creator of WeChat. Mr. Zhang is famous for his perfectionist pursuit of a well-designed service.“He is renowned in China’s tech scene as an artist and philosopher, as well as for his fierce mission against anything that degrades user experience,” Connie Chan, an investor at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, recently wrote of Mr. Zhang.Mr. Zhang fought many internal battles when Tencent’s revenue department pushed to put more ads on WeChat. In a four-hour speech earlier this year, he pondered the question of why there were not more ads on the messaging service, especially the opening-page ads that are the norm in many other Chinese mobile apps.Mr. Zhang’s answer: Many Chinese spent a lot of time — about one third of their online time — on WeChat, he said. “If WeChat were a person, it would have to be your best friend so that you would be willing to spend so much time with it,” he said. “How could I post an ad on the face of your best friend? Every time you see it, you’ll have to watch an ad before you can talk to it.”Mr. Zhang, who has made restraint his product philosophy, has been lucky because Tencent makes most of its money from online games so that it does not need to sell ads for revenue.Tencent doesn’t break out its revenues from WeChat, but its financial report for the third quarter of 2018 said that social advertising revenue, which includes WeChat, grew 61 percent from a year earlier, while the category called “other businesses,” which includes payment services, rose by 69 percent.Mr. Zuckerberg does not have that luxury, given that he is trying to switch from an ad-based business into a different model. It will be far from an easy task to pull off.“Zuck is clearly trying to address Facebook’s problems of privacy and fake news, but it will greatly affect its monetization capability,” said Ivy Li, a venture capitalist at Seven Seas Partners in Menlo Park, Calif. “How comprehensive the surgery is going to be and whether the implementation will be twisted by all kinds of compromises is a big question.”She added: “Facebook is trying to seek a balance between a public square and a private space in an increasingly polarizing society. The final result could be it will be abandoned by both.”Follow Li Yuan on Twitter: @LiYuan6.videoAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayBy Jill CowanGood morning.(Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.)When he took office this year, Gov. Gavin Newsom inherited an expansive, consuming problem. The state doesn’t have enough housing, and what housing it does have is rapidly becoming too expensive for most people who live and work in the state. Legislators have tried to make a dent in various aspects of the crisis. Today, my colleague Jennifer Medina explores how one of Mr. Newsom’s efforts is playing out in a Southern California city. Not too long after he took office, Mr. Newsom, in his State of the State address, called out several cities he said were not doing their fair share to develop more affordable housing. Among them: Montebello, a historic middle class suburb just east of Los Angeles that was once referred to as a Mexican-American Beverly Hills.Just a short drive away from Downtown Los Angeles, Montebello has long attracted government employees and other white-collar workers eager to buy modest single-family homes — a kind of “promised land” for those looking to get out of the city. Today, three-bedroom homes can be found for around $500,000 — a relative bargain compared with much of Los Angeles. So it was, at least in some ways, a bit of an odd choice for the governor’s ire.State officials say the city has done little to keep up with the growing demand, failing to create a clear plan for how it will expand its housing stock. But since the governor’s speech, he’s tried to strike a more conciliatory tone, appearing with Mayor Jack Hadjinian of Montebello after a closed-door meeting with other local government leaders last month.“I’m not mad at him for calling us out,” Mr. Hadjinian said. “We see this as an opportunity.”Juan Rivera, a home-ownership counselor at Montebello Housing Development Corporation, said he had watched the prospects for first-time buyers become increasingly dire.“Affordable housing? There is none,” he said. “I don’t think it’s a unique problem to Montebello, but the opportunities to live here are just fewer and fewer.”But local developers and investors like Robert Tapia say it is the governor who needs to be more open to creative solutions. “He’s fundamentally not understanding how real estate gets done,” he said. “Where do we come up with the land? People keep holding on to their land, onto their properties — we have no control over ownership.”(We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

Berkeley.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Erin GriffithSAN FRANCISCO — For Rick Heitzmann, a venture capitalist at FirstMark Capital, the moment is now.Two companies that FirstMark invested in years ago, Pinterest and Postmates, have filed paperwork to go public. Pinterest unveiled an offering prospectus on Friday. A third company, Airbnb, is expected to do the same within the next year. All are likely to be embraced by Wall Street, generating huge profits for FirstMark.Which means it’s time for Mr. Heitzmann, whose New York investment firm has kept a relatively low profile, to consider hiring a public relations agency.The flood of initial public offerings is an occasion for FirstMark to “tell our story,” he said. “We have been part of some of the more successful start-ups in the last several years and have been instrumental to their growth, often as the first investor. That’s a good story to tell.”Across tech land, investors who helped nurture “unicorns,” the start-ups valued at more than $1 billion, are now getting ready to embody a different animal metaphor: the peacock.That’s because the companies they bet on years ago — such as Uber, Lyft, Pinterest, Slack, Postmates and Peloton — are preparing to list on the stock market, which would create a bonanza of returns, the likes of which Silicon Valley hasn’t seen for years.For venture capitalists, that means it is time to stop walking a tightrope of self-promotion. For years, many did not want to look as if they were taking credit for the success of the start-ups they backed. And they did not want to make it seem that the truckloads of money they stood to make were more important than their start-ups’ high-minded missions.So they sent fawning congratulatory tweets, posted generic blog posts to Medium and name-dropped their deals on one of a dozen interchangeable V.C. podcasts. They “thought led” and became “thinkfluencers.”Now that they’re ready to shed the false modesty, some investors are calling in the pros.Ann Miura-Ko, a partner at the venture capital firm Floodgate, recently worked with the public relations firm OutCast to spotlight her “special relationship” with the ride-hailing company Lyft. Ms. Miura-Ko invested in Lyft in 2010, when it was called Zimride, and her firm owns about 1.5 million shares in the company. That stake could be worth as much as $102 million when Lyft goes public, which could happen this week.Ms. Miura-Ko said Lyft’s I.P.O. would validate Floodgate’s strategy of investing in companies when they are just starting, before the bigger venture firms get involved.“We’ve had great exits along the way, but this is the real proof point,” she said. “We think it’s important to Floodgate’s story.”When asked about hiring a public relations firm, Ms. Miura-Ko deflected. Later, she said, “Every person has their own way of developing a megaphone.”In a follow-up statement, she added, “I’m a teacher and an investor, I have a Ph.D. in math modeling, and I think like an engineer, so thinking about myself and my business from a branding and marketing perspective doesn’t come naturally to me, but these are important factors in the success of all kinds of businesses all over the world, which is why I engaged OutCast to help me think through and formalize both the Floodgate brand and my professional brand.”OutCast declined to comment.In Silicon Valley, some public relations firms said they had noticed more queries from venture capitalists in the last month. Mike Moeller, founder of Aircover Communications, a public relations firm, said it had been busier than normal with cold calls from venture firms that were trying to stand out.“Some firms are realizing, ‘Huh, maybe awareness doesn’t just magically grow on trees,’” he said.“They’re realizing they need to be part of this conversation,” added John Kuch, a public relations executive at Moxie Communications Group. With so much money in tech, “folks who have been conservative are getting out there even more.”For years, venture capitalists on Sand Hill Road, the epicenter of the venture industry in Menlo Park, Calif., were a more buttoned-up lot. Few used public relations firms. Many investors looked askance at talking to the press.But that changed as venture capital increasingly became a reputation game. Venture firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, which was co-founded by the Netscape wunderkind Marc Andreessen, hired their own public relations staff.Some venture firms built out entire media divisions. First Round Capital, for example, created a digital magazine, First Round Review, which publishes entrepreneurial profiles, advice and lessons. Other investors have found time between start-up pitches and board meetings to publish books, deliver TED talks and amass huge followings on Twitter.Still, nothing crowns them as much as being associated with a unicorn company that goes public. When Facebook went public in 2012, venture capitalists who had invested in the social network solidified their reputations as rainmakers — and also were set for life. They included Jim Breyer of Accel Partners, David Sze of Greylock Partners and Peter Thiel of Founders Fund.“A $9 Billion Jackpot for Facebook Investor,” one headline screamed about Mr. Breyer in 2012, marveling at how he had turned a $12.7 million investment in the social network into a pile of gold.That kind of name recognition gives investors an edge over competition in new deals. Promotion is part of the game, said Lisa Wu, a partner at Norwest Venture Partners. “If you don’t do it, you miss out,” she said.Trevor O’Brien, who is working on a start-up in San Francisco, said entrepreneurs also looked at whether a venture capitalist had invested in any unicorns.“V.C.s showcasing logos from big investments does matter in terms of signaling credibility and experience,” he said, adding that while it is not the only factor, “it checks a box.”Alongside Ms. Miura-Ko and Mr. Heitzmann, this wave of I.P.O.s will likely raise the profiles of Jeff Jordan, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz who backed Airbnb and Pinterest, and Alfred Lin, a venture capitalist at Sequoia Capital who invested in Airbnb.Mr. Heitzmann said FirstMark was not embarking on a promotion effort because of trouble raising new funds or getting into good deals. Instead, founders of younger companies that FirstMark has invested in have suggested he try to raise the firm’s profile for their sake.“Portfolio companies have said, ‘If you guys had a better brand, it would help me recruit,’” he said.Ms. Miura-Ko said she didn’t do any personal branding when Floodgate started in 2010 because there wasn’t much competition to invest in the very young companies that the firm was targeting.“You didn’t have to think about it,” she said.But now it’s a lot noisier. Ms. Miura-Ko was recently told by students at Stanford University, where she teaches classes about start-ups, that to stand out, she should create her own channel on Discord, a chat app for gamers. She was amused by the suggestion but didn’t follow it, she said. Why? Because it didn’t feel authentic to her personal brand.Follow Erin Griffith on Twitter: @eringriffith.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Remy Tumin and Marcus Payadue(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. The gig economy arrived on Wall Street.Lyft’s initial public offering values the company at $24.3 billion, pricing its shares at $72 each to become the first publicly traded ride-sharing app. It will begin trading on the Nasdaq on Friday.This opens a new chapter for Silicon Valley on the public markets. Uber’s initial public offering, coming in the next few months, is expected to be even bigger, and other disruptive tech darlings are also going public. Here’s who’ll get rich.In other tech news: The U.S. government sued Facebook, saying it engaged in discrimination by targeting housing ads based on race and religion. Twitter and Google may also be under scrutiny._____2. President Trump addressed a rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., infused with his sense of vindication after the completion of the Mueller report.“The collusion delusion is over,” he told the cheering crowd. “This was nothing more than a sinister effort to undermine our historic election victory.”Three Times journalists are there.We examined the state of the economy under Mr. Trump. It’s his biggest bragging right, but it is shadowed by the Commerce Department’s downward revision of estimates for economic growth in the fourth quarter._____3. The Mueller report may be in, but the chasm between Democrats and Republicans is only growing wider.The House Intelligence Committee’s first hearing since the special counsel delivered his report fell into tumult as the committee tried to resume its own work on Russia’s intervention in the 2016 presidential election.Republicans called on the panel’s chairman, Adam Schiff, above right, to resign, and he accused them of turning a blind eye to President Trump’s wrongdoing.The Justice Department revealed that Mr. Mueller’s report came in at more than 300 pages, raising more questions about what information was left out of the four-page summary released by William Barr, the attorney general._____4. The U.S. wants to take a gay dating app out of Chinese hands.The Trump administration is pushing a Chinese firm, Beijing Kunlun, to relinquish its ownership of Grindr, over concerns that Beijing could use personal information on the U.S.-based app — like sexual orientation or dating habits — to blackmail or influence American officials.It appears to be the first case in which the U.S. has asserted that foreign control of a social media app has national security implications._____5. New York State filed a sweeping lawsuit against the Sackler family, which owns Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin.The lawsuit accuses members of the family of methodically erasing a paper trail of profits and shifting hundreds of millions of dollars to themselves through offshore entities as investigators closed in.It also lays out how OxyContin distributors helped pharmacies manipulate the timing and volume of orders to circumvent the monthly opioid limits as the epidemic of abuse exploded. Above, New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, announced the lawsuit.Spokesmen for Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family denied the allegations._____6. The Supreme Court rejected an appeal from gun owners to temporarily block a federal ban on bump stocks.Bump stocks, attachments that enable semiautomatic rifles to fire in sustained, rapid bursts, were banned by the Trump administration as of Tuesday. The court’s action means the ban remains in force while court challenges move forward.For many, the traumatic memories of gun violence have an enduring impact. We talked to survivors of mass shootings who continue to struggle, even years later. Above, a father picking up his daughter after the Newtown, Conn., shooting in 2012._____5. It’s pronounced boot-edge-edge.Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., has a challenging last name (thanks to his father, who immigrated from Malta). And he has an unconventional résumé. But he’s drawing big crowds and has jumped to third place in a poll of Iowa voters for the 2020 Democratic caucus.We also took a look at Senator Cory Booker’s road from enforcer to criminal justice reformer, beginning with rocky oversight of the Newark Police Department, and Senator Kamala Harris’s small-dollar, yet formidable, online fund-raising operation._____8. Three really interesting science stories:An iceberg twice the size of New York City is about to split from Antarctica. Two rifts on the Brunt Ice Shelf, in West Antarctica, are nearing one another. They will create an iceberg over 560 square miles in size. We’ve mapped the timeline of the split.The first global analysis of a fungus that has been wiping out frogs for decades demonstrates that it is, in the words of one researcher, “the most deadly pathogen known to science.” It has caused major declines in more than 500 species of frogs around the world, and at least 90 are presumed to have gone extinct.Last, a British woman has never experienced pain or anxiety, even during childbirth and surgery. Scientists have finally figured out why._____9. A harbinger of spring has finally arrived: baseball’s official opening day.We have a look ahead at the Yankees’ season (they won today, pictured above), where the larger-than-life outfielder Aaron Judge has a murky financial future. Our baseball columnist also looks at how the Los Angeles Dodgers are shaping up and has an American league preview, too.

That’s right, every year, men schedule their procedures in conjunction with the men’s basketball tournament so they can recuperate watching the games._____10. Finally, a look at the most diverse generation in American history.More than 68 million Americans belong to Generation Z, the demographic of those born between the mid-1990s and a few years ago. We asked them to describe their identities and what sets them apart.Thousands replied, using the language of their times — cisgender, queer, bi or just their preferred pronouns — terms in wide circulation to signal the pride, fluidity or suspicion of categories of sexual orientation, race and ethnicity.“I feel that I’m not fully a part of one culture,” said one. “I’m just dipping my uninvited toes into separate pools rather than immersing myself into one.”See for yourself what they had to say.And we wish you the kind of night of your choosing._____Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing.

Want this newsletter in your inbox? Sign up here.Hi, I’m Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here’s a look at the week’s tech news:Web regulators are getting into their groove. But are they going too quickly?This past week, the British government proposed new powers to issue fines and make individual executives legally liable for harmful content on their platforms. My colleague Adam Satariano said it “would be one of the world’s most aggressive actions to rein in the most corrosive online content.”Days earlier, Australia passed legislation that threatens fines for social media companies that fail to rapidly remove violent material. And there’s a growing pipeline of other internet regulation, along with existing laws like the European Union’s sweeping General Data Protection Regulation.“We’re entering a new phase of hyper regulation,” said Paul Fehlinger, the deputy executive director of the Internet and Jurisdiction Policy Network, an organization established to understand how national laws affect the internet.This flurry of content rules is understandable. Much of the material they would police is abhorrent, and social media’s rapid rise has caught lawmakers off guard; now the public wants something done.But the regulations could have unintended consequences.Difficulties in defining “harmful” mean governments will develop different standards. In turn, the web could easily look different depending on your location — a big shift from its founding principles. (This is already happening: The Chicago Tribune’s website, for example, doesn’t comply with General Data Protection Regulation, so there’s no access to it from Europe.)There may be less visible effects. If regulation required differences at a hardware level, that could fragment the infrastructure, said Konstantinos Komaitis, a senior director at the nonprofit Internet Society, which promotes the open development and use of the internet. That could make the internet less resilient to outages and attacks.And bigger, richer companies will find it easier to comply with sprawling regulation, which could reinforce the power of Big Tech.“There is a major risk that we end up in a situation where short-term political pressure trumps long-term vision,” Mr. Fehlinger said.Mr. Komaitis said avoiding unintended consequences was “very simple, yet very difficult.”“It is all about collaboration,” he added. The idea: lawmakers work together across borders to ensure rules are more consistent.The challenge is that collaboration could slow the pace of regulation that lawmakers desire. But Mr. Komaitis said many proposed regulations lack clear plans for implementation, and envisions snags when governments come to apply them. If they struggle, he said, collaboration and sharing of expertise may be the only way to make their plans work.[How is technology blurring the lines between public and private? Sign up to Charlie Warzel’s new limited-run newsletter to find out more — and what you can do stop it.]Artificial intelligence could make our lives easier and more efficient. But, like any powerful technology, it’s more complicated than that. A.I. can be used for surveillance. To control autonomous weapons. It can be biased. It could erode jobs. The list goes on.None of those are reasons to reject A.I. outright. But they underscore how its development must be approached with care.Big Tech has struggled to publicly demonstrate that care. Amazon, Google and Microsoft have all drawn criticism for their A.I. work with military and government agencies. Just this month, Google’s plan to create an A.I. ethics board ended disastrously when backlash about board members led to its dissolution.Missteps should be called out, especially when they’re made by such powerful corporations. But in an emergent field, mistakes also serve as lessons. And a new set of A.I. ethics guidelines from the European Commission is a good example of how trial and error will be a fundamental part of ethical A.I. development.The guidelines, developed by 52 experts, contain seven requirements that A.I. systems should meet to be deemed trustworthy. What stands out about them for Charlotte Stix, a policy officer at the Leverhulme Center for the Future of Intelligence at Cambridge University, is that they’re designed to be carried out.Unlike other A.I. ethics guidelines, they attempt to join ethical principles to firm recommendations — something that has divided opinions among some people working in the field. That’s why the European Commission hopes companies will adopt and test them between now and 2020, so that they can be improved.Frank Buytendijk, a vice president in Gartner’s data and analytics group, said the guidelines sent a message to big tech companies that may have struggled with A.I. ethics in the past: “Here’s your chance to do the right thing.”Amazon joined the ranks of tech companies wanting to blanket the world with the internet.Its Project Kuiper plan, which came to light in filings made by the Federal Communications Commission, would put 3,236 satellites into low Earth orbit to deliver the internet to “underserved communities around the world.” It has been likened to a network under development by SpaceX. Facebook has plans for a similar system, and Google has teamed up with the satellite operator Telesat along the same lines.These initiatives seek to provide affordable internet connections to people who currently lack them — from Alaska to sub-Saharan Africa. Satellites appear to be a front-runner: Christopher Mims of The Wall Street Journal noted that, according to the satellite industry veteran Shayn Hawthorne, “some kind of affordable satellite internet now appears inevitable.”For big tech companies, this is not selfless. A good example of why is the Free Basics program offered by Facebook’s nonprofit Internet.org: a zero-cost data service that provides access in some developing countries to a curated group of websites, including Facebook. In locations that are essentially untapped markets, its provision of the web can help it secure new users.Other Big Tech players are unlikely to want to miss out.■ Does privacy matter?

So in 2016, he was happy to help a young filmmaker who wanted to learn more about Albanian gangsters.The two met on many occasions in Albanian bars and social clubs, where Mr. Rezaj and others talked about old times. Through these conversations, the filmmaker, Matthew A. Brown, started to develop a fictional story about an Albanian gangster. Then one day, Mr. Brown asked Mr. Rezaj a big question: Would he play the main character?Now the film is complete and has been making the festival rounds, even while its backers are still looking for a distributor. Its improbable star, who has had no acting training and has spent most of his adult life avoiding both the spotlight and daylight in general, has found himself schmoozing with industry people at film gatherings and posing for selfies with fellow countrymen who have heard about the movie.“To me, this comes natural, what they wanted me to do,” Mr. Rezaj said last week over afternoon cognacs and cigarettes at a bar, Luke’s Lounge, in the Morris Park section of the Bronx. “I grew up, you could say, in a gangster’s paradise.”His Albanian fans aren’t the only ones watching. At the Method Fest Independent Film Festival in Beverly Hills, Calif. last month, the John Garfield Award for Best Actor was split between two winners. One was Ethan Hawke, who starred in the film “Stockholm.” The other, who on that night listened in disbelief while his name was being read (and pronounced correctly for a change, “REZ-AYE”), was Mr. Rezaj.Funny thing is, he’s not acting. “Matt told me, ‘Act how you would normally act,’” Mr. Rezaj recalled the director telling him. “I just get into the zone, whatever.”Mr. Rezaj was 6 when his family ended up in the Bronx after escaping Albania by slipping through the mountains, a journey he has difficulty describing without becoming emotional, so he usually doesn’t. “We were thrown in the trenches,” he said of early days in 1970s New York. “You just don’t come to America and move to a nice neighborhood.”He was a street kid. “What 15-year-old do you know who has to come out of his house with a gun?” he asked. “You had to become someone else to survive. I had to be what the streets demanded.”He got into trouble when he was 20. “It was a traffic dispute with a postal worker,” he said. “The guy assaulted me. I saw him a few months later, and I returned the favor.” With a baseball bat.He stood trial in federal court in 1992 and was convicted of felony assault on a federal employee. He served more than four years in prison. “Gladiator days for me,” he said.“I came out, and I took over the world,” he said. He opened a cafe, then a couple bars, he said. By then, Morris Park had become a base of operations for an Albanian crime ring run by Alex Rudaj, called the Corporation, that sought to take on the Mafia’s five families. Mr. Rudaj and others were later charged and convicted of racketeering, illegal gambling and extortion. “They didn’t want to make money the old-fashioned way,” a prosecutor said in 2005 during closing arguments at the trial. “They wanted to make it through violence, fear and intimidation.”Mr. Rezaj, who was not charged in that federal case, declined to comment about whether he had a role in organized crime. When discussing that topic, he spoke in generalities, often smirking and shrugging. “Eventually, you’ve got to get out of that life,” he said in Luke’s Lounge. “Out here, my guard is never down. I’m a well-known person in this town. There are people out here who don’t like me. A lot of things from the past, they just don’t disappear.” His right forearm is scarred from where a bullet passed through 11 years ago.Today, he lives in Westchester County with his mother. He drives for Uber. He was introduced to Mr. Brown when the filmmaker, who had become intrigued with Albanian gangsters after reading about the Rudaj mob case, arrived in the neighborhood and started asking questions.“If I’m going to do something good and real, I’ve got to talk to these guys,” said Mr. Brown, 46, who was born in South Africa.The two men hit it off, and Mr. Rezaj’s friends would gather with them, setting aside a habitual mistrust of outsiders. “Every time I’d go out with John, I’d hear a story that could be its own film,” Mr. Brown said.Mr. Brown wrote a long script for an epic revenge film set in Kosovo and New York, then set it aside. He wrote a 12-page outline of a much more local story and showed it to Mr. Rezaj. There would be no script.“He said, ‘You’re the story. You’re the script, all these stories you’ve been telling,’” Mr. Rezaj recalled.Mr. Brown, with Mr. Rezaj’s help, assembled a small, mostly nonprofessional cast from the Bronx. Mr. Brown’s wife, the actress Ashley C. Williams, whose credits include the stomach-churning horror film “The Human Centipede (First Sequence),” plays a person of levelheaded tranquillity in a world of violent men.The film, which was shot over 12 days in the Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn, tells the story of Leon (Mr. Rezaj), a former player in organized crime who becomes obsessed with killing the informant who sent him to prison as a young man after he runs into the man in a bar.In the course of the film’s lean 81-minute running time, Leon becomes unhinged in a swirl of cognac and cocaine, murderously stalking through barrooms and back streets with a pistol tucked under his tank top. Mr. Rezaj’s ability to explode with rage at the slightest provocation while in character is unnerving — and, he said, not an acting stretch.“I can do that anytime,” he said. “The only thing I found hard about this job was the freaking hours.” He hated all the repeat takes. “Everybody would get it right, one guy would get it wrong,” he said. Then, another guy would mess up. “‘Let’s do it again. Let’s do it again.’ It was the worst thing to hear,” he added. In one scene, Leon beats a man beyond recognition with a bat in a garage over an overdue debt. In reality, Mr. Rezaj was hitting a tire on the floor. He was sore for days.“He’s truly like an animal,” Mr. Brown said. “He’s completely in the moment. He can’t talk about it, he can’t, because he doesn’t know what he’s doing.”A rare disagreement between the director and the lead occurred after the end of filming. Mr. Rezaj did not like the title that Mr. Brown had given the movie. “I was disgusted,” Mr. Rezaj said. “I’m getting judged by that title.”Mr. Brown pushed back. “Albanians tend not to like it as much,” he said. “Everybody else loves it.”The film is called “Albanian Gangster.”Michael Wilson has been a reporter and columnist at The Times since 2002, writing stories for the New York, National, International and Arts pages.  @MWilsonNYT AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayBy Jill CowanGood morning.(Want to get California Today by email? Here’s the sign-up.)A formerly homeless veteran ekes out just enough to live by picking through the trash of billionaires like Mark Zuckerberg on the streets of San Francisco and selling the designer jeans and high-end housewares he finds.U.S.C. students jet to Bali for spring break, while some of their classmates work overnight shifts to pay for books.Recently, my colleagues Thomas Fuller and Jennifer Medina wrote articles about the symptoms of California’s vast and growing economic inequality.That’s a major, vexing topic in the state, though hardly unexplored.Still, they seemed to strike a particular chord with readers — hundreds of whom emailed, tweeted and commented on each.Many applauded Jake Orta, the Air Force veteran and Texas native whom Thomas followed around the rain-slicked streets of the Mission this winter.“Hats off to Mr. Orta,” one commenter, hotGumption, wrote. “He’s entrepreneurial, a survivor and — as I see it — a distant cousin to the trend called ‘shabby chic’ where canny designers take what used to be yard sale junk and make millions by renaming it.”Others were outraged by his story, not because they saw his actions as wrong, but because of what his lifestyle signified.“The profile speaks to the utter absence of care America provides its veterans,” Mike Frank wrote. “Wake up call to Mr. Zuckerberg: look out your front window, use your vast wealth and make Facebook a morally conscious leader with a commitment to the veterans who have served us and will continue to do so.”And some thought the story focused too much on the extremes.“Characterizing our country as a Dickensian Tale of Two Cities is a lot more fun than realizing it’s instead a Tale of Three Cities, with the overwhelming majority doing just fine,” wrote another commenter, bigoil.[Read the full story here.]More readers shared their experiences of being somewhere in the middle of the income spectrum at elite universities — and how the exposure to different ways of life was itself an education.“At Stanford, my freshman roommate got $100 for each A she earned. I had to earn spending money by serving food in the dining halls,” wrote Alice, whose son is now a freshman at U.S.C. “I realized being rich did not necessarily mean one was a snob. She realized she had grown up in a bubble. I encourage my son to embrace both the haves and the have-nots at S.C.”Others said that the piece depicted experiences similar to their own.“I got a great education at U.S.C. and was not resentful, but the idea of any sort of ‘even playing field’ at the school is simply untrue, and the gap in money and social stature was nearly impossible to close,” wrote Christine, who said she was the first person in her working-class family to attend college.Still others said inequality is what you make of it.“Wealthy people and celebrities send their kids here, they always have, but this narrative only works to devalue the education that many middle and lower middle class students care deeply about,” wrote Virginia, who said she’s a current U.S.C. undergrad. “I don’t care about the Corvette, as long as it doesn’t hit me when I’m jaywalking to class.”[Read the full story here.](We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

Then, on Sunday, she held a rally in her hometown, Oakland; today, she’s headed to Iowa for a town hall.“We are at an inflection point in the history of our world,” she said at the Sunday rally, the official start to her campaign. “We are at an inflection point in the history of our nation. We are here because the American dream and our American democracy are under attack and on the line like never before. And we are here at this moment in time because we must answer a fundamental question: Who are we? Who are we as Americans?”My colleague Astead Herndon has been following and writing about Ms. Harris and her presidential bid. He was in Columbia, S.C., with her on Friday. So I asked him to share some of his impressions and analysis. Here’s what he had to tell us:Astead: South Carolina, which votes fourth in the Democratic primary and is particularly important because of its high percentage of black voters, has played host to several likely presidential hopefuls in recent days, including Ms. Harris’s Senate colleagues Cory Booker of New Jersey and Bernie Sanders of Vermont.The difference for Ms. Harris? She has been able to lean on her enormous network as a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc., the country’s oldest black sorority. On Friday, she was the noted guest at the group’s annual Pink Ice Gala, which afforded her an audience of thousands of black South Carolinians at the ticketed event.“I’m so honored to celebrate with my sorors,” she said. “We stand on the shoulders of women who were leaders, who 111 years ago said to us that we must honor sisterhood and service.”The room was a preview of the electorate that could help slingshot her to victory. Older black residents, all dressed in black tie for the event, rushed the stage to get a photo with the presidential candidate, or to stream her speech on their social media channels. Ms. Harris did not mention her presidential candidacy in the short remarks, but the crowd knew this was the beginning of a long-term courtship.In a short gathering with reporters after, Ms. Harris said it was important to her to attend the event, to highlight the importance of black voters — and particularly black female voters — but also to share how much the sorority means to her.“My mother used to say, ‘You may be the first to do a lot of things, but make sure you’re not the last,’” Ms. Harris said. “It’s about bringing people with you.”(A note: We often link to content on sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

But an invitation to the combine never came. A few teams had him work out, but the message was clear that he would not be among the N.B.A.’s precious 60 draft picks.Six feet 8 inches and solid, but used to playing near the rim, Travis said he was told he needed to add another dimension to his game — “be more versatile, become a better passer, decrease turnovers, become more athletic.” Given that, he suddenly had to decide whether to stay at Stanford as a graduate student or to pursue a graduate degree in basketball somewhere else.[Follow our live coverage of the N.C.A.A. tournament here.]And thus was created a different kind of one-and-done at college basketball’s top finishing school: John Calipari’s Kentucky, the famed lair of uber-talented high-schoolers who play one N.B.A.-mandated season of games before entering the draft.“Granted I’m four, five years older than these guys,” Travis said last month, sitting in a lounge outside the locker room of Kentucky’s practice facility. “But I am here for a year, similar to them.”Travis’s decision was striking because, for more than a decade, Calipari has been the most popular host of raw freshmen rather than seasoned seniors. His modus operandi at Kentucky has been to accept, without apology, the best 17- and 18-year-olds in July, coach them up and send them off to the N.B.A. the following June. Since Calipari arrived in Lexington in 2009, Kentucky has averaged three first-round picks a year, most of them freshmen. The team has also reached four Final Fours and captured a national title.Enter Travis, a two-time All-Pac-12 first-teamer who turned 23 in November. He was injured most of one season at Stanford, and a medical redshirt left him with one more year of eligibility. But before leaving Stanford, he walked at graduation with his class; he majored in Science, Technology and Society, a course of study that attracts many of the tech-minded who arrive in Palo Alto with dreams of staying in Silicon Valley after college.That is why moving to Kentucky also made perfect sense. A highly recruited prospect from Minneapolis five years ago, Travis had one year left and he sought out a school that could help him get to where he wanted to be as a basketball player.“You’re playing 30-something games a season, but you’re in practice almost 200 days,” said Travis, analyzing the problem like an engineer.“So where can I go where I’m playing against a pro every day in practice?” he added. “I felt like this was the best platform, where everyone can potentially be a pro at their position, and that’s who you’re training with at night, that’s who you’re practicing with, that’s who you’re hanging out with, eating with. Everyone has the same mind-set of trying to be a professional.”The jury is still out on whether he has sufficiently improved his draft stock. Two N.B.A. front-office executives, who declined to be named because N.B.A. rules ban public discussion of prospects, delivered mixed reviews. One predicted Travis will not be drafted, and the other argued that thanks to Travis’s time at Kentucky, he had played his way into the low- or mid-second round.Calipari has had Travis confined mostly to the paint. But James Clark, a private coach who worked with Travis last summer, said that Travis had improved his shooting to the point where he could play as a “stretch four” — the valuable kind of power forward who can create more space for his offense by serving as a threat to score away from the rim.“I also think people are seeing how strong he is,” Clark added. “He’s smart with the basketball — he doesn’t have a lot of turnovers.”At Kentucky (27-6), which faces Abilene Christian in the first round of the N.C.A.A. men’s tournament on Thursday in Jacksonville, Fla., Travis emerged as a starter and key force near the basket. Because he is playing fewer minutes on the star-stocked Wildcats, most of his per-game statistics are down from the previous two seasons (although his block total has skyrocketed), but his impact has nonetheless been powerful.Calipari credited Travis with wrestling Grant Williams, the resident bruiser on rival Tennessee, to a draw in Kentucky’s victory over its fellow No. 2 seed last month. As if to prove Calipari’s point, Tennessee won the next meeting between the teams, when Travis was out with a sprained knee. Tennessee also won the rubber match — by 4 points — in the Southeastern Conference tournament, with Travis back on the court but probably not at full strength.For Calipari, the education of Travis is a task at once unusual and familiar.“Here’s a kid that works like this, that needs a little extra stuff to be able to go reach his dreams, and it appealed to me,” Calipari said during an interview in his office.At one point, Calipari referred to Travis as “a good kid,” and then scolded himself for calling Travis a “kid.”The two bonded last fall during the contentious hearings over Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination.“We talked about the Supreme Court stuff that was going on,” said Calipari, a politics junkie. “Haven’t been able to do that in the last eight or nine years.”One night at a team dinner, Calipari told Travis he thought Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who played a prominent role in the hearings, might make a compelling Democratic presidential candidate. Travis agreed: his family and Klobuchar’s are family friends; he went to high school with the senator’s daughter, Abigail Bessler. (Klobuchar entered the presidential race in February.)Travis will spend the next few years trying hard to earn an N.B.A. spot.Calipari is optimistic, because Travis can shoot, create off the dribble and score. “He’s going to be one of those guys in that league who you want in your locker room, you want on your team, that has the toughness to guard anybody,” Calipari said.The process might take time, a lucky break, more improvement, or a combination of all three. Periods of frustration seem likely.It is also easy to see Travis eventually ending up in business school. He aspires to athletic administration; at Stanford, he took the time to get to know the athletic director, Bernard Muir.That is something to think about later. There is a more immediate task for the fifth-year senior who, as of Thursday morning, had won a National Invitation Tournament championship but had yet to play in an N.C.A.A. tournament game.“I’ve been happy with what I came for,” Travis said recently, “and what I really came for is March.”Marc Stein contributed reporting.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Jamie TarabaySYDNEY, Australia — At a dried-up waterhole in Australia’s far north, wild horses were found dead or dying.

In the southeast, where most people live, aging coal-powered plants struggled to cope with demand on Friday, with more than 160,000 households temporarily losing power.In Melbourne, tram routes were cut back to save power, public swimming pools were overwhelmed and people who could get to air conditioning did so.“I think this is the hottest day I’ve ever experienced in my life,” Ikumi Cooray, 25, said Friday, waiting for a tram in Melbourne as a popsicle melted in her hand.It wasn’t — at least, not if Ms. Cooray was in Melbourne in 2009, when the city hit its current record of 46.2 degrees Celsius. Friday’s temperatures reached a mere 42.4 degrees, but that was bad enough. The day before, the heat had been so intense that Petra Kvitova’s semifinal against Danielle Collins at the Australian Open was halted so the roof of Rod Laver Arena could be closed.Adelaide, to the northwest, did break a record on Thursday — an 80-year-old one — reaching 46.2 degrees Celsius, or 114 Fahrenheit.Mr. Firth, the pub manager, said everyone at the Red Lion behaved, though he expressed concern about whether he could keep giving away beer going through the heat wave. “We might be breaking liquor laws if we give out that much free beer, but we can’t control the temperature,” he said.In Melbourne, few people were venturing outside on Friday, and business at cafes and restaurants was slow.“We have been dead today,” said Nicole Smith, who works at a cafe in the suburb of Collingwood. “Everyone’s obviously been ordering Uber Eats and doesn’t want to leave the office.”The power in the cafe had repeatedly gone out on Thursday, she said. “All our fridges kept turning off.”“I just feel sick,” said her co-worker Anwesha Sinha, who had brought an umbrella to shield herself from the sun on her walk home. Ms. Sinha, an immigrant from India, said she was used to humid heat but found the dry heat hard to cope with.

No deaths or injuries have been reported, but there have been evacuations, and temperatures have continued to climb.“People have not been sleeping, they’ve been snapping at each other,” said David Killick, a hobby farmer in Judbury, a town about 35 miles south of the city of Hobart. On Friday, he and his wife moved their dog and three horses off their stretch of farmland.“Every Tasmanian is urged to have a fire plan, and we live in a relatively remote bush setting, so you have two choices: you either stay and fight the fire or you leave early,” said Mr. Killick, who also writes for the Hobart Mercury newspaper.“There wasn’t an active fire near us, but when you live on a hilltop at the end of a dead-end street, you don’t want to be there when a fire starts,” he said. “We took some clothes, our photo albums and that’s about it. Shut the gate behind us and hope for the best.”Tasmania is usually a more temperate place. Mr. Killick said visitors from Queensland, home to Australia’s Gold Coast, would typically come in the summertime to escape the heat.In Australia’s Northern Territory, Aboriginal rangers had to cull more than 50 wild horses after finding dozens dead or dying near a water hole that had dried up. More culls were being considered as the heat wave showed no sign of slowing, said Elke Wiesmann of the Central Land Council.There have been other dramatic illustrations of the heat’s extremity. This month, fruit growers in South Australia reported that the pits in peaches and nectarines had gotten so hot that they burned the fruit from the inside. In November, an extreme heat wave killed more than 23,000 flying foxes, a type of bat, almost a third of the species in Australia.Many parts of the country have banned all fires just ahead of the Australia Day holiday weekend, during which most people celebrate outdoors.Almost all of Australia’s 10 warmest years on record have occurred since 2005, according to the government’s Bureau of Meteorology. The bureau says rainfall has been decreasing in the south and that there have been longer and more frequent marine heat waves.“There has been a long-term increase in extreme fire weather, and in the length of the fire season, across large parts of Australia,” the bureau said in a recent report.Australia’s heat waves, now an annual ordeal, have been expanding into areas that hadn’t normally experienced them before, said David Rissik, deputy director of the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility.“The fact that we had bushfires in places that traditionally don’t burn, like rain forests, I think was really an eye-opener,” Dr. Rissik said. “I would say that people are still digesting what that means to them.”If you’re in Australia, are you noticing life there changing to adapt to extreme heat?

I’m Jamie Condliffe. Greetings from London. Here’s a look at the week’s tech news.There is little as fashionable in 2019 as the desire to curb Big Tech’s power. But knowing how far regulators should go in putting limits on Silicon Valley’s largest companies isn’t straightforward.At one extreme, there are calls to break up Big Tech.  Senator Elizabeth Warren grabbed headlines during the week when she called for just that. Ms. Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, argued that companies shouldn’t offer their own products on platforms they controlled (like Apple’s selling apps on its App Store — something Spotify called out to European regulators on Wednesday). She also said she would roll back anticompetitive acquisitions, such as Facebook’s takeovers of Instagram and WhatsApp.Her pitch isn’t perfect, as The New York Times’s Kevin Roose pointed out — it’s too generic, misses easy wins and overlooks some big issues. But it is a bold, inspiring rally cry for Big Tech’s biggest critics.At the other end of the spectrum: tech companies. Ideally, the likes of Facebook and Google would love to perpetually operate in the lightly regulated world that helped them grow so quickly. But even Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s chief executive, acknowledged that it was “inevitable that there will be some regulation” when he testified to the House Energy and Commerce Committee in April.There’s plenty of room between those extremes. Take, for example, a report published Wednesday by the British government, which called for an overhaul of antitrust policies for Big Tech. Its main proposal: that a new regulator identify companies with “strategic market status,” then block some activities — such as promoting their own products or services in search results over those belonging to competitors (hello, Google!).That, the report’s authors say, is a “more pro-business and pro-consumer solution” than “changing antitrust law to drive breakup” of businesses.So who’s right? Mr. Zuckerberg, at least when he says regulatory intervention is inevitable. There’s strong bipartisan support for such regulation. As for where a line should be drawn, that’s harder to say.Breaking up big companies isn’t easy: It’s expensive and takes a long time. And it doesn’t always go to plan. The last notable attempt to do so, when a judge ruled two decades ago that Microsoft be cleaved for having violated antitrust law, was overturned on appeal. So Ms. Warren could have her work cut out for her.But it may ultimately become a question of balancing ambition with need. Is it better to gamble on breaking up big companies, or guarantee that new rules curb some of their behavior? That’s something that lawmakers are going to have to wrestle with.When OpenAI was founded three years ago, it had a huge goal: to build artificial intelligence software that was as capable as the human brain. Its founders said that because it was a nonprofit with noble ambitions — it had $1 billion in funding from backers to pay its way — the public could trust it to build that so-called general artificial intelligence.Only, $1 billion doesn’t go far with goals like that. Huge computing resources and big salaries to attract talent burn through cash. Actually, it turns out, some profits might be useful.So, Wired reported, Open AI announced that it was changing its business model. To keep up with Facebook and Google, it created a OpenAI L.P., a company that can take money from investors that need to return a profit, like venture funds. That will make it easier to raise funds. Down the line, it might monetize some of the technology it develops. But the company decided to cap the returns that investors will see — to $100 for every dollar invested.One way to think of that figure is that OpenAI deems a 100-times return to be an ethical margin on building a general A.I. — enough to make it a feasible endeavor, but not so much as to tar it with the Big Tech brush. That reasoning clearly holds if you inhabit Silicon Valley. But it will be interesting to see if that profit cap is enough to put everyone at ease.On March 12, 1989, Tim Berners-Lee proposed an idea for linking digital files that his boss, Mike Sendall, called “vague but exciting.” It ultimately became the World Wide Web, and 30 years later we’re left with much to love — and hate — about its existence.At an event at London’s Science Museum on Tuesday to mark the web’s passage into its fourth decade, Mr. Berners-Lee was asked what it might look like in another 30 years. Here’s what he said:■ “It’s not, I think, for us to try and guess.”■ “Look at what’s happened over the last 30 years. The web has changed really dramatically, and a lot of that we couldn’t have predicted.”■ “What we can do is we can say what web we want.”■ “We want a web which is open. We want a web which is royalty-free. We want a web which is discrimination-free.”Worthy goals. And in an article he wrote this past week, Mr. Berners-Lee laid out steps that may be required to ensure they happen:■ “Governments must translate laws and regulations for the digital age. They must ensure markets remain competitive, innovative and open.”■ “Companies must do more to ensure their pursuit of short-term profit is not at the expense of human rights, democracy, scientific fact or public safety.”■ “Platforms and products must be designed with privacy, diversity and security in mind. “■ “And most important of all, citizens must hold companies and governments accountable.”Thirty years on, Mr. Sendall’s analysis might apply equally well to this proposal, too.Elon Musk really dislikes whistle-blowers. According to Businessweek, Mr. Musk, the Tesla chief executive, set out to destroy one employee who leaked details about raw materials wastage at the company.How does Google pay off executives accused of misconduct? Handsomely: Two shared a total of $135 million, according to details that emerged from a lawsuit during the week.Who will fund the next wave of tech start-ups?

McGlashan Jr. was sitting on Richard Branson’s private island several years ago when the idea first struck him: He would create a new venture capital fund focused on ethical investing.He had been inspired during a conference on the island also attended by Laurene Powell Jobs, the widow of the Apple founder Steve Jobs, and Jeff Skoll, the first president of eBay. Soon after, he would recruit them and the U2 singer Bono to the Rise Fund on the promise of doing good.Yet on Tuesday, Mr. McGlashan was one of 50 people caught up in a federal investigation into college admissions fraud, a scandal that has ensnared prominent parents who stand accused of paying bribes to give their children an edge.While two Hollywood actresses were the most recognizable figures to face charges, they were outnumbered by business titans who are not household names.Mr. McGlashan is widely seen as one of Silicon Valley’s most powerful investors, a partner at the $103 billion investment firm TPG. The fund he oversaw there invested in prominent brands including Airbnb, Spotify and Uber. He has been placed on leave from TPG and Rise.Also charged were Gordon Caplan, a top mergers and acquisitions attorney who was a co-chairman of the law firm Willkie Farr, and Doug Hodge, the retired chief executive of Pimco, one of the world’s biggest bond fund managers. Mr. Caplan was placed on leave on Wednesday, and Mr. Hodge’s name was stripped from the website of Sway Ventures, an investment firm where he was a venture partner.Mr. Hodge is also listed as a board member for two wealthy private schools in California: Sage Hill School and the Thacher School. Blossom Beatty Pidduck, Thacher’s head of school, said on Wednesday that Mr. Hodge had been on the board since 2011 and that the board was discussing whether to let him continue serving. Messages left with Sage Hill were not returned Wednesday.The actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin were the boldface names in the charges announced on Tuesday by federal prosecutors in Boston, but such celebrities may still be able to find work after their cases are resolved. That won’t necessarily be the case for the high-powered lawyers and money managers on the list.“Professionals, their stock in trade has to be their integrity,” said Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor and a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. “Celebrities have a different stock in trade.”Mr. Caplan, who worked on complex deals for Hudson’s Bay including the sale of Lord & Taylor’s former flagship store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, would lose his law license in New York if convicted of a felony. Mr. McGlashan, whose reputation drew star power to a fund with the idea of positive social change, may have a hard time raising money if he has a felony conviction on his record. And Mr. Hodge, who told Harvard Business Review last year that he was surprised “how quickly opportunity came my way” after his retirement, could see those chances to do something new dry up.After the charges were announced, the firms quickly sought to distance themselves from the accused. TPG’s announcement noted that the charges against Mr. McGlashan were for “personal misconduct,” and Willkie Farr pointed out that the case against Mr. Caplan was “a personal matter and does not involve Willkie or any of its clients.” Willkie also removed Mr. Caplan’s biography from the firm’s website.A lawyer for Mr. Caplan and a spokesman for Mr. McGlashan declined to comment on Wednesday. Mr. Hodge could not be reached for comment.Neither TPG nor Willkie is likely to be undone by the charges against a leadership figure, but both firms may face uncomfortable questions from clients and investors. TPG, for example, has long cultivated an image as a progressive and trustworthy institution. It moved quickly to install Jim Coulter, its chief executive and a co-founder, as acting chief of the Rise Fund.Mr. McGlashan is listed as one of several “key men” in agreements with investors who committed money to TPG, but his suspension — or potential permanent exit — would not unwind those agreements unless several more of TPG’s top managers departed, according to a person familiar with the firm’s operations, who was not authorized to speak publicly. Investors in the fund have committed money for several years, and the case is unlikely to have a direct financial impact on the fund.On Wednesday, Mr. McGlashan stepped down from the board of STX Entertainment, the film studio that he helped found with the producer Robert Simonds. The news was shared in an internal memo sent to STX employees and reviewed by The New York Times. STX is funded in large part by TPG, which said in the memo that it remained committed to the studio, whose movies include the teen comedy “The Edge of Seventeen.”Rebecca Roiphe, a former prosecutor and a professor at New York Law School who specializes in legal ethics, said she expected few clients would leave Willkie Farr because of the charges against Mr. Caplan, who in April was named a “deal maker of the year” by The American Lawyer, a trade magazine. But she said the case could give potential clients a reason to ask questions about the firm’s culture and its process for selecting lawyers to manage the firm.“They made the choice to have this person represent the firm,” Ms. Roiphe said.Charging documents filed by federal prosecutors describe how parents were willing to pay William Singer, the founder of the Edge College & Career Network, a college preparatory business, up to $75,000 to arrange for cheating on standardized tests or hundreds of thousands of dollars to bribe college coaches to recruit a student. Mr. Singer, who has pleaded guilty to charges including racketeering conspiracy and obstruction of justice, cooperated with the investigation.According to prosecutors, Mr. Singer advised Mr. McGlashan to claim that his son had learning disabilities, which would allow the student more time to complete an entrance exam, and Mr. McGlashan gave $50,000 to Mr. Singer’s charity. The men also discussed creating a fake football recruiting profile for his son.Mr. Hodge paid more than half a million dollars to get two of his children into the University of Southern California, according to prosecutors, who also said his discussions with Mr. Singer had been captured on secret recordings.Mr. Caplan was also caught on tape, the authorities said. In discussing the scheme to improve his daughter’s college entrance exam score in return for $75,000, prosecutors said, Mr. Caplan asked Mr. Singer a number of times if anyone has gotten “caught” or “ever gotten into an issue with this.”At one point, prosecutors said, he told Mr. Singer: “Keep in mind I am a lawyer. So I am sort of rule-oriented.”An earlier version of this article misstated the amount of assets that the investment firm TPG has under management. It is $103 billion, not $70 billion.Katie Benner and Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Adam Satariano and Jack NicasLONDON — Apple’s powerful role as gatekeeper of the App Store has long frustrated the makers of apps who must abide by its rules or risk losing access to hundreds of millions of customers who own Apple devices.Now one of Apple’s biggest rivals, the music streaming service Spotify, says Apple is abusing its position and violating European antitrust laws.In an aggressive attempt to undercut Apple’s power, Spotify said on Wednesday that it had filed a complaint with European regulators, accusing Apple of using its App Store to squash companies that compete with its services, including Apple Music.Spotify’s complaint comes at perilous moment for the world’s biggest tech companies. Scrutiny over Silicon Valley’s power has been increasing in recent years, and has already become a topic among Democratic presidential hopefuls.One of them, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, last week proposed breaking up the tech giants as a remedy to their unfair advantages. One of her ideas was to separate the App Store from Apple.“Spotify’s complaint is just the latest example of what can happen when these enormous companies abuse their power to undermine competition,” Ms. Warren said in a statement Wednesday. “We need a level playing field, and that starts by breaking up giant tech companies who both own a marketplace and operate in that same marketplace.”On Wednesday, a British government report also called for tougher antitrust laws for the industry.Apple’s role as a make-or-break arbiter has long frustrated app makers by imposing rules and charging a fee of up to 30 percent on anything sold through its App Store.Spotify, which has headquarters in Luxembourg and Sweden, said it had told the European Commission, an aggressive regulator of the tech industry, that the policies were not just a costly nuisance but a “tax” that violated competition laws and merited an investigation.The policies have been particularly vexing for companies, like Spotify, that compete with Apple. Spotify and Apple Music are the world’s largest music streaming services.“They continue to give themselves an unfair advantage at every turn,” Daniel Ek, Spotify’s chief executive, said in a message posted on the company’s website. He said Apple was acting as both "player and referee to deliberately disadvantage other app developers.”Apple did not respond to a request for comment. The company has said the fees are reasonable given that it must maintain the App Store and is providing access to millions of potential customers who own Apple devices.Apple’s introduction of the App Store in 2008 revolutionized the mobile-phone industry, creating a new marketplace for consumers to download games, productivity tools and social networking services. There are now more than two million apps available on the App Store.Companies like Spotify have thrived on Apple’s platform, which typically generates more money for app developers than Google’s Play Store.Spotify’s overall sales last year rose 29 percent to 5.3 billion euros, or about $6 billion, but the company is not profitable and is under pressure from investors to improve its margins. The company paid about 74 percent of its revenue to cover music rights and related costs.Spotify has been a formidable competitor to Apple in attracting customers for music streaming. Spotify said that it ended 2018 with 207 million active users around the world, including 96 million who were signed up for a paid subscription that did not include ads. In January, Apple said that its Apple Music service had 50 million paying users.Apple’s control over the App Store has been an increasing source of tension as the company has focused more on online services that compete with many of the apps sold on its platform. As iPhone sales have leveled off, Apple has relied more on sales of software and services. The largest driver of that sort of revenue is the App Store.Spotify said Apple was continually changing its policies to harm competitors.“Apps should be able to compete fairly on the merits, and not based on who owns the App Store,” Mr. Ek said. “We should all be subject to the same fair set of rules and restrictions — including Apple Music.”A search for “music” on the App Store on Wednesday showed how Apple can give itself an advantage. The top result was an ad for Apple Music, followed by eight more results for Apple apps. Spotify was listed 11th.Companies are finding ways to reduce the fees they pay to Apple. In 2016, Spotify started sending customers to an outside website to make a payment rather than processing charges within its app. Netflix and Amazon have made similar moves.As a result, Spotify generally does not share revenue with Apple for customers who signed up after 2016, but pays 15 percent for customers who signed up before that period. Apple’s fee decreases to 15 percent from 30 percent after the first year of a subscription.Sensor Tower, an app-data firm, estimated that Apple still took in 23 percent of the roughly $670 million consumers spent on Spotify on the App Store from 2015 through 2018.But Apple punishes companies that do not use its payment system by restricting their ability to communicate with customers and preventing the release of app updates, Spotify claimed. Spotify accused Apple of blocking its app and other Apple competitors from services such as Siri, HomePod and Apple Watch.Spotify said Apple also treated companies differently. Uber, for example, is not required to pay a fee to Apple for charges through its app.Apple demonstrated its power this year when, in response to Facebook’s violating its app rules, it  temporarily shut down Facebook’s internal apps, including those for the company’s cafeteria menu and shuttle schedule.The European Commission has a history of turning a company’s antitrust complaints into larger investigations of tech platforms. Last year, it fined Google a record €4.34 billion, about $5.1 billion at the time, for antitrust abuses related to its Android operating system, and forced Google to effectively loosen its grip over the platform. Google is appealing. European officials are also investigating possible anticompetitive practices by Amazon.European regulators have expressed concerns about Apple’s dominance in music. Last year, the European Commission held up Apple’s acquisition of the song-identification app Shazam over concerns it would harm competition, though the deal was eventually approved. In 2016, the commission accused Apple of a tax avoidance scheme and ordered the company to pay $14.5 billion in back taxes to Ireland, a decision Apple is appealing.It is unclear whether Spotify’s complaint will lead European regulators to start a formal investigation of Apple. The term of Margrethe Vestager, the top antitrust official in the European Commission, ends this year, meaning the decision could fall to her successor.“The commission has received a complaint by Spotify, which we are assessing under our standard procedures,” the commission said in a statement.In the United States, the Supreme Court is considering a suit brought by consumers claiming that Apple’s control over the App Store represents an unfair monopoly, forcing customers to pay higher prices than they would in a more open market.Follow Adam Satariano and Jack Nicas on Twitter: @satariano and @jacknicas.Adam Satariano reported from London, and Jack Nicas from San Francisco.

That atmospheric river was no joke.For the nature-inclined among us, though, there is a bright side to all this weather. And that is the strong likelihood that the state’s desert parks will soon be awash in vibrant, Instagrammable color.That’s right: Another “super bloom” is probably upon us.In 2017, wildflower blooms in Southern California were so massive that they were visible from space. This year, experts say, a combination of fires to clear out competing flora, and rain mean that conditions are shaping up to be optimal for a similar display.I asked Casey Schreiner, founder and editor of the website Modern Hiker about the best ways to enjoy the flowers.The short answer? “Research and flexibility,” he said.In California, Mr. Schreiner said, because there are so many different microclimates, it’s tough to predict (and plan for) peak blooms.“Everyone wants to know: ‘When should I book my campsite? When should I book travel?’” he said. “The reality is that’s not really how this process works.”If you’re truly committed to experiencing the height of a wildflower bloom in any given park or region, you’ll need to be ready to head out quickly.“It may look like something is going to be amazing, and then some dry Santa Ana wind comes in and then there’s a hot weekend with direct sun,” he said.Fortunately, Mr. Schreiner said, plenty of organizations track wildflower blooms and can offer “very educated guesses on when things are going to pop.” (Here’s Modern Hiker’s full list of resources.)Mr. Schreiner said he often relied on the Theodore Payne Foundation’s wildflower hotline — although its season officially kicks off in March, so it hasn’t started putting out weekly reports.Of course, the flip side to all this flexibility is that in places like Anza-Borrego Desert State Park, which has come to be known as the super bloom epicenter, reservable campsites might already be booked up. Lodging in Borrego Springs, too, is most likely to be jammed.The nice thing about Anza-Borrego, Mr. Schreiner said, is that as long as you follow certain guidelines, you can “pretty much camp wherever you want,” within the park.Alternatively, you can always plan to hike a great wildflower trail (like one of these) whenever you’re available to camp and appreciate whatever you see.No matter what, Mr. Schreiner said, be a responsible user of the outdoors. It may be tempting to plunk down right in the middle of a vast blooming field for the perfect shot, but don’t crush the flowers. And stay as close to established paths as you can.(We often link to content on sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

Or, Mr. Schreiner said, you can buy from a handful of nurseries that focus on native flora.

But there were encouraging signs in the data as well.By Patricia CohenThe economy’s remarkably steady job-creation machine sputtered in February and produced a mere 20,000 jobs. It was the smallest gain in well over a year and came on top of other signs that the economy was off to a sluggish start in 2019. For months, the labor market could be counted on for an upbeat counterpoint to negative developments, including a fragile global economy weighed down by trade tensions. In the United States, growth for the first quarter is expected to dance around the 1 percent bar, as the shot of adrenaline delivered by last year’s tax cuts fades. Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust in Chicago, said Friday’s news from the Labor Department was worrisome. “This is a disappointing report,” he said. “I don’t think there’s any way to sugarcoat it.”But the longer-term trend is what matters, and there were competing interpretations of whether the report was a troubling omen or a fluke.Beyond the month’s payroll figure, the report offered some unambiguously good news, including 3.4 percent year-over-year wage growth, the strongest in a decade.  Revisions to previous months’ estimates added 12,000 jobs, bringing the average gains for December, January and February to 186,000. The official jobless rate fell to 3.8 percent, from 4 percent in January. A broader measure of employment that includes part-timers who would prefer full-time work and those too discouraged to search fell to 7.3 percent from 8.1 percent. “That’s a year’s worth of improvement in one month,” said G. Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist at the private bank Brown Brothers Harriman. Aftereffects of the government shutdown and wretched weather may have contributed to anomalies in the report. “This is the strangest jobs report I’ve seen in a long time,” Mr. Clemons said. “It’s bizarre. I can’t help but think there is noise in there.” During the decade-long expansion, the economy has churned out 20 million jobs. The anemic job creation and rising wages could indicate that the pool of available workers was drying up, and employers were having trouble filling openings.“The real challenge is the shortage of people,” said Tom Gimbel, chief executive of LaSalle Network, a staffing firm in Chicago. He said he speaks to roughly two dozen hiring managers and chief executives every week, and everyone is bullish. “I haven’t had anybody in 2019 tell me that they’re not going to be adding head count,” he said. But the combination of the payroll news with the prospect of torpid first-quarter growth and stubborn trade disputes cannot be brushed off, said Mr. Tannenbaum, the Northern Trust economist. “It’s a signal we need to be cautious with the U.S. economic outlook,” he added.  On Wall Street, the S&P 500 was down roughly 0.2 percent on Friday. It was the fifth straight decline for the index, a marked slowdown after the first two months of the year. The labor report could reflect some of the confusion and delays prompted by the 35-day partial government shutdown, which extended through most of January. Furloughed federal workers and affected contractors had to scrounge for part-time work when their paychecks were halted. Those circumstances were reflected in January’s report, which showed that the number of workers who snagged part-time jobs for economic reasons jumped by nearly half a million and those temporarily unemployed rose by roughly 175,000.“They now have paychecks and don’t need to drive Uber to make ends meet,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at the accounting firm Grant Thornton. The shutdown also postponed hiring both within the government and in the private sector, in part because the federal electronic service that verifies the employment eligibility of prospective workers — E-Verify — was not operating. Some of those hires, particularly in the public sector, may be in the pipeline. Government payrolls — federal, state and local — were down by 5,000.Delays in income-tax refunds may also have had an impact, if people held off with discretionary purchases, Ms. Swonk said. The leisure and hospitality showed no growth. Some of the layoffs that big retailers like Gap, JCPenney, Sears, Dollar Tree and Abercrombie & Fitch have announced may be starting to trickle through as well, with a drop of 6,100 in the retail sector.In addition, the construction industry, which is closely linked to weather conditions, shed 31,000 jobs last month.Outside of the government’s report, signs of employer confidence were still evident. “I’ve been in this business over 40 years, and February always presents kind of a pause,” said William H. Stoller, chairman and chief executive of Express Employment Professionals, which is based in Oklahoma City. He compared it to taking a breath during a marathon, before a second wind kicks in. “I don’t see it hitting the wall at all at this point,” he said.Other recruiting and employment professionals also expect the labor market to regain its momentum. Bill Ravenscroft, a senior vice president at the staffing firm Adecco, pointed to a growing willingness to convert temporary workers into full-time staff members. The high rate of conversion, he said, shows there is little concern that layoffs will be needed down the road.With job postings outpacing applicants, Adecco has started to offer daily pay to lure more people into the pool of potential workers. Many job seekers can’t wait two weeks for the paychecks, Mr. Ravenscroft said. Now, “if you log eight hours that day, you get paid for it.”Sanford Health’s weight-loss and lifestyle program, Profile, has been on a hiring binge, said Nate Malloy, Profile’s chief executive. He said he expected 100 new locations, many of them franchises, to open this year. “We’re adding around 50 to 100 employees a month” across locations, he said. Most are health coaches, with starting wages of $15 to $20 an hour. As has been the case throughout the recovery, job opportunities can vary widely by region. Hard-pressed rural areas have experienced the slowest growth in employment, yet residents are often unable or unwilling to abandon their homes and move to other areas. The job growth reflected in the monthly reports is spread relatively evenly across large urban areas, but the Brookings Institution’s Hamilton Project found that “rural counties — the majority of which were already struggling — seem to be increasingly left behind with employment barely growing over the last five years.”Nationwide, though, employers talked about their hiring plans. Ace Hardware, a cooperative of independently owned and operated hardware stores, expects an additional 160 stores will open this year, creating 2,500 jobs, said Kane Calamari, the company’s personnel chief. Of the 681 employers surveyed last month by Vistage, an association of small-business owners and executives, nearly 60 percent said they planned to increase their total staff over the next 12 months. That share is down from last year, said Joe Galvin, Vistage’s chief research officer, but is still strong.And on Twitter, President Trump continued to be an enthusiastic cheerleader for the economy.

By Tammy La GorceWill Novak lives in Arizona. Bill Novak lives in Brooklyn. Will accidentally got Bill’s email invitation to a bachelor party in Vermont. He started a GoFundMe called “Help me go to the bachelor party of a stranger” and the rest is viral history. And now the bachelor party is history too. It was apparently fairly epic — and a welcome distraction for an eager nation. “Dozens of people, maybe even hundreds, have said things along the lines of, ‘Well, the news cycle is so depressing, people are deeply upset by what they see on the news, and this is so stupid and so funny” — a welcome diversion, in other words, said Will Novak, 35.There were some close calls along the way, including the brief theft of a $75,000 Maserati S.U.V. entrusted to Mr. Novak by a rental car company. He was a designated driver all weekend, since he doesn’t drink. On his first night there, out late at a bar with his fellow bachelor partygoers, he met four drunk women from Manhattan. They were trying to get home but couldn’t call an Uber because, as Mr. Novak kept saying, there’s no cell phone service in Vermont. So he offered to drive them. When he went inside the bar to tell the women he had pulled up the car outside and was ready to go, a drunk man jumped in the Maserati and took off. Mr. Novak was “terrified,” he said. Within a few minutes, though, the car thief returned. He just wanted to take such a nice ride for a spin, apparently. “If I’m honest, I was really upset,” Mr. Novak said, “but I tried to be jovial about the whole thing.” Why didn’t he call the police? “There’s no cell service in Vermont. It would be a great state to commit a murder in for that reason.”Though there was also a shoulder injury serious enough to leave Bill Novak (the actual invitee) heading back to Brooklyn with his arm in a sling, things had a way of working out. And, Mr. Novak (the stranger one) was nearly deafened by fireworks his fellow partygoers set off upon his arrival. Angelo Onello, the groom-to-be being celebrated, incidentally will end up $3,000 richer as another result of the email mistake made by his brother, Devin Onello, the bachelor party’s organizer.By the time of Mr. Novak’s flight from Arizona to Vermont, the GoFundMe had raised almost $5,000, much more than he needed to fund the trip. So he is donating the surplus to Mr. Onello, of Midland Park, N.J., and his fiancée, Devon Cianciaruso, who is four months pregnant.“We both work full-time, but we’ve got a lot of expenses with the wedding and renovating our house. So we can use that money for the baby’s college fund, and it was extremely nice of him to do that for us,” said Mr. Onello. They plan to marry Feb. 1 in Wyckoff, N.J.Mr. Novak considers it extremely nice of the Onellos and his fellow Vermont partygoers to have welcomed him warmly, despite a few handicaps when it came to fitting in. As a teetotaler among a group known for its partying, Mr. Novak knew he was out of his depth. Ms. Cianciarusco, who watched footage of her fiancée’s party on social media during a bachelorette party at a spa back in New Jersey, said Mr. Onello’s life could easily have been the inspiration for the movie “The Hangover.” Plus, Mr. Novak had only been skiing once before, as a 14-year-old, and didn’t know how to dress for the occasion. The invitation requested guests to pack outfits with the question, “What would Angelo wear?” in mind. In his acceptance reply, Mr. Novak offered to wear a wrestling singlet picked up from a WWF event in 1989, as he didn’t know Mr. Onello. (In the end, he wore a rainbow-striped ski suit most of the weekend.)He felt, he said, comfortable in the ski suit among his new friends. Though he bonded with most of the other 20 men in a superficial way, through intervals of what he called “jumping around and listening to metal music,” he especially liked getting to know the other William Novak. “I connected with him a lot,” he said. “We have similar political views and we like some of the same bands and the same movies. I definitely think we’ll stay in contact.”The Brooklyn Mr. Novak, who works as a freelance copywriter and in video production, feels likewise. “I was in communication with Will the whole time, and I’ll stay in communication with him a long time. He’s a blast,” he said.The Phoenix Mr. Novak also plans to stay in touch with some of the 10,000 Instagram friends he has made since flying to the bachelor party — especially the moms. Mr. Novak said he had been peeking into analytics and found that many of the viewers following the action on Instagram at last weekend’s Vermont bachelor party were women ages 35 to 50. “There’s a lot of stay-at-home moms who are like, ‘Your story reminds me of my youth! We all wish we could leave our kids behind for and go off for a weekend,’” he said.“I’ve got a cougar following now, and that’s been my goal my whole life,” he said, a day after returning home from Vermont. He was joking. But there is one goal he is serious about.Though the attention has him courting suggestions to host a travel adventure show, or to take his personality to Hollywood in some other capacity, he wants to help his wife, Veronica, mother to their now 10-month-old daughter, Olivia Rose, realize a dream.Mrs. Novak currently works full-time at an event planning company. But “she wants to be a full-time mom and to have another baby, and I will do whatever it takes for her to be one,” he said. “Even if it means I have to till a field or something. I’ll do it.”“I Doozy” is an every-so-often feature highlighting people, places or things related to Weddings. AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Howard MegdalAaron Gordon sat slouched in front of his locker, immobile as ice packs worked on his body following yet another loss earlier this season. His Orlando Magic teammates showered and dressed, and left.Gordon’s back had been bothering him, and no wonder: He’s in his fifth year of carrying the Magic franchise. And he is in for the long haul, too. After doing what he described as “due diligence” this past summer, Gordon signed a four-year, $80 million contract, handing over most of his mid-20s to a team that, so far, has failed to put a winning combination around him.But if the 6-foot-9 multidimensional star is still waiting for a winning supporting cast, his 2018-19 season is the latest, best evidence yet that he is approaching a specific kind of broad-based play that is fast becoming a requirement for surviving in the N.B.A.Gordon showed it off days ago in a 103-96 win over the Golden State Warriors.He did it all, scoring 22 points, pulling down 15 rebounds and using his defensive athleticism to help limit the Warriors to 9-for-40 shooting from 3-point range. By the end of last week, the surging Magic had found themselves in eighth place in the Eastern Conference and in new territory for Gordon: the playoff race.It has taken every skill Gordon has, but for his part, the 23-year-old has embraced the way the competition in the N.B.A. has demanded that he do virtually everything on any given night.“Versatility is going to be a huge part. The league is going in that direction,” Gordon said. “So it’s going to be 6-9, 6-10, 6-11, 7-foot guys able to do everything — handle the ball, pass, shoot, rebound. That’s the way the game is going to be.”And that’s the way the game is for Gordon, and how it has been dating back to his high school days at Archbishop Mitty in San Jose, Calif., where he played point guard before a late growth spurt turned him into a 6-foot-9 forward at Arizona, and then the fourth overall pick in the 2014 N.B.A. draft.The Magic can use Gordon anywhere.For three consecutive possessions in a game against the Houston Rockets in January, Gordon found himself bringing the ball up the floor and feeding center Nikola Vucevic in the post, settling out on the wing for a 3-pointer on a catch-and-shoot, and then posting up himself.“Offensively, his efficiency is up, and his assists are way up,” Magic Coach Steve Clifford said of Gordon. “I think one of our issues has been drawing fouls and getting the ball going into the paint. And that’s something he’s done a good job with.”Gordon was back in San Jose this past summer, getting up 300 shots every day, and the result has been a 53.3 true shooting percentage, his most efficient showing in three years, even as he’s taken more shots from everywhere on the court and opposing defenses have constructed game plans around stopping him.But he also put in extra time on work like slide steps, all with the long-range goal of becoming an elite two-way player. Clifford said Gordon laid out his plans for himself when the two first spoke after Clifford was hired over the summer.The results have been extraordinary. Per Synergy, Gordon ranks second (of 140 qualified players) in the N.B.A. in points per possession on isolation plays, minimum 40 possessions, with 0.545 points per possession.And he isn’t doing this against just bigs, either: The Magic routinely play him against the opposing team’s biggest offensive threat.When the Magic played the Nets in January, Orlando had Gordon take on Joe Harris, a shooting guard, the league leader in three-point percentage and winner of the three-point contest during All-Star weekend.“That speaks to, first of all, what they think of Joe, and also what they think of Gordon’s defensive game,” Nets Coach Kenny Atkinson said. “And defensively, when he wants to stop a guy, he can stop him — he has phenomenal athleticism.”The extent of Gordon’s abilities on that end were revealed further against the Nets that night, when a switch landed Gordon on the Nets’ D’Angelo Russell, an uber-quick point guard in the midst of the finest scoring barrage of his career. Russell feinted left, right, trying to find a pathway with his dribble from the top of the key. Gordon did not let him pass, and Russell, clearly frustrated, finally shunted the ball off to a teammate.The indications that Gordon has become a star are there. What is far less clear is how Orlando puts a championship team around him, though Clifford effusively endorsed him as the model player of that future roster.“He fits with what wins in the N.B.A. right now,” Clifford said. “He’s 23, and he’s made terrific gains, already, this year.”Clifford is a capable coach, in his first season with Orlando. But the roster looks less like a plan and more like a series of one-off moves. Vucevic is an excellent, traditional center, but his presence has kept Gordon, along with young bigs Mo Bamba and Jonathan Isaac, from getting significant time developing as the kind of stretch 5s most teams around the league deploy.Gordon is picked to run the offense, and does so effectively — his assist percentage of 16.4 is a career high — but that is in part because Orlando lacks a true starting point guard. Markelle Fultz may be the answer long-term, but whether the embattled former Philadelphia 76ers guard even plays this season remains a mystery.Gordon’s next step, per Clifford, needs to be the role of go-to scorer down the stretch of games, which Gordon agrees with. Will it happen?“Well, we’ll see,” Clifford said. “I mean, that’s what it’s all about. We’ll see.”But he needs help getting to those late-game situations with a chance to win it. Still, as Gordon eases into superstardom in the relative obscurity of Orlando’s slow rise in the East, he often uses visualization to help motivate himself, closing his eyes and picturing what a championship for the only franchise he’s ever known would look like.He said it gets hard to see it sometimes, pointing out that “a lot of things have to go right” even as he said he was sure it will.“Of course,” Gordon said, pulling on his pants gingerly, navigating his sore back.Toppling the Warriors last week showed Gordon just may be right. Losing to the lowly Cleveland Cavaliers on Sunday night, though, showed how far the Magic have to go.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byThe city’s inaugural event has pushed the boundaries of censorship and what constitutes art — and how and where to display it.By David BelcherMr. Belcher is an editor in the Hong Kong office of the Opinion section.BANGKOK — In the waning weeks of this city’s first biennale, original artwork continues to grace riversides, temples and shopping malls where tourists might not even notice anything out of the ordinary. It’s hard to get noticed here in the City of Angels, even if you’re a piece of art all dolled up at a temple.The more than 200 pieces sprawled across this sprawling city through Feb. 3 are a fascinating testament to Bangkok’s desire to be more famous than infamous — more than a balmy and bewitching megalopolis of food and Buddhist and Hindu temples, not to mention its temples of debauchery.That very soul that gives Bangkok its world-famous reputation is what’s fully on display in this biennale: the three-month-plus event has unflinchingly paid homage to all things Bangkok and Southeast Asia, of which it is unofficially the tourism and commercial center. It has taken the concept of the biennale and upended it. All exhibitions are free, unlike some biennales that charge more than $30 for entry fees to each exhibition space. Young people have responded, making it the most attended arts event in the city’s history.Without incident, the exhibitions have taken up residence in some of the most revered sites across the city: there has been virtually no backlash from the military junta that has run the country since 2014, despite content that challenges the political and social order of Thailand. The biennale, entitled “Beyond Bliss,” has been entirely privately funded, which allowed it more artistic freedom, apparently, which has been somewhat unexpected. With postponed elections this spring and the coronation of the new king in May, the biennale has been a well-timed bit of limelight before politics and royal pageantry take over.Scores of cities now host biennales, the every-two-years-let’s-put-on-a-show idea inaugurated in Venice in 1895. But few seem to have redefined it in quite the way Bangkok has. Seventy-five artists from 33 countries have participated, including celebrity names such as Yayoi Kusama and the performance artist Marina Abramovic. But about half are Thai, and they have pushed the limits of what is taboo in a country many assume is mostly free of taboos. Thailand’s almost flat-out refusal to accept Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, its troubling tensions in its far south between Muslims and the Thai military that have claimed thousands of lives since 2004, the abuse of migrant workers and the growing industrial pollution in the country’s rivers are all depicted here.More than 20 locations have been not transformed so much as enhanced; sculptures are tucked into corners of shopping malls and bustling temples where swirling colors and textures often upstage many of the site-specific pieces. The long-abandoned 19th-century East Asiatic Building evokes the ones along Venice’s Grand Canal, but with a twist: a European remnant along the ever-shifting and bustling Chao Phraya River that is Bangkok’s jugular vein.Last month, the typically uber-tan tourists stumbled around with their usual gait, the Silom district still reeled with knock-off watches being sold next to bars full of overly friendly lady boys while Muslim women in burqas and on their cellphones strolled by. But the traffic-clogged streets served up an occasional giant sculpture. The water taxis that connect the tourist dots along the Chao Phraya were viewing platforms for art pieces such as “Zero” by the Scandinavian duo Elmgreen & Dragset, a vertical, 25-foot-tall image of a see-through oval swimming pool, from which to ponder the river’s ever-expanding skyline of luxury hotels and apartments.Just a bit farther north are a few temples that embody Bangkok’s Hindu and Buddhist past and present. It is here where the biennale blends in most respectfully and gracefully. Most notably is the Thai artist Nino Sarabutra’s “What Will We Leave Behind,” more than 125,000 tea bag-size porcelain skulls that line the walkways of the Wat Prayurawongsawas temple. They massage the feet as you comb the temple. They glisten. They break. Life underfoot.Next door at Wat Arun, or the Temple of Dawn, the touristy Buddhist temple that was restored in 2017 with the finest of detail, several artists have immersed their pieces gently into this vast complex of radiant tiles and selfie-obsessed tourists. And at Wat Po, the reclining Buddha temple across the river, the artist Huang Yong Ping has installed “Zuo You He Che,” a pair of massive legs topped with animal heads carrying scriptures in their mouths. The pieces meld seamlessly into their surroundings to the point that hundreds, if not thousands of tourists, pass by daily, never aware of the modern art infusion.One of the Bangkok Biennale’s final acts is the performance artist Kawita Vatanajyankur’s “Knit,” a critique on how women are exploited in the work force. She weaves her body in and out of a loom of red yarn around 12 white poles in an oval shape, becoming knotted and contorted. This performance is not being performed in a museum or abandoned warehouse but in the soaring lobby of the posh Peninsula Hotel during afternoon tea — a new spin on how Bangkok’s engine of tourism and its women converge again.But a more potent depiction of this idea is on display at the Bangkok Arts and Culture Center, and it, like a few other pieces, has pushed the limits of censorship in Thailand. Chumpon Apisuk’s video installation “I Have Dreams,” shows sex workers from Chiang Mai directly addressing the viewer, giving a rare voice to the hundreds of thousands of women and men who the country — and its often careless tourists — mostly ignore.“I have a dream, to build a new house for my family,” one woman says. “Then I can open a small grocery shop.” It’s a simple and earnest aspiration, heartbreaking and heartfelt. Yet it roars from a small video room in a corner of an arts center. Bangkok’s biennale has set the stage for its return in 2020 with the simplest of words and yet the most profound statement of how art can define a city — and redefine what it means to be racy and taboo in Bangkok.David Belcher is an editor in the Hong Kong office of the Opinion section.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Remy Tumin and Hiroko Masuike(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. President Trump’s national address lasted just nine minutes. Watch it here.Mr. Trump argued that there is a crisis on the southern border that must be addressed before the government shutdown — now the second longest — can end. He was at times misleading. Here’s what he said and how it stacks up against the facts.Here is the response from the Democratic Party leaders, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer._____2. It’s payday for federal workers. There’s only one problem: There’s no paycheck.The bank account of a single mother who works for the Census Bureau has dipped to negative $169. A federal corrections officer took a side job driving for Uber to make his mortgage payment. And a wildland firefighter sold his truck to pay next month’s bills.We talked to federal workers across the country who are furloughed because of the government shutdown and are wondering how long they can survive without pay._____3. Paul Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign manager, discussed internal polling data from the 2016 race with a man tied to Russian intelligence, prosecutors alleged.The accusations came to light in a document filed by Mr. Manafort’s lawyers that was supposed to be partly blacked out — but contained a formatting error. Above, Mr. Manafort after a court appearance last year.Prosecutors for the special counsel Robert Mueller broke off a plea agreement with Mr. Manafort in November, accusing him of repeatedly lying to them. The details of their accusations have been largely kept secret until now.Separately, Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who met with Trump campaign officials in Trump Tower during the 2016 campaign, was charged in a separate case showing her Kremlin ties. Prosecutors said she helped draft Russia’s “intentionally misleading” response in a fraud case._____4. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey refused to meet with John Bolton, the White House national security adviser, after he said Turkey must agree to protect Syria’s Kurds.The snub came a day after Mr. Erdogan commended President Trump’s decision to pull out of Syria. It makes an agreement between the two allies that much more difficult ahead of an announced U.S. withdrawal from Syria. Above, Mr. Bolton, left, with a Turkish government spokesman.For his part, Mr. Bolton has been walking a tricky line on the withdrawal plans. He walked back Mr. Trump’s promises for a speedy removal of 2,000 troops — but he was also at least partly responsible for the conditions that led to that sudden move in the first place._____5. U.S. carbon dioxide output rose by 3.4 percent in 2018, the biggest increase in eight years, according to a preliminary estimate by a private research group.The uptick came even as a near-record number of coal plants across the country closed last year. Some of that increase was weather related, but another big reason for the change was the growing economy: Emissions from factories, planes and trucks soared.The report illustrates how difficult it could be for the country to make further progress on climate change, particularly as the Trump administration pushes to roll back federal regulations that limit greenhouse gas emissions._____6. Sears will remain open — at least for now.The retailer reached an 11th-hour deal pushing off the threat of liquidation. The company’s chairman now has an opportunity to sweeten his $4.4 billion offer to buy Sears and keep its 400 stores open.Edward Lampert, a hedge fund manager, is now expected to bid for the company at a court-supervised auction next week. Already the company’s largest stockholder, he’s the only bidder seeking to maintain Sears as a “going concern.”The company’s largest creditors will ultimately decide whether they would recover more money by allowing Mr. Lampert to keep the company or sell it off piecemeal._____7. New York City plans to spend at least $100 million to ensure that undocumented immigrants and low-income residents can receive medical treatment.Mayor Bill de Blasio, above, said that the new plan would improve coverage for 516,000 people and aim to reach more of those who are eligible for health insurance but haven’t applied for it.The announcement was Mr. de Blasio’s latest jump into the national debates over immigration and health care, and builds on earlier efforts to position himself as a bulwark against the policies of President Trump._____8. Clemson defeated Alabama for the college football championship Monday night using some big plays.But the team’s performance had its roots in a gutsy decision Coach Dabo Swinney made back in September.Mr. Swinney substituted a freshman quarterback for a proven starter at a key moment. That decision made everything, our columnist writes._____9. “We canned a feeling.”Ease, comfort and pleasure are what millennials really want — and capitalism is into it.A new beverage called Recess is a case study in where those desires meet. Bubbles? Yes. CBD? Check. Sans-serif block font? Yeah! A knowing, nudging, creepily on-point Instagram presence? Obviously.Our writer, herself no stranger to millennial nu-irony, explains why the sparkling water infused with hemp extract is flying off the shelves at $29.99 for a six-pack._____10. Finally, here’s a look at a high-stakes science project.Scientists wanted to better understand the explosive reaction between water and lava, but doing experiments in active volcanoes is no picnic. So a group of researchers decided to brew up their own backyard lava.“We are not just crazy people mixing and seeing what happens,” a volcanologist said. “We are scientists and we want to quantify, and we do have an idea of what we are doing here.”Have a spectacular evening._____Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing.

The community team is currently working on it and we thank you for your patience.It’s always a pleasure to see a new constructor make a debut in The New York Times, and today we welcome Jeff Slutzky, who learned the ropes from Derek Bowman. A side note before we look at their puzzle: I’d like to reiterate that the best way to get started making crossword puzzles is to find a mentor and to work with that person on polishing skills before submitting work to an editor. The learning curve for making crosswords is steep and hard to climb alone. Still, some aspiring constructors avoid this step.Maybe they want to be left alone to practice on their own, or maybe they are sensitive to criticism. For whatever reason, they avoid working with a pro and find themselves facing a long list of rejection emails, whereupon they give up and walk away from a fun hobby and a wonderful community.I don’t understand that. Puzzle editors only have time to give limited feedback when responding to submissions, so isn’t it better to have your very own pro to ask questions and work with? The puzzle community is a lovely one, and I have not met a more helpful crowd. O. K., maybe emergency medical workers are actually more helpful, but if you want to learn how to make a puzzle in the most efficient way, join the Crossword Puzzle Collaboration Directory on Facebook and look at the list of veteran constructors who have volunteered their time to help. Pick one and ask if he or she has time to help you with some of your ideas. Be patient with veteran constructors’ time, and really listen to what they tell you. If they have criticism — and I hope it’s gentle and sensible — don’t feel bad or get angry at them. They are trying to make you a better (and hopefully, published) constructor. Above all, don’t give up.Mr. Slutzky worked with Mr. Bowman before submitting his puzzle (you can read more about their collaboration in their notes below), and look where he is now. You could be doing that, too, and then we could all gather here to say nice things about your puzzle.18A: “Bass group?” is nice misdirection that fooled me for quite awhile. The answer is NSYNC because the singer Lance Bass was a founding member.20A: TIL that the Nobel Prize is not only a shiny medal, but also a monetary prize worth 9 million kronor. According to xe.com, a currency calculator, that is worth $1,011,960.43 U.S.D.42A: “Long time out?” is not referring to being outside your home for a long time, it’s talking about being “out” or unconscious for a long time. The answer is COMA.49A: The entry ATF is short for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (that was added on later), and it’s not the answer to “Group of traffic cops, for short?” because police officers who direct traffic are part of the group. The word “traffic” is being used here in the illegal “trafficking” sense.50A: The GIG economy consists of freelance jobs like driving for Uber, renting property via Airbnb or helping others take care of mundane errands via TaskRabbit.22D: Congratulations to “The Last Jedi” director RIAN Johnson, who is appearing in the New York Times Crossword for the first time.Mr. Slutzky and Mr. Bowman offer us a sound addition theme, wherein we are supposed to add TOR to the theme entries to give them a different meaning. The revealer at 66A, the final Across entry, is TORAH, clued as “Sacred text … or your reaction upon figuring out this puzzle's theme?” (“TOR … Ah!”)For example, at 21A, the answer to the clue “Kidnapper who gets arrested?” is CAPTOR IN HAND, which is based on the phrase “cap in hand.”Jeff Slutzky: I’m excited to be making my New York Times Crossword debut. (It’s my first crossword anywhere, actually!) I first came up with this theme several years ago, but I knew nothing about crossword constructing software or word look-up programs at the time, so I tried to create the whole puzzle using graph paper, my pencil and my brain. I didn’t get very far.I met Derek Bowman at the 2018 American Crossword Puzzle Tournament. He’s a veteran constructor, and when I told him I had a theme idea, he expressed interest in collaborating with me. He came up with a couple of new theme entries, as well as the great TORAH kicker at the end. One of our original entries — MENTOR AT WORK (clued as “Yoda or Mr. Miyagi, from 9 to 5?”) — was nixed by the editors because it didn’t really change the meaning of the base phrase, so we replaced it with CAPTOR IN HAND.Derek was great to work with, and I learned a lot from him. I’m glad we were able to put this puzzle together.Derek Bowman: After emailing back and forth a bit after we met, we ended up collaborating on this puzzle. Jeff had several ideas for theme entries that involved adding TOR to common phrases, and I found them to be very funny. (IT’S RAINING, MENTOR sadly ended up on the cutting room floor.) Together, we eventually narrowed it down to the theme entries listed in the grid, with some guidance from Will Shortz and Sam Ezersky.Jeff has a great sense of humor, and I’m still amazed that he immediately identified the tune from “Dear Evan Hansen” that was lovingly redone at the A.C.P.T. talent show last year after hearing just a few notes. Jeff is a whiz at musicals, has a keen eye for detail and was a lot of fun to work with on this puzzle.Almost finished solving but need a bit more help?

By Alyssa LeaderMs. Leader is a law student and activist.As a student at Harvard, I reported a sexual assault by a classmate to the university. After a six-month investigation that ended after I graduated, I received a decision from the administrative board. The board voted to “scratch,” a term defined in the administrative board’s handbook. “Nothing wrong occurred,” it reads. “There are no grounds for action.”College students who endure sexual assault and sexual harassment have long been frustrated by anemic responses from their schools, which too often echo that message: “Nothing wrong occurred.” A new rule that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has proposed — and which the public can comment on through Wednesday —  would make a bad situation even worse by all but demolishing the obligation of schools under Title IX to protect students who experience sexual harassment, including sexual assault. As the #MeToo movement continues to empower survivors of assault and harassment in various professions to speak out, we should worry not only about the effects of this proposed change on campuses, but also about the related price women will pay after graduation. I fear — and research suggests — that the campus predators whom schools fail to hold accountable today may go on to become the abusive bosses of tomorrow.[The Opinion section is now on Instagram. Follow us at @nytopinion.]I have cautiously hoped that the accountability the #MeToo movement has brought to the workplace would trickle into university life. But instead, at the very time people like Harvey Weinstein and R. Kelly have begun to face consequences for their behavior, Ms. DeVos is pushing to roll back the Title IX guidance that assaulted and harassed students depend on to seek justice. Among other changes, her proposed rule would require schools to dismiss all incidents that do not meet an extremely narrow definition of sexual harassment: “so severe, pervasive and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access” to education. As Dana Bolger, a co-founder of Know Your IX, a national youth-led campaign against sexual violence, has pointed out, some courts have ruled that a rape does not meet this standard. The rule would essentially eliminate schools’ responsibility to respond to incidents off campus, which make up 95 percent of sexual assaults of female students, according to the Department of Justice. Moreover, schools would not be legally responsible for addressing any sexual harassment that is not reported to a school official designated to deal with that issue. The overall effect of the proposed rule — which supporters say would restore due-process rights to those accused of sexual assault and harassment — would be to make reporting, already an uphill battle for raped and harassed students, feel even more futile. Carly Mee, who represents survivors of school sexual violence as a senior staff lawyer at SurvJustice, told me, “It is completely illogical that at a time when the public is finally coming to terms with the reality of how prevalent sexual violence is thanks to initiatives like Tarana Burke’s #MeToo movement, the DeVos administration is simultaneously attempting to weaken Title IX protections for survivors.”It’s safe to assume that most perpetrators of sexual violence who have come to public notice through #MeToo didn’t suddenly become abusers after landing jobs in newsrooms and board rooms and on movie sets. Their idea that one can abuse with impunity is learned, and in many cases it is learned where most things are learned — at school. Violent sexual behavior that goes unchecked during college does not reach a natural end at graduation. In fact, many perpetrators of sexual violence are serial offenders: Of men who acknowledge using sexually violent or coercive behaviors, around one in five report committing repeat assaults. Another study found that men reporting a history of sexually aggressive behavior commit, on average, more than six sexual assaults. Examples of school perpetrators who skirted accountability and then offended after graduation are already emerging. Jameis Winston, who was accused of rape as a student at Florida State University and is now a professional football player, reached a settlement with an Uber driver who said he sexually assaulted her in her car in 2016.But the path from perpetrator of school sexual violence to workplace abuser need not be inevitable. Interventions including cognitive behavioral therapy have proved to be highly effective in preventing perpetrators from reoffending. Far from being unfair, responding seriously to perpetrators of school sexual violence is tough kindness. As the world grows increasingly intolerant of violent sexual behavior, early intervention and clear messages about appropriate behavior can prevent perpetrators from reoffending and facing more long-term career, legal and personal consequences.But the first step in effectively intervening must be more, not less, accountability. Ms. Mee suggests that Ms. DeVos should begin by devising policies responsive to school survivors’ needs. “The public conversations going on right now need to translate into action,” Ms. Mee told me. “Those in power have a responsibility to listen to the stories being told and use this momentum to improve the system through which survivors seek justice, not weaken them even further.” If they don’t, they risk emboldening perpetrators who offended in early in life to continue abusing the women in the workplace. I took the unusual step of suing Harvard for its handling of my case and was unsuccessful. The judge dismissed the Title IX claim because of her determination that the university was not “deliberately indifferent.” But as I’ve learned as a student activist, I’m far from alone in my experience of seeing a man accused of sexual assault assured by a college that his actions were not out of bounds — and wondering what that means for the women who will encounter him in the future. While I obtained a restraining order against the man who assaulted me in college, he graduated and got a coveted job, where he’ll only have more and more power as time goes on. While I hope he’ll never become the villain of another woman’s #MeToo story, I am not optimistic. The proposed rules make it even more likely that men like him will leave their college campuses and enter the work force believing they can abuse women and be assured “Nothing wrong occurred.”Alyssa Leader is a second-year law student at the University of North Carolina.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Winnie Hu[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]The traffic choking New York City streets has brought new congestion fees on taxis and Ubers and rallied support around a broader congestion pricing plan to charge all cars and trucks entering the busiest neighborhoods.Now city officials are ratcheting up the fight against another traffic headache: parking scofflaws.On Thursday, Mayor Bill de Blasio is expected to announce new measures aimed at municipal employees who abuse city-issued parking placards that are intended to help them carry out their official duties, but too often are abused and contribute to clogged streets.Many employees brazenly display the placards while parked illegally — including in crosswalks, on sidewalks and blocking bus and bike lanes — or while using personal vehicles when not working.Under the de Blasio administration, the number of city-issued placards has soared and critics have accused the mayor of doing little to tackle the problem.Now, city officials are promising a more aggressive campaign. A new enforcement team of traffic agents will issue tickets and target placard abuse in neighborhoods that have become hot spots, such as Downtown Brooklyn and Chinatown. Any placard found to be misused three times will be revoked under a new “three strikes” policy; previously, it had been left to the discretion of the agencies that issued the placards.In addition, the city will make the misuse or fraudulent use of a placard a separate violation on top of any parking violation. Currently, placard abuse is treated as a parking violation and carries a $50 fine. City officials said they would push for changes to state law to establish a $250 fine for placard abuse.The city also plans to test out stickers as a replacement for paper placards to make it harder to transfer placards to unauthorized vehicles. It will also develop a digital parking system by 2021 in which physical placards will be unnecessary because license plates will already be linked to a database and parking violations will be automatically issued through a so-called pay-by-plate system.Still, none of the mayor’s measures will significantly reduce the total number of city-issued placards, which have nearly doubled to 125,500 in 2018 from 67,297 in 2008, according to city records. The largest chunk, 50,000, is issued by the Transportation Department for its own employees as well as those at other government agencies, and others. The Police Department issues another 44,000 to law enforcement officers, and the Education Department, 31,500 to teachers and school employees to park near their schools.Transportation advocates say the police fail to vigorously target scofflaws, in part, because some officers themselves abuse their placards.Advocates also accuse city officials of doling out parking placards as political favors to the powerful teachers’ unions and others, including 50,000 new placards for teachers and school employees in 2017. They said the city has helped create the problem because more placards lead to more opportunities for abuse and the oversupply of placards has encouraged more people to drive to work, putting more cars on the road.“The elephant in the room is whether they can reduce placard abuse to everyone’s satisfaction without a meaningful reduction in the sheer number of placards,” said Danny Pearlstein, a spokesman for the Riders Alliance, a grass-roots group of transit riders.The placards, Mr. Pearlstein said, have essentially created a large class of privileged city workers, many of whom would otherwise be taking buses and subways. “It’s a question of fairness,” he said. “Plenty of people have to get to work on time and do work that is important to the life of the city.”City officials said that 50,000 temporary placards for school employees were issued to resolve a labor dispute with the teachers’ union. But the number of placards dropped to 31,500 later that year when the Education Department moved to an online application system that set out clear eligibility standards. The department has also tightened oversight of placards, including tracking names and vehicle information for every placard in a database and printing permits on paper that cannot be illegally copied.The previous mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, challenged the city’s tradition of bestowing parking placards on city employees and in 2008 his administration cut the number in half to 67,297 from 144,048 the year before. Mr. de Blasio’s aides said the number of placards had crept back up to 103,000 by the time he took office in 2014.Bruce Schaller, a consultant who helped lead the Bloomberg efforts, said any comprehensive effort to curb placard abuse would sputter unless placard numbers were reduced.Still, Mr. Schaller said he believed the new measures were at least a start. “If there’s real follow-through to what they’re announcing, then people should be able to see improvement,” he said. “Will it completely solve the problem? I can guarantee you no, but New Yorkers are more realistic than that.”The new measures follow renewed efforts by the City Council to cut down on placard abuse. Council members led by Speaker Corey Johnson have recently proposed bills that council aides said were similar to the mayor’s measures or would go even further, such as requiring at least 50 targeted enforcement sweeps every week by the Police Department that would be monitored by the Department of Investigation. The bills would also require enforcement officers to call for towing any vehicle blocking bike and bus lanes, crosswalks or fire hydrants.“The council is thrilled the mayor has seen the light on placard abuse,” Mr. Johnson said. “And we are very much looking forward to working with him to remove this scourge from our streets once and for all.”This is not the first time Mr. de Blasio has vowed to take on the chronic problem. In 2017, the mayor announced a citywide enforcement plan, including creating a new anti-placard-fraud police unit. As a result, city officials said, the number of summonses for illegal parking has risen to 54,608 last year from 28,269 in 2016. But placard abuses have continued, with egregious examples often documented on social media.“Placard abuse erodes faith in government and has no place in our city — it’s simply a question of fairness,” the mayor said in a statement. “Misused and fraudulent placards increase congestion and pose a public safety risk. These initiatives give us the tools we need to start making a real dent in this pervasive issue, to help build a fairer city for all.”Regina Myer, president of the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership, which manages three business improvement districts, said she welcomed the new measures. The neighborhood, which is home to city agency offices and courthouses, has been inundated with placard-carrying drivers who double park on streets and block traffic, leave cars on sidewalks and take up metered spots meant for visitors and shoppers, she said.“I think it will go a long way in starting to check this problem,” she said. “Sadly, Downtown Brooklyn is really the Wild West of placard abuse.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Remy Tumin and Stephen Reiss(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good evening. Here’s the latest.1. The U.S. and Canada, some of the last holdouts, grounded all Boeing 737 Max 8 jets in the wake of a crash. That essentially pulls the plane from almost everywhere in the world. Above, a Max 8 at La Guardia Airport in New York on Tuesday.Though no cause in the Ethiopian Airlines crash has been determined yet, one of the pilots reported “flight-control problems” to air traffic controllers, requesting permission to turn back minutes before the crash.President Trump issued the ban himself, reversing an earlier decision by American aviation regulators to keep the planes in service. Boeing said it supported the decision to ground the planes. One big open question for the American company: What happens to the 5,000 open orders for the Max 8 jets?Here’s a simple guide to all the developments in the unfolding story._____2. A criminal investigation is underway into deals Facebook struck with tech companies that gave them broad access to millions of users’ personal information.A federal grand jury in New York has subpoenaed records from at least two prominent makers of smartphones and other devices that had entered into partnerships with Facebook. Above, outside Facebook’s headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif.“We are cooperating with investigators and take those probes seriously,” a Facebook spokesman said in a statement to The Times. “We’ve provided public testimony, answered questions and pledged that we will continue to do so.”Facebook formed sharing deals with more than 150 companies, including Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Sony, and has phased out most of those partnerships over the past two years._____3. Paul Manafort’s total prison time is now 7.5 years after a second judge handed down a sentence against him in one of the special counsel’s highest-profile cases. Above, Mr. Manafort last April.Mr. Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, was sentenced to just under four years last week in a financial fraud case. The additional sentence encompassed a host of crimes, including money-laundering and obstruction of justice.“It is hard to overstate the number of lies and the amount of fraud and the amount of money involved,” Judge Amy Berman Jackson said, reeling off Mr. Manafort’s various offenses.Just as the second ruling came down, New York indicted Mr. Manafort on 16 additional felony charges. If convicted, he could go to prison even if the president pardons him._____4. Parents arrested. College campuses reeling. Fresh questions about standardized testing. The fallout from the college admissions bribery scandal is spreading.A day after 50 people were indicted in a sweeping Justice Department investigation, businesses, students and schools were beginning to assess the damage and distance themselves from the accused. While lawbreaking in the sector is rare, the shadowy, and completely legal, world of high-priced college consultants is nothing new.The indictments revealed two back doors available to wealthy parents, like Gordon Caplan, pictured above leaving federal court in Manhattan on Tuesday. One involved bribing university officials to pass off applicants as athletic recruits; the other used brazen cheating on standardized exams. And both schemes had two Hollywood stars playing a role, prosecutors said.Our Opinion section has multiple takes on the scandal from the columnists Frank Bruni and Farhad Manjoo, a humor writer and more._____5. News in crime and punishment:Gov. Gavin Newsom of California announced a moratorium on capital punishment, granting a temporary reprieve to the 737 inmates on the state’s death row, the largest in the Western Hemisphere. The execution chamber at San Quentin prison near San Francisco, above, will also be closed under the executive order.Separately, 55,000 old rape kits around the country were finally tested with funds provided by the Manhattan district attorney’s office, resulting in the conviction of 64 attackers._____6. Dozens of children are trapped in a school after a building collapse in Lagos, Nigeria.Rescuers scrambled to pull children out from under the wreckage of a three-story building that fell in on itself. The building housed apartments as well as a nursery and a primary school. Hundreds of people had gathered at the site awaiting news of their children.Officials said at least 8 people had been killed and workers had pulled at least 37 people alive from the site._____7. The F.D.A. is moving toward restricting sales of flavored e-cigarettes to try to curb teenage vaping.The agency proposed requiring retailers to wall off flavored e-cigarettes to prevent sales to underage smokers. Menthol, mint and tobacco-flavored e-cigarettes would be allowed to stay out in the open. The proposal also includes a ban on flavored cigars smoked by 1.3 million youths. Above, a vape store in New York’s East Village.The move is opposed by many convenience stores, but some public health advocates think it doesn’t go far enough. The proposal must undergo a 30-day comment period before it can be finalized._____8. Call them the new “mafias.”With Uber, Airbnb and other tech giants readying to go public, Silicon Valley’s often-incestuous circle of life is ready to start another cycle.In this model, employees of tech start-ups frequently leave once they have been enriched by their firms’ initial public offerings and begin new ventures. Then networks of alumni from these companies — called mafias — support their peers’ new businesses with hiring, advice and money.In other tech news, here’s a guide to totally reclaiming your privacy in 15 not-so-simple steps. For one man it involved selling his house and car, setting up a new corporate identity and giving himself a fake name for his new neighbors._____9. Movie review sites like Rotten Tomatoes are often inundated with users trying to manipulate a film’s box office success. And then came “Captain Marvel.”Even before the superhero movie — starring Brie Larson, above — was released, audience reviewers gave it negative feedback, prompting sites like Rotten Tomatoes to change the rules on their platforms.We also have an interview with Amy Schumer, who told our comedy critic that her new Netflix special, “Growing,” was the most difficult challenge of her career. It airs March 19._____10. Finally, chasing a waterfall theory.Scientists had long assumed that waterfalls always formed from geological or climate-driven changes. But by building a scaled-down river in a laboratory, a research team demonstrated that waterfalls can bring themselves into existence without any outside help. Above, a waterfall in Tal, Nepal.By better understanding how waterfalls can form, the new study may prompt scientists to reconsider how our planet shaped itself, and look at geology with greater precision.Have a beautiful night._____Your Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.And don’t miss Your Morning Briefing.

Here’s the sign-up.)Happy 2019.Last year was a big one in tech, as the Silicon Valley behemoths that drive large swaths of California’s economy faced mounting scrutiny over the way they handle our personal information and do business with one another.But it felt almost overwhelming trying to get a handle on everything that came to light. So I asked Pui-Wing Tam, our Tech editor, to put the revelations into some context.Jill Cowan: What was the most surprising thing your team uncovered this year and why?Pui-Wing Tam: So much happened in tech in 2018 that it’s hard to know where to begin. But the story line that emerged that I found the most surprising was the increasing activism of tech workers.Silicon Valley tech employees have historically seemed a docile lot, lured to the corporate campuses in Mountain View, Calif., San Jose and farther north in San Francisco by promises of fat compensation and a comfortable life.But in 2018, many engineers and other workers at companies like Google and Facebook began more publicly voicing their thoughts on a range of issues, including whether artificial intelligence should be used by the Pentagon, how to better treat sexual harassment victims, and how to embrace more diversity of thought in the workplace. They showed conscience, a heart, and a healthy amount of internal debate.What was the most disconcerting thing your team found this year?It was a year full of holy moly headlines about Facebook improperly handling our user data, Google working on a censored self engine for China, Amazon setting off surveillance alarm bells by selling facial recognition tech to the police, and domestic abusers using smart home technology to harass their victims. Most creepy of all was this column about Brian X. Chen’s experience downloading all the information that Facebook had ever collected on him.So by the end of the year, one of the most disconcerting things was wondering if tech even does any good any more.Fortunately, Farhad Manjoo reminded us of the personal power of how tech can help us store and surface our memories with a column about Google Photos. And Kevin Roose handed out a few awards for good tech.What story lines will be the most important in the year ahead?We’ll still be closely following how far this tech backlash goes. And in San Francisco, we’re looking for a big bump in conspicuous spending if a bunch of tech start-ups — including Uber, Lyft, Slack, Pinterest and others — manage to make their debut on the stock market, enriching their founders, employees, investors and the Tesla car dealer down the road.(Please note: We regularly highlight articles on news sites that have limited access for nonsubscribers.)• A blue wave swept Orange County in the midterms.

You may have had enough Brexit news to last a lifetime, but wait: There’s more.After Parliament for the third time rejected Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan to extricate Britain from the E.U., Britons on both sides of the issue are angry and embarrassed. And they are losing faith in their political system.“We’re in the last hour,” a firefighter said. “I’m wondering: What does more damage? Leaving without a deal? Or the total annihilation of faith in democracy?”On Monday, Parliament will take one more stab at an alternative plan to leave the bloc by the April 12 deadline. If that fails, the country may very well leave the E.U. without a deal or request another extension from the bloc’s leaders.

And here’s the front page of our Sunday paper, the Sunday Review from Opinion and our crossword puzzles.____2. Black box data suggests that the crashes of two Boeing jets — in both the Ethiopian Airlines flight and the disaster in Indonesia — involved problems with the same faulty sensors and automatic system, according to several people briefed on the data.The system is believed to have pushed the front of the plane down, leading to a nosedive that killed all 157 people aboard the Ethiopian Airlines flight. Above, 737 Max 8 airplanes on the assembly line in Renton, Wash., last week.Here’s a visual breakdown of the dangerous flaws in the Boeing 737 Max that may have caused two deadly crashes in five months.____3. A judge struck down President Trump’s order to lift an Obama-era ban on oil and gas drilling in the Arctic Ocean, dealing a major legal blow to the president’s push to expand offshore oil and gas development.She wrote that an executive order by Mr. Trump revoking the drilling ban “is unlawful, as it exceeded the president’s authority.”Separately, a spring surge of migrants is stretching border facilities far beyond capacity. A makeshift encampment under a bridge in El Paso, above, was set up after the main border processing center reached up to 400 percent of its capacity. The influx comes as Mr. Trump said he would cut off all foreign aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador over migrant caravans, and threatened to close the Mexican border as soon as this week.Looking ahead, the NATO secretary general will address a joint meeting of Congress to observe the 70th anniversary of the alliance, which Mr. Trump has often criticized.____4. New York is poised to become the first city in the U.S. to introduce congestion pricing, part of a state budget lawmakers will vote on today after reaching a late-night agreement with Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The toll on cars entering Manhattan’s busiest areas would help provide badly needed financial assistance for mass transit.The budget would also impose a statewide ban on most types of single-use plastic bags from retail sales, the second such ban in the country. Plastic or paper? Here’s what to consider at the grocery store.Separately, the state has filed a sweeping lawsuit against members of the Sackler family, owners of Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin. The suit accuses them of turning a “collective blind eye” for years while dangerous opioids were “dispensed like candy” throughout the state.____5. It was also a busy week in the business world.Lyft began trading on the public markets, becoming one of the most valuable American companies to go public in the last decade and signaling the start of a new chapter: the gig economy on Wall Street. Here’s who gets rich once companies like Lyft, Uber and other so-called unicorns go public.Facebook banned white nationalist content as countries like Australia and New Zealand consider extensive restrictions against the spread of hate and violence on social media.

And Wells Fargo is searching for a new leader after its chief executive, Timothy Sloan, abruptly resigned.____6. It’s been 50 years since affirmative action began to affect the college admissions process. A look back through the decades shows what went right, and what it got wrong.Columbia University provided a unique setting for the practice back in 1969, with a record number of black students admitted that year. We tracked some of them down to hear their stories, including Gregory Peterson, pictured above.In the wake of a sprawling admissions cheating scandal, elite colleges are now trumpeting record low admissions rates. The actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman are due in federal court this week alongside other defendants to face charges in the admissions scheme.____7. A painting of Jesus attributed to Leonardo da Vinci sold for $450 million, the most expensive painting ever auctioned. Now, “Salvator Mundi” is shrouded in a new mystery: Where is it?Since a Saudi royal, most likely Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, bought the painting in 2017, it has vanished from view. It was supposed to appear in the Louvre Abu Dhabi. Now the Louvre in Paris wants it, too.

Here’s the latest.1. 47 months.That was the sentence meted out to Paul Manafort for financial fraud at a federal court in Alexandria, Va., in a hearing that stretched past 7 p.m. Eastern.The judge, T.S. Ellis III, said that 19 to 24 years, the recommended sentence, would be “excessive” for a man who’d lived an “otherwise blameless life.” Above, Mr. Manafort, President Trump’s former campaign chairman, in February 2018. In court today, he was dressed in a green prison jumpsuit and sat in a wheelchair.Separately, Michael Cohen, the president’s former lawyer and fixer, sued the Trump Organization, saying it refused to pay him $1.9 million in legal fees after he began cooperating with prosecutors.And next week, Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, is scheduled to be sentenced. Here’s a refresher on everyone who has been charged in investigations related to the 2016 election, and a guide to the scrutiny undertaken by House committees of the president and his businesses, campaign and administration._____2. The House passed a sweeping resolution condemning anti-Semitism and bigotry, as Democrats hoped to put an internal uproar behind them.The vote capped an emotional week for Democrats, who divided along racial, religious and generational lines after Representative Ilhan Omar insinuated that backers of Israel exhibit dual loyalty. The resolution started off as a pointed rebuke to Ms. Omar but was rewritten into what one Democratic aide called a “kitchen sink resolution.”And today’s 2020 developments: Former Vice President Joe Biden appears to be 95 percent sure he is running for president. Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, on the other hand, is out._____3. The Trump administration created a list of activists and journalists whom they subjected to additional scrutiny at the border with Mexico last year.The effort was an attempt to determine who was behind the caravans bringing large numbers of migrants from Central America to the southwest border, according to a leaked internal government document. Above, a caravan of migrants in November en route to the United States, captured in a photo by Go Nakamura, a freelance photographer who was on the government list.The activists and journalists — including the photographer who took the picture above — were singled out for extra screening by U.S. and Mexican border officials._____4. Efforts to end the Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo are failing because of growing distrust among residents, the leader of Doctors Without Border said.Dr. Joanne Liu said outside organizations, including her own, had alienated Congo residents, leading them to avoid medical care and even to attack treatment centers. The outbreak is now the second largest Ebola epidemic ever. Above, a mother of a child suspected of dying from Ebola.She called on medical teams to treat patients “as humans and not as a biothreat.”_____5. Elsewhere abroad:President Xi Jinping, above left, is breaking the rules and longstanding traditions of Chinese politics — by letting his hair go gray. For decades, Chinese leaders have sported unnaturally black heads of hair, a look that symbolized unity and gave the party a youthful veneer. The graying is part of his efforts to soften his hard-line policies.On a far more serious note, insulting the government online could land Russians in jail after lawmakers passed bills to further control information. The bills reflect a nearly two-decade-long project by President Vladimir V. Putin to put information flow under state control.And in a surprise move, the normally cautious European Central Bank revived stimulus measures designed for times of crisis, a sign of how trade tensions are reverberating through a slowing world economy._____6. Several thousand (more) millionaires are about to flood San Francisco.Uber, Lyft, Airbnb and Pinterest are all about to go public. Now, seemingly the whole city — and not just the financial planners and the real estate agents — is scrambling to prepare.“Even if just half the I.P.O.s happen, there’s going to be 10,000 millionaires overnight,” one real estate agent said. “People are like, ‘I’m not going to sell till next year, because there are going to be bajillionaries everywhere left and right.’”_____7. Alex Trebek, the longtime game show host, revealed that he was seriously ill in a way true to his more than three decades leading “Jeopardy!” — on screen, on the “Jeopardy!” set and with a touch of humor. Above, on set this week.Sharing his Stage IV pancreatic cancer diagnosis, he said: “I plan to beat the low survival rate statistics for this disease. Truth told, I have to. Because under the terms of my contract, I have to host ‘Jeopardy!’ for three more years.”It is an aggressive cancer, with few good treatment options. It usually has no symptoms until it is advanced. There is, however, a rising survival rate, compared to what patients faced 10 years ago._____8. High school and university boxing programs are a dying breed. One old trainer in Nekoosa, Wis. — population 2,500 — is trying to keep the hopes of small-town boxers alive.Ken Hilgers, 69, pictured above, is a retired paper mill powerhouse operator who teaches the art of boxing to any child who walks through the door.

Temperatures start in the low 20s and by the afternoon will warm all the way up to the low 30s.Alternate-side parking: Suspended through Ash Wednesday.The outlook for New York City yesterday went from, in the words of Bob Dylan, “give me shelter from the storm” to “an uneventful morn.”And yet the city’s public schools — the nation’s largest system — were closed for a snow day.How did that happen?Why did Mayor de Blasio call a snow day?Timing. He had to make a decision Sunday evening, when the forecast looked ominous. The weather changed overnight, but by that point, it was too late to adjust the plan.The call to close schools is made early, “with as much time as possible for parents to plan,” the mayor’s spokesman said. Then there are all the school buses to think about.As my colleagues Eliza Shapiro and Michael Gold wrote, buses leave depots before dawn and could interfere with the nearly 1,600 snow plows combing the streets.How many snow days have there been in New York City?Seven since 2014, compared with 11 from 1978 to 2013, according to The City’s Alyssa Katz.What happened with recent storms?• On Nov. 16, a sudden rush-hour storm took local officials by surprise, and thousands of commuters were delayed and stranded. Some students were stuck on a bus for 10 hours.• Then on Jan. 18, motorists were advised to stay off the road. It turned out to be not so bad.Did everyone get the forecast wrong, or did the weather change?“Temperatures were just not as cold as predicted, so it didn’t allow for as much accumulation,” said John Murray, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service. “It was a challenging forecast, with uncertainty at play, and a few inches can make a dramatic difference.”Who else can tell you about the weather?Practically everyone gets their information from the National Weather Service. Its website is detailed and maybe not ideal for people who just want to know if they need an umbrella or scarf. For that, there are some very good newsletters (I can think of a few).If you want a little more information, there is an array of weather apps.Liz Robbins, a former Times colleague and weather enthusiast, told me about some she uses: AccuWeather is easy to use; Dark Sky is precise and good for knowing when to grab an umbrella; and Weather Underground (clever name!) has helpful charts, graphs and radar maps.The takeaway: By the time the brunt of a storm arrives, it’s too late to figure out how to respond. Mayors often need to make decisions hours earlier, when many of the factors may be, literally, up in the air.And now ...

Then they read their puns to the audience, whose reaction is calculated by a very official “human clap-o-meter.”Whoever emerges victorious squares off with a winner from a previous contest.The main rules: no hate, no hurt feelings and encouragement for all.So, what does Mr. Firestone think of the stylebook’s entry on puns?To my surprise, he not only liked it, but said that was what he was attempting to emulate.“The conventional wisdom is ‘a pun is an eyeroll.’ What we try to do is set up a situation where it is really a side-split,” he said. “We don’t want people rolling their eyes, ‘Oh, my gosh,’ because I don’t think we’d get people coming back.”And come back they have. Tonight’s show, at 7 p.m., at Littlefield in Brooklyn, is the 95th Punderdome to take place in New York City, Mr. Firestone said.Part of Punderdome’s success is its lax rules about what exactly a pun is. “We define it very broadly,” Mr. Firestone said.Audience members, who applaud or groan at the wordplay, “may not have a particularly correct definition of puns.”It’s Tuesday — have fun with words.Dear Diary:I was coming out of the subway elevator with my son in his stroller, when I saw a rat on the platform barely two feet away.A rat is one of the few things that can truly unnerve me.

The old come-ons are obsolete. Range is the new horsepower. Connectivity replaces cylinder count. And sustainability is the new status symbol. Volvo’s Polestar 2 electric car, unveiled last week, even comes with a leather-free “vegan” interior.The need for carmakers to win over a public still hesitant about buying a car that needs half an hour or more to recharge is becoming more urgent as electric vehicles move closer to mass production.Battery-powered rides like the BMW i3, Nissan Leaf and Tesla’s lineup have been available for years. But this once-niche category is now expanding at a breakneck pace.There are dozens of new electric cars on display at the Geneva International Motor Show, which opened to the public on Thursday and continues through March 17. These are not concept cars that may never be for sale, as tended to be the case at previous shows. They are vehicles with familiar brand names that you will be able to buy this year or next.An electric Porsche is coming at the end of this year. Volkswagen is refitting a German factory to build a battery-powered car that, beginning in 2020, will sell for about the same price as a Golf.Audi, a unit of Volkswagen, showed nothing but battery-powered vehicles and hybrids at the Geneva show. Renault, one of the first companies to offer electric cars, is renewing its lineup. Volvo skipped the show in order to leave the stage to its all-electric Polestar.“2019 will be a decisive year for electromobility,” Herbert Diess, the Volkswagen chief executive, said at a company event in Geneva.It’s also a moment of truth for the traditional automakers, which have long argued that their decades of experience in manufacturing will allow them to avoid the start-up problems suffered by Tesla and to dominate the next wave of automotive technology.Tesla’s financial woes, which have prompted it to shutter retail stores and lay off 7 percent of its work force, may prove them right. But it remains to be seen whether the entrenched carmakers can generate the same energized fan base.The key to selling any product is differentiation, making your car seem cooler and more capable than all the others. Long ago, it was V-8 engines, six-speed automatic transmissions, and the actor Ricardo Montalbán caressing the “soft Corinthian leather” seats of a Chrysler Cordoba.But a lot of the features that set conventional cars apart, like fast acceleration, quiet interiors and smooth handling, are pretty much standard with electric cars.While gasoline engines need at least a few seconds to gather momentum, batteries deliver instant pep. Electric motors make very little noise. And battery packs, heavy and usually spread out beneath the passenger compartment, provide a low center of gravity and help glue an electric car to the road.Automakers also need to prevent their models from becoming commodities as the whole idea of car ownership is under attack by Uber, Lyft and other ride-share companies.One way Volvo and others are trying to answer the upstarts is by importing a bit of Silicon Valley vibe, even if their engineers are in Sweden or Stuttgart. Polestar, which is positioning itself as a brand separate from Volvo, staged the recent unveiling of the Polestar 2 as if it were a new iteration of the iPhone.Thomas Ingenlath, the chief executive of Polestar, bounded onto a stage in Gothenburg, Sweden, wearing a mustard-colored zip-up jacket over black slacks and a T-shirt and white sneakers.Polestar is “redefining premium for the electric age,” Mr. Ingenlath said, standing in front of a giant video screen. His presentation, broadcast online, was heavy on the car’s digital features, including an 11-inch touch screen and Google voice recognition software that allows drivers to summon driving directions or call up a tune from Spotify.A United States version of the Polestar 2 will go on sale early next year, initially in California and Washington State, for about $63,000. (The Polestar 1, a performance hybrid, has just begun rolling off a Chinese production line.) Dealerships will be small retail spaces in city downtowns, and some may be pop-up stores.When Mr. Ingenlath got to the part about the Polestar 2’s vegan interior, he showed an image of cows looking content, presumably because they were not fated to become car seats. “I will spare you now the video of mass production of leather,” Mr. Ingenlath said, somewhat darkly.Ricardo Montalbán, who died in 2009, may not have been a fan, but the pitch underlined the carmakers’ assumption that electric car buyers will skew green.The primary motivation of a customer who wants an electric vehicle “is being friendly to the planet,” Olivier Murguet, executive vice president for sales at French carmaker Renault, said in an interview in Geneva.But, he added, electric vehicle customers pay close attention to the same things as other car buyers, like the purchase price.Electric cars continue to cost thousands of dollars more than conventional vehicles. High price remains an obstacle, mostly because of the cost of the batteries. That may be less of a problem than it seems. Electric vehicles already on the road are holding on to their value well, Mr. Murguet said. That allows carmakers to offer attractive leasing terms because they know the cars will command a good resale price when the lease expires.European customers can lease a Renault Zoe, a two-door battery-powered subcompact, for 150 euros a month, or $170. “Even if the price of the cars is higher, the amount to finance from a customer’s perspective is not that much more,” Gilles Normand, senior vice president for electric vehicles at Renault, said in an interview in Geneva.And many buyers of electric cars won’t be individuals, but car-sharing services that buy them by the dozens and can spread the cost among more users. Those buyers tend to pay attention to the cost of a car over its life span rather than just the initial purchase price. Electric cars look better from that angle because they don’t require oil changes and electricity is cheaper per mile than gasoline.“The whole business case is changing for all of us,” Chris Delaney, president of Europe for tire maker Goodyear, said as he sat in a self-driving electric shuttle van on display in Geneva. (Goodyear is supplying specialized tires for the vehicle.)While electric vehicles account for only about 5 percent of Goodyear’s current sales, Mr. Delaney said, they account for 40 percent of new business from manufacturers — an indication of how fast demand is rising. Electric cars pose a design challenge for tiremakers as well. The cars’ high weight and fast acceleration require a more robust tire.The open question is whether any of the established carmakers, who still make most of their money from conventional vehicles, can generate buzz as effectively as Elon Musk, Tesla’s chief executive. Despite all of Tesla’s problems, Mr. Musk commands widespread respect in the industry for transforming the image of electric cars from nerdy science projects to desirable performance vehicles.So far, no other car manager has demonstrated Mr. Musk’s ability to make Tesla the center of the conversation, though not always in a good way.“Tesla did a lot to build up the market for electric cars,” Detlev von Platen, head of sales and marketing at Porsche, said. “We have a lot of respect for what they accomplished. They’re a reference for us.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayAn illustration from “Biddy Mason Speaks Up”By Jill CowanGood morning.(Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.)When you think of the people who built Los Angeles, the names that most likely jump to mind — William Mulholland, the Chandlers — are often those of white men. It’s not surprising, and it’s not unusual among American cities.That’s why, when I heard Laura Atkins, a Berkeley-based children’s book author, mention Bridge Mason, known as Biddy, on an episode of the podcast East Bay Yesterday, I took note.Ms. Mason, she said, had been born enslaved, won her freedom in a California court in the mid-1850s and eventually became a prominent downtown L.A. landowner — not to mention the growing metropolis’s richest woman.She organized the city’s First A.M.E. church and was a philanthropist.It’s Black History Month, so I’ve been thinking about what it means to honor the legacies of people whom history has traditionally left out.Ms. Atkins and Arisa White, a poet, have written a book about Ms. Mason’s life, “Biddy Mason Speaks Up,” part of a series about civil rights leaders. So I asked them how they decided to write about her and about different ways of thinking about historical figures.“A lot of what we thought about was the idea of the kind of linear, heroic narrative, where there’s one singular person who saves the day, versus more of a feminist recovery project,” Ms. White said. “We have to amass Biddy Mason’s story by pulling through different threads.”The book, which is illustrated by Laura Freeman, alternates between a story told from Ms. Mason’s perspective and pages that are filled with definitions of words like “power,” “race,” and “westward expansion,” as well as timelines and discussion questions for readers about how those themes play out in their own lives.On one page, the authors ask: “Have you ever been taken away from someone you love?”On another: “What does freedom mean to you?”Ms. White said she was also excited to highlight a different way of building wealth. Ms. Mason worked as a midwife and a healer who used herbal remedies her enslaved grandmother had taught her.Among her clients were some of L.A.’s richest residents, including Pio Pico, the last governor of Mexican California.“It’s bringing to life a different kind of intelligence that I don’t think young readers access when they think about enslaved people,” she said.Ms. Atkins said she knew that the idea of reframing history through a feminist, collectivist lens might sound a little too, well, Berkeley for a lot of educators.But she said she had been heartened by the response.“We’ve gotten some real love from people out in the world and appreciation for the way it empowers students to engage,” she said.(A note: We often link to content on sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

You wouldn’t expect that at a private company or, say, in almost any European country. But they keep reporting for work, in the midst of what is now the longest federal shutdown in United States history.Which raises the question: Why do they keep showing up? Lawmakers are beginning to float the idea that perhaps they shouldn’t and that some sort of coordinated absence by federal workers might be the quickest way to persuade President Trump and congressional Democrats to find a deal to end the shutdown:Couple senior Republican lawmakers tell me the only way this breaks open is if TSA employees stay home and Americans get furious about their flights. That’s the only out, they say. And they’re close to the WH.Workers understand the power they have; a walkout of Transportation Security Administration employees would effectively cripple air travel in the United States, for example. But they do not appear close to wielding that leverage. On Wednesday, T.S.A. reported its national rate of unscheduled absences was 6.1 percent, up from 3.7 percent a year ago, but not high enough to significantly worsen wait times in most major airports. Here are the reasons more federal workers are still showing up for work despite not getting paid. The National Labor Relations Act extends a right to strike to American workers — but it specifically does not give that right to government workers. A law passed during President Jimmy Carter’s administration bars federal workers from striking. When air traffic controllers walked off the job in 1981, demanding better pay and working conditions, President Ronald Reagan ordered them to return to work. When they did not, he fired them. For an employee deemed “excepted” from furlough during a shutdown — which is to say, forced to work without pay — walking off the job could carry a similar penalty. Guidance from the federal Office of Personnel Management prohibits excepted employees from taking any sort of leave, including vacation or sick days, during a shutdown. “If an excepted employee refuses to report for work after being ordered to do so,” the guidance says, “he or she will be considered to be absent without leave (AWOL) and will be subject to any consequences that may follow from being AWOL.”Union leaders and federal workers frequently stress that furloughed employees want to be allowed to return to their jobs — and that employees working without pay are doing so largely because they care about their work, be it protecting public lands, inspecting food for safety or catching drug smugglers at the border.“It sounds corny, I know,” said Jacqueline Simon, the director of public policy for the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal workers’ union. But “federal employees are extremely devoted to the mission of their agencies,” she said. “They don’t just fall into these jobs. They believe in public service; they believe in what they do. They’re not just going to walk away. There may come a point when some of them have to, to feed their families, but no one wants to do that.”The National Air Traffic Controllers Association has seen “no unusual increase” in controllers missing work, the union’s executive vice president, Trish Gilbert, said on Friday. Asked if the controllers’ association would consider organizing a strike, a walkout or another job action if the shutdown continued in the long run, Ms. Gilbert said the union “would not condone or endorse any kind of activity like that.”“We have taken an oath,” she said. “We know we’re important to the United States economy, and we are going to work. We’re just not getting paid. So even if this drags on, people will come to work.”At least five lawsuits have been filed against the federal government by groups including the American Federation of Government Employees, the National Treasury Employees Union and the air traffic controllers’ association.A United States District Court judge ruled on Tuesday against issuing any temporary restraining order that would allow workers to stop coming to work or order them to be paid. But those cases will continue to work their way through the judiciary, with another court date set at the end of the month.The average federal worker has lost about $5,000 since the shutdown took hold in late December. On Wednesday, the president was expected to sign a bill promising that those workers would receive retroactive pay.Loyalty does not make workers immune to economic reality; they still need to make mortgage and car payments. In the high-cost Washington area, Ms. Simon said, a T.S.A. employee’s salary starts at $28,000 a year, which “doesn’t give you any cushion for absorbing any interruption in your pay.” Reporting the agency’s elevated rate of unscheduled leave on Wednesday, T.S.A. officials said that “many employees are reporting that they are not able to report to work due to financial limitations.” Furloughed employees can work other jobs to make ends meet: A staff member with the White House Council of Economic Advisers has begun driving for Uber to pay the bills, the council’s director said this week. But moonlighting is a lot harder for excepted employees, who still must show up at their regular job every day.With a strong labor market and an unemployment rate hovering around 4 percent, many of those employees might eventually quit to take a job that brings an immediate paycheck. An analysis from the online jobs site Indeed suggests that might already be brewing. It looked at job search behavior from mid-December through mid-January for workers at some affected federal agencies, including the I.R.S. and the T.S.A. Indeed researchers found that clicks on job listings rose at least 17 percent for each of those worker groups over that period, a sign that employees affected by the shutdown “are searching for jobs more right now than they usually do at this time of year,” said Martha Gimbel, Indeed’s director of economic research.Ms. Simon said that some workers might eventually be forced to take other jobs if the shutdown stretches on. For now, she said, there is no talk about a coordinated “sickout” or other walkout from work. Federal employees, she said, are “sharing their heartache” with one another — and their indignation.“They don’t like being treated as hostages,” she said.

As a promoter, he has had to miss some of his fighters’ matches and use creative scheduling to make payments.This past weekend, it meant trusting that his small team would take care of any last-minute problems and that he would arrive late to an event headlined by his top fighter, Claressa Shields, taking on Christina Hammer for the undisputed middleweight world title.“You’re down for the count, champ,” Kelly Swanson, one of Salita’s publicists, told him as Salita chuckled and prepared to eat Shabbat dinner Friday night.Salita was 9 when his family moved to Brooklyn from Odessa in what is now Ukraine. When his mother was hospitalized with breast cancer a few years later, he was introduced to the rabbi at Chabad of Flatbush, a synagogue belonging to a branch of Hasidic Judaism. Salita began exploring his faith more deeply, inspired in part by the fact that he was in a country with religious freedom, he said.But he also received encouragement from an unlikely source: Jimmy O’Pharrow, his boxing trainer at the Starrett City Boxing Club in Brooklyn. Salita had started going to O’Pharrow’s gym at 13 and was the rare white fighter there. O’Pharrow, who died in 2011, had said about Salita, “Kid looks Russian, prays Jewish and fights black.”“Jimmy always encouraged my individuality, to learn about myself, my culture,” Salita said. “It gave me confidence to do what I needed to do socially and spiritually.”By the time he turned professional in 2001, Salita was observing the Sabbath.He could not fight on Friday nights, a showcase for up-and-coming fighters. Those who followed his career said his religion had little to do with his never winning a world title during this 12-year career. Although he had a 35-2-1 record, his only shot at a world championship, against Amir Khan in 2009, ended by technical knockout 1 minute 16 seconds into the first round.“The truth is that his skill level didn’t match up with a class profession,” said Bob Arum, Salita’s first promoter.Salita started promoting as a way to resurrect his career. After losing to Khan, he promoted the next card on which he fought. He got the Jewish Channel to broadcast the fight. He did that for two more of his fights and got into the promotional business full time after his last fight in 2013.Oscar De La Hoya and Floyd Mayweather Jr. are among the marquee faces of a trend of boxers becoming promoters. But Salita has a much tougher road because his fighting career was not nearly as heralded as theirs, and he does not have the flair and drama of big names like Arum and Don King.But what Salita lacks in star power, people say he makes up for with his earnest style and strategy. He is personable and talks so softly sometimes that people have to lean in to hear him.When he came to Shields, a two-time Olympic gold medalist, he brought a newspaper article he had read about her and a vision for her career.“When I had a conversation with him about me becoming world champion within seven fights, fighting on Showtime, me becoming a millionaire, he said, ‘Everything you are saying is obtainable, but I see more for you,’” Shields said.Salita began promoting Shields in her second professional fight. By her fourth fight, she won her first world title. On Saturday, she faced Hammer, who was undefeated, in a unification fight on Showtime. It was the first time that women had headlined a Saturday night card televised on Showtime.And so it was that Salita sat nervously in his dark hotel room at 7:30 p.m. on Saturday, anxious as the minutes ticked. The undercard fights started at 6 p.m., but the Sabbath did not end until 8:15.When the clock in the room hit 8:16 p.m. — he likes to have a minute buffer — Salita was up and in the bathroom, putting on his suit. He took out his prayer book, flipped through the pages, whispering a prayer. He kissed it and at 8:24 p.m. was out the door, his eyes trained on his cellphone as he texted nonstop.He quickly got a call. Someone could not find the tickets that were supposed to have been left for them at the arena.“O.K., I’m on my way over there,” he said.He stopped in a friend’s room, they chanted a final Sabbath prayer, and Salita poured himself a shot of Cognac.“Yeah, he’s nervous,” the friend, Vadim Tovshteyn, said.8:44: In an Uber, and Salita got another call. “Six minutes away, one mile,” he told the person on the other end.8:48: Another call. “Two minutes away,” he said.8:52: “Yeah, I’m walking in,” Salita said over the phone.In the arena, it was greetings all around for Salita, who wears a black skullcap with his gray suit. He checked on Shields in her dressing room, where gospel music blasted as she got her hands wrapped, and then he took his seat ringside.The upstart nature of Salita Promotions, with a core staff of about four, was clear. The fight was in a 3,500-seat auditorium. It was nearly full. The crowd was spirited, but nowhere near the size of most major championship fights. Still, it was a long way from the club shows he promoted early on, where he lost money and could not get a major broadcaster to pay attention. And the result, he said, was significant, not just for boxing, but for society.Shields dominated the fight to move to 9-0 and hand Hammer, whom Salita also promotes, her first defeat in 25 bouts. Everyone was high-fiving and hugging Salita, who believes Shields could become a bona fide star.Eddie Hearn of British-based Matchroom Boxing promotions said the Shields-Hammer bout could have benefited from a “major promoter,” according to BoxingScene.com. But with the biggest female star in Shields, some said that Salita could corner a market that many big-name promoters have ignored.“If you’re an established female fighter, I want Dmitriy to be my promoter,” said Steve Farhood, a Showtime boxing analyst.Salita is now looking forward to what will undoubtedly be his most lucrative bout as a promoter. Jarrell Miller, a heavyweight who was the first fighter Salita signed, faces Anthony Joshua, the world champion from England making his United States debut, at Madison Square Garden on June 1. Miller is a big underdog, but an upset would be like a golden ticket for Salita’s promotional career.“He has a good flair for promoting; he is something special,” Arum said.After the news conference on Saturday night, Salita reflected on a Jewish belief that God created everything with a purpose, and “as a human, you do your best to make it reach its potential.”“As a promoter,” he said, “my responsibility is to make sure every fighter does the best they can with what they’ve got.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftBy Kevin RooseThe gig economy’s work force is fighting back, and in some cases, it’s winning.On Wednesday, Instacart, the Silicon Valley upstart that delivers groceries and other household items to customers through an app, reversed a tipping policy that had outraged workers, who accused the $7 billion company of cheating them out of rightfully earned wages.“We heard loud and clear the frustration when your compensation didn’t match the effort you put forth,” Apoorva Mehta, Instacart’s chief executive, wrote in an open letter to Instacart’s contract workers, known as shoppers.Instacart’s workers had taken to Reddit forums and private Facebook groups to express their anger with the policy, which counted tips toward the guaranteed minimum payments the company offered to shoppers. In some cases, the more customers tipped, the less Instacart paid them.“It’s offensive, it’s unethical, and in this climate it’s a very dumb thing to do,” Matthew Telles, an Instacart courier in Chicago, said this week before the reversal.In the letter to shoppers, Mr. Mehta apologized for the tipping policy, which he called “misguided.” He said that from now on, Instacart would calculate tips separately from base pay. He also said the company was putting new minimum payments into effect: at least $5 for orders that require only delivering an item, and $7 to $10 for orders that involve picking items off supermarket shelves.In addition, Instacart said it would retroactively compensate workers who had lost base pay as a result of the old tipping system.The victory at Instacart, which will ultimately affect thousands of workers, is just the latest in a string of successful pressure campaigns by workers for gig economy platforms. Drivers for Uber and Lyft in New York successfully agitated for a citywide minimum wage that went into effect this week. Postmates, another high-flying start-up, recently settled a class-action suit with thousands of delivery workers who contested the way the company classified them as contract workers.[Subscribe to “With Interest.” It’s a Sunday newsletter with essential business insights that’ll prep you for the week ahead.]It’s no secret that many modern gig workers exist in a state of permanent precarity, with few legal protections, unstable working conditions and pay that varies based on who’s flush with venture capital money that week. Most gig economy workers are still classified as contract workers, meaning that they aren’t covered by federal minimum wage laws and other labor protections.Still, by organizing en masse and expressing vocal opposition to exploitative policies, they have managed to wring some concessions out of the billion-dollar corporations whose labor they provide.For Instacart, the drama began late last year when it changed its method for paying its contract workers.Until then, Instacart’s shopper pay was determined by an algorithm that factored in a fixed base payment for each order, along with a per-item bonus and extra payments for certain tasks, such as delivering over long distances. After the change late last year, Instacart presented shoppers with a single, itemized “earnings estimate,” and guaranteed them a $10 minimum payment for each batch they accepted.But Instacart shoppers began to notice that for some orders, the tips that customers had added during checkout were being counted toward their $10 minimum, rather than being paid out on top of them.Angry shoppers collected shocking examples of low pay, like a receipt submitted by an Instacart shopper who appeared to have been paid a total of $10.80 after a $10 tip. (Instacart claimed that the payment was an “edge case,” and that it was putting new policies in place to prevent similar incidents.)In another example, two identical Instacart batches paid out $10 — the guaranteed minimum — even though one delivery earned a $2 tip and the other a $6 tip. In the case of the $2 tip, Instacart’s “batch payment” came to $8; in the case of the $6 tip, Instacart paid only $4.“We started to notice customers who said they tipped, but a lot of times we wouldn’t see the tips,” said Kaylania Chapman, a worker in Orlando, Fla., who delivers orders for both Instacart and DoorDash, a rival delivery app with a similar tipping policy.The workers’ complaints started to be picked up by news outlets including Fast Company and NBC. And they caught the attention of Working Washington, a union-backed labor group in Seattle, which collected more than 1,500 signatures of Instacart shoppers who objected to the company’s pay practices. Some began asking for cash tips outside the app, while others encouraged customers to leave 22-cent tips — a nominal amount meant to show solidarity with workers — through the app and then adjust the tips higher after a delivery was made.On Wednesday, after the announcement that Instacart was changing its policies, a representative from Working Washington, Sage Wilson, said, “In the space of two weeks, Instacart workers came together, sparked a national media sensation and transformed the entire pay model of a $7 billion corporation.”DoorDash, which is valued by investors at $4 billion, has not announced plans to change its tipping policy, which dates to 2017.“DoorDash’s pay model provides transparency, consistency and predictability,” a company spokeswoman said on Tuesday. “Since implementing this pay model more than a year ago, we’ve seen a significant increase in dasher retention, percentage of on-time orders and dasher satisfaction.”After Instacart’s announcement on Wednesday, the DoorDash spokeswoman declined to comment.Many Instacart shoppers were thrilled by the company’s about-face. In a private Facebook group, some celebrated their successful campaign to get the company to change its tipping policy and make them whole on previous payments.“I can’t believe it! Back pay!” one shopper wrote.“THIS is why you stand up for yourself against corruption,” wrote another.“I’m very excited that we got Instacart to listen to our complaints,” said Ashley Knudson, an Instacart shopper in Seattle. “I feel like we have some work to do, and we’re not going to back down until we get the consistency that we need in our batch payments. We consider this a small victory, for acknowledging their mistreatment, but we look forward to pushing onward and having our voices be heard.”Many gig economy workers still face economic insecurity and exploitative platform policies, of course, and lawmakers may ultimately need to come to their rescue. (On Tuesday, Representative Ro Khanna, a Democrat who represents parts of Silicon Valley, told BuzzFeed News that Instacart’s now-defunct tipping policy was a “deceptive business practice that should end.”)But ultimately, it may be up to customers to demand more accountability and worker-friendly policies.Elizabeth Haslam, a DoorDash customer in California who has spent more than three years placing orders from the delivery service, said on Tuesday that she was “shocked” to learn about the company’s tipping policies.“It made me really angry that I was contributing to a company that would do that,” she said. “And it makes me wonder how many other services are doing the same thing.”Kevin Roose is a columnist for Business and a writer-at-large for The New York Times Magazine.

Notoriously choked with traffic, a clattery, belching, potholed sluice of despair, built for 47,000 vehicles, now used by 153,000 cars and trucks a day, the long-neglected midcentury highway is collapsing. Experts give it until 2026 — in infrastructure terms, the day after tomorrow — when big trucks may no longer be able to use it.Serving working stiffs from Staten Island, truck drivers from New Jersey, slicing smack through tony, litigious, brownstone Brooklyn, it is a modern American parable. Having bent the continent to our will, devising bridges and dams, railroads and highways, the United States in the early 21st century has fallen conspicuously behind other countries, paralyzed by our inability to fix failing infrastructure.We treat collapsing sewers and tunnels like trips to the dentist, procrastinating until disaster strikes, and then we have to spend a fortune on recovery. Faced with staggering costs, we squabble along partisan lines, pitting drivers against subway riders, suburbanites against city-dwellers, red versus blue — blocking change in the name of prudence, missing one after another opportunity for progress.Summoned last week by community groups, the Brooklyn Heights Association and A Better Way, the crowd in Brooklyn Heights assembled for a town hall at lovely old Plymouth Church to help quash two nasty plans — one painful, the other even more so — that the city’s Department of Transportation had put forth a few months back.The plans offered alternatives for repairing the despised roadway, a crucial mile-and-a-half of which morphs into a six-lane triple-cantilever affair, clinging to the hillside beneath the Heights — a kind of bunk-bed arrangement conceived during the 1940s by the prolific landscape architects Michael Rapuano and Gilmore Clarke.The cantilever system was a victory for People Power over the Establishment. It diverted the highway from running straight through the middle of Brooklyn Heights, as Robert Moses, the city’s all-powerful planning czar back then, had wanted but community groups protested. The top bunk became the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, one of the loveliest spots in the whole city.Saving it is now inextricably linked to the destiny of the B.Q.E. Ideally, New York should leave the Promenade alone and probably just give up on this stretch of the expressway, the way other cities have torn down highways to create parks and flourishing neighborhoods — the way the Bloomberg administration removed traffic from Broadway where it passes through Times Square.Drivers adapt. It’s one of the counterintuitive laws of automotive behavior. We forget that car-centered urbanism didn’t always have such a stranglehold on New York City. As late as the early 1950s, overnight street parking was illegal. Unfortunately, politicians and traffic engineers fixate on accommodating the number of drivers we have.And there seem to be more of them than ever, what with the subway’s decline and hordes of Uber cars and Amazon delivery trucks.The solution, congestion pricing, may soon impose tolls to help fix the subways and reduce the number of cars and trucks on roads like the B.Q.E. A study released the other day by the Regional Plan Association — commissioned by A Better Way — suggested that congestion pricing could reduce traffic on the B.Q.E. into Manhattan by 13 percent, enough to allow the road to shrink down to four lanes. That’s assuming politicians, catering to countless constituencies, don’t exempt so many routes that congestion pricing becomes toothless.Some years ago, a B.Q.E. proposal surfaced that imagined digging a tunnel beneath Downtown Brooklyn to create a shortcut for the highway where it connected with the Brooklyn Bridge, reducing travel times and removing the entire cantilevered stretch past the Heights. It accommodated four lanes and looked attractive on paper. City officials say it will be as cataclysmic and complicated as Boston’s Big Dig.Which is one explanation for the Department of Transportation’s $4 billion plans. Choice A involved a decade or two of lane closings: total Carmageddon. Choice B turned the Promenade into a six-lane highway for nearly as long.As it happened, both plans were already pretty much shelved before the town hall meeting started. Mayor Bill de Blasio, reversing himself after several months, announced a “panel of experts” would consider alternative proposals.There are a bunch of proposals out there now. One, by a Brooklyn planner named Marc Wouters, envisions erecting a second elevated highway, a temporary parallel bypass, next to the cantilevered stretch of the B.Q.E.City Comptroller Scott M. Stringer has floated a plan of his own to close the B.Q.E. except to trucks, making one level of the elevated roadway a linear park. His likely opponent in the next mayoral race, City Council Speaker Corey Johnson, allying himself with many transportation advocates, wants to replace the cantilevered section of highway with a more modest boulevard and spend the money that would have been used on its repair to improve public transit.Both politicians took to the Plymouth Church podium the other evening. The crowd cheered. But the scheme that provoked the most oohs and aahs came from the architecture firm Bjarke Ingels Group, or BIG, which has an office in Dumbo. Cunningly labeled the BQP, for Brooklyn-Queens Park, BIG’s plan has been quietly circulating among community leaders and transportation officials for a few weeks. It surfaced online and in The Daily News the day of the town hall.The plan moves the elevated B.Q.E. down to little-used Furman Street, which runs below the highway where it skirts Brooklyn Bridge Park. Furman would be widened by cutting into the berm now shielding the park from the highway. The berm, rebuilt, would then slide back over the new road, burying it — at grade — while making room above for the so-called BQX streetcar, if that were ever to happen, and also acres of new parkland.In essence, the elevated expressway would yield to a vast new wash of greenery extending Brooklyn Bridge Park all the way up to the Promenade.The benefits in terms of noise, air quality and open space are abundant. BIG says the disused cantilevers could be turned into more parkland or parking lots, revenue-generating shops or apartments, whatever Brooklynites wanted.Like the Clarke and Rapuano scheme, but for the 21st century, the BQP reframes an infrastructural headache as a civic opportunity. Back in 2011, the New York State Department of Transportation under Gov. Andrew Cuomo, clearly daunted by the challenge, simply fobbed off on the city the failing B.Q.E. — which, as an interstate, was the state’s responsibility. (The state can do that. It does this sort of thing all the time.)Mayor de Blasio then passed along the problem to Polly Trottenberg, the city’s transportation commissioner, who has described fixing the elevated highway as “the most challenging project not only in New York City, but arguably in the United States.”To her credit she has now heard the outcry. She is open to other plans, BIG’s included.There are many obstacles to the BQP and they are formidable. There is an immense sewer line that runs directly below Furman, serving much of Brooklyn.There are venting plants and substations for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority that are in the way.One part of the plan imagines moving a lobby to the third floor of an occupied apartment building because the covered highway would abut the current entrance. Joralemon Street would become a dead end without any obvious place for cars to turn around.The list goes on.Brooklyn Bridge Park costs some $250,000 per acre per annum to maintain. It raises operating funds through private development. Brooklynites have spent years in court contesting even the smallest private incursions into the park. Unless the new parkland were financed differently, the added acreage via the BQP would require the construction of something along the lines of a brand-new 300,000 square foot condo or commercial development.Moses soured New Yorkers on big change. Resistance is the default mode. Whether the challenge is public housing, Hudson Yards, Penn Station or the B.Q.E., City Hall today doesn’t seem to grasp the concept of urban design.The BQP sets a bar at least, which is worth pursuing. The mayor should do more than trust a panel of outside experts to judge what comes over the transom and offer quick solutions. The project needs state and federal buy-in. It requires a proper interagency master planning process, one steeped in community consultation. This takes time. And it can’t be left up to traffic engineers.The crowd at Plymouth Church that arrived to man the barricades departed with the promise of something better.New Yorkers deserve as much.AdvertisementAdvertisement

On June 9, 1999, Google made a pledge to its small but growing number of customers in a blunt 600-word statement. “Google is sensitive to the privacy concerns of its users. The internet allows individuals to explore and communicate with unprecedented ease, but it also allows websites to collect and distribute personal information with equal ease. We at Google know that many users are, understandably, concerned about such practices.”The statement, which today reads like a quaint artifact of a simpler time, would become the company’s first privacy policy — a gently lawyered explanation of how the company collects and distributes its users’ data and information. Google’s was far from the first privacy statement from a big technology business, but it’s one of the first examples of the form from a company that helped lay the foundation for the modern, information-guzzling internet.[As technology advances, will it continue to blur the lines between public and private? Sign up for Charlie Warzel’s limited-run newsletter to explore what's at stake and what you can do about it.]  And it wasn’t only Google that was “sensitive to the privacy concerns of its users.” All of today’s tech giants have made similar commitments.In 2002, the Microsoft founder Bill Gates declared, “Users should be in control of how their data is used.”Three years later, Facebook, through its founder, Mark Zuckerberg, echoed the statement in a note to its campus user base, “We give you control of your information.”Similar statements from countless technology companies have followed in the years since. Over that time, they have said they would like to protect your privacy ...… even as many companies began to collect and display information invasively.Technology companies have also tried to explain all the ways they protect your privacy ...… but the rhetoric was different from reality, where a number of companies experienced hacks and data breaches.Since the early 2000s, companies have argued that despite all the data they collect, you still own it ...… and yet default designs and settings and lax security have long left information vulnerable.Finally, since the advent of concerns about Google and Facebook’s use of personal data for advertising,  companies have pointed out that they don’t sell your data …… and nonetheless many of the companies' business models are predicated on a targeted advertising model that relies on the continued collection of increasingly personal information.It’s been almost 20 years since Google’s first privacy statement. The internet today is a significantly different place, one that’s largely powered by the transmission and transfer of our personal information. Data breaches — some of vertiginous scale — are common, as is the creeping sense that, in order to log on, we’re forced to submit to being tracked and targeted.But if the modern internet has changed greatly, the statements from the multinational corporations that transformed it have remained strikingly similar. The tech companies and their leaders have been saying we should be in charge of our information for 20 years. So why — now, more than ever — does it feel that we aren’t?Charlie Warzel, a New York Times Opinion writer at large, covers technology, media, politics and online extremism.

Technology, financial and real estate companies pitched jobs in sales, engineering, accounting and logistics. A $150,000-a-year salary, said one poster, “isn’t just a dream.” But for many job seekers, it still seemed like one. At one end of the event hall, two dozen candidates sat dejectedly under a banner that read, “Hope you find a good job soon.”“Job hunting,” said Hou Hao, a 28-year-old accountant who could not find a position that matched her previous $2,700-per-month salary, “now feels like being constantly slapped in the face.” China’s slowdown, which has idled factories and construction sites, is rippling through its offices. Educated, white-collar workers are being hit with job cuts and shrinking paychecks. Even big technology companies like JD.com, the online retailer, and Didi Chuxing, China’s answer to Uber and one of the world’s most valuable start-ups, have not been spared. The white-collar job distress suggests the slowdown in China’s economy, the world’s second largest, is broader than official numbers indicate. China increasingly relies on middle-class spenders who are helping to broaden the economy beyond its industrial base. But these consumers are not spending the way they used to, and that lethargy is ricocheting through every part of the economy, from the real estate market to China’s once-thriving tech sector. The slowdown also suggests the government will have a harder time pulling the economy out of its slump. China’s policy tools to kick-start growth — unleashing waves of loans from the state-controlled banking system or building new highways and airports — will not be much help for workers who process insurance claims or enter data into computer systems. Supporting those businesses and workers would require longer-term reforms, like getting state banks to lend more to private businesses or cutting red tape for entrepreneurs. In the past, “by virtue of building a bridge, you could get the economy growing,” said Fraser Howie, co-writer of three books on the Chinese financial system. Now, he added, “there is no obvious catch up, and therefore it makes it all the more important that China makes important, difficult decisions to move forward.”Chinese leaders have acknowledged that creating jobs could be a challenge. During his annual news conference on Friday, Li Keqiang, China’s premier, said that Beijing would make employment for college graduates and laid-off workers a priority this year.China does not disclose reliable jobs or layoff data, so the full impact of the slowdown is not clear. Some surveys show there is still high demand for jobs in certain sectors. But multiple signs point to trouble for other office workers. One measure, based on a survey of services businesses, suggests shrinking employment in a variety of industries. Search results from Baidu, China’s biggest search engine, analyzed by Nomura, the Japanese bank, show the term “job seeking” rose to a high in December. Human resources executives and senior staff at tech firms, property developers and other large private companies described layoffs in recent months of up to 30 percent at some firms involving hundreds of workers, according to a recent survey by the research firm Global Source Partners.On one major job recruitment website, Zhilian, the number of openings across all sectors posted in the fourth quarter fell 10 percent from the same period in 2017. New positions at technology firms and internet start-ups fell 51 percent in the third quarter of 2018 from a year earlier.China’s office workers have suffered during past slowdowns, but cuts now have a broader impact as the country’s economy matures and they become a bigger part of the work force.For workers like Sherry Xu, the weakened job market undermines the basic premise that a college education leads to a more secure future than a factory job. Ms. Xu, a 34-year-old finance professional, attended a prestigious university, and then rose through the ranks of the finance industry. Recently, Ms. Xu was called into a meeting with human resources, right after she finished pitching to a group of potential investors. Her employer, a financial firm, was having a difficult time, she was told. Layoffs would start soon. She would be among them.“The job market isn’t looking good,” said Ms. Xu, who after the meeting accepted a freelance contract with the same firm at half her earlier pay. “I feel this time, it will be harder than ever for me to find a job.”Just a week after Lunar New Year celebrations in China in February, Didi Chuxing, the country’s largest ride-sharing and taxi-hailing service, notified employees that it would cut 2,000 jobs — roughly 15 percent of its work force, according to a person with direct knowledge of the plan, who was not authorized to speak publicly. The cuts would target jobs that are outside the company’s core focus of safety technology, engineering and international operations, employees were told. Chinese news media reports also said Didi was cutting back perks like free snacks and beverages. In a statement, Didi said it would adjust benefits but would not make major cuts without providing specifics. Didi said its benefits were as varied as health care services, meal and transportation subsidies, and corporate gym access. JD.com, the e-commerce company, has started to evaluate employees with the goal of shedding 10 percent of its top executives, it told staff in February. Asked about the cuts, JD.com said it planned to hire 15,000 new employees in 2019. “JD highly values its work force,” Tracy Yang, a spokeswoman, said in a statement. Layoffs, like other economic events, have become politically sensitive, and companies are reluctant to confirm the winnowing of staff. In response to reports that the e-commerce giant Alibaba was planning to freeze recruitment, the company published a statement promising to “hire more talent and increase our investment in talent,” adding that this was important “especially when the economy is challenging.”China’s vibrant tech scene is also facing a cash crunch. Many start-ups are having trouble raising money.Qi Feng started working in sales at Renrenche, the online car platform, nearly four years ago. Mr. Qi and other colleagues were called into a meeting several weeks ago and told to quit, he said. They were offered new contracts that required them to pay $6,000 to the company in exchange for customer data. They could then use the data to sell cars on the platform and pocket the profit. He said he had refused to quit and had been told that he would be fired.“It has a big impact on me,” Mr. Qi said. He has monthly mortgage payments of $400 and a $300 monthly car loan. His daughter is just a year old, he said, and he and his wife take care of their parents. A spokesman for Renrenche said the move was part of a strategy that would make employees into partners. “For those who are not willing to convert into partners, we will handle them properly and according to law,” said Han Di, the spokesman.Qiao Lifeng, a college-educated accountant who left the business briefly to open a restaurant, moved from Heilongjiang Province in China’s far northeast to Shenzhen, in the southeast, two decades ago when the city was at the front line of China’s economic overhauls. He got his first job at the Shenzhen General Talent Market, the same job fair Ms. Hou attended. He slowly worked his way up at several companies as an accountant until two years ago, when he decided to try his hand at building his own business. Now that his restaurant has closed, he found himself back, but the world had changed. “I only started looking for jobs,” Mr. Qiao, 45, said. “It’s very difficult to find a job that suits me.”Alexandra Stevenson is a business correspondent based in Hong Kong, covering Chinese corporate giants, the changing landscape for multinational companies and China’s growing economic and financial influence in Asia.  @jotted • Facebook AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byLet us help you start your day.By Alisha Haridasani Gupta(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. New Zealand investigates how the massacre could have been avoided, China gets a toehold in Europe and Apple prepares to unveil its next big thing. Here’s the latest: Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern ordered an inquiry into whether government agencies could have prevented the attacks at two mosques in Christchurch on Friday that left at least 50 dead.Her cabinet also agreed “in principle” to overhaul the country’s gun laws and will announce reforms “within 10 days of this horrific act of terrorism,” she said at a news conference.The victims: New Zealand’s deputy police commissioner said specialists had worked through the night to identify the people killed at the Al Noor and Linwood mosques. Islamic leaders and victims’ families have been discussing holding a burial for all victims, possibly on Wednesday.The suspect: Our reporter went to the town of Dunedin, home to the suspected gunman, and spoke to people he interacted with, including members of his rifle club.Perspective: Our Opinion section has essays examining the traits white supremacist terrorists have in common and the history of white supremacist violence. At least one gunman opened fire on a tram in the city of Utrecht, killing three people and injuring five more.Officials arrested a suspect — a 37-year-old Turkish-born man — after an eight-hour manhunt, but it’s still unclear whether he was the only person involved in the attack.Authorities said they were looking into the possibility the shooting was an act of terror, with the counterterrorism agency raising its threat assessment to the highest level. They had also ordered the evacuation of all mosques in the city, but it’s unclear if that move stems from a specific threat or as a precaution in the wake of the attack in New Zealand. But they didn’t rule out other motives, and some reports suggested the attack was the result of a domestic dispute.Context: The city of Utrecht has a large immigrant population, with more than 30 percent of residents born outside the Netherlands. The attack took place in the Kanaleneiland neighborhood, home to a large number of Muslims, including immigrants from Morocco and Turkey. This week, President Xi Jinping is expected to arrive in Rome to sign a deal that would make Italy the first Group of 7 nation to participate in Beijing’s global Belt and Road initiative.The deal would open Italy to greater Chinese infrastructure investment in exchange for favorable customs conditions and a faster trade route into the heart of Europe.The vast project is already underway in the port city of Trieste. Construction workers in scuba gear have been laying foundations near the site of a new pier. Other cities up for a transformation include Genoa and Palermo.Concerns: The U.S. and E.U. powers like Germany and France have been wary of Beijing’s Belt and Road project, casting it as an economic and perhaps even military threat.Supporters of the plan in Italy, however, have few reservations, saying the country’s laws protect its autonomy.The kingdom has a history of going after dissidents and other Saudi citizens abroad, but the efforts escalated sharply after Prince Mohammed bin Salman was elevated to crown prince in 2017.The prince authorized a clandestine campaign that included the surveillance, kidnapping, detention and torture of Saudi citizens, according to American officials who have read classified reports about the efforts.Since then, Saudi security forces have detained dozens of clerics, intellectuals and activists who were perceived to pose a threat, as well as people who had posted critical or sarcastic comments about the government on Twitter.Details: At least a dozen missions were carried out by the same team that killed Jamal Khashoggi in October, suggesting that the gruesome murder was part of a broader push, according to officials and associates of some of the Saudi victims.The group behind Mr. Khashoggi’s killing, which American officials called the Saudi Rapid Intervention Group, also forcibly repatriated Saudis from other Arab countries and detained and abused prisoners in palaces belonging to the crown prince and his father, King Salman. Afghanistan: Three months after the country’s soccer chief, Keramuddin Keram, was accused of sexually abusing members of the women’s national team, an investigation has stalled, amid fears it will never proceed.Britain: The speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, warned Prime Minister Theresa May that she could not hold a third vote in Parliament on her beleaguered Brexit plan unless it was substantially different from the proposal already been rejected twice.India: Gauri Lankesh, a journalist who railed against the right-wing Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, or B.J.P., was shot dead in September. We take a deep look at her story and what it reveals about the country’s increasingly intolerant politics.The Philippines: A beached whale died with 88 pounds of plastic trash inside its body, an unusually large amount that brought renewed attention to ocean pollution.#MeToo: Nearly 100 female economists in the U.S. say that a peer or colleague has sexually assaulted them, and nearly 200 say they were the victims of an attempted assault, according to a new survey that reveals deep evidence of gender and racial discrimination in the field.Lyft: The ride-hailing app — and Uber’s main rival in North America — hopes to be valued at up to $23 billion, according to filings ahead of its initial public offering, most likely the year’s biggest.The Prado: As Spain’s national art museum celebrates its bicentennial, our writer — who has visited more than 200 times — returned to every gallery, vestibule and passageway.Apple: The tech giant’s next big product isn’t a new device, but a billion-dollar-plus foray into streaming video. The company is expected to reveal details of the project next week.Spain: A bar in Madrid celebrating the dictator Gen. Francisco Franco and catering to the radical right is run by a Chinese man — an irony that has not gone unnoticed by patrons. “We used to joke to him,” one said. “If Franco was still alive, he would kill you.”Tips for a more fulfilling life.Recipe of the day: Sometimes only a hearty pasta dinner will do, like rigatoni with wilted greens, bacon and a fried egg.We all have rivals in our work lives. They’re our closest competitors — and they can be our greatest allies.Doctors answer questions about the benefits and drawbacks of retinols found in skin-care products.New Zealanders have lit candles, piled flowers and stood vigil since a gunman attacked two mosques in Christchurch, killing at least 50 people.They have also performed the haka.The ceremonial dance originated with the Maori, the country’s indigenous Polynesian inhabitants. Warriors danced to intimidate opponents with grimaces, chanting and aggressive postures. But there are also hakas of welcome and hakas for funerals.The form has been embraced by New Zealanders of all origins, most famously by the national rugby team, the All Blacks. Many schools have haka groups, and every two years, there’s a national competition hosted by one of the country’s iwi, or tribes.A variety of haka have been performed for the Christchurch victims. For instance, a biker group, Black Power, used a warlike haka to express solidarity.Others performed one of the most famous hakas, “Ka mate,” a tribute to life in the face of death.Andrea Kannapell, the briefings editor, wrote today’s Back Story.Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

More everything.Beethoven hardly lacks for exposure, but to mark the 250th anniversary of his birth, in 1770, Carnegie Hall announced on Wednesday that it would go all in, and devote roughly a fifth of its 2019-20 season to his music.All his piano sonatas. All his string quartets. Lots of his chamber music. And not one but two cycles of all nine symphonies: one performed on period instruments, with John Eliot Gardiner conducting the Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique, and another on modern instruments, with Yannick Nézet-Séguin and the Philadelphia Orchestra.“We all feel this is really the pivotal figure in the history of Western classical music,” Clive Gillinson, Carnegie’s executive and artistic director, said in an interview. “Everything he touched, he changed and transformed.”Mr. Nézet-Séguin, who became music director of the Metropolitan Opera this season, will be the subject of a Perspectives series that will give New Yorkers a chance to hear him conduct all three of his ensembles: the Philadelphians, the Met Orchestra and the Orchestre Métropolitain of Montreal. The mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato, the singer-songwriter Angélique Kidjo and Mr. Gardiner will also have Perspectives series, and Jörg Widmann will hold the Richard and Barbara Debs Composer’s Chair.There’s a lot to chew on in the season, which will open Oct. 3 with Franz Welser-Möst conducting the Cleveland Orchestra, and will end June 21 with Daniel Barenboim and the Vienna Philharmonic. So here is a tip sheet, with critics and writers for The New York Times highlighting some of the concerts that intrigue them next season.MUNICH PHILHARMONIC (OCT. 25-26) AND BAVARIAN RADIO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA (NOV. 8-9)ORCHESTRE MÉTROPOLITAIN (NOV. 22) AND ORCHESTRE SYMPHONIQUE DE MONTRÉAL (MARCH 24) The season brings a couple of battle-of-the-bands moments. Most halls would be happy to import a single orchestra from Munich or Montreal, but Carnegie is bringing a pair from each city. So New York audiences will be able to contrast performances of Valery Gergiev conducting the Munich Philharmonic with those of Mariss Jansons leading its neighboring Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra. And they will be able to compare the Orchestre Symphonique de Montréal, under the baton of Kent Nagano, with that city’s lesser-known ensemble, the Orchestre Métropolitain. MICHAEL COOPERAMERICAN COMPOSERS ORCHESTRA, NOV. 13 This ensemble’s reliably excellent taste results in a program that features new orchestrations of Ives songs by Hilary Purrington and Hannah Lash, as well as the premiere of a guitar concerto by Ms. Purrington. Her recent “A Clarion Call” is packed with haunted harmonies and riotous humor that Ives might well have admired. SETH COLTER WALLSIRISH CHAMBER ORCHESTRA, NOV. 19 Unique synergies often develop when an orchestra is led by a composer-performer. In his collaboration with the Irish Chamber Orchestra, Jörg Widmann, as conductor and solo clarinetist, serves up a meticulously balanced program with compositions that showcase his debt to Bach (“Versuch über die Fuge”) and rock (“180 beats per minute”) alongside works by Mendelssohn, Weber and Mozart’s own Bach-flavored Adagio and Fugue in C minor. CORINNA da FONSECA-WOLLHEIMCONRAD TAO, NOV. 20KIRILL GERSTEIN, FEB. 20IGOR LEVIT, MAY 5 A great way to refresh repertory staples is to perform them alongside new and recent works. The brilliant young pianist and composer Conrad Tao offers a particularly bold example of this approach in his solo recital at Weill Recital Hall, which fascinatingly juxtaposes the old (Bach, Rachmaninoff, Schumann) and the new (David Lang, Julia Wolfe, Jason Eckardt). At Zankel Hall, the formidable Kirill Gerstein will play unusual works by Liszt, Brahms and Gyorgy Kurtag steeped in Hungarian dances and folk song, as well as pieces by Haydn, Busoni, Bartok (the flinty, seldom-heard Piano Sonata), Thomas Adès and, to end, Schubert’s exuberant “Wanderer” Fantasy. Igor Levit will join Carnegie’s Beethoven salute in Stern Auditorium with Sonatas No. 9, 10 and 11, and the still-astounding “Hammerklavier.” ANTHONY TOMMASINISO PERCUSSION, DEC. 7 The program for this virtuosic and often mind-opening quartet, “A Century of Percussion,” is something of a greatest hits concert. They will revisit pieces like David Lang’s “the so-called laws of nature,” Steve Reich’s “Music for Pieces of Wood” and John Cage’s “Third Construction.” But the evening will also include the local premiere of a new work by Julia Wolfe. JOSHUA BARONEORCHESTRE RÉVOLUTIONNAIRE ET ROMANTIQUE, FEB. 19-24 There is hardly a shortage of recordings of Beethoven’s symphonies, but the one I inevitably turn to is John Eliot Gardiner’s vigorous, colorful, altogether vital cycle with this period-instrument ensemble. After a pair of crack Berlioz performances at Carnegie this past fall, this team is surely ready to put the old Ludwig van through his paces. ZACHARY WOOLFETHE CROSSING, MARCH 25 Such is their radiant sound and the vibrancy of the repertory they’ve cultivated, it’s gotten to the point I’d hear anything this Philadelphia vocal ensemble sings. At Carnegie they’ll join the cellist Maya Beiser, whose charismatic cross-genre experiments have seductive savvy, in the New York premiere of Michael Gordon’s “Travel Guide to Nicaragua.” ZACHARY WOOLFEBOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA, APRIL 15 After presenting Act II of Wagner’s “Tristan und Isolde” at Carnegie last spring, the Bostonians will be back, under the baton of Andris Nelsons, for Act III. These two concerts are a test drive for the tenor Jonas Kaufmann, who has been gradually rolling out his Tristan. (Other cast members include Emily Magee as Isolde and Günther Groissböck as King Marke.) JOSHUA BARONEQUATUOR ÉBÈNE, APRIL 17-MAY 2 Even outside of anniversary years, cycles of the Beethoven string quartets mushroom all over the concert landscape. But this French ensemble, known for its passionate and rigorous playing, is sure to bring something special to its six-concert survey in the spring. Do stick around for the encores, which these players use to shoot off in unexpected directions with improvised takes on folk music, jazz or the Beatles. CORINNA da FONSECA-WOLLHEIMTIMO ANDRES, APRIL 29 Aaron Copland’s mid-20th-century Piano Sonata is the oldest work you’ll find in this solo recital, which features a wide range of pieces by contemporary composers like John Adams, Donnacha Dennehy and Frederic Rzewski — and, of course, Mr. Andres himself. Later in the evening is a premiere from the young composer Gabriella Smith. JOSHUA BARONEMAURIZIO POLLINI, MAY 17 There’s enough Beethoven this season to last a lifetime, but it’s a lifetime of Beethoven that Mr. Pollini, 78 years young, will bring to this performance of the final three piano sonatas. There’s no artist I’d rather hear play this music. DAVID ALLENVIENNA PHILHARMONIC, JUNE 19-21 Poor Mahler, with just six performances of his symphonies next season at Carnegie. I wouldn’t want to miss Michael Tilson Thomas conducting the Sixth in his farewell performance at the hall before stepping down as music director of the San Francisco Symphony (March 18), but Daniel Barenboim has a peculiar, productive way with these scores that makes these concerts more promising than the norm. He leads the Fifth, Seventh and Ninth. DAVID ALLENAn earlier version of this article misstated who will sing the role of Isolde in the Boston Symphony Orchestra’s concert of Act III from “Tristan und Isolde.” It will be sung by Emily Magee, not Michelle DeYoung.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayBy Jill CowanGood morning.(Here’s the sign-up, if you don’t already get California Today by email.)Yesterday was another busy news day in California. A historically wet winter helped officially end a more than seven-year drought, and fallout from the college admissions fraud investigation continued to spread: Students spurned by universities allegedly involved have begun to sue, saying they unwittingly participated in a process rigged against them.[Here are answers to all your questions about the scandal.]But today, we wanted to dig into the Los Angeles contemporary art scene. Jason Farago, a critic for The New York Times, recently made his way west for a piece exploring L.A.’s place in a global art ecosystem. He wrote about how he approached an expansive landscape: It’s almost a rite of passage for a New York Times art critic to be sent to Los Angeles to take the temperature of the city’s museums and galleries, and to pronounce whether the second-largest city in America has “caught up” to our hometown. As long ago as 1956, one of my predecessors wrote that “spectacular myths hover with the smog over Los Angeles obscuring the considerable progress this city has made in terms of the arts during the last few years.”So when my editor and I sat down to plan my recent story on contemporary art in Los Angeles, timed to the West Coast debut of London’s Frieze Art Fair, we set ourselves some ground rules. No clichés of L.A. as a dream factory of endless sunny days. No cooing over allegedly cheaper rent, which has become a myth of its own. Even the go-to jokes about traffic no longer made sense now that the New York subway has buckled into chronic dysfunction.Over a week in Los Angeles — plus a few days in Palm Springs, scoping out the sculpture of the Desert X biennial — my priority was to assess the city on its own terms. I visited just about every museum and gallery from Brentwood to Boyle Heights.I had coffees with museum directors and beers with recent M.F.A.s, whose local concerns dovetailed with global artistic ambitions. Plunked in the middle of it all were two new art fairs — Frieze, held on the Paramount backlot, and Felix, staged in the guest rooms and cabanas of a Hollywood hotel — that were the first to draw a global audience to Los Angeles after years of false starts. (My colleague Jori Finkel had a report from the fairs.)Surveying any city’s art scene, let alone one as diverse as L.A.’s, is a game of omissions. With more space I’d have covered stalwart galleries like Regen Projects, in Hollywood; newer ones like Château Shatto, downtown; and nonprofits like Art + Practice, Mark Bradford’s space in South L.A.The collector base is growing, though it remains small relative to the city’s wealth. Alternative spaces like the Underground Museum, the Cabin, and Bel Ami are doing very good work.The city’s boosters want critics to tell you that Los Angeles is now the center of the contemporary art scene. But the truth is that no single city can lead the way in producing the art of our time. Los Angeles, like every large city, is now a constituent of a global art system, where none of us is insulated from the flows of money and images. That may not be a satisfying conclusion, but at least it gives us the space to understand this wonderful city as it really is.(We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

Instead of forceful action against the likes of Facebook and Google, they say, the F.T.C. leans on rules that make it hard to impose penalties bigger than rounding errors for the companies.Those critics have an unusual champion: Joseph J. Simons, the man running the agency.“We have this over 100-year-old statute that is our main authority,” Mr. Simons said in his first sit-down interview since becoming chairman 10 months ago. “And clearly legislators who approved that were not thinking about data security and privacy issues.”In the deregulatory era of the Trump administration, Mr. Simons, 60, a Republican lawyer who has jumped between the public and private sectors for more than 30 years, is a rare voice for strengthening the government’s hand.Mr. Simons has urged Congress to expand the F.T.C.’s privacy-enforcement powers and allow it to impose fines more easily, write new rules and hire more experts. He also says the agency should police how all companies and nonprofits — not just technology companies — collect and handle people’s digital data.But none of those changes will happen before Mr. Simons must make the most anticipated decision on data privacy in the agency’s history. In the coming weeks, he and the F.T.C.’s four other commissioners are expected to conclude an investigation into whether Facebook violated its promises to protect people’s data.The outcome of the case is seen as a referendum on the government’s ability to rein in tech giants that have amassed incredible wealth and power from collecting and bartering user data.“The F.T.C.’s decision on Facebook will be highly consequential, for the F.T.C. and Facebook, for the tech industry, and for consumers,” said David Vladeck, who led consumer protection at the agency during the Obama administration. “The commission’s action will set the bar.”The case has taken on huge significance in Washington, where Facebook has become Exhibit A for an industry accused of a wide range of problems, from enabling foreign election interference to crushing competitors.A rising chorus of Republican and Democratic lawmakers has criticized the F.T.C. for not restraining the companies’ data-collection practices, which are central to some of their businesses. The agency’s biggest penalty on a tech company was a $22 million fine imposed on Google in 2012, for misrepresenting how it used some online tracking tools. Google reported $50 billion in revenue that year.On Friday, Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who is running for president, announced a sweeping plan to strengthen regulations against big tech companies.“The F.T.C. has been a disappointment with its lack of enforcement in the past, which for Facebook and Google has amounted to a slap on the wrist,” Senator Josh Hawley, a freshman Republican from Missouri, said in an interview. Mr. Hawley investigated Google for competition violations when he was a state attorney general.The Facebook investigation is focused on whether the social network violated a 2011 consent decree in which it promised to protect user data and inform users of changes in how their data was used. The inquiry started last March under Mr. Simons’s Republican predecessor, Maureen Ohlhausen, after a report in The New York Times revealed that the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica had analyzed the data of 87 million users without their permission.The agency is considering imposing a multibillion-dollar fine on Facebook as well as new requirements to strengthen protections on how data is collected and shared, according to two people close to talks between the agency and the company. The two sides have discussed a possible settlement for weeks, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing.Facebook declined to comment about Mr. Simons and the investigation. The social network has defended its actions, saying that when it learned a researcher violated its terms of service by giving user data to Cambridge Analytica, it demanded that the data be destroyed and was promised that it had been.On Wednesday, the company announced plans to shift to a more privacy-focused platform. Mark Zuckerberg, the company’s chief executive, said Facebook would invest in encrypted communications and refashion its messaging tools to emphasize private conversations.Mr. Simons declined to discuss the Facebook case. And he was even guarded about his own use of technology. He would not say whether he used Facebook or two other popular apps owned by the company, Instagram and WhatsApp. He doesn’t use other social media like Twitter, he said; aides write the tweets from his official F.T.C. account.“I don’t even know how to access my account,” Mr. Simons said.His comfort zone is antitrust regulation, a major focus for the F.T.C. and an area in which he has worked for most of his career. In his meticulous office, Mr. Simons keeps handy a worn Yale Law Journal with red plastic tabs on antitrust articles. He has had six of its authors speak at the F.T.C. since he arrived.In one of his first actions as chairman, he held hearings on updating merger reviews and antitrust enforcement in the digital age. In late February, he announced a task force of 17 antitrust staff members to study potential problems that could arise from past tech mergers.“In antitrust, you want to focus on areas where there is likely to be market power or monopoly power,” Mr. Simons said. “So it is not unreasonable to look at big digital platforms and say, well, that might be an ripe area to look at.”He is new to the world of data privacy and admits he is cramming to understand it, immersing himself in articles and grilling staff about data protection. But that, he said, allows him to bring a “fresh perspective” to privacy enforcement.“I am willing to look at everything with a fresh eye, and to question long-held beliefs and assumptions,” he said.The F.T.C. monitors whether companies like Google, Uber and Facebook break promises written into privacy policies. But it can’t directly fine a company for a first-time offense; it can only charge a company with deceptive or unfair business practices, which the agency must prove in court. The potential penalty against Facebook could reach billions of dollars because the case hinges on whether it violated a previous settlement.Mr. Simons argues that the agency needs more direct authority to oversee privacy practices and fine companies. He says it is too hard to prove to a court that someone has been harmed by a company’s unauthorized use of their data.“It’s important that we get civil penalty authority,” he said. “For companies that have lots of money, the impact would be sufficient to deter them.”Privacy groups say the agency has missed numerous opportunities to punish companies with its existing powers. Many compare the commission with European regulators, which have levied hefty fines on Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple for violating antitrust, privacy, tax and security laws.Some privacy advocates are also concerned about Mr. Simon’s inexperience in the area, saying it requires a deep understanding of complicated technologies.“I don’t think he understands the dimensions and implications underlying the consumer privacy threat,” said Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group.Mr. Simons said there were obvious differences between how the United States and Europe viewed privacy.“The E.U. has this strong sense of the right to be forgotten,” he said. “We don’t have that. We have the opposite of that. We have the First Amendment.”And he said the details of how the government handled digital privacy should be for lawmakers, not him, to sort out.“Privacy involves very important societal and cultural values that really need to be determined by the Congress,” Mr. Simons said, pointing toward Capitol Hill, less than a mile up Pennsylvania Avenue from his office.“Not,” he said, “by unelected F.T.C. commissioners.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Chris Stanford(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning,We’re covering Parliament’s latest rejection of Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal, Lyft’s public trading debut, and a plastic bag ban in New York State. It’s also Friday, so there’s a new news quiz.Lawmakers today again refused to endorse Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan to withdraw Britain from the European Union.After two previous rejections, the vote leaves Mrs. May’s deal in ruins and adds further confusion to the country’s politics, just two weeks before the scheduled departure date.What’s next: The defeat appears to leave the increasingly weakened prime minister with two unpalatable options in the short run: Britain can leave the bloc on April 12 with no deal, a chaotic and potentially economically damaging withdrawal; or Mrs. May can ask European leaders — who have ruled out a short delay if her plan failed — for what could be a long postponement.Shares of Lyft, the ride-hailing company, opened for trading today at $87.24, above the public offering price of $72. At the I.P.O. price, Lyft had a market value of over $24 billion, making it one of the most valuable American companies to go public in the last decade.What’s next: Among those expected to follow in Lyft’s footsteps are its main rival, Uber, as well as the digital pinboard company Pinterest and the messaging platform Slack. Beyond cementing the place of the companies in people’s lives, public trading would unleash a new wave of wealth in the tech industry. Here’s a look at who stands to get rich.A lawsuit filed on Thursday accused members of the Sackler family, who own the maker of the opioid painkiller OxyContin, of systematic fraud. The suit also includes major pharmaceutical companies that distributed alarming amounts of prescription painkillers during a rising abuse epidemic that has killed hundreds of thousands of people across the U.S.The state is seeking, among other goals, to claw back money that it says was transferred from the Sackler-owned Purdue Pharma to private or offshore accounts in an effort to shield the assets from litigation.Response: A spokesman for the Sackler family called the allegations “a misguided attempt to place blame where it does not belong for a complex public health crisis. We strongly deny these allegations, which are inconsistent with the factual record, and will vigorously defend against them.”“After three years of lies and smears and slander, the Russia hoax is finally dead,” Mr. Trump declared at a rally in Michigan on Thursday, his first since the end of the special counsel’s investigation. “The collusion delusion is over.”Mr. Trump took particular delight in ridiculing Representative Adam Schiff, Democrat of California, who faced calls from Republicans on Thursday to step down as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. (He didn’t.) Related: The still-secret report submitted last week by the special counsel was more than 300 pages long, the Justice Department has acknowledged. Attorney General William Barr, who released a four-page summary of the report last weekend, has indicated that redacting the report for classified and grand jury information will most likely take weeks.Closer look: Mr. Trump points with pride to last year’s economic growth and promises even faster growth to come.

(Watch live on NASA’s website.)One of the two astronauts, Christina Koch, was originally paired with Anne McClain for what was supposed to be the first all-female spacewalk. It was canceled after Ms. McClain found that the available spacesuit was too roomy, a safety issue that raised questions of sexism.That made us think about the media coverage of women in space. In 1963, the cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova, 26, became the first, orbiting the Earth aboard the Vostok 6. She is now 82 and a member of Russia’s Parliament.“Soviet Blonde Orbiting as First Woman in Space” was a headline in The New York Herald Tribune’s European edition, which reported: “Valentina — or Valya, by which she is known to her friends — seemed to wipe away the gloom of Moscow’s gray skies.”That’s it for this briefing.

As Mr. Barr put it, a lot “of people wonder how such huge behemoths that now exist in Silicon Valley have taken shape under the nose of the antitrust enforcers.” And since taking office, President Trump has repeatedly attacked America’s biggest technology corporations, especially Amazon, Facebook and Google. Among other accusations, he has charged Amazon with ripping off the Post Office and Google with  censoring conservative users. He recently criticized Facebook, Google and Twitter for “ridiculous” bias in favor of Democrats. By most appearances, Mr. Trump is a foe of big tech.Mr. Barr, however, will find that those “huge behemoths” will continue to dominate, because, in part, the administration’s chief antitrust enforcer is their champion. On top of granting tech platforms huge windfalls in his tax reform law, Mr. Trump appointed a friend of big tech, Makan Delrahim, to lead the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. Mr. Delrahim has consistently promoted the interests of the biggest tech companies.While we believe Mr. Delrahim, a veteran corporate defense lawyer and antitrust official in the George W. Bush administration, was correct on the merits in trying to stop the AT&T/Time Warner merger, that action was an outlier. In a Senate hearing in December, he boasted that he “strengthened” the Justice Department’s amicus brief program as a means of reshaping antitrust law. In its briefs, which represent the views of the federal government as an expert in antitrust law and are influential in court, the department has supported legal interpretations that would make Amazon, Google, Facebook and other dominant firms more powerful. On top of looking into possible procedural improprieties between the president and Mr. Delrahim, Congress should demand an explanation for — and put a stop to — Mr. Delrahim’s under-the-radar effort to revise antitrust law.In the most prominent case, Apple v. Pepper, the Supreme Court will decide, any day now, whether ordinary Americans can hold tech platforms accountable. The Antitrust Division filed briefs siding with Apple. (Our organization, the Open Markets Institute, filed an amicus brief in support of Pepper.) In its briefs, the Justice Department argued that iPhone users should not be able to sue Apple for monopolizing the sale of iPhone apps. Although the text of federal law grants everyone (consumers, workers and businesses) the right to sue antitrust violators for damages, the Justice Department is seeking to restrict private citizens’ ability to hold corporate power to account. In contrast, a bipartisan coalition of 31 states filed a brief endorsing the right of all consumers to obtain compensation and be made whole.The Justice Department took an even more radically pro-monopolist position in a lower court case. In Viamedia v. Comcast, the Seventh Circuit in Chicago is now deciding whether Comcast, which both operates and competes in the clearinghouse for TV advertisements in Chicago and Detroit, illegally monopolized this clearinghouse when it blocked Viamedia, an ad management company. Through such “refusals to deal,” monopolists can suppress emerging competition or extend their dominance into new markets.The government advised the court to adopt the 2013 ruling by Judge Neil Gorsuch, then on the 10th Circuit, in Novell v. Microsoft, which broadly insulates a monopolist from the charge that it improperly cut off rivals’ access to a good or service they need to compete. Under Novell, if someone sues a monopolist for refusing to deal with competitors, the conduct is illegal only if the monopolist “sacrificed profits” in the process and that its sole effect was to hurt competition. This standard would make stopping “refusals to deal” virtually impossible.The Antitrust Division’s position in Viamedia is especially helpful to Google and Facebook, whose core services are free to users. Consider Facebook’s 2013 decision to cut off users’ friend lists from Vine, a video streaming app launched by Twitter. Thanks to Facebook’s move, users of Vine could not invite friends to join the app. Under the standard endorsed by the Justice Department, Facebook would be protected from legal liability for stifling Vine unless an antitrust enforcer could show that Facebook sacrificed profits in this predatory act. Because Facebook does not charge users, this would be a tall order for the government, excluded rivals and injured consumers.Along with these pro-monopoly briefs, the Antitrust Division’s leadership has publicly expressed almost uncritical admiration for technology giants. Disregarding both congressional intent in enacting the antitrust laws and the latest evidence on the economic and political harms from corporate concentration, our top antimonopoly enforcers have been fawning over monopoly.Mr. Delrahim and his deputies routinely praise the biggest tech companies and adopt their legal rationalizations. In a speech in Mexico City in November, he asserted on the basis of little evidence that “market power is a motivating factor for investment in a free-market economy” and disparaged rules to protect competitive markets as akin to “breaking a man’s leg to make him run faster.” Mr. Delrahim recently hypothesized that “large digital platforms have grown because they provide innovative and disruptive services that consumers seem to like and want to use” and expressed nationalistic pride in the dominant tech platforms being American. Contrary to these claims, however, actions by the European Commission and documents published by Britain’s Parliament indicate that the tech platforms have used abusive practices to maintain and extend their power.In December, Andrew Finch, the Antitrust Division’s principal deputy assistant attorney general, contended that “consumers often benefit from concentration” and dismissed calls to break up or regulate tech platforms as “drastic.”The division dresses up its actions in the rhetoric of humility. In a June 2018 address, Barry Nigro, a deputy assistant attorney general at the Antitrust Division, said that when enforcing antitrust law, “First, we should do no harm,” and warned, “we should be wary of trying to prescribe the correct path forward.”Yet, as the Justice Department’s top antitrust enforcers proclaim humility and practice restraint when it comes to monopolies, they do not extend this courtesy to elected officials. Cities and states seeking to structure markets through the democratic process can expect hectoring, not humility, from the department.The Justice Department has, to the benefit of Uber and Lyft, interfered with municipal efforts to improve the lives of ride-hailing drivers. These drivers, on average, earn less than the local minimum wage in many places. In November 2017, the Department of Justice (as well as the Federal Trade Commission) filed a brief against Seattle’s law granting collective bargaining rights to ride-hailing drivers.The Justice Department has also weighed in on the legality and wisdom of state rules on, for example, the practice of law. In a statement of interest in a case challenging a Florida bar’s rule, the Antitrust Division paid tribute to “new competition from mobile platforms that can profoundly change an industry.” This type of free-standing policy lecture voices a hostility to democratic market structuring and is outside the division’s statutory duty to police corporate cartels, mergers and monopolies.When trying to understand the Trump administration’s position on tech monopolists, ignore Mr. Trump’s tweets and look to what his antitrust enforcers do and say. Mr. Trump’s antitrust chief is hindering the ability of federal, state and local governments and the public to tame the power of tech giants. Instead of this deference to corporate power and condescension to our elected representatives, the department should be confronting monopolies in tech and elsewhere and respecting the policy choices of state and local officials.Matthew Buck is a reporter-researcher with the Open Markets Institute.

But as an investor, he has zero doubts about the business potential of the $2.1 billion “mystical services market.” It’s an area that he has been trying, unsuccessfully, to invest in for nearly two decades.Mr. Birnbaum researched lots of astrology start-ups in the Web 1.0 era but concluded then that they were not good investments. “They were pretty much just marketplaces sending traffic off to random astrologers,” he said. “They were definitely shady.”This year he finally backed one: Sanctuary, an app that can be described as “Uber for astrological readings.” For $19.99 a month, you can receive a monthly one-on-one chat consultation with an astrologer. (The app also provides free daily horoscopes.)Mr. Birnbaum’s decision to back a horoscope company through Five Four Ventures, the incubator he runs, “gets a lot of grins” from people in the finance world, he said. But they get it. Astrology is having a cultural moment, and for investors, that translates to dollar signs. In recent years astrology traded its psychedelic new-wave stigma for modern Instagrammy witch vibes, and those vibes are very popular with millennial women. This means there’s money to be made. Start-ups — professional, non-shady ones with interesting business models — are bubbling up, eagerly raising funding from people like Mr. Birnbaum.A few weeks after Sanctuary became available for download, Co-Star, an app that lets people download and compare their birth charts, raised just over $5 million in funding from the Silicon Valley venture capital firms Maveron and Aspect Ventures, as well as 14W, based in New York. Co-Star’s website promotes the fact that astrology allows “irrationality to invade our techno-rationalist ways of living.” The app has been downloaded more than three million times. Its Instagram account has more than 400,000 followers.Banu Guler, the chief executive and co-founder of Co-Star, said not every investor she pitched was enthusiastic about her company and that some dismissed its practice area as pseudoscience. “I get that you’re not into astrology,” she said, “but if you had access to a 20-something or teenager who is a girl, that’s who you need to talk to.”A third app called Pattern is spreading among finance and Hollywood types; it is founded by Lisa Donovan, the co-founder of Maker Studios, which sold to Disney for $675 million. Ms. Donovan said she hasn’t raised a formal round of outside funding yet.Ms. Guler, a Scorpio with Cancer rising and moon in Leo, believes Co-Star can be “really big.” Bigger than the dozens of horoscope blogs or online shops selling crystals and tarot cards. Maybe even bigger than meditation apps, one of which was recently valued at $1 billion by investors.Meditation, Ms. Guler said, is an antisocial way of interacting with the world. She views astrology as a form of collective wellness, with Co-Star helping people relate to each other based on star signs. Another big difference between astrology and meditation’s practitioners: Astrologers are not allergic to making money.Co-Star is free, but users can pay $2.99 to compare their chart to that of a friend who isn’t a member. This is where the relating comes in. They can answer questions like, “Why did we get into that insane fight and why did you shut down?” Ms. Guler said. “Is it because you’re a Capricorn Mars? Maybe. So let’s talk about it.”Anarghya Vardhana, a partner at Maveron and a Libra, said Co-Star has the potential to be as big as Spotify, the music streaming app worth $24 billion, or Tinder, the ubiquitous dating app owned by Match Group.“It probably has this aura of being unscientific or whatever,” Ms. Vardhana said. But Ms. Guler “did a really good job of understanding all of that and rooting it in as much science as possible.” Co-Star promotes its use of artificial intelligence and data from NASA to track movements of the stars.Ms. Guler emailed a university psychology program asking if they’d take M.R.I. scans of people while using the app to learn about how people are reacting to it. She got no response. “Having money will help with that,” she said.The casual observer might attribute astrology’s surging popularity to the stereotype of the narcissistic millennial. Of course the selfie-loving nanoinfluencer generation is eager to hear that they’re unique and special, no matter how woo-woo it seems. Horoscopes are a more personalized version of BuzzFeed-style identity content that’s designed to be relatable and shareable: “17 Things That Only People Named Jennifer Will Understand” or “28 Signs You Were Raised By Persian Parents In America.”“What’s better than something that is basically a story about you?” Mr. Birnbaum said.But that explanation ignores what many in the astro-verse consider the major turning point for Big Zodiac: The election of Donald Trump. It changed everything, according to Aliza Kelly, the astrologer-in-residence at Sanctuary. (She writes its horoscopes and conducts some of its readings.) Watching The New York Times’s forecast needle tip from Hillary Clinton to Mr. Trump raised people’s doubts about certain scientifically proven systems, Ms. Kelly said. “People became so much more receptive to the idea of there being different ways of seeing the world,” she said. They turned to astrology “in order to create some sense of structure and hope and stability in their lives.”President Trump’s election inspired Ms. Guler to leave her work in fashion media and create Co-Star. “I was like, ‘We gotta figure out something more meaningful than what we are doing,” she said. The role social media played in the election — and how “it is changing how we operate as humans in the world” was a part of her concern, Ms. Guler said.Investors see other trends feeding into astrology’s resurgence, Ms. Vardhana said. People are seeking smaller, specialized communities online, while participation in organized religion is declining. Millennials (and the rest of us) are lonely and want community, no matter how many followers we have on social media. Why wouldn’t we turn to the stars and moons and planets and houses of the horoscope?“This is a phenomenon and maybe astrology and the technology of Co-Star is well equipped to address it,” Ms. Vardhana said. The challenge, she said, will be converting more mainstream skeptics without “alienating the astro-nerds.”A few minutes into my reading on Sanctuary’s app, Ms. Kelly, my on-demand astrologer, asked me if her assessment of my birth chart rang true. According to her interpretation, last year was a very important year for me to redefine my values. As a Libra rising, my relationships are very important to me, she noted. And in the next few weeks, I should put myself out in the world to make connections :).“Sure!” I typed into the app. It was just vague enough that if I did a little mental backbend, I could find examples to support her conclusions. I felt hesitant to share anything too personal about myself with a stranger until I remembered that by entering the date, city and precise time of day I was born, I had already bared my soul, astrologically speaking.Sanctuary’s in-app readings are bite-size, designed to answer a specific question or dilemma. Sometimes, Ms. Kelly said in an interview, you just want to know why someone is being a jerk, “or how you can best navigate that dynamic. You don’t need to talk about ancestral trauma.”Ross Clark, Sanctuary’s chief executive, co-founder and a Leo, estimates that there are 100,000 self-employed astrologers in the country. Sanctuary is starting with around 30, who Ms. Kelly and the Sanctuary team has helped vet and train on the company’s reading system. He emphasized the app’s live one-on-one connections. “We’re not trying to be some sort of spiritual Alexa, where we’re using AI to replace someone,” he said. “If you think about the practice, it’s really emotional.”The apps create a shortcut to intimacy. Armed with purported knowledge of your peers’ personalities, conversations can skip over the polite get-to-know-you small talk and dive right into the ancestral trauma. In that way it doesn’t even matter that the science is actually fake. It creates a self-fulfilling prophecy where perceived intimacy leads to real intimacy. Later, when I interviewed Ms. Kelly, she mentioned that this was a good story for me, a Pisces, to be doing.Why? Because, she said, Pisces are spiritual healers and emotional philosophers. “The quest for spiritual awakening and enlightenment is what Pisces energy is all about,” she said. “It’s in your blood.”It felt like a convenient conclusion, given her company’s interest in getting me to write a story. Then again, who was I to argue with the stars? With my blood? It felt absurd, but also just satisfying and amusing enough that I did not reject the suggestion. Instead, I said, “Sure!”Erin Griffith reports on technology start-ups and venture capital from the San Francisco bureau.

But it hit the Sundance Film Festival with full force only in January, when Charlotte’s Web, a leading purveyor of the substance — the Uber of CBD, if you will — hosted a three-day party, lines out the door, in a converted store and restaurant on Main Street in Park City, Utah.It was envisioned by the seven brothers behind the company: Josh (43), Joel (39), Jesse (37), Jon (36), Jordan (34), Jared (32) and J. Austin (27), all with the last name Stanley. Five of them were attending Sundance with their proud mother, Kristi Stanley Fontenot, 65, hosting screenwriters, film editors and the like dressed in casual sweaters, jeans and snow boots, at panel discussions on the future of cannabis and alternative healing and at parties serving CBD-infused cocktails.One night there was a $175 10-course dinner. All the dishes, including the cured black cod to the hazelnut chocolate crunch cake, contained Charlotte’s Web CBD. Thomas Pierce, a 32-year-old film producer and C.E.O. of an entertainment marketing agency, was among those bingeing on the offerings. “I attended a private dinner for 50, a happy hour event with CBD beer and tacos, and a late party sipping on delicious CBD cocktails,” Mr. Pierce said. “I was in my happy place.”Josh Hetzler, a producer of “Before You Know It,” a film premiering at Sundance, worked with Charlotte’s Web to distribute CBD to his entire cast and crew. The brothers were running around the space, letting their personalities shine.Josh Stanley, the eldest and nerdy one, roped guests into technical, scientific discussions about CBD. “We use liquid chromatography to test all the levels of the cannabinoids in the field,” he told this reporter. “We perfected the art of the oxymoron. The whole plant is standardized.” (A 30-something woman nearby was overheard telling her friend that he looked like the lead singer of a boy band.)Joel Stanley, the chairman of the company, ran around handing out necklaces that carried bottles of their farms’ soil and taking selfies. He slicked his hair back for the occasion and proudly wore a fluffy gray-and-white-checkered wool sweater. “My brother bought them for all of us in Mexico City,” he told a group congregated around him. “I don’t know why my brothers aren’t wearing theirs.”J. Austin, the youngest, was there with his boyfriend, Mitch Clough. (They live together in Denver and have a dog named Little Arthur Weasley.) He kept coming up to his mother, hugging her and making fun of her for how much she was loving Sundance. “He’s the fun one,” she said.Jon, the bearded one (though he has shaved since), mostly hung out at a table with his fiancée, Katie, holding hands and savoring the food. And at a party later Jared was drinking cocktails with his mother at a wooden table at the back, shyly surveying the scene.While their personalities differ, they all agreed on one thing: They hated the larger-than-life banner of all seven of them posing on the hemp farm hanging on the wall of the party.“I think most of us are intimidated by it,” Josh said. “We tried to take it down. We can’t handle it.”“I think we are a marketer’s dream because we have a family dynamic,” Joel said. “They feel like we’re a great big sandbox. We’re, like, O.K. …”“It’s kind of crazy,” J. Austin said. “I’m the wallpaper for a Sundance party.”There were more guests at the party than in the brothers’ entire hometown.They described growing up in poverty in a tiny community named St. Louis, Okla., which has a current population of 158. The four eldest were raised in a two-bedroom trailer with no drinkable water. Even when they moved into a larger house, they said, five boys shared one bed — a water bed with no headboard or frame, just a mattress. (They also have four sisters, Jennie, 41, Joy, 29, Julee, 23, and Jensyn, 21, who aren’t involved in Charlotte’s Web’s daily operations, though Julee worked in customer service the first few years and Jennie is an investor in the company.)Nick Ferguson, 35, who has known the Stanley family since he was in fifth grade, said almost every time he goes to a bar or restaurant with one of the brothers now, a stranger approaches them.“They are a good-looking group of dudes, girls have always taken notice,” Mr. Ferguson said. “But now even guys will come up and say, ‘Are you one of the brothers?’ Sometimes they just want to say hi, but other times they want to talk at length about Charlotte’s Web and my buddy has to say, ‘I’m trying to have dinner with my friends right now.’”Kristi Mahaffey met Rich Stanley through a mutual friend. They were students at Kansas State University and married less than a year from the date they met. “He was very charming and very, very charismatic,” she said. “He kind of had this Tom Selleck look that was hard not to fall for.”Mr. Stanley was committed to Christianity and God (less so his sales job, which he was continually quitting), so they moved to St. Louis to help grow a Southern Baptist church. With four children and one on the way, all they could afford was the two-bedroom trailer. Mrs. Fontenot said she had to drag all the children to the church every morning to collect drinkable water.Her mother, Signa Mahaffey, whom the family calls Gammy, helped them move into a three-bedroom home in nearby Shawnee. There, five more children were born. They had tap water, but often couldn’t afford to pay the electricity bills. “It would get turned off, and Mom would tell us it was campfire time,” Josh Stanley said. “We would get so excited and pull out the candles and roast the marshmallows.”Jordan remembered how stressful it felt when the car broke down constantly. Jesse asked to be dropped off blocks from school because he was embarrassed by that same car. As a 5-year-old Jared collected pennies to buy gallons of milk because his brothers told him it would fill him up like a meal.At the film festival, Josh was joking with his mother about how many younger siblings he has. “I am a professional diaper changer,” he said. “I can whip up a formula. I can even nurse.” The first child was named Joshua David, from the Bible. For the next one, a girl, they couldn’t decide if they should name her Jennie or Danny. “The coin chose Jennie, and it set the J names in motion,” Mrs. Fontenot said.The brothers fought growing up (and still do). “Josh and I have broken each other’s noses,” Joel Stanley said. At the dinner, Joel was laughing at Josh for being long-winded. Josh was making fun of Joel’s outfit.If the boys wanted to do anything special, like go on a ski trip with their youth group, they had to raise their own funds. They started a yard-raking business by putting up signs all over town that said, “Rake your yard the easy way. Hire me.” Jared Stanley was particularly skilled at selling candy bars door-to-door, even going into office buildings. “He must hold the world record,” Mrs. Fontenot said.Josh Stanley remembers using money he made from a paper route to buy pillows from a thrift store so he could sleep on the floor instead of the crammed bed. “One day I just had enough,” he said.“When I was 13, Joel was 18, and he was basically working full time while a senior in high school,” said Mr. Ferguson, the family friend. “Even though I was young I remember thinking that was a sacrifice.”He never met Rich Stanley, who left in 1997 when the youngest child, Jensyn, now 21, was a year old. He is now 66 and living in Denver, where he works as an Uber driver. The sons generally talk about him respectfully if coolly. Still, they rented him a home when they made enough money, and on the phone Rich Stanley said he is a loyal customer. “I use Charlotte’s Web five to six times weekly,” he said. “It has made a noticeable difference in my cognitive thinking and in my joint health.”In 2007, Kristi married Steve Fontenot, an oil-drilling consultant. But by that point, the boys were on their way to forging their own fortune.In 2010, Josh asked his mother to come with him to look at office spaces in the Denver area. Since college he had been working with developmentally disabled children in group homes. He had read up on medical marijuana, and he wanted to open his own dispensary. His mother’s distressed reaction: “Pull the car over right now.”She later read papers on the topic and then slowly got on board. It wasn’t like the family was oblivious to marijuana. “Josh definitely did pot growing up in high school,” Mrs. Fontenot said. “I knew he was doing it, but it wasn’t disruptive, and I was so busy having babies.”Josh moved into the warehouse so he could work on his project full time, sleeping on a sleeping bag on the floor. But at the time there was no medical marijuana bill. There was only one constitutional statute, the one he operated on, that said one caregiver could grow six plants for one patient. By Josh’s own account, he was serving tens of thousands of people. “I knew that is not what the law intended,” he said. At one point the governor’s office called Josh’s lawyers in, and, as Josh recalled, said that he had beaten the system for now but would be in handcuffs soon. Josh responded by starting the first 501c4 in Colorado to lobby for a medical marijuana bill. Luckily for him, Bill 10-1284 passed in 2010, helping pave the way for regulated medical marijuana sales.One day he arrived at the dispensary to find protesters, many from a right-wing Christian coalition group holding signs saying Jesus was against him. No banks would lend him money.At the time, Joel was in Texas working for an oil company. Jon was traveling the world. Jordan was in Colorado clearing the forests for fire prevention as a chain saw operator. Jared was working at a bar. Jesse was playing basketball at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs. J. Austin was still in high school.One night, most of them were in Denver for a concert by John Prine, a country folk singer-songwriter. They gathered at their mother’s house and listened to Josh lay out his vision and arguments. Everyone except J. Austin (still in high school) joined Josh’s endeavor.At that point Joel assumed the role C.E.O. of the company. Most growers of cannabis at the time were searching for strains that contained high percentages of THC, the extract that makes people high. But the Stanleys were searching for plants that contained more CBD, the extract that purportedly heals. They crossbred multiple varieties to get one that contained 22 percent and named the products derived from it after their first patient, Charlotte, a little girl with Dravet syndrome, a very rare and destructive form of epilepsy that caused her to have hundreds of seizures. The brothers were still focused on medical marijuana as a business, but that changed in August 2013 when CNN’s Sanjay Gupta did a special on their success with Charlotte. Fifteen thousand families reached out to them in the next month, they said, and the company decided to focus on CBD. Charlotte’s Web was born.According to the company, sales have tripled every year since 2015. It currently ranks No. 1 in the world for sales of hemp-based CBD, according to New Cannabis Ventures, an information platform focused on the cannabis industry. In September, in Canada, the company raised $100 million in an I.P.O. There is nothing sexy about the Charlotte’s Web lab in Boulder, Colo. It’s a factory operation, filling up to 50,000 bottles of CBD oil a day. In the lobby there are framed signs attesting to the company’s quality control. The most fun part is a little plaque with a pig on it that Charlotte’s Web’s bank made for it to celebrate the I.P.O. There aren’t even pictures of the good-looking brothers.But this will probably change soon.In December the 2018 Farm Bill passed in the United States Congress, legalizing CBD across the United States. As long as it contains less than 0.3 percent THC, and therefore doesn’t get you high, you can grow it, cultivate it, charge for it, even ship it across state lines (there are some restrictions for quality control. Also, some places are declaring where it can be distributed. New York City, for example, just took away the right of food vendors to sell it.)“The moment the 2018 farm bill passed, I knew it was the moment to join Charlotte’s Web,” said Eugenio Mendez, who left his job as global vice president of marketing of water, enhanced water and sports drinks at Coca-Cola to become Charlotte’s Web chief growth officer.While Charlotte’s Web isn’t legally allowed to declare any medical benefits, the company said it gets hundreds of letters a week from people saying it works for Parkinson’s, lupus, PTSD and opioid withdrawal. There are people giving it to their pets. Then there are the casual users, people taking oil at parties to prevent hangovers the next day. Others take it in the morning, because they believe it keeps them calm, alert and feeling good. Some think it helps with anxiety and insomnia.Mr. Hetzler suggested his film crew try it to ease the physical pain of making a movie. “I remember being approached by one of our crew members after a long day of rigging lights and moving gear,” he said. “He told me the CW balm worked incredibly well.”It’s a strange reality when the same product is being used for both life’s biggest medical challenges and to prevent hangovers. But that’s where we are with CBD, said Dr. Rachna Patel, the author of “The CBD Oil Solution,” who began prescribing medical marijuana in 2012. “Typically the way it works is you have a medicine, there is research done on it, scientists figure out what it works for, then people use it,” she said. “It’s the opposite with CBD. People are using it, and then they are like, ‘It works for this,’ and now science needs to study it.” CBD may be hype. It may be placebo. It may be a miracle cure. Legislation could shut it all down at any moment. But in the current culture, the Stanleys have a huge advantage.Since the beginning of 2018, Charlotte’s Web has experienced a 60 percent growth in sales online. The product is now found in 3,700 stores across the United States. The company is forecasting revenue growth of $120 to $170 million in 2019, up from $15 million in 2016.Each brother has contributed something different to its success. “One of the best public speakers I’ve ever heard in my life is my older brother Josh,” Joel said. “When we have a TED Talk, we may write the content, but he gives it. Jesse is one of the funniest people I’ve ever met in my life. He’s hilarious, but he’s also creative so he does the marketing. Jon is the dead sexy one. Jon, Jordan, they take on the grunt of planting, learning how to deal with pests, teaching the farmers what to do. Jared is the most valuable operator. He should have been Forbes 30 under 30, but now he’s too old. He’s the one that does all the scaling. J. Austin, he handles scheduling, opportunities and events. Everyone loves him.”And each has his own vision of how to use his new wealth. Jon, who is engaged and expecting his first child, wants to learn a new language. Jared, married with a 4-year-old, has bought his first home. J. Austin, who has a long-term boyfriend, had his eyes on a Toyota F4 Cruiser but instead bought an Infiniti. Jordan, married with two children, dreams of sharing his land with the community by throwing some kind of outdoor events. Josh, divorced with one child, owns a vacation property in Costa Rica. So does Jesse Stanley (still single!). Joel is busy keeping track of his three children, all with different hobbies, who travel between his house and that of his ex-wife.Charlotte’s Web next plans to build a tourist destination where fans from all over the world can interact with the product. Like at the Guinness Factory in Dublin or the Avery Brewery, five miles from Charlotte’s Web’s lab, people will be able to learn about CBD, try it out and see how it is made. But please don’t have the misapprehension this will be some kind of Stoned-henge.“Not everyone wants to be strung out,” Joel said. “I know I don’t.”An earlier version of this article misspelled, in two instances, the given name of one of the Stanley sisters. She is Jennie, not Jenny.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Inyoung Kang(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning,We’ve got breaking news on two continents today, a crisis at the southwestern border, and a new Brexit deadline.The WikiLeaks founder faces one count of conspiracy to hack a computer related to his role in the 2010 release of classified U.S. documents, according to court documents unsealed today shortly after his arrest in London. He was arrested at the Ecuadorean Embassy, where he had lived since 2012, after Ecuador withdrew the asylum it had granted him.President Lenín Moreno of Ecuador said that his country had decided to stop sheltering Mr. Assange after “his repeated violations to international conventions and daily-life protocols.” The background: After WikiLeaks released the classified material in 2010, Mr. Assange, 47, took refuge in the embassy two years later to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he faced questions about sexual assault allegations. He is also suspected of aiding Russian interference in the 2016 election by releasing material stolen from the Democrats.The country’s military ousted President Omar al-Bashir today, ending a 30-year authoritarian rule in the face of mass street protests.Mr. al-Bashir, 75, is accused of war crimes and is wanted by the International Criminal Court in connection with genocide in Darfur, where hundreds of thousands were killed. He was taken into custody, the government was dissolved and the Constitution suspended, the defense minister said.Some of the protesters called for caution while awaiting a statement from the military.“The uprising continues,” a spokeswoman said, adding that they would continue “until there is a complete step down of the whole regime.”Go deeper: Mr. al-Bashir liked to play up his humble origins to project a folksy image that contrasted with his image in the West, where he was often seen as a heartless warmonger.There had been warnings for years that America’s immigration system was on the brink of failure.That moment may have arrived: The country is now failing to provide either necessary humanitarian relief or basic controls on the number and nature of who comes in.By the numbers: At the current pace of nearly 100,000 migrants a month, officials say more than a million people will have tried to enter the country in a 12-month period. The flow of migrant families has reached record levels — as many as 27,000 children are expected to arrive in April.Voices: “Infectious disease is everywhere,” a Border Patrol union leader said. “It’s dangerous for our agents. It’s dangerous for the detainees that don’t have anything.”William Barr said on Wednesday that the government had surveilled Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, and that he was preparing to review “both the genesis and the conduct” of that inquiry. “I think spying on a political campaign is a big deal,” he said.Mr. Barr also offered more details of the Russia investigation by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, adding that he hoped to release the redacted report next week.Yesterday: The Treasury Department declined to immediately give President Trump’s tax returns to Congress, saying it needed more time to assess the lawfulness of the request. Here’s what we might learn from the documents.Looking ahead: Gregory Craig, a White House counsel during the Obama administration, is expected to be indicted on charges related to his work for Ukraine, his lawyers said. The case stemmed from an investigation initiated by Mr. Mueller’s office.As companies and governments gain new abilities to follow people across the internet and around the world, the costs and benefits of technological advances are becoming clearer.The Times is beginning a project to explore the debate around those changes.See for yourself: What do you think should be private?

The analysis, and other projections from outside the White House, suggests that the shutdown has already weighed significantly on growth and could ultimately push the United States economy into a contraction.While Vice President Mike Pence previously played down the shutdown’s effects amid a “roaring” economy, White House officials are now cautioning Mr. Trump about the toll it could take on a sustained economic expansion. Mr. Trump, who has hitched his political success to the economy, also faces other economic headwinds, including slowing global growth, a trade war with China and the waning effects of a $1.5 trillion tax cut.That’s a total of $200 million in unpaid wages each workday.To blunt the shutdown’s effects, the administration on Tuesday called tens of thousands of employees back to work, without pay, to process tax returns, ensure flight safety and inspect food and drugs. But some people involved in the shutdown discussions in the White House have privately said they anticipate that Mr. Trump will grow anxious about the economic impact in the coming days, accelerating an end to the stalemate. Others close to the president believe Mr. Trump has leverage and are encouraging him to stand by his demands.For now, the White House shows no signs of being ready to relent, and Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, continued to blame Democrats for the economic damage.“Congress needs to look at the harms that we’re talking about,” Mr. Hassett said, “and address them.”Mr. Hassett said on Tuesday that the administration now calculates that the shutdown reduces quarterly economic growth by 0.13 percentage points for every week that it lasts — the cumulative effect of lost work from contractors and furloughed federal employees who are not getting paid and who are investing and spending less as a result. That means that the economy has already lost nearly half a percentage point of growth from the four-week shutdown. (Last year, economic growth for the first quarter totaled 2.2 percent.)Mr. Hassett, attempting to illustrate the pain caused by the shutdown, said on Tuesday that one of his furloughed staff members had begun driving for Uber to make ends meet.Mr. Trump has demanded that Democrats, who control the House of Representatives, include $5.7 billion for a border wall in any measure to fund the government. Democrats have refused and, along with some Republicans, have tried to persuade the president to reopen the government and negotiate border security afterward. The House has passed several bills to fund parts of the government, including the Internal Revenue Service, that are not related to border security. Senate Republicans have declined to schedule votes on those bills.On Tuesday, in an effort to try to splinter the Democrats’ opposition, the White House invited several House Democrats from districts Mr. Trump won to discuss a path forward. None showed up.The impasse has left 800,000 federal employees furloughed or working without pay, along with throwing thousands of government contractors at least temporarily off the job.Mr. Hassett said it was possible that the damage could grow. He also said much of the damage should be repaired once the shutdown ends and workers get back pay. But he acknowledged that the shutdown could permanently reduce growth expectations if businesses and markets begin to expect that Congress and the president will repeat the experience again and again.Some economists have begun to warn that such a situation is likely and that economic confidence could be undermined as businesses, consumers and investors lose faith in the ability of political leaders to find agreement on issues like raising the federal debt limit and approving trade deals.That lack of confidence could snowball into a self-inflicted economic contraction on the heels of what appears to have been the nation’s strongest year of growth since the 2008 financial crisis. Financial markets are already highly volatile amid concerns about the trade fight with China, slowing global growth and signs of weakness in American housing and manufacturing sectors.“The economy could easily stall in the first quarter, and then the question is what happens in the second” if the shutdown persists, said Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. “The longer it goes on, the longer it takes to recover.”The longer the federal government remains closed for business, more services are affected.If the shutdown continues through the end of March, Mr. Shepherdson said in a research note, he would expect the economy to shrink in the first quarter. While federal workers are likely to receive back pay once the furlough ends, most government contractors will not, and the longer spending is depressed, the higher the risk that the businesses they run or patronize will fail, Mr. Shepherdson said.The shutdown “is threatening to derail this economic expansion,” Bernard Baumohl, the chief global economist for the Economic Outlook Group, said in a research note on Tuesday. Its effect on federal workers’ spending plans is particularly worrisome for the automotive and housing markets, which were already showing signs of trouble before the shutdown, he said.On Tuesday, a Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey showed weakening manufacturing activity in the United States, the latest in a line of similar warnings. Economists at JPMorgan Chase called the data an early indication of additional slowing in the sector, adding that the shutdown was probably hurting business sentiment.Michael L. Corbat, the chief executive of Citigroup, told analysts on Monday that “right now, we see the biggest risk in the global economy as one of talking ourselves into a recession.”With no end in sight, federal workers appear ready to seek alternate employment before things get worse.The online jobs site Indeed analyzed job search behavior from mid-December through mid-January for workers at some affected federal agencies, including the I.R.S. and Transportation Security Administration. It found clicks on job listings rose at least 17 percent for each of those worker groups over that period, a sign that employees affected by the shutdown “are searching for jobs more right now than they usually do at this time of year,” said Martha Gimbel, Indeed’s director of economic research.“With the shutdown occurring in a tight labor market, many workers have other options, and they seem to be trying to take advantage of them,” Ms. Gimbel said. “If the shutdown leads to a loss of talent for the federal government, it could be harder for it to compete for new hires in a labor market this tight.”That might already be happening inside the White House. Mr. Hassett said on Tuesday that a prospective new hire had told the council that he might turn down the job he had been offered out of graduate school because the government is unable to bring him onto the payroll.Maggie Haberman and Julie Hirschfeld Davis contributed reporting.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ellen RosenIf you’ve been worrying that drones would be filling the skies over your head, dropping packages off day after day at your neighbor’s house, leaving food on doorsteps or photographing your every move, you can relax a little. At least for now.The hype over commercial drones is, so far, largely just that. One of the people who contributed to that hype was Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder. In a “60 Minutes” interview in December 2013, he predicted that deliveries by drones could become commonplace within five years.The fifth anniversary of Mr. Bezos’s prediction has come and gone, but widespread deliveries by drone are not yet a reality, neither by Amazon nor by any other company.Regulatory thickets, technical complexity and the public’s skittishness have proven to be formidable hurdles. At a minimum, the unresolved issues include whether it is safe to allow drones to fly beyond a pilot’s visual line of sight, to operate at night and to fly over people.But that doesn’t mean there’s likely to be a drone-free future. And maybe there shouldn’t be.Test programs around the world that use the technology for lifesaving pharmaceuticals as well as for food and even coffee are attempting to prove that delivery by drones is not only safe, but efficient and environmentally sound.Several companies, including Zipline, which is distributing blood by drone in Rwanda, and Swoop Aero, an Australian company that is dispensing vaccines and other medication on Vanuatu in the Pacific, are focused on medical needs.Others are turning their sights on consumers, hoping drones can be part of the answer to helping small businesses compete with behemoth retailers — or even helping the big guys keep their competitive edge.Ultimately, says the analyst Colin Snow, whether for sunscreen or sushi, the “big question is whether it makes economic sense to do ‘last mile’ delivery by drone. Some studies say yes, while others say no.”Chinese aviation administrators, for example, have already approved drone deliveries by the e-commerce giant JD.com and delivery giant SF Holding Co. But in the United States, it will depend on whether regulators eventually allow drone companies to have autonomous systems in which multiple aircraft are overseen by one pilot and whether they can fly beyond the vision of that pilot. Current regulations do not permit multiple drones per operator without a waiver. Operators like Wing, the drone-delivery company owned by Google parent Alphabet, have that capability.But the immediate economic return isn’t clear yet. According to the chief executive of Wing, James Burgess, “scale doesn’t concern us right now. We strongly believe that eventually we will be able to develop a delivery service for communities that will enable them to transport items in just a few minutes at low cost.”The company, whose drones can now travel round trip up to 20 kilometers — just over 12 miles — is participating in various stages of testing on three different continents. Its first pilot program is in a suburb of Canberra, Australia, where it is working with local merchants to deliver small packages, including over-the-counter medicine, as well as food. The Australian regulators have issued a permit to allow one pilot to operate up to 20 drones at a time with virtual oversight.“We’ve tried to keep expectations to a minimum and stayed humble. We didn’t have a lot of preconceived notions,” Mr. Burgess said. The Wing drone is a hybrid that includes, yes, wings for horizontal flying, as well as miniaturized propellers — like a helicopter’s — that allow for hovering over a destination. Somewhat surprisingly, the most popular item ordered in the Australia pilot is coffee, which can be received — still hot — in as little as three minutes from the time the order is placed.This spring, the company will begin a new trial in Helsinki, for which it is soliciting views as to what should be delivered.Mr. Burgess also said that, separate from drone tests, the company and others were working on a so-called unmanned traffic management system. Akin to virtual air traffic controllers, the system will be designed to permit multiple aircraft — manned and unmanned — to fly safely in the airspace simultaneously. Wing is also one of several companies participating in a pilot program in Virginia. As with its testing in Finland and Australia, Wing will focus on the delivery of consumer goods, including food.The Virginia site, in Blacksburg, near Virginia Tech, is one of 10 chosen by the Federal Aviation Administration as part of its Unmanned Aircraft Systems Integration Pilot Program.The 10 were culled from 149 applications from “state, local and tribal governments,” agency spokesman Les Dorr said in an email. Those in the industry didn’t apply directly, but could show their interest, he said, and more than 2,800 companies responded.Wing and Uber are two of the companies participating. But Amazon’s Prime Air division is not among those testing its technology. In a statement issued when the 10 locales were announced last May, the company said, “While it’s unfortunate the applications we were involved with were not selected, we support the Administration’s efforts to create a pilot program aimed at keeping America at the forefront of aviation and drone innovation.”Amazon’s Prime Air is, however, part of a consortium of companies participating in the European Union’s test of drone deliveries in Belgium.A number of smaller drone companies are involved in testing programs elsewhere. North Carolina has partnered with Silicon Valley-based Matternet and Zipline to deliver essential medical supplies and laboratory samples. In addition, Israeli start-up Flytrex, which is already delivering goods by drone in Reykjavik in partnership with online Icelandic retailer AHA, will focus on food in Holly Springs, N.C., a fast-growing suburb of Raleigh.Those in the industry, not surprisingly, say that the response from residents has been positive. A Pew Research Center survey in December 2017, however, found that 54 percent of Americans disapprove of drones flying near homes; 11 percent support drones, while 34 percent favor limits on use.Part of the reluctance, some say, is concern about privacy and sound. As a result, local governments are trying to educate their residents about drone operation. Noise levels are comparable to dishwashers and cars driving nearby, according to a report by Flytrex.Privacy concerns are in part alleviated by ensuring that drones do not have forward-facing cameras capable of photographing those on the ground.While the F.A.A. has chosen the 10 pilots, the programs still need to apply for agency waivers because they will fly beyond the visual line of sight, fly at night and fly over people, fundamentals not allowed under current law. The agency is seeking comments on expanding permissible uses under current law; it is also testing to evaluate the parameters of regulation.As a practical matter, this means that some of the pilot programs are not yet operational as they await F.A.A. approval.That’s O.K., said James Pearce, a spokesman for the North Carolina Department of Transportation, which prefers to ensure that the drones can safely fly and that those on the ground are not exposed to any risks, including those that are self-inflicted. “We need to make sure that people know not to try to grab the drones.”The F.A.A. is making quarterly visits, said Aaron Levitt, the assistant director of engineering for Holly Springs, N.C., and a drone enthusiast. He recently spent several days on a site visit with agency representatives as they prepared for the first phase, which will permit 15 restaurants to send orders to a local athletic complex, and planned for a later phase when the drones will fly beyond the line of sight.While the deliberate pace may seem slow, Mr. Levitt, like others interviewed, remains sanguine. “It’s like the red flag laws when cars began to populate the roads. You had to have someone walking ahead with a flag to warn others. That’s where we are today with drones — not being able to fly beyond the visual line of sight is like not allowing a car to drive faster than a person can walk.”While the companies, F.A.A. and local governments test the capabilities and limits, there’s another factor that comes into play. Unlike traditional car or truck deliveries, battery-operated drones don’t rely on fossil fuels for their short flights. A 2018 study in the journal Nature found that electric drones were “far more efficient than trucks, vans, larger gasoline drones, and passenger cars,” when comparing for distance traveled. And though the study found that benefits may be reduced once the electricity used for recharging and warehousing was factored in, drones clearly have less environmental impact than a one-item delivery by car.The environmental benefits are real, Mr. Burgess said.Or, as Yariv Bash, the chief executive of Flytrex said: “Now, you’ve got a guy driving a one-ton car bringing a half-pound hamburger. It’s crazy.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byThousands gathered in Los Angeles to honor the rapper, who was gunned down in his neighborhood. By Jennifer Medina, Jose A. Del Real and Tim ArangoLOS ANGELES — The coffin, adorned with white and violet flowers, sat center stage. Three large photographs of the slain rapper were projected overhead on giant television panels, rendered in hues of pink and blue. A thick wall of flowers, a piano, and a harp on stage softened the atmosphere of the cavernous sports arena.Choking back tears as they danced, family, fans and hip-hop luminaries gathered on Thursday in Los Angeles to honor Nipsey Hussle, the rapper who was gunned down in South Los Angeles last month. The bittersweet memorial to a local hero melded deeply emotional tributes with arena-filling musical interludes from his debut album.“This is a celebration. The marathon continues,” shouted DJ Battlecat over the loudspeaker before the beginning of the service at Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles, which included Hussle’s family along with prominent figures like Stevie Wonder, Snoop Dogg and YG. Before the service began, Hussle’s voice boomed from the speakers and thousands of fans sprung to their feet to sing along, the bass shaking the ground, giving the event the feel of a concert.The outpouring reflected the depth of admiration for Hussle, who incorporated his upbringing and experience as a gang member into his music, which spoke powerfully to many who live in the city’s poorest neighborhoods and well beyond. As his musical success propelled him in recent years, Hussle funneled investments to the South Los Angeles streets on which he had grown up, earning devotion from fans, neighbors and local leaders. Hussle’s Marathon Clothing store became a potent symbol of black entrepreneurship and was transformed into a makeshift memorial last month after Hussle was gunned down outside its doors over a “personal dispute,” according to the Los Angeles Police Department. The majority of mourners at the event were African-American and Latino, largely in their 20s and 30s, many wearing the famous “Crenshaw” shirts that were sold in Hussle’s store. Members of the Eritrean community wore traditional clothing, some adorned with national flags. As the service drew to a close, a D.J. played several songs from Hussle’s album, including “Hussle & Motivate.” Attendees danced and sang along, some chanting Hussle’s name as they left the arena toward the procession, which ran through Watts, Inglewood and South Los Angeles. Here are more highlights from the day.Before performing at the funeral, the musician Stevie Wonder called for stronger gun regulations. People nodded along in the audience as he spoke.“It is a heartbreak to again lose a member of our family. It is a heartbreak because it’s so unnecessary,” he said. “It is so painful to know that we don’t have enough people taking a position that says: Listen, we must have stronger gun laws.”“It is unacceptable,” he added, in what was the most overtly political speech during the memorial. “It is almost like the world is becoming blind. I pray that we will grow and that the leaders who have responsibility to perpetuate life will do it by making sure that the laws will make it very hard for people to have guns and take their frustrations out to kill life.”After his remarks he performed the song “Tears in Heaven.”In a tribute, Snoop Dogg said that he and Hussle were drawn to each other like magnets. He said that other up-and-coming artists often promise that “I’ll make you a million dollars.” Not Hussle; he knew his talent was about more than money: “He was a visionary.”“Nipsey’s line was, ‘Hey homey, listen to my music, just give it a listen,’” Snoop Dogg recounted. “I didn’t grow up with Nip, in the neighborhood, but I watched him grow up in front of me.”He praised Hussle for the unifying role he played in a culture sometimes marred by gang violence. “We’re going to respect another man from another neighborhood when he comes from where we come from,” Snoop Dogg said. “You are a peace advocate, Nip. That’s what you are.”The service all but stopped the hip-hop world on Thursday. While some West Coast rappers took the stage to speak about Hussle’s life and enduring message, others sent their own emotional condolences. Jay-Z, whose company Roc Nation managed Hussle in recent years, wrote in a statement printed for the funeralgoers: “You were a curious soul who was evolving at a speed that was truly inspiring. The seeds you have planted are already bearing fruit.”Kendrick Lamar, another local Los Angeles hero, in his own letter recalled touring with Hussle in 2009. “Casually I would go out to the crowd and listen to the substance he spewed on stage. Thinking to myself, this is the type of talent I want to be a part of,” he wrote. “I watched a young, ambitious black male orchestrate fellowship amongst the men around him on that tour.”And Drake, who was set to perform in London on Thursday, posted a photo of himself watching the service to Instagram. “Sent off like a king and rightfully so,” he said. “Sending our love from across the world.”Before entering Staples Center, many fans stopped to take pictures in front of a black armored truck that Hussle owned. The “all money in” truck was used for promotions and became a fixture outside his clothing store. The truck was treated like a piece of public art, positioned in the middle of a closed-off street, surrounded by fencing and plainclothes security guards. Kathleen Gonzalez, 20, said that what she remembered most about Hussle was how he treated everyone — “a homeless man, an average man, a man without papers who was here illegally.” “He gave everyone the same praise he received,” added Ms. Gonzalez, a therapist who works with special needs children in South Los Angeles. “Nowadays it’s really rare to see that.”Even as the city came together on Thursday to mourn Hussle, she said her community was on edge over the threat of more violence. “Being from that part of the city, it’s something you keep in mind,” she said. “Nipsey wouldn’t want that.” Some mourners came from far away. Ron Solomon flew in from Atlanta on Wednesday night and went straight to Hussle’s shop in Crenshaw. “Everything he lived is what I believe in, too,” he said. “Uplifting his people. Not letting the system beat us.”The N.B.A. all-star James Harden, of the Houston Rockets, and DeMar DeRozan of the San Antonio Spurs also came to mourn Hussle. They wore white to honor their friend and fellow South Los Angeles native and entered with somber faces, not speaking to anyone.President Barack Obama sent a letter praising Hussle, which Karen Civil, a hip-hop media personality, read at the service. Mr. Obama said that he had heard Hussle’s music through his daughters. “While most people look at the Crenshaw neighborhood where he grew up and see only gangs, bullets and despair, Nipsey saw potential,” the former president wrote. “He saw hope. He saw a community that even through its flaws taught him to always keep going.” Angelique Smith, Hussle’s mother, stood up to the microphone dressed entirely in white, with a tulle veil covering part of her face. She spoke at length of her own spiritual beliefs, calling on Hussle’s ancestors to “lead him on his journey.” “I have perfect peace,” she said. “I am happy, I am complete. I am strong, and if I can feel this way, so can you.”With the help of Hussle’s father, Dawit Asghedom, who was at her side, Ms. Smith named several ancestors by name and led mourners in a call and response. She spoke of a deep spiritual connection to her son, using his given name of Ermias. “He’s intelligent. He’s radiant. He’s a superhero,” she said.Lauren London, Hussle’s longtime partner and mother of his 2-year-old son, also took the microphone in a white dress. She quoted what Hussle had often told her: “The game is gonna test you. Never fold. Stay 10 toes down. It’s not on you, it’s in you, and what’s in you they can’t take away.”By midafternoon, hundreds of people had gathered in the streets along Crenshaw and Slauson, outside the clothing shop where Hussle was killed. The funeral procession snaked 25 miles through South Los Angeles, a last lap through the neighborhood where he grew up and is beloved. Todd Lavergne, who grew up in the neighborhood and does equine therapy for children throughout the city, sat on his horse at the intersection. Mr. Lavergne, 45, said he wasn’t even a fan of Hussle’s music: “I’m an elder.” But he still came to pay homage, underscoring Hussle’s reach.“He represented the community and wanted to help the community,” he said. “To give them something to do, to keep their minds busy.”Even the manner in which Hussle was killed was seen by some as a final message to the community, to keep up the push for peace that Hussle had worked so hard for. Darlene Young, who has a soul food catering business and was driving for Uber in South Los Angeles on Thursday, said that God had, “brought him home in a way to show the violence in the streets.” She continued, “if you read the Bible, you have a time to live and at time to die.”Reporting was contributed by Walter Thompson-Hernández in Los Angeles and Joe Coscarelli and Niraj Chokshi in New York.

And it wants them (and only them — got that, teens?) to try vaping instead.“For smokers. By design,” blares the company’s website. A new $10 million TV ad campaign, called “Make the Switch,” echoes that theme, featuring testimonials from ex-smokers, all comfortably above the legal smoking age, who have swapped their cigarettes for a Juul.This benevolent-sounding mission — helping nicotine-addicted adult smokers switch to something far less likely to kill them — is Juul’s new pitch, and the way it hopes to rehabilitate its image as one of Silicon Valley’s most problematic start-ups.You can’t fault Juul for trying. The company, which is valued at $38 billion, has been through the wringer lately, with regulators, public health advocates and concerned parents accusing it of fueling an epidemic of teenage nicotine addiction by marketing to young people with fruit-flavored pods, colorful youth-filled ads and social media campaigns. It has been sued by users and lambasted by lawmakers, and the Food and Drug Administration, which is investigating whether Juul’s marketing practices deliberately targeted underage users, conducted a surprise inspection of the company’s headquarters last year. (In November, Juul announced it would shut down its Instagram and Facebook accounts, and stop selling most flavored pods in stores.)Adding to the concern is that last month, Juul took a $12.8 billion investment from Altria, the tobacco giant behind Marlboro and other popular brands, in exchange for 35 percent of the company.Now, after making billions of dollars and joining forces with Big Tobacco, Juul is billing itself as a public-health crusader.Juul is far from the first company to attempt a humanitarian makeover. Facebook, an outgrowth of a Harvard student’s juvenile attempt to quantify the attractiveness of his classmates, now claims to have been motivated by a virtuous impulse to connect the world; Uber, created by two tech entrepreneurs who wanted to zoom around San Francisco in luxury cars, later tried to convince people that it wanted to provide affordable mobility to the masses.But in Juul’s case, revisionist history is particularly important, because the way Juul markets itself is central to the question of how it should be treated. Many consumers, investors and ethical technologists would rightly shun a company that knowingly targeted minors with harmful products, and cleaned up its act only after public pressure. But if you believe that Juul had a noble anti-cigarette mission all along, it’s easier to excuse its missteps as the product of innocent naïveté.Unfortunately for Juul, plenty of evidence suggests that the company didn’t always take its public health agenda so seriously.In 2015, in an interview with The Verge, Ari Atkins, a research and development engineer who helped create the original Juul, said that “we don’t think a lot about addiction here because we’re not trying to design a cessation product at all.”He added that “anything about health is not on our mind.”In other early interviews, James Monsees, Juul’s co-founder and chief product officer, played down the idea of a public health mission.“We’re not an activist company,” he said in a 2014 interview. “If you don’t like what we’re making better than cigarettes, then have a cigarette, that’s fine.”In an interview the next year, Mr. Monsees called Juul’s predecessor, a tobacco vaporizer known as Pax, “the dystopian future of tobacco,” and said the company’s vaporizing technology might someday find a market beyond cigarette smokers.In a statement this week, Mr. Monsees said the company had been forced to be careful about its marketing. Under federal regulations, the company is allowed to bill its device as a “switching product” for smokers, but not as a smoking cessation tool or a health device. He said that while Juul “initiated campaigns in the past that we would not do today,” it was always focused on eliminating cigarettes.“Since 2005, we have been focused on creating a product to help people switch away from smoking combustible cigarettes — the number one cause of preventable death in the world,” Mr. Monsees said. “That focus has been clear in the key milestone moments in the creation of the company — it is what we said in our 2005 Stanford graduation thesis and our first fund-raising letter in 2007.”Juul’s founders did, in fact, talk about improving health as a motivating factor early in the company’s existence. In a 2007 email sent to potential investors, Adam Bowen, Juul’s other co-founder, mentioned wanting to “offer a new alternative for health-conscious smokers.” The pair’s graduate thesis presentation, delivered while they were studying at Stanford in 2005, pitches vaping as a healthier substitute for cigarettes.But Juul’s public marketing told a different story. Few of the company’s early ads made any mention of cigarettes’ risks, or advocated for smokers to switch; most were focused on playing up vaping’s cool factor. As recently as 2017, the front page of the company’s website said nothing about switching from cigarettes at all, only that the Juul offered an “intensely satisfying vapor experience.”Recently, Juul — now equipped with an army of lobbyists and a slick communications team that includes a former White House spokesman — has studiously revamped its image. Glossy profiles have been written about the company’s “lifesaving mission” and Juul’s new chief executive, Kevin Burns, has gotten on message, emphasizing the company’s focus on adult smokers.This abrupt about-face has drawn skepticism from critics. Matthew L. Myers, the president of the antismoking advocacy group Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, characterized Juul’s new ad campaign as little more than a P.R. effort aimed at lawmakers and regulators.“Juul has engaged in all the traditional tactics of a company that is trying to fend off meaningful regulation, rather than actually change their behavior,” Mr. Myers said. “That is classic Big Tobacco.”For all the hand-wringing, no one is suggesting that Juul’s nicotine pods are less healthy than cigarettes, or that the company should stop marketing itself as a smoking alternative. There’s every reason to believe that vaping is significantly less harmful than smoking, and many adult smokers have in fact used Juul’s products to help them quit.But motives matter. And Juul’s shifty self-presentation suggests that the company may not be acting entirely on the level.Juul wants you to believe that it became a teenage sensation entirely by accident, that its products were only ever meant for adult smokers and that taking billions of dollars from Big Tobacco is consistent with the values of a company that has always put a priority on health over profits.The truth is much hazier than that.Kevin Roose is a columnist for Business Day and a writer-at-large for The New York Times Magazine.

It kicked in Oct. 1 and is causing vacationers to rethink their summer travels and stirring anxiety among the homeowners who rely on them.The fallout over the 11.6 percent tax has inserted New Jersey into a broader debate as states and communities grapple with the explosive growth of the online home-sharing economy. A patchwork framework of local ordinances has failed to keep pace with the rapid rise of Airbnb, the largest home-sharing site, which was valued at $31 billion two years ago and has upended the rental market around the world.Much like Uber’s dominance has caused a regulatory challenge for cities and Amazon’s ascent has prompted states to adopt internet sales taxes, the popularity of Airbnb has begun to push lawmakers to impose new rules even as they find ways to tap the enormous revenue it generates.Massachusetts also recently passed a statewide tax on short-term rentals aimed at Airbnb and other home-sharing sites; a proposal to increase the sales tax on similar rentals has been introduced in Colorado.In New York City, Airbnb and local officials have been at war over efforts to crack down on the industry. A federal judge blocked a law in January that would have required Airbnb to provide detailed information about listings and hosts, and the city recently filed a lawsuit against a group of real estate brokers, accusing them of using Airbnb to illegally rent out dozens of apartments.State and local governments that have moved to rein in Airbnb and other home-sharing sites have set off alarm bells among those whose economic survival is tied to the short-term rental market and who are angry that they are being ensnared by new taxes and regulations.In Massachusetts, critics warn that the new tax will wreak havoc on the state’s vital summer tourism season in places like Cape Cod. The same arguments are being put forth in New Jersey.Vacationers are abandoning long-held traditions and heading elsewhere. Homeowners complain they are having a hard time filling properties when they should be well on their way to being fully booked for summer. And businesses that rely on free-spending summer visitors fear that the rental tax threatens their most important time of year.Susan Hiller said she was heartbroken to be heading to Palm Beach, Fla., with her four daughters and extended family for their annual summer vacation.While the groomed white sand and glassy teal waters of the exclusive locale are a siren song for vacationers, beckoning even President Trump, Ms. Hiller said it is just not the same as the Jersey Shore.“I’ve been going to Ocean City since I was 5 years old and I’m 51,” said Ms. Hiller, who lives outside Philadelphia. “It is truly my most favorite place on earth.”George Triebenbacher, 56, grew up on Long Beach Island in New Jersey and now owns seven properties there that he’s been renting out since 2010. His weekly rates vary — three homes rent for $1,650, three go for $5,500 and a larger home fetches $10,000.In past years, by this point in March, all his homes had typically been reserved for the summer. But this year, about one-fourth of his rental weeks are still available, he said, and some people who had initially reserved are backing out.“People are actually canceling and forgoing deposits to get away from the taxes,” he said. “There’s no question that there’s all kind of upheaval being created by this tax.’’Debbie Mozer, 60, who owns a souvenir shop in Beach Haven, said summertime sales are crucial to her bottom line. “Everything depends on our sales for the summer,” Ms. Mozer said. “This is how we make our living.”The 130-mile long New Jersey coastline is one of the state’s most prized resources. The four Jersey Shore counties accounted for more than $20 billion of the $43 billion spent in New Jersey on tourism in 2017, the most recently available data, according to state officials. When the Trump administration unveiled a plan to drill for oil off the New Jersey coast, opposition to the proposal unified politicians of all stripes, from the progressive Democratic governor, Philip D. Murphy, to a conservative Republican representative, Chris Smith.Passage of the short-term rental tax flew largely under the radar last summer, overshadowed by the battle between Mr. Murphy and Democratic legislative leaders over a different tax — on the wealthy — that nearly shut down the state’s government.But now many along the shore say the rental tax places one of the state’s main summer economic engines in its cross hairs. The 11.6 percent tax applies to all rentals fewer than 90 days, including those made on home-sharing sites or directly between a renter and an owner. The only exceptions are rentals arranged through a Realtor, which are not subject to the tax.John Brennan owns a home on Long Beach Island that he is listing on Airbnb for $2,200 a week. By late winter he said he typically has 70 percent of the season booked. But so far, nothing has been rented. “They can’t just keep taxing us,” he said.Though it has frustrated renters and homeowners, Airbnb frames the tax as official recognition of its legitimacy, putting the company on equal footing with the hotel industry.“Home sharing is bringing economic opportunity to families and businesses in every corner of the Garden State,” Josh Meltzer, who oversees public policy for Airbnb in the Northeast, said in a statement. “We are excited to be able to support core state and local services from Jersey City to the Jersey Shore.’’The controversy over the tax underscores how New Jersey and other states are struggling to ensure that newer e-commerce companies abide by the same rules that apply to more established businesses, said Kim Rueben, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan research group based in Washington.“As person-to-person rental has become a larger part of economy, states and localities are trying to figure out, ‘How do you go about collecting the taxes that are equivalent to what hotels collect?’” Ms. Rueben said. “This is probably something that people were always supposed to pay and they just weren’t collected.”Some homeowners and others on the Jersey Shore are fighting back, forming a group, the NJ Shore Rentals Coalition, to lobby lawmakers and Mr. Murphy to exclude shore rentals from the tax. A bill that would do that has been unveiled in Trenton, though it is unclear if it has enough support to pass.“The vast majority of the Jersey Shore are homes that were rented out long before the sharing culture that’s developed with Airbnb,” said Duane Watlington, vice president of the coalition. “We believe that if the unintended tax is not corrected, there will be less money spent on vacations, further exacerbating the need for tax revenues.”The Murphy administration has signaled that it would consider revising the tax to ease the burden on the Jersey Shore.“The administration stands ready to work with the Legislature to amend the law to more closely mirror the intent of our original budget proposal,” said Jennifer Sciortino, a spokeswoman for the state Treasury Department.Much of the anger around the new tax has come from the Jersey coast, but many short-term rentals are concentrated in northern New Jersey, where visitors to New York City can find cheaper lodging.Of the $133 million earned by Airbnb hosts in the state in 2018, more than half came from the three northern counties closest to New York. The four shore counties accounted for $48 million, though the majority of rentals there are condensed around the three-month summer season.Maria Vitale, who has rented out her home in Lavallette for nearly 10 years, is charging the same weekly price, $2,400, as last year, but said many would-be renters had been turned off by the additional $280 in taxes.“New Jersey people, we’ve been taxed enough,” she said.The tax is taking hold at a time when the coast is still not fully recovered from Hurricane Sandy, Ms. Vitale noted. Still, there are signs of optimism: Her kitchen is being used less, she said, as renters seek out restaurants that have begun to reopen after the devastating 2012 storm.“Knowing what the Jersey Shore went through six-plus years ago,” she said, “I don’t think this is the opportune time to tax them even more.”An earlier version of this article misstated the types of rentals to which the 11.6 percent tax applies. It is all rentals of fewer than 90 days, not 14 days.Follow Nick Corasaniti on Twitter: @NYTnickc AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byLet us help your start your day.By Alisha Haridasani Gupta(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.) Good morning. The fate of Brexit remains uncertain, the U.S. goes after Chinese investments in American technology and Brunei’s new Islamic laws draw widespread criticism. Here’s the latest: It seems Prime Minister Theresa May’s sacrificial promise to resign in exchange for support for her withdrawal plan has made little difference.Parliament remains deadlocked. A third vote on her twice-rejected plan will take place in Parliament today, but a third rejection is entirely possible.To add to the complications, none of the eight alternative Brexit plans that lawmakers voted on on Wednesday mustered a majority, setting the stage for yet more debates in Parliament on Monday to try to whittle down the list for a second round of voting.Analysis: Mrs. May’s resignation offer was a surprising move for a woman who, over the last two years, has bounced back from crises with unflappable resolve. “The sight of this proud, rigid woman admitting that she could not finish the job, giving up her hopes of ever being remembered as anything but Brexit roadkill, was a somber one,” writes our London correspondent Ellen Barry.The next prime minister: British bookmakers are already offering up odds on who they think will step up when Mrs. May steps down. The Trump administration is pushing a Chinese firm, Beijing Kunlun, to relinquish its ownership of Grinder, over concerns that Beijing could use personal information on the U.S.-based app — like sexual orientation or dating habits — to blackmail or influence American officials.This appears to be the first case in which the U.S. has asserted that foreign control of a social media app has national security implications.How we know: People familiar with the matter told our national security reporter, David Sanger.Why it matters: The case is the latest effort by the administration to tighten controls over China’s ability to gain access to critical and emerging American technology.The broad push is driven by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., which last year killed a merger between MoneyGram, a money transfer firm, and Ant Financial, a payments company related to Alibaba.This heightened scrutiny runs in tandem with the administration’s campaign to block Huawei from building next-generation 5G networks around the world over concerns that it would give Beijing access to critical data.Speaking of Huawei: A British review found “significant” security problems with the Chinese company’s telecommunications equipment that governments and independent hackers could exploit, posing risks to national security. But the report stopped short of banning the company’s equipment in the country. Hezbollah fighters directed by Iran to fight the Islamic State have missed paychecks. Promised funding and support to help Syria rebuild have failed to materialize.The Trump administration says the punitive sanctions on Iran are working as they were meant to: undermining Iranian support for militant groups and political allies in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and elsewhere in the Middle East.Context: Iran has long used its patronage of Hezbollah in Lebanon, Shiite militias in Iraq and Syria, the Palestinian militant groups Hamas and Islamic Jihad, and the Houthi rebels in Yemen to boost its influence and counter the powers of Saudi Arabia and Israel.Caution: Analysts question whether the lack of Iranian support will change the behavior of these groups, which remain ideologically committed to Iran’s agenda and can promote it through local politics.“When you try to push Iran out of the region by sanctioning it,” said one expert, “you are forcing it to get involved in the region even more.” Two rifts on the Brunt Ice Shelf, in West Antarctica, are close to calving, or breaking off, creating an iceberg over 560 square miles (1,450 square kilometers) in size — about twice the size of New York City.The rifts were stable for 30 years, but in 2016, an image showed the two advancing toward each other. Scientists say the break could trigger the further retreat of the entire shelf. We’ve mapped the timeline of the split.From the archives: In 2017, we published an in-depth look into the risk of Antarctica’s collapse due to global warming.

Its market debut was the biggest so far this year. Uber — its main rival in North America — is expected to have an even bigger I.P.O., reflecting investors’ demand for a new generation of Silicon Valley darlings that have created the gig economy.Brunei: Beginning April 3, the country will implement Islamic laws that would punish adultery and gay sex with death by stoning, despite immense international pushback. The laws would apply to Muslims, non-Muslims and foreigners alike. Facebook: The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is suing the social media company for housing discrimination for allowing advertisers to restrict who can see housing ads based on characteristics like race, religion and national origin.Pakistan: Prime Minister Imran Khan introduced an ambitious plan to alleviate poverty, aiming to help the country’s poorest gain better access to health care, education and employment.New Zealand: The country’s immigration agency said that registrations of interest to live and work there — the first step toward applying for a visa — had increased in the 10 days after this month’s mosque attacks, compared with the 10 days leading up to it. Much of the interest came from Americans and people in predominantly Muslim countries.U.S. economy: The Commerce Department revised its estimate for growth this year to 3.0 percent, down slightly from 3.1 percent, presenting President Trump with a test of policies that he claims have so far boosted the economy.Frogs: The first global analysis of a fungus that has been wiping out frogs for decades demonstrates that it is, in the words of one researcher, “the most deadly pathogen known to science.” It has caused major declines in more than 500 species of frogs around the world, and at least 90 are presumed to have gone extinct.No pain, more gained?

A seemingly endless Brexit twists along, a triumphant President Trump points fingers, and a portrait of a seething Nissan offers a backdrop to the fall of Carlos Ghosn.

That was President Trump, reveling in his first rally since the end of the 22-month Mueller investigation, ridiculing those who sought the inquiry and the news media that did not overtly back him. “After three years of lies and smears and slander, the Russia hoax is finally dead,” Mr. Trump declared. “The collusion delusion is over.”There were greater-than-usual concerns about trouble at the rally, with security personnel more visible and sturdier barriers between the news media and the audience. But the mood in the crowd seemed no more intense, our reporters found, than at previous Trump rallies.The Mueller report: The Justice Department acknowledged that the report by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, was more than 300 pages long, raising questions about what was left out of Attorney General William Barr’s four-page summary of Mr. Mueller’s findings.Congress: The House Intelligence Committee’s first hearing since the completion of the report devolved into tumult.

Their 35-day nightmare of missing bill payments, working without paychecks, asking strangers for money and visiting food pantries was finally ending.But many of the federal workers who have been furloughed or working for free since December were leery of the three-week deal reached on Friday to reopen the government. New worries gnawed: How long before they got paid? Would federal contractors see even a dime of back pay?And most of all, after the longest shutdown in American history, would they and 800,000 other federal workers be back in the same mess in three weeks if President Trump and Democrats do not reach an accord on whether to fund his proposed border wall?“This was all for nothing, basically,” said Angela Kelley, 51, a furloughed worker for the Bureau of Land Management in Milwaukee who picked up shifts as an Uber driver to earn money to buy gas and groceries as the shutdown dragged on.On Friday, Mr. Trump praised federal workers as “fantastic people” and “incredible patriots” and acknowledged the toll they had suffered. But several federal employees said they still felt angry after being treated like pawns, they said, in a five-week-long Washington standoff. They said the shutdown had left deep scars on their families and finances and undermined their faith in elected leaders, and in the careers they had chosen.The New York Times talked with more than a dozen federal workers and contractors — from wildland firefighters to Coast Guard families to museum security guards — about how they had survived the shutdown, and the uncertainty they now face.John Hare, 42, is one of thousands of Coast Guard employees and retirees worried that they may find themselves in the same precarious position a few weeks from now.Because the Coast Guard is the only branch of the military that is part of the Department of Homeland Security, it was affected by the shutdown. About 55,000 active-duty, reserve and civilian employees had already missed either one or two paychecks, while another 50,000 military retirees would have gone without a pension payment for the first time on Feb. 1.After 22 years of service, Mr. Hare was forced to retire from the Coast Guard last August after learning he had a rare form of cancer that spread from his appendix. His wife had to stop working to care for him, and missing Mr. Hare’s pension check of $2,698 would have put a significant dent into the family budget.“The faith in our leadership to be able to negotiate with each other has been broken,” Mr. Hare, of Rolesville, N.C., said on Friday. “And they chose to break faith with the U.S. military.”“I certainly question the hostage-taking of government employees’ paychecks,” he said. “And nobody that was in power who had the power to stop this, none of them were injured” by the shutdown.“It is less a sense of relief because nothing has been solved.”Yvette Hicks, 40, a security guard at the Smithsonian museums, said she woke up on Friday and prayed, once again, for the shutdown to end. As a single mother, she said the shutdown had taken a toll on her family’s budget and her own mental health.When she learned on Friday she might be returning to work, Ms. Hicks said she had been crying. Her 14-year-old daughter and 8-year-old son were due home from school soon, and she was trying to put up a brave face for them. She said her son, Kaden, had nevertheless told his teachers that his mother was now sad all the time.Ms. Hicks said her family had once been homeless, and that she believed her job at the Smithsonian was a path to stability. She even saved up enough to book a spring-break vacation for her children to an indoor water park in Virginia. But as the bills piled up and her paychecks stopped, she said she canceled the trip and lost the $350 deposit she had paid for a room.“It’s just a hurting thing,” she said. “This has damaged my family.”Anthony Powers, 35, had begun thinking about leaving his 15-year career as part of an elite team of wildland firefighters with the United States Forest Service in Southern California. He was that frustrated with his nation’s leaders.“Our country is being run by children,” he said.On Friday, he was relieved but not elated, noting that everything could shut down again soon.Mr. Powers and his colleagues typically spend this time of year clearing away brush to help lessen fire danger in the coming year. None of that has been happening for the last month or so, and his team needs more than three weeks to get the job done. He also has a national conference set for the end of February, and the short-term opening leaves him in limbo. Is it going to happen? Should he plan for it? Not plan for it?“There’s been so much planning for this to go into the long-term,” he said. “Now it’s like, where do you reset?”Nic Trujillo, 34, a single father and collections representative for the Internal Revenue Service in Ogden, Utah, said the shutdown had done financial and emotional damage.He had not paid rent in January because he needed to pay other expenses. On Friday, he and his 6-year-old son were just one week away from being evicted and having to move in with extended family.Staying at home had also left him depressed. Before he was ordered to return to work without pay on Jan. 18, his natural night-owl tendencies had taken over. He would stay up late, get up to get his son off to school, then sleep for much of the day.“I haven’t really done anything. I haven’t really gone anywhere,” he said, explaining that he didn’t want to waste gas. “It’s just been a very depressive time.”He said he blamed both the president and Congress for the shutdown, saying that none of them knew what it was like to live paycheck to paycheck.“They are so out of touch with the American people that it’s unacceptable.”Kim Howell, 34, whose husband is in the Coast Guard in Boston and has been working 12-hour night shifts throughout the shutdown, said she didn’t feel much relief on Friday. She said she didn’t expect that her husband would get any back pay for a week or two. And then there was the possibility that the government would shut down again in three weeks.Ms. Howell said her family had been fortunate because she works for a tech startup. But the loss of her husband’s income strained them. They had to put off rent payments, utility bills, and cellphone, cable and internet bills.She had visited a food pantry that had been set up in Boston for Coast Guard families. She worried about the impact on her three children, who are 9, 13 and 14. Her oldest child told her he felt helpless and anxious watching his parents try to navigate the crisis. She did not blame any particular party, but said she felt betrayed. And she worried the dysfunction was far from over.“I’m staying in shutdown mode,” she said. “That’s the only responsible thing to do right now.”Reporting was contributed by Julie Turkewitz and Mitch Smith.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byA Word WithBy Kathryn ShattuckThe way Natasha Lyonne sees it, New Yorkers are perpetually tempting fate — dodging the yellow cab, the Uber, the bicycle blocked from view by the double-parked truck.“We realize that there’s literally death around the corner at all times,” she said. “Walking to work it’s like, oh, I really did nearly die six times today.”So in “Russian Doll,” her dark new Netflix comedy, debuting Feb. 1, in which her character dies and dies and dies again, it’s maybe not so much the way it happens that’s confounding. It’s the why.As Nadia, a computer coder on the cusp of 36 and at loose ends in the East Village, Lyonne attends a birthday party in her honor, leaves with a man, gets hit by a cab and then ends up back where she started — over and over and over. And between each untimely demise, she scours the city for clues like a modern-day Philip Marlowe, uncovering important lessons that need digesting before she can get along with, well, life.Created along with Amy Poehler and Leslye Headland, “Russian Doll” is Lyonne’s first effort at writing and directing a series — one secure within the Netflix flock, where later this year she’ll wrap up her sentence as the Litchfield Penitentiary inmate Nicky Nichols in “Orange Is the New Black.”But Lyonne is also venturing out of the safe zone: She and Maya Rudolph — who stars with Lyonne’s boyfriend, Fred Armisen, in “Forever” — recently signed a first-look television deal with Amazon Studios for their Animal Pictures production company.“I’m really eager and excited to get other people’s ideas out there because I’m a little bit, like, spent on self for a minute,” Lyonne said.At a photo studio in TriBeCa, posing for the camera in a fearsome pantsuit not unlike the one Nadia wears, Lyonne, 39, talked about adding hyphens to her job description and aging out of troublemaking.Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.So how did this autobiographical-but-not series come about?Amy called me out of the blue one day and said, “You know, as long as I’ve known you, you’ve always been the oldest girl in the world.” And I’m like, “Is that a compliment?” Cut to the end of the story: We ended up developing a show for NBC called “Old Soul,” in which I played a character named Nadia, and Ellen Burstyn played [a character based on] Ruth, my real-life godmother who lives in Murray Hill and spends most of her time at the Borgata in Atlantic City and is a high-roller but almost exclusively on the slot machines. Chain-smoker, Carltons. So when that show did not get picked up, it was almost like a paid investigation of what would become “Russian Doll.”What’s it like handing off your ideas to an all-female writers’ room? In an amazing way, the first thing that goes out the window is the trope of a woman. Everybody is a vulnerable, complex person, but I don’t think that the ways in which we exhibit that are in any way how our stories have been told traditionally.How fun was it thinking up ways for Nadia to die?There’s probably a bit of a misconception around how key the deaths are. It was more an emotional story of bottoming out. There are metaphorical deaths big and small throughout the day: There are the bigger ones where you just feel like your whole world is collapsing, [because of] health or a relationship falling apart. Then there’s the smaller deaths of the text message that didn’t get responded to that you’re obsessing on, and it feels like you’re suddenly a hollow man inside.Let’s not forget those street-crossing hazards.I’m definitely a real criminal jaywalker. I’m happy for the environment that we have bicycles now in the city, but it’s unmanageable. You don’t know if they’re coming from this side or the other side. It’s way too zany. No longer is there this elegant kind of Richard Hell sort of Lou Reed lazy amble through the city as you cross the street, looking over your shoulder like a cool guy. They’ve killed that entire rhythm to Manhattan.I don’t want to spoil anything, but you’ve cast Chloë Sevigny in a very personal role.Chloë is my closest person in life, and there was really only one person that felt like it was safe to entrust that role to. Probably the most incredible moment for me was walking home with my little director’s binder in the East Village and watching the sun begin to rise. And I’m like, this is a very different kind of sunrise than what I’ve experienced historically at this hour. This was the good guy’s version of that, and it was deep stuff. Chloë and I had walked those streets so many times, and now it was this world that we had built. There was a lot of gratitude. I just couldn’t believe how things have turned out.In July, you told some crossword puzzle jokes for T Magazine. It seems you’re obsessed.I might like the crossword puzzle more than I care about cigarettes, which is insane. There have been relationships where I’ve broken up because I’m like, I need this to feel more like a crossword puzzle. At the time, I didn’t know that that’s what was missing — about the stimulus or lack thereof — but it’s a real sweet spot. Imagine if they ever really figure out virtual reality: It would feel similar in terms of why people would want to escape into a futuristic pod and just live in there because the world outside has become too toxic to inhabit. That was an early concept for “Russian Doll” that we abandoned because we realized we didn’t know how to make that show.Yet Nadia does sneak in a puzzle.Yes, when she’s visiting Horse [Brendan Sexton III] — the gutter punk who’s not based on a real character from my life that I know from Tompkins — at the shelter, and she’s playing her crossword puzzle. I would say that’s a real one-to-one stolen from my reality. It’s not the only autobiographical piece of “Russian Doll,” but it’s the one most worthy of being a highlight.You’re turning 40 in April. Are you planning a party?I hope that there will be a party. Honestly, it was waylaid because the prices of New York rental spaces are so extreme that I was like, do I look like a Rockefeller? I don’t drink or anything, so something that would give you the sensation that your brain was melting, but I don’t know how to get there. I’d just like to be around some friends and some nice music and take it easy. I’m so happy to be growing up. I can’t believe how much easier it is to be an adult person as opposed to a troublemaking tween.“Orange Is the New Black” will end later this year. That must feel pretty traumatic.What’s amazing is that these scenes are so heavy to play, and it comes so easy at this point, just because we’ve lived in the bones of these people for so long. My hope would be that a good group of us continue to find out where we have a hub. “Orange” will become our O’Hare, and we’ll return there in new incarnations that can bleed out into new ideas. We really have our little tribe now, our allies for life. But yeah, it’s going to be very emotional.In November, you were an answer in a Times crossword puzzle and wrote on Instagram, “Please put this on my tombstone.” What would you really want your tombstone to say?I’m glad you think I’m going to die later today and that you have information that I clearly don’t. [Laughs] So far, that’s my best idea, but I’m hoping to beat it within the next few weeks. And I’m not so concerned. The tombstone, one hopes, it tells you what it wants to be.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byLet us help you start your day.By Alisha Haridasani Gupta(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning.Congress finds out what’s in the Mueller report, Thailand’s military appears to have won elections and Brexit continues to confound a nation. Here’s the latest:Attorney General William Barr sent lawmakers a summary of the special counsel’s highly anticipated report on Russian interference during the 2016 presidential election. The key findings will be made public later today.This much is clear: The Mueller report established no conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, but left it to Mr. Barr to determine whether President Trump's actions constituted obstruction of justice. Mr. Barr found that they did not.Our Washington Bureau is assessing the summary in greater detail now, and we’ll be updating the news story linked above and our live briefing.Impact: The report’s delivery “marked a turning point that will shape the remainder of Mr. Trump’s presidency and test the viability of American governance,” our chief White House correspondent writes.Other investigations: The special counsel, Robert Mueller, issued no further indictments but federal and state prosecutors are pursuing about a dozen other inquiries that grew out of his work, meaning President Trump hasn’t yet emerged from a looming legal threat.Hundreds of thousands of protesters took over the streets of Central London on Saturday, calling on lawmakers to break the political stalemate and hold a second referendum on Britain’s withdrawal from the E.U.Few lawmakers have any appetite for a second public vote, however, so the march’s main impact may be as a reflection of growing popular frustration over the gridlock.What’s next? Officials in the E.U. gave the British Parliament until April 12 to decide what it wants to do, so Brexit will not take effect on March 29, the date set two years ago.On the table is Prime Minister Theresa May’s widely unpopular draft plan. If lawmakers approve it by the E.U. deadline, Britain will leave the bloc on May 22.If not, Britain has three choices: a no-deal Brexit on April 12, no Brexit at all or a longer delay of possibly two more years. Parliament has strongly opposed all of these options, too.Today: Lawmakers are to vote on proposed amendments to Mrs. May’s plan, including one that would allow for a rapid-fire round of voting on alternatives.Analysis: Ellen Barry, our London correspondent, looks at how some Brexit supporters have shifted from the original goal of a less restrictive relationship with the E.U. to willingness to walk away from the bloc with no deal at all.A military-linked party seemed to have emerged as the winner of parliamentary elections, the country’s first vote since a coup in 2014.With about 90 percent of the ballots counted as of Sunday, Palang Pracharat, the military’s proxy party, had 7.5 million votes, the Election Commission said. Pheu Thai, the populist party toppled in the coup, had been widely expected to finish first, but was second with seven million votes.The remaining votes will be counted today, but it appears to be the first electoral failure since 2001 of a party aligned with Thaksin Shinawatra, the polarizing former prime minister.Concerns: More than 5 percent of the ballots were invalidated, raising questions about the integrity of the results. And turnout was 66 percent, lower than the expected 80 percent.Democracy activists say the new military-backed Constitution worked in favor of the country’s armed forces, which has orchestrated more than a dozen successful coups over the years. Electoral rules blunted the power of some blocs, and the threat of jail time hung over leaders of anti-junta parties.The voting was for the lower house. The new Constitution gives the military the power to appoint all 250 members of the Senate, so its power in Parliament will be overwhelming.A four-year military operation to push the terrorist group from Iraq and Syria ended on Saturday when American-backed forces took back the last speck of land in the region controlled by the group.The end of the Islamic State’s self-declared caliphate, which at its peak was the size of Britain, is a major blow to the group. The group continues to exist, however, as a diffuse insurgency from Afghanistan to the Philippines, and experts say it is more powerful today than it was in 2011, enriched by years of collecting taxes in Iraq and Syria and returning to the guerrilla tactics it used in the past.By the numbers: The group has tens of thousands of fighters in Iraq and Syria as well as followers around the world. Since last summer, it carried out at least 250 attacks in Syria. ISIS followers have carried out attacks in at least 25 countries since 2017.Recruiting: A modern, educated couple in the Philippines became key recruiters for the Islamic State, calling on followers to wage jihad in Muslim parts of the archipelago.On the ground: Hours after a U.S.-backed militia announced victory over the Islamic State in Syria, a local driver working with a team of journalists from NBC News was killed in an explosion in the area. It was not immediately clear whether the group had been targeted, or whether previously unexploded ordnance from heavy militia bombing might have been involved.Boeing: An investigation by The Times looks into how the aircraft manufacturer rushed to develop the 737 Max 8 to keep American Airlines from ordering hundreds of planes from its rival, Airbus, and how the frenetic pace played out for engineers and construction teams.New Zealand: The country banned the so-called manifesto of the man suspected in the Christchurch massacre, making it a crime to possess or distribute the content in an attempt to limit the spread of hateful ideas and foil his desire for notoriety.China-E.U. relations: President Xi Jinping secured Italy’s cooperation with his Belt and Road initiative and then headed to France to meet with European leaders, some of whom fear widening internal divisions over China’s increasing reach.Cambodia: Top E.U. officials visited the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, to consider revoking a special trading deal because of the country’s deteriorating human rights record.North Korea: The country’s state media escalated calls for South Korea to distance itself from the U.S., as the U.S. sent mixed signals over whether it would tighten or relax sanctions on the North.Norway: A cruise ship stranded for nearly 24 hours by rough weather and engine trouble finally headed to shore, after about a third of the 1,300 people aboard were airlifted, one by one, to safety.Coming this week: Apple will unveil its video streaming service on Monday, and Lyft — Uber’s main rival in North America — will make its debut on the stock market on Friday in what could be the tech world’s biggest initial public offering since 2014.Russia: A marathon across the frozen surface of Lake Baikal in Siberia was a precarious endeavor through unpredictable and grueling conditions. “Baikal prepares new surprises,” said the founder of the race. “That makes it more interesting.”Perspective: Calling Asian women “adorable,” “cute” or “beautiful” in professional settings is a form of racism that “dresses up its violence in praise,” the author R.O.

We noticed that the subway system skips only a few letters of the alphabet, and asked her to explain.The letters missing from the current subway map either were removed over the years or never existed because officials thought they might confuse riders. An I train could have been mistaken for a 1, or an O train for zero.There was an H train — a shuttle line in Rockaway Park, Queens — but it was changed to an S for shuttle in 1992.The K once ran along the C line in Manhattan, but the letter was retired in 1988.Once a letter disappears from the map, that doesn’t mean it is gone forever. The W train, between Queens and Manhattan, was axed in 2010 and then reappeared in 2016 as part of new service after the opening of the Second Avenue subway, which diverted the Q train to three new stations on Manhattan’s Upper East Side.As for the Z, transit advocates held a funeral for the line amid budget cuts in 2009, but it has survived after all (for now).Your Morning Briefing is published weekday mornings and updated online.

Daley, a member of Chicago’s political dynasty of Daleys — earlier conceded defeat.Either Ms. Lightfoot or Ms. Preckwinkle would be the first African-American woman to lead the nation’s third largest city, succeeding Mayor Rahm Emanuel as mayor. Only one other woman, Jane Byrne, has been elected mayor, in 1979. If Ms. Lightfoot were to win, she also would be the first openly gay mayor of Chicago.Ms. Preckwinkle, 71, a long established politician who has often been urged to run for mayor, had been widely expected to do well in Tuesday’s balloting amid a cast of 14 candidates. The success of Ms. Lightfoot, 56, who has never held elective office before, was far more surprising; she was less well known in Chicago’s political sphere and had far less money.[Get to know the candidates: Here’s a short profile of Ms. Lightfoot. And one of Ms. Preckwinkle, too.]Her win, too, was seen as something of a rebuke to Mr. Emanuel’s tenure as mayor and to Chicago’s old political history. Ms. Lightfoot had tried to define her campaign as a rejection of machine politics and a refocusing on Chicago’s struggling neighborhoods, not just its gleaming downtown.[More on the issues at stake in Chicago’s election.]Ms. Lightfoot emerged at a gathering of supporters late Tuesday night, and seemed to take note of people who hadn’t expected her success. To applause, she called out: “So what do you think of us now?” She added: “This, my friends, is what change looks like.”The historic nature of the runoff was not lost on Ms. Preckwinkle’s supporters, who gathered at a party on another side of town. The crowd cheered when Bridget Gainer, a county commissioner, noted from the stage that Chicago city would, one way or another, have an African-American woman as mayor later this year.“Tonight, I am proud of my city,” Ms. Gainer said. “Our whole country is going to be watching us and what we’re going to be doing.”Lonnell Saffold, the recording secretary for a local unit of the Service Employees International Union, said having two black women in the runoff shattered “a glass ceiling that Chicago probably would have never fathomed.” Mr. Saffold said he voted for Ms. Preckwinkle, but that Ms. Lightfoot had been his second choice.The city’s votes were sprinkled widely across the massive field of 14 candidates who had hoped to replace Mr. Emanuel, who didn’t run for a third term. With 92 percent of the votes counted, Ms. Lightfoot had the highest vote tally, with about 17 percent. Ms. Preckwinkle had 16 percent, and Mr. Daley, who was well funded and who many here had expected to easily make the runoff, came in just below 15 percent.[ This was a look at the top candidates in Tuesday’s election, an unusually wide field.]For months, Chicago’s campaign has looked like a reunion of its best-known political figures — a former police superintendent, a former public schools chief, a former city clerk.Among the names most familiar to voters were Ms. Preckwinkle and Mr. Daley, a brother of this city’s longest-serving mayor (Richard M.) and a son of the second-longest-serving mayor (Richard J.). Richard M. Daley, who ran Chicago for 22 years before Mr. Emanuel arrived in 2011, was sometimes known as “Mayor for Life,” and some Chicagoans thought the Daley name alone would at least advance the latest Daley into a runoff.On Tuesday night, Dona Scott, whose husband, Sam, was Mr. Daley’s campaign chairman, lingered after Mr. Daley conceded defeat from a stage.“Right now I’m digesting what happened,” she said. “In my heart of hearts, I believe Bill was the person to lead this city.”Sam Scott, the campaign chairman, said that he felt Mr. Daley was hurt by negative ads in the last two weeks from his competitors.But there was something more at play. “The times have changed,” he said. “In the last couple of elections we’ve seen, younger folks, women, people of color, have taken something of a spotlight. It’s more difficult for an older white gentleman to relate to some of the changes that people think that they want.”For weeks, the sheer number of candidates seemed to have left some Chicagoans flummoxed — unsure, even in the final hours, whom they would vote for. Some political strategists said they wondered if that might discourage some people from voting at all in the election, which is technically nonpartisan, though Democrats reliably win.Mr. Emanuel upended Chicago’s political landscape when he announced in September that he would not seek a third term. Mr. Emanuel — who had been sharply criticized over his handling of school closings, crime and police misconduct and had faced political challengers — said at the time that the mayor’s office “has been the job of a lifetime, but it is not a job for a lifetime.” After that, many more candidates stepped forward.Whoever becomes the next mayor of this city of 2.7 million people will face an array of complicated, sometimes interconnected, challenges all at once.The city’s pension system will require an additional $1 billion in revenue by the end of the new mayor’s first term. Yet residents say they are weary from years of increases in their property tax bills and fees. Crime and gang violence remains a deep worry for many, even as the city contends with its long history of troubled relations between the police force and residents, especially in the black community.And although tourism has boomed downtown, development along the Chicago River has flourished and corporations have flocked to the city in recent years, some neighborhoods on the South and West Sides have struggled with disinvestment, schools closing and people moving away.On Tuesday, Jackie Ropski, a marketing director for an elementary school, said that she saw this election as more important than some, with so many candidates to choose from and at a pivotal moment in Chicago history.“I think there is a certain amount of weight on this particular election,” Ms. Ropski said, after voting in the Irving Park neighborhood on the Northwest Side. “Personally, I think education takes prominence among all the issues, but whoever is mayor has to take a layered approach. How do you solve poverty, crime, neighborhood tensions, education? That’s complex.”Alex Ruiz, 33, a student and Uber driver, said that the biggest issue that worried him was Chicago’s financial situation and its looming pension obligations. The next mayor, he said, had to get the city’s finances in order to spread confidence to Chicagoans about the state of the city.Mr. Ruiz grew up only a few miles east of his current neighborhood, Irving Park, but his family had steadily moved west throughout his life as gentrification kept pushing them out.“Everyone’s trying to stay in this city they were born in,” he said. “If we don’t address the financial issues, we’re going to keep driving the middle class out of the city.”At Manny’s deli, south of downtown, Natalie Wasso said she was leaning toward voting for Mr. Daley, if she voted at all.Ms. Wasso, 32, a phlebotomist who lives on the Southwest Side, said she trusted the Daley family, which led the city for most of her childhood. Her grandmother had always voted for Daleys in past elections.“We never had a problem: That’s the name we know in Chicago,” Ms. Wasso said. “He can relate to us regular people.”But Jewel Morris, 62, a retired probation officer, said he had voted for Ms. Preckwinkle, though he deemed her the “lesser of two evils” compared with Mr. Daley.“No Daleys, no Bushes, no dynasties,” said Mr. Morris, who lives on the Near West Side. “We don’t need any of that.”The Chicago of 2019 is better than when he was a child, he said. The architecture is unparalleled, the restaurants are world-class and tourists are coming to the city in droves. But the inequality feels like the Chicago of his youth.“You’re looking at a tale of two cities,” he said. “It’s still the city of neighborhoods and still the city of segregation.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byReaders respond to three columns about increasing divisions within the party. By Rachel L. Harris and Lisa TarchakMs. Harris and Ms. Tarchak are senior editorial assistants.What — or who — will it take to unite the Democratic Party? Last week, three columnists wrote about the growing rivalry between the party’s progressives and moderates, and speculated as to which contingent could produce a candidate strong enough to take the presidency in 2020. Responses to each column (David Leonhardt’s “A Dose of Moderation Would Help Democrats,” Ross Douthat’s “The Democrats Have a Culture Problem” and Thomas B. Edsall’s “‘We Are Either a Team or We’re Not’”) reflected a common divide among our readers. While many touted the virtues of democratic socialists like Senator Bernie Sanders as being able to galvanize younger voters, many others called for someone like Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio (who has since decided not to run), saying more centrist policies helped him hold an important swing state in the midterms.A selection from these debates is below. Comments have been edited for length and clarity. What I’d like to see is not a combination of progressives and moderates, but a combination within individual Democrats of progressive policy aims and moderate temperament. Turning those policy aims into reality will require long-term Democratic control of Congress and the White House. Forging such a durable majority will take patience, prudence, and consensus building. It won’t be accomplished with an intolerant, purist mind set that isn’t shared by most Americans. The progressive agenda is too important to be entrusted to the progressive personality type. — Longestaffe, PickeringMost self-described socialists are young. They have seen what their moderate parents have gotten us: income inequality, a deteriorating environment and college graduates driving Uber because that’s the best work they can get. You can say that socialism is a bad electoral strategy but young people don’t care. Instead of lecturing them about why they’re wrong, try listening to them. — Cal. Prof., Berkeley, Calif.A more reasonable label would be “Ineffective Flabby Reformism” versus attempts to actually stand up and accomplish some needed goals. The terms “left” and “socialism” really refer to being good to our neighbors, being less selfish, seeing the harm of extreme inequality, opening one’s eyes to historical racism and sexism in our lives and trying to save our planet from ecological catastrophes. — Just Thinkin’, TexasWe need to move this country forward after being thrown back on our heels by the incompetent G.W. Bush, immoral Trump and ineffective Obama. We need Franklin D. Roosevelt’s economic policies, John F. Kennedy’s and Lyndon B. Johnson’s social activism and rigorous environmental policies. Far more Republicans will support the candidacy of Senator Bernie Sanders than that of a moderate Democrat. Sanders would take all the disenchanted Trump voters, and they are growing by the day. — Rich D., TucsonThe Democratic Party doesn’t recognize that it is an elitist organization; that the progressive ideals it claims to represent are akin to political gentrification at the expense of solving the underlying problems threatening America’s working class. And when someone like Sen. Sherrod Brown does speak for this great mass of individuals, he is labeled with the pejorative term “populist,” as though it is unfair to appeal to what most of the country really wants. — Jerry Meadows, Cincinnati I’ve heard moderate Democrats dismissed as “unicorns,” not worthy of pursuit. I can tell you there are plenty of us in this party, and if it swings too far to the fringe left, not only will the party lose independents in 2020, they will lose us. I don’t consider anyone using the tag “Democratic Socialist” to be an actual Democrat and I won’t support a single one of them. — Cordelia, New YorkI have the misfortune of living in northwest Pennsylvania, the gateway to the Rust Belt. “Democratic Socialism” is not going to work in this part of the country. The right will continue to use Representatives Ocasio-Cortez and Omar as cudgels to paint the left as unhinged. I just wish there was some way to play down the coverage of these new members who are representative of their districts, but not necessarily the rest of the party. I might support them, but my neighbors won’t. — Marylouise, The Rust BeltA call for Democrats to move to the center, when in fact the positions of the progressive candidates are strongly supported by the public, seems foolish and dangerous. Americans want fairer taxes, universal health care, a livable wage and an environmental future that controls global warming. These are meat and potato issues that the electorate will support. — Kevin Cummins, DenverThe fact is, our left represents mainstream social and political policy in intelligent, forward-thinking nations. We’re proud of our beliefs. Democrats: walk away from moderate Trump voters. They will never vote for you. It’s time to tack hard left. The only way for Democrats to win is to answer to us, your base. And we’re tired of wasting our votes on centrists who have given us nothing. — Nicholas Rush, Colorado SpringsIf the right moves further to the right, then, in order for the Democrats to be moderate, they also have to move right. The spectrum needs balance. Personally, I’m looking at a presidential candidate that is to the right of Bernie Sanders and to the left of Amy Klobuchar. Someone who can get both coastal liberals and Midwest blue dogs to vote with excitement. Someone who is to the left of moderation. — Aimee Pollack-Baker, MassachusettsDon’t write off us baby boomer centrist Democrats just yet. Millennials may be marching to the left, but I’m not and neither is anyone in my social circle. And there are still plenty of us remaining. I see the policies of Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker as arrogant and ludicrous. From a simple mathematics point of view, they can’t win a national election with the Electoral College. Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar will be the final straw to alienate the majority of white and Latino Americans who are trending right. Trump will win again. And if Trump goes down and a reasonable Republican like Mitt Romney steps in, I’ll vote for him. — David G., Monroe, N.Y.Successful candidates know the nuanced nature of their specific locales. Nancy Pelosi’s challenge is how to stretch her rhetorical practice and analytical toolbox to understand and empower newly elected representatives who clearly bring sorely needed skills and values to the House. If she is to succeed, she must temper the old guard’s outrage at the presence of the new. — Wis. Gal, Colorado SpringsWe were told to go along to get along and vote for Hillary Clinton. Where did that get us? This time, no way. — Cal Page, New Hampshire What’s the point of electing moderates or centrists? They’ve done little or nothing to address gross inequality, gun violence, drug prices, wars of choice, corporate tax evasion, trade deals that offshore jobs, abuse of tech sector visas, data privacy, access to primary care, failing infrastructure, regulatory capture and the corrupt swinging doors to the private sector. The new wave of progressives reject special interest financing, taking only small individual donations, and want to deliver change. The stakes are too high to revert to business as usual. — Xoxarle, Tampa, Fla. America is a big country and there is plenty of room to allow a variety of different cultures to coexist within it. Liberal secular communities do and should exist alongside conservative religious ones. Democrats running for federal office should not focus on cultural issues that devolve easily but on issues like foreign policy that must be resolved at the federal level. — Aoy, Pennsylvania I may agree with many of the very progressive ideas of Rep. Ocasio-Cortez and the new cadre of lefties in the House, but I also dread the notion of a Trump re-election, losing the House again and never taking back the Senate. That is exactly what will happen if idealism — and, in some cases, narcissism — clouds judgment. I still haven’t forgiven Ralph Nader, who had been a hero of mine, and all his high-minded rhetoric for giving us George H.W. Bush. — Steve, CorvallisDemocrats cannot win simply by taking California, New York, New England and New Jersey. If you look at the electoral map from 2016, although Hillary Clinton won the majority of the popular vote, the congressional districts went by and large to the Republicans. Ignoring the Midwest and the South will prove fatal to the chances of regaining the presidency, controlling who sits on the U.S. Supreme Court, enacting laws that benefit the poor and middle class and protecting a woman’s right to choose. America is not a left leaning country, despite what some new members of Congress want us to believe. — Mark Jeffery Koch, Mount Laurel, N.J.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

The election is on Feb. 26.Weather: Dry and cold, then afternoon snow, may turn to rain and sleet tonight. Tomorrow, another wild swing to the mid-50s. Alexa, when will it be spring for good?Alternate-side parking: In effect until March 6 (Ash Wednesday).Charging motorists a fee to enter Manhattan south of 60th Street, and using the money to fund mass transit, is an idea “whose time has come,” Governor Cuomo said two years ago.Despite that declaration, the Republicans who then controlled the State Senate refused to vote on congestion pricing. The proposal died.But Democrats took control of the State Senate last month, and they back the idea. So now, supporters of congestion pricing are mobilizing in ways they haven’t before. Here’s how:Mr. Cuomo is a driving force.The governor has been criticized for the problems plaguing the subways. He, in turn, has argued that congestion pricing can help pay for improvements. If lawmakers don’t pass congestion pricing, he has said, subway riders might see a fare increase.The M.T.A. is on board.Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials are conducting a “listening tour” of state lawmakers, said Kathryn Wylde, the president and chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, a business group. Advocates said lawmakers and their constituents were more likely to support congestion pricing if they learned about how the money would be used.Campaigns are mobilizing.At least two groups — Fix Our Transit and #FixTheSubway — are rallying labor, immigrant, business and civic organizations. But opposition exists, and it includes some lawmakers representing suburban residents who rely on cars and would pay more to enter the busiest parts of Manhattan.How would it work?Motorists headed south of 60th Street would be charged. Drivers using already-tolled tunnels or the Henry Hudson Bridge to enter Manhattan would get a credit. Drivers crossing the Brooklyn Bridge and heading north on F.D.R. Drive past 60th Street wouldn’t have to pay.The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority would set and collect the fees.How much would the fee be?That’s being worked out. Last year, a state panel suggested $11.52 for passenger cars and $25.34 for trucks.[Read more about the push for congestion pricing.]Today is the funeral for Detective Brian Simonsen, who was killed by police fire in Queens.Christopher Ransom, who was charged in the robbery that led to Detective Simonsen’s death, grew up wanting to be a police officer, friends of Mr. Ransom said. He faces life in prison if convicted.My colleagues Ali Watkins and Ali Winston examined the men’s lives before their deadly encounter inside a cellphone store.[Read more about the two men.]They wrote, “Had they met under different circumstances, friends of the detective said, Detective Simonsen’s skill at calming down troubled people, coupled with Mr. Ransom’s desire to connect with the police, might have led to a less tragic outcome.”The Times’s Ashley Southall reports: The New York City Police Department planned today to begin reviewing hundreds of requests for officer body-camera videos after a court said the footage could be made public.A police union, the Police Benevolent Association, argued for over a year that the videos were secret under a state civil rights statute shielding records used to evaluate officers’ performance. But a state appellate court ruled Tuesday that the videos were “more akin to arrest or stop reports.”“To hold otherwise would defeat the purpose of the body-worn-camera program to promote increased transparency and public accountability,” the court said.The police commissioner, transparency advocates and media including The New York Times applauded the ruling, but the union said it was considering an appeal to the state’s highest court.A Republican as public advocate?

Mr. Geduld owned the shop while also making a fortune as “a Wall Street super-trader,” the magazine said.But, as he explained, his success on Wall Street was linked to his work at Donut Pub, on 14th Street.Here are three important lessons from Mr. Geduld, via the magazine:Run the business by knowing the business.“I fried the doughnuts, I filled the donuts, I mopped the floors. My philosophy was the only way to run a business was to learn it from the ground up.”Food can be a form of advertisement.“I’d send clients doughnuts every week.”“When the market opened, you’d get the biggest institutions in New York — Alliance Capital, J.P. Morgan — calling up: ‘Jesus Christ, the chocolate glazed were great.’ It was a very effective way to advertise.”People are the real influencers.“The people who visit because of social media won’t come back if the product isn’t great.”“You need someone behind the counter to say with a smile, ‘Good morning, how can I help you? Would you like to try a new doughnut?’”It’s Wednesday — donut glaze over details.

FriedmanOpinion ColumnistIn case you haven’t noticed, long-established political parties across the democratic world are blowing up, with Britain’s Labour Party just the latest to fracture. Could America’s parties be next?Could we have our first four-party election in 2020 — with candidates from the Donald Trump far right, the old G.O.P. center right, the Joe Biden center left and the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez far left all squaring off, as the deepening divides within our two big parties simply can’t be papered over any longer? It’s not impossible.Indeed, two phrases recently in the news that touch on core principles of the Democratic and Republican Parties are like fuses that could ignite much larger explosions in the coming year. Those phrases are: “unwilling to work” and “national emergency.”On Feb. 7, Ocasio-Cortez’s congressional office sent out an F.A.Q. explainer of the Green New Deal that she’s proposing. The initiative aims “to mobilize every aspect of American society … to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and create economic prosperity for all.”I admire that goal and the huge energy she’s brought to it among young people. But one version of her office’s F.A.Q. stated that the Green New Deal would guarantee, among other benefits, “Economic security to all who are unable or unwilling to work.”Economic security for people “unwilling to work”? Who’s going to sign up for new taxes to support people unwilling to work or be retrained?When some commentators called this out, Ocasio-Cortez’s team said the F.A.Q. was an unfinished draft that never should have been released. I don’t buy it. It was also too late. That phrase — economic security even for people “unwilling to work” — was not just noted by conservatives. It rattled some center-left Democrats as well, because it hinted that the party’s base had moved much farther to the left in recent years than they’d realized, and it highlighted the most important fault line in today’s Democratic Party — the line between what I’d call “redivide-the-pie Democrats” and “grow-the-pie Democrats.”Grow-the-pie Democrats — think Mike Bloomberg — celebrate business, capitalism and start-ups that generate the tax base to create the resources for more infrastructure, schools, green spaces and safety nets, so more people have more opportunity and tools to capture a bigger slice of the pie.Grow-the-pie Democrats know that good jobs don’t come from government or grow on trees — they come from risk-takers who start companies. They come from free markets regulated by and cushioned by smart government.The wisest grow-the-pie Democrats have also learned something from the past few years: The benefits of Nafta, open trade with China and the rise of the digital economy — while vital for creating economic growth — don’t just automatically trickle down, any more than G.O.P. tax cuts did. They require trade insurance and surge protectors, free community college, portable health care coverage and pensions, and a very intentional strategy to more equitably spread the benefits of growth among bosses, workers and shareholders.Redivide-the-pie Democrats — think Bernie Sanders — argue that after four decades of stagnant middle-class wages — and bailouts for bankers and billionaires but not workers in 2008 — you can’t grow the pie without redividing it first. Inequality is too great now. There are too many people too far behind.The decision by Amazon to scuttle its big expansion in New York City marks the first big clash this election season between grow-the-pie Democrats, who insisted that tax breaks for Amazon would pay for themselves, and redivide-the-pie Democrats, who saw Amazon as pitting their community in a race to the bottom with other communities over which could lavish more subsides on a tech behemoth that didn’t need them.In truth, the episode was a huge failure of imagination by both sides. Virginia got it right, explained Amy Liu, urban affairs expert at the Brookings Institution, in an essay last week in The Times. Yes, it gave Amazon some $500 million in subsidies, but the state offered twice that amount in new investments in local transportation and schools to create a strong pipeline of technically skilled workers — something that will benefit the entire community for years.As for the G.O.P., it’s divided between a “limited-government-grow-the-pie” right — but one that wants to just let capitalism rip — and a “hoard-the-pie, pull-up-the-drawbridge” Trump-led far right.The limited-government-grow-the-pie faction is itself split between the Never Trumpers — who’ve refused to prostitute themselves to Trump’s serial lying, cozying up to Russia and other madness — and those who’ve hitched a ride on Trump’s wagon to get their tax cuts, conservative judges and deregulation.But Trump’s decision to declare a “national emergency” on the Mexico border has violated the party’s most core principle of limited government. In doing so it’s opened a fissure between the old limited-government-grow-the-pie Republicans and the anti-immigrant hoard-the-pie, pull-up-the-drawbridge Trumpers.The early signs are that the limited-government types — led by Mitch McConnell — are so morally bankrupt, after having sold their souls to Trump for two years, they’ll even abandon this last core principle and go along with Trump’s usurpation of Congress’s power of appropriation.Stay tuned. Over the years our two parties have usually managed to handle deep fractures. This time may be different.The level of outrage in both bases is sky high: Their ability to express that outrage through weaponized social networks, talk radio and cable television is powerful and pervasive, and the three accelerations — in globalization, technology and climate change — we’re going through are stressing everyone and demanding very different political choices.So here’s my hunch: The 2020 U.S. election will be unlike any in my lifetime.Think about it. Ever since World War II until the early 21st century, the major political parties in the West were all built on a set of stable binary choices: capital versus labor; big government/high regulation versus small government/low regulation; open to trade and immigration versus more closed to trade and immigration; embracing of new social norms, like gay rights or abortion, and opposed to them; and green versus growth.Across the industrial world parties mostly formed along one set of those binary choices or the other. But that is no longer possible.What if I am a steelworker in Pittsburgh and in the union, but on weekends I drive for Uber and rent out my kid’s spare bedroom on Airbnb — and shop at Walmart for the cheapest Chinese imports, and what I can’t find there I buy on Amazon through a chatbot that replaced a human? Monday to Friday I’m with labor. Saturday and Sunday I’m with capital.My point? Many of the old binary choices simply do not line up with the challenges to workers, communities and companies in this age of accelerating globalization, technology and climate change, but national governments are so paralyzed by partisanship that they can’t adapt. And most families are too weak to manage these forces and pass along the American dream to their kids.Fortunately, though, all is not lost. Creative adaptation is happening in many of America’s counties, cities and towns, where trust is much higher. The most successful are forging what I call “complex adaptive coalitions,” where business, labor, philanthropists, social entrepreneurs, educators and local government all network together to create jobs, attract businesses, grow housing, fix potholes and improve schools.These coalitions are not focused on splitting the differences between the old right-left binary choices. They’ve actually moved to a totally different grid — one that asks every day on every issue: “What works? Find it and share it, so we can get the best out of these accelerations in technology, globalization and climate change and cushion the worst for the most people in our community."Oxford economist Eric Beinhocker recently pointed out to me research that says there are only two ways to cure political tribalism: “A common threat or a common project.” We need a common project, and it’s obvious: Build a new foundation for the middle class. Ultimately that requires the local and the national levels to work together. But for now we should be glad that it’s at least happening at the local level.Don Baer, who served as President Clinton’s communications director, has a bumper sticker for anyone who wants to run for president in 2020 on the grid of rebuilding our country through complex adaptive coalitions — but it will take your whole bumper:“Make America work again, for those who are willing to work and for those who are willing to work together.”The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

He keeps a piano in his office. He was an investor in “Hamilton.” He helped usher in an era of live musicals on the broadcast networks. And he’s friends with Dolly Parton.As of Monday, he is also the executive charged with the formidable task of bringing HBO into a more digital future without its Emmy-winning series “Game of Thrones” or “Veep,” both of which will end their runs in the coming months.Mr. Greenblatt, 58, was named the chairman of entertainment at AT&T’s Warner Media, giving him oversight of TBS, TNT, a future streaming service and — the crown jewel — HBO. Thanks to a reorganization brought about by the veteran AT&T executive John Stankey, Mr. Greenblatt has become one of the most powerful players in the industry.“There are only a few things I wanted to do,” he said in a telephone interview. “These opportunities in these kind of jobs aren’t open that often.”Mr. Greenblatt, who goes by Bob, was the beneficiary of corporate changes signaling that AT&T will not be a passive overseer of the media empire it acquired last June for $85.4 billion. He spent much of the last two decades as the head of entertainment at Showtime and NBC, and his expertise makes sense for a company that is looking to increase its output while trying to hang on to is core fans.His first big assignment will be to remake the structure that was in place in the years when HBO, TBS and TNT were owned by Time Warner, under which HBO operated independently.The overarching goal is to produce enough quality content to make the new incarnation of AT&T — with its planned streaming service front and center — a fearsome competitor to the deep-pocketed tech companies Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and Apple. Don’t forget the Walt Disney Company, which has plans to enter the digital fray in a substantial fashion, thanks, in part, to the trove of content it acquired with its purchase of the bulk of 21st Century Fox for $71.3 billion.And Mr. Greenblatt will become the caretaker of something dear to those who have spent their Sunday nights glued to “Sex and the City,” “The Sopranos” and “Game of Thrones”: HBO. The network’s chief executive, Richard Plepler, who had spent 27 years at the network, the last six at its head, announced his resignation last week.Mr. Greenblatt noted that he was not some wildly out-of-the-box pick. “I’m not as much as an outsider that could have been brought in,” he said. “I don’t want to just come in and upend everything and destroy what they’ve built.”Mr. Greenblatt said he was approached by Mr. Stankey, the longtime AT&T executive and Warner Media chief executive, last fall, not long after he had stepped down from NBC. Talks accelerated in January.“I was immediately excited about it,” he said. “Though not undaunted by it. You know from my history I like a challenge.”A meaningful change will come about in short order: HBO’s center of gravity will shift from New York, Mr. Plepler’s base of operations, to Los Angeles, where Mr. Greenblatt built his career.He dreamed of being in show business when he was growing up in Rockford, Ill., about 90 miles from Chicago. “Literally in the cornfields,” Mr. Greenblatt said. He set his sights on becoming a producer when he saw “That’s Entertainment!”, the 1974 film filled with clips from classic MGM musicals. But he had no connections: His father worked on air-conditioners and heating systems, and his mother was a travel agent.Oddly, the Catholic high school he attended — “He’s definitely got to be the only Catholic Robert Greenblatt in the world,” Ms. Parton said when she presented him an award in 2011 — was a musical-theater training ground. His classmates included Joe Mantello, who went on to be a Broadway director, and the musical star Marin Mazzie, who died last year.After piling up degrees at the University of Illinois, the University of Wisconsin and the University of Southern California, Mr. Greenblatt landed a job at the Lorimar studio in the late 1980s. That was where he worked with Peter Chernin, the executive and producer who would play a role in virtually every turn of his career in the years to come.“Peter is my ultimate mentor, my uber mentor,” Mr. Greenblatt said.Mr. Chernin left Lorimar for a new TV network — Fox — and persuaded Mr. Greenblatt to join him. The timing was impeccable. Fox was entering its go-go ’90s phase, with addictive soaps like “Beverly Hills 90210” and “Melrose Place” and the family drama “Party of Five.” Mr. Greenblatt also helped put “The X-Files” on the air, despite his initial hesitation.He decided to strike out on his own as a producer in the late 1990s, forming a studio with the producer David Janollari — with financial backing from 20th Century Fox, thanks to Mr. Chernin. In that role, he squired a few network shows and had a critically acclaimed hit with “Six Feet Under,” Alan Ball’s darkly comic funeral-home series. It lasted five seasons on HBO and won the Golden Globe for best television drama in 2002.“I felt the HBO glow way back then,” Mr. Greenblatt said.He rejoined the executive ranks at Showtime, where Mr. Chernin had worked in the 1980s. “When I was at Showtime we were, of course, in the shadow of HBO,” Mr. Greenblatt said.At the time, HBO was known for gritty, male antiheroes like Tony Soprano. Showtime went in a slightly different direction under Mr. Greenblatt, programming shows like “Weeds” with Mary Louise-Parker and “Nurse Jackie” with Edie Falco. A personal favorite for Mr. Greenblatt was “Dexter,” starring the former “Six Feet Under” star Michael C. Hall. Showtime became a serious home for original programming on his watch, with the number of subscribers rising to 19 million, a 52 percent jump over his tenure there.In 2010, as NBC was trying to recover from the decision to replace its 10 p.m. dramas with a nightly Jay Leno talk show, Comcast was closing on its purchase of NBC Universal. When Comcast executives were looking for a new entertainment head, Mr. Chernin suggested his protégé.Mr. Greenblatt orchestrated a turnaround at NBC, taking it from last place to first among viewers 18 to 49 years old, who are prized by advertisers. At the network, he followed the strategy that he has relied on throughout his career: find a difference-maker. At Fox, it was programming teen-friendly soaps when no one else was doing them. At Showtime, it was a new twist on the antihero. At NBC, it was “The Voice,” the uplifting hug-in of a show that struck a new note in a genre dominated by the acerbic “American Idol.” And it was not such a big jump from the heartwarming qualities of “The Voice” to the unapologetically emotional NBC hit “This Is Us.”Mr. Greenblatt also made live musicals an unexpected force on broadcast television, with NBC’s productions of “The Sound of Music,” “The Wiz,” “Hairspray” and “Jesus Christ Superstar,” a winner of five Emmys. And he showed off his musical chops at an NBC presentation for advertisers, accompanying Ms. Parton on piano for a performance of her song “I Will Always Love You.”When Mr. Greenblatt left the network last September, he had his piano — an 1898 Steinway grand, with ivory keys, which he bought at age 20 — moved from his NBC office to his home. But he wasn’t through with show business, saying at the time that he would love to run a company. Once again, his mentor stepped in.Mr. Chernin had a relationship with Mr. Stankey and AT&T’s chief executive, Randall Stephenson, having worked with them on a joint venture called Otter Media, a company AT&T bought last year.“I know he had conversations with John and Randall about me over the last six months or so,” Mr. Greenblatt said. (Mr. Chernin declined to comment for this story.)Now that he has the big job, the work begins. Mr. Greenblatt gave HBO’s programming president, Casey Bloys, a vote of confidence, saying he has done an “extraordinary job.” He also pledged to be a “friend to the creative programmer.”“Nothing is more exciting to me than, ‘Who’s directing? Who’s doing it?’” Mr. Greenblatt said. “All of that is very exciting to me, and I have no doubt I’ll be plugged into all of that.”Mr. Bloys announced last month that HBO would begin rolling out programming on Monday nights, an example of the network’s expanded slate and beefed-up budget. Will that plan continue?“The Monday night thing, I haven’t thought much about,” Mr. Greenblatt said. “The scheduling of these networks are always tricky, less so in the modern age, with streaming platforms and watching things when you want. There’s probably too much programming for Sunday, and maybe Monday makes sense.”In his new role, Mr. Greenblatt will split his time between HBO’s offices in Santa Monica and the Turner Broadcasting offices in Burbank. For the time being, he said, the piano will stay at home.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byLet us help you start your day. By Melina Delkic(Want to get this briefing by email? Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning,We start today with a Brexit delay, a fifth term for Netanyahu and the first image of a black hole.European Union leaders agreed to push the deadline for Britain’s departure from the bloc back to Oct. 31, staving off a chaotic, no-deal exit that was set for Friday. It was longer than Prime Minister Theresa May had hoped for — she proposed June 30, which many found unrealistic. European leaders agreed to review the arrangement at the end of June.At a news conference after a long night of negotiations, Donald Tusk, the European Council president, said the two sides had agreed to what he called “a flexible extension.”What it means: Britain will almost certainly have to hold elections for the European Parliament on May 23 — something Mrs. May once argued would be absurd, given that Britons voted to leave almost three years ago. That prospect will likely anger hard-line Brexit supporters.The path ahead, as you’ve probably guessed, remains a minefield. Benjamin Netanyahu is on course to become Israel’s longest-serving prime minister.With nearly all of the votes from Tuesday’s election counted, the centrist Blue and White alliance led by his rival Benny Gantz conceded, all but confirming that the country will stay on its conservative course. Mr. Netanyahu is widely credited with having built a strong economy and kept Israel secure. He has also delivered long-sought diplomatic victories, several of them with the help of President Trump.What’s next: Mr. Netanyahu, who is likely to be indicted on bribery and fraud charges, is expected to try to persuade his coalition partners to pass a law granting him immunity from prosecution.Signs of division: More than a million Israelis voted for Blue and White, a record for a new party, making it the main alternative to Israel’s right wing.Arab perspective: The election underscored that the dream of a Palestinian state is more remote than ever — as is the chance that the United States will help create it. The Treasury Department said on Wednesday evening that it would not immediately comply with a congressional request to hand over President Trump’s tax returns, setting up a protracted legal battle between two branches of government.Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said in a letter that lawyers needed more time to assess the lawfulness of the request, expressing concern that it would violate taxpayer privacy. It wasn’t clear how long the review would take.Mr. Trump has declined to release his returns on the grounds that the I.R.S. was auditing him — even though no law prevents a taxpayer from releasing returns while under audit.Points of contention: Mr. Mnuchin and many Republicans believe that furnishing the returns could open the floodgates to weaponizing the Internal Revenue Service. Some Democrats say the language in the formal request for the returns does not give Mr. Trump the leeway to refuse it.Astronomers captured the first image of one of the most mysterious entities in the cosmos.A black hole is a cosmic abyss so deep that not even light can escape it. This one was found in the heart of the Messier 87 galaxy, roughly 55 million light-years away. The image, showing a dark circle surrounded by a lopsided ring of light, illustrated a finding that shocked Albert Einstein when his equations predicted it in the early 20th century: that space-time can collapse when too much matter or energy is concentrated in one place.How they did it: Eight radio observatories, spanning six mountains and four continents, observed the galaxy on and off for 10 days in April 2017. The image emerged after two years of computer analysis.Black hole cinema: If you can’t get enough, we rounded up some of the best streamable movies in the black hole canon.Huaraz, a Peruvian city of 130,000, sits about 14 miles below this swelling glacial lake. Many of its residents live in fear that a flood, caused by an avalanche at the lake, could wipe away their homes.Our Sunday magazine’s climate issue looks at how and why a Peruvian farmer has sued a German utility company over global warming — and what the effort might teach us about litigating a problem so enormously complex.Sudan: As protesters continued to demand President Omar Hassan al-Bashir’s ouster, state news media said the military would “issue an important statement soon,” leading to speculation about a possible coup. Snapshot: A smartphone snap from the Sudanese protests has gone viral. The speaker has since been identified as Alaa Salah, a 22-year-old student, above. Some people have dubbed her the Sudanese Statue of Liberty. “Her picture has had resonance far beyond its place of origin,” our chief fashion critic writes.

The true nature of the artist’s Nazi past is now coming to light.New Zealand: Parliament passed a law banning most semiautomatic weapons less than a month after the mass killings in Christchurch. Just one lawmaker opposed it.Travel: JetBlue Airways, the New York-based low-cost carrier, announced that it would begin flying across the Atlantic Ocean, between London and the East Coast of the U.S., in 2021. 2020: Pete Buttigieg, the gay, Christian mayor of South Bend, Ind., and a Democratic candidate for president, is using the language of faith to confront the Christian right on territory they have long claimed as their own.Holy stairs: The marble of a stairwell in Rome said to have been used by Jesus will be revealed to the public for the first time in 300 years. Many who visit the steps ascend on their knees, as an act of penance.Spoken word: One of our Opinion columnists recorded voice memos to remember column ideas and turns of phrase — even full paragraphs and outlines of his articles. He said it revolutionized the way he worked, letting him write the way street photographers shoot — “out in the world, whenever the muse strikes me.”What we’re reading: Comic strips on Instagram. Michael Roston, a science editor, writes: “If you really miss the funny pages in newspapers of yore, try Instagram.

The 13th installment begins in Chicago on Thursday.Disney wants to rally the faithful for the December release of the next “Star Wars” episode. The title is to be announced on Friday.Billions of dollars in movie tickets, merchandise and video-on-demand rentals are on the line.Safe to say it will not be “Episode IX — We Will Keep This Going Until Tatooine Freezes Over.”“Make Alderaan Great Again?” Or a musical? “A Death Star Is Born.”Fans have spent months guessing. A Reddit user floated “Balance of the Force,” citing coding buried on StarWars.com. The subtitles do tend to be something of the something — “Return of the Jedi,” “Attack of the Clones,” “Revenge of the Sith.”The promotion can either help fans to move past their grouchiness over the eighth movie, “The Last Jedi,” or prompt another rebellion that will send Disney marketers to battle positions.That’s it for this briefing.

Hollywood’s love affair with book publishing has been long and varied, touching every cinematic genre. And yet it is a love that dare not spell its name correctly. Despite decades of sending emissaries back and forth from coast to coast, swapping mediums, one side looking for money, the other for legitimacy, we remain strangers to our cousins in storytelling.To be fair, any story set in an industry other than filmmaking is bound to incur infelicities when being handled by people who think filmmaking is the noblest cause. However, because book publishing is a comparatively niche business, the inaccuracies prick the ears. Films about publishing put too fine a point on our role as narrative mulch. In the romantic comedy “The Proposal,” Sandra Bullock plays a big-shot book editor. Early in the film, they (one imagines a producer consensus being reached) have her refer to Don DeLillo as Don “De-lee-lo.” The actor playing the head of the publishing house echoes the pronunciation back to her. De-lee-lo. Light of my airborne toxic event, fire of my nuclear war. “The Proposal” was released in 2009 but was apparently filmed in a bunker with no internet access. If this sounds nitpicky, I might remind you that I was not the one who decided Don DeLillo was famous enough to plop into a major studio script.More recently, in the charming series “Younger,” Miriam Shor plays Diana Trout, the head of marketing at a boutique publishing house. Diana has an award on her desk from “the London lit fair,” which absolutely no one calls it. As the seasons unfurl, the nonsense piles up: Someone from publicity asks what “PEN” stands for; editors have publicists; publishing houses sell books to other publishing houses; authors take editors with them when they switch publishers; a small company with a “Game of Thrones”-level franchise is somehow in constant danger of bankruptcy; and members of the editorial staff spew impossible commands like “We’re on tight launch for the fall … so I will need marketing and cover artwork by the end of this week.” Have these people met a managing editor? They’d be lucky to walk away with some of their fingers.Happily, once realism has been pulped like the first print run of a fraudulent memoir, the fun can begin. In “Younger,” as in “Fifty Shades of Grey,” a woman who looks as if she couldn’t legally rent a car is given her own publishing company; Joan Didion is allegedly spotted “hoarding gift bags”; there’s concern an author will be “scooped up by those mouth breathers at Little Brown”; and the (actual) host of “Bookworm,” a nationally syndicated radio show, grills an author about her sex life. Meanwhile, the series is not without its flashes of spine-chilling verisimilitude: “Black tie means black tie,” Diana says before an awards ceremony. “No color. This isn’t the Grammys!”Historically, book publishing works best on film when it functions as a springboard to a different world. “Fatal Attraction” is about a book editor but, well, is it? A children’s book is intentionally printed with pages missing in “Elf.” But, well, Santa. “The Last Days of Disco” is partially set at a publishing house. We easily forgive the film’s suggestion that one needs a best seller to be promoted to associate editor — in fact, the job title is a stopgap, a means of promoting an assistant while taking away her overtime — because “The Last Days of Disco” is not about publishing. It’s a comedy of manners about New York in the early 1980s, not “The Last Days of Carbon Copies.”Few movies really succeed as both realism and entertainment. One is “The Scoundrel,” starring Noël Coward as a pretentious publisher. It’s filled with jabs like “I refuse to make money improving people’s morals, it’s a vulgar way to swindle the public,” and “This anteroom is fairly quivering with outraged geniuses.” But it was released in 1935. And while plenty of movies and shows since have done well by the actual writing life (“The Ghost Writer,” “Wonder Boys,” “Bored to Death”), “The Scoundrel” is a rare bird. The closest approximation of it I’ve seen is “Wolf” (1994), a campy film in which an editor, played by Jack Nicholson, and a marketing director, played by James Spader, turn into werewolves as Michelle Pfeiffer looks on, blondly. “Wolf” does wonders with the publishing world before it starts howling at the moon. The desks are messy, the offices are quirky, Time Warner is derided as “a multinational media conglomerate,” Nicholson uses his newfound wolf powers to edit without his glasses and a publisher is advised never to “stint on review copies.”It’s rarely said that Hollywood is coming from a good place, but in the case of book publishing, I believe it is. Its skewed depictions often seem careless or condescending, but they stem from a healthy desire to superimpose tension. No one wants to read about grass growing but what they really don’t want to do is watch grass growing. So what’s a little blackmail between editors?At least Hollywood’s version of book publishing is consistent in its warped ideas: Every company is publicly owned, and there is zero padding between a junior copy editor and “the board” or “the shareholders.” And everyone’s jobs are completely interchangeable. So long as you have the capacity to leave the office and come back, you can acquire a book, start an imprint, poach an author, triple a budget or sell movie rights (the irony!). You don’t have to tell anyone you’re doing it, either. Make like you’re in “Good Will Hunting”: Scribble the answers on the chalkboard and run.But by far the strangest and most glaring commonality is the presumption of glamour. This stems from a conflation with magazine publishing along with a belief that an audience will tune out unless glitter is sprayed in their eyes. Story lines are chock-a-block with perks like fashion fittings, “company seats” and name-brand coffee. Central to the ethos of book publishing is the notion that everything cool is being pushed out, nothing cool is coming in. This is what binds us, publishers and writers alike. We try to sneak books into your house and under your pillow. We crumble them over your food when you’re not looking. In return? Bupkis. Only after you’ve worked at a publishing house for so many decades you literally can’t walk do we let you take an Uber home.So why does Hollywood keep trying if publishing is such a tough code to crack? Perhaps it’s because everyone likes a challenge. More likely, it’s because they know we have a secret. They know there’s something lasting and human and world-changing and completely bonkers that we’re hiding behind our molasses-like culture and confounding royalty statements. At the end of “The Last Days of Disco,” after everyone’s been laid off from their respective industries, Chloë Sevigny’s character is the only one left employed — as an associate editor.“I don’t envy her though,” says Kate Beckinsale’s character. “Stuck in book publishing.”Oh, it’s not as bad as it looks. One can’t believe everything one sees on screen.Sloane Crosley is the author, most recently, of “Look Alive Out There,” a collection of essays.Follow New York Times Books on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, sign up for our newsletter or our literary calendar.

Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning,We start today with a surge in border crossings, renewed activity at a North Korean launch site, and F.D.A. approval for a fast-acting antidepressant.More than 76,000 migrants crossed the border without authorization in February, an 11-year high and a sign that stepped-up prosecutions, new controls on asylum and harsher detention policies have not discouraged families fleeing violence and poverty.“The system is well beyond capacity, and remains at the breaking point,” Kevin McAleenan, commissioner of Customs and Border Protection, said on Tuesday.President Trump has used the numbers to justify expanding the wall along the 1,900-mile border with Mexico, although many analysts say that would do little to slow migration.Closer look: In the past, undocumented immigrants were mostly single men from Mexico, but that’s no longer the case. We examined who’s coming and what’s driving them.Background: The migration numbers are higher than they have been in recent years, but they’re nowhere near historical levels. Arrests for illegally crossing the border reached about 1.64 million in 2000. In the 2018 fiscal year, there were 396,579.After Kim Jong-un first met with President Trump last year, North Korea began dismantling a site used to launch satellites and test technologies for its missile program.The country is now rebuilding the site, Sohae Satellite Launching Station,  according to American military analysts and South Korean intelligence officials. The news came on Tuesday, soon after Mr. Kim returned from Vietnam following the breakdown of his second meeting with Mr. Trump.Why it matters: The renewed activity could indicate that Pyongyang is preparing to end its moratorium on missile tests. But South Korean intelligence officials reportedly told lawmakers that North Korea had been rebuilding the facilities even earlier, possibly to make their dismantling more dramatic if a deal was reached with the U.S.About a quarter of the 16 million American adults with depression gain little or no benefit from existing treatments. That could change with a fast-acting prescription nasal spray derived from ketamine that the Food and Drug Administration approved on Tuesday.Though the antidepressant properties of ketamine, an anesthetic, are not well understood, the drug indicates a new approach to treating mood problems, experts said.Also in health news: There is no association between the measles vaccine and autism, a new study found, confirming what has long been widely accepted in the scientific community. During his first year in office, the president routinely signed checks to Michael Cohen, then his lawyer, who has said they were compensation for hush payments to two women who claimed they had had affairs with Mr. Trump. In total, Mr. Trump or his trust paid Mr. Cohen $420,000, according to federal prosecutors, who say the payments were part of a scheme directed by Mr. Trump to violate campaign finance laws.How we know: Mr. Cohen provided two checks to Congress to support his testimony last week, and his lawyer provided six additional checks to The Times this week. Response: The White House referred questions about the payments to Mr. Trump’s private lawyers. Jay Sekulow, one of his personal lawyers, had no comment, and a lawyer for the Trump Organization declined to comment.Related: Mr. Trump has suggested the White House might not cooperate with an expansive document request by House Democrats scrutinizing whether he obstructed justice or abused power.When a bridge in Genoa, Italy, collapsed last August, killing 43 people, it set off a criminal inquiry and a public relations crisis for the Benettons, the Italian family that controls Autostrade, the road operator that managed the bridge.Though the family, which is more famous for its fashion brand, is not accused of any wrongdoing, it is facing angry questions about big profits and lax regulation. Anti-Semitism resolution: The House is likely to vote on Thursday on a resolution condemning anti-Semitism, widely seen as a reaction to anti-Israel remarks by Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota.F.D.A. resignation: Scott Gottlieb, the head of the Food and Drug Administration, announced on Tuesday that he would step down at the end of the month.The 2020 election: Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, and Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon have both said they won’t be seeking the Democratic nomination for president. Here’s the state of the field. Ex-auto chief is released: Carlos Ghosn, the former Nissan Motor chairman facing charges of financial wrongdoing in Japan, was released on bail today after being held in a Tokyo jail since November.Snapshot: Above, the annual Royal Shrovetide Football game in Ashbourne, England, which has been played for hundreds of years. The two-day contest, which concludes today, involves thousands of players, split into two teams (Up’ards and Down’ards) depending on which side of the Henmore River they were born on. The field of play is the town itself, and the goals are miles apart.Architectural honor: The Pritzker Prize has been given to Arata Isozaki, who combines Western and Japanese influences. Here’s what to know about the award.Late-night comedy: Jimmy Kimmel welcomed the arrival of Mardi Gras: “The official slogan of Mardi Gras is ‘Laissez les bons temps rouler,’ which is French for ‘I vomited in an Uber today.’” What we’re reading: This commentary in The Boston Globe, about the killing of Jassy Correia. Andrea Kannapell, the Briefings editor, writes: “Women often urge their friends to ‘text me when you get home.’ As this column explains, it’s an impulse that we shouldn’t have to have, yet still do.”Cook: Tuna packed in olive oil is a nice addition to pasta with fresh herbs, lemon and peas. (Our Five Weeknight Dishes newsletter has more recommendations.)Listen: These eight clips present the range of André Previn, who made a mark on Broadway and in Hollywood, on the classical concert stage and in the jazz club.Go: “Jean-Michel Basquiat,” the inaugural exhibition of the Brant Foundation’s space in Manhattan, has nearly 70 works by the painter.Watch: There’s a new trailer for the final season of “Game of Thrones.” Join us in rewatching the series. Smarter Living: Listening can feel like a lost art. Think of it as meditation: Clear your mind and focus on what’s being said. Put your phone down, and step away from your computer. And the product experts at Wirecutter, a Times company, recommend six fitness items that travel well.Thugs: It seems the world is full of them.Michael Cohen, President Trump’s former personal lawyer, painted himself as a “thug’s thug” in public testimony, our Op-Ed columnist Maureen Dowd wrote.Leaders, including Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela, Kim Jong-un of North Korea and Narendra Modi of India, have been called thugs, too.The word can be traced to “thag,” a Hindi word meaning “thief” or “con man,” whose roots go back to Sanskrit.It’s believed that for centuries, gangs of thieves and assassins called thugs operated throughout India. In thrall to Kali, the goddess of destruction, they were said to commit “thuggee” — setting up and often strangling victims.In the 1800s, the British, who were beginning to spread across the country, decided to put a stop to them.Under the leadership of Lord William Bentinck, thousands of people identified as thugs were captured, convicted and sentenced. In the 1830s, thugs were declared “destroyed.”Some now question whether thugs were as destructive as reported in colonial representations.Lent starts today, and, in the spirit of repentance, we’d like to thank readers who pointed out a couple of oversights in yesterday’s Back Story, about Mardi Gras king cakes. The photograph we used was not of what’s traditionally thought of as a king cake, but of a king cake-themed doberge cake from a bakery in New Orleans. And we failed to mention that, while Mardi Gras is widely associated with New Orleans, the celebration got its start in the U.S. in Mobile, Ala.That’s it for this briefing.

The outline of the interference effort has always been easy to make out, but key questions about its significance — Could Russia really affect voter sentiment by posting? Did trolls really lower voter turnout in key states? — are still, in large part, matters for speculation. And the committee’s findings did little to change that.On the subject of Facebook, for example, the reports analyzed new internal data on the campaign efforts of the Internet Research Agency, Russia’s “troll farm,” and offered some examples of its work. We know that there were more than 76 million “engagements” with content from the Russian group — likes, comments, shares and clicks — but it is not currently possible to know how many came from real people. “Since Facebook did not provide data about any sock-puppet accounts involved in the distribution of the content or the existence of ‘fake Likes’ from these accounts,” one report says, “we are operating under the assumption that this engagement was from real people and that this content was pushed into the News Feeds of their Friends as well.”Those are two enormous leaps. We do not currently know for sure whether these engagements were carried out by humans or bots or a mixture of the two, so the researchers were left to assume the worst. It’s worth scanning other recent Facebook narratives for similar assumptions. Did Facebook cause the gilets jaunes protests in France? Is the movement “a beast born almost entirely from Facebook,” as a recent BuzzFeed piece suggested? Or are the protesters just using Facebook as they sustain a long tradition of civil unrest in France?The latter theory is obscured by the basic difficulty of discerning why an individual feels a certain way, much less a diverse nation of millions. The former, however, feels as though it has been hidden from us, because Facebook should, in theory, be able to shed light on this question. Its users live in a state of full surveillance, with them and everything around them subject to near-total tracking. The company is at least capable of knowing how a piece of content found its way from one user to thousands or how a gilets jaunes group functions on the social platform. Far more than any outside researchers, Facebook is capable of answering questions about the Internet Research Agency in 2016: For example, how many of the accounts that interacted with the group’s posts went on to interact with other political content? Was the audience for these posts even real in the first place or part of the operation itself? (Both reports criticized tech companies for doing the bare minimum to assist in the committee’s efforts.)The biggest internet platforms are businesses built on asymmetric information. They know far more about their advertising, labor and commerce marketplaces than do any of the parties participating in them. We can guess, but can’t know, why we were shown a friend’s Facebook post about a divorce, instead of another’s about a child’s birth. We can theorize, but won’t be told, why YouTube thinks we want to see a right-wing polemic about Islam in Europe after watching a video about travel destinations in France. Everything that takes place within the platform kingdoms is enabled by systems we’re told must be kept private in order to function. We’re living in worlds governed by trade secrets. No wonder they’re making us all paranoid.The original sin of our current tech hegemons is that in order to work, the rest of the world can’t know how they work. How does Google trawl the web and produce search results? That’s a secret that helped it become the dominant search engine and that sustains its business model. How does Facebook choose what comes next in your News Feed? How do YouTube recommendations work? Too much transparency, the defense goes, would expose them to reverse-engineering or abuse by bad actors.The technologist Anil Dash recently described some of the internet’s biggest platform businesses as “fake markets.” These are businesses that purport to be marketplaces, making money by connecting parties — people who want rides with drivers, advertisers with eyeballs — but are not actually markets in the strict sense of the word. They’re centrally and often assertively managed and manipulated. Some hardly resemble markets at all. Dash singled out Uber: In that “market,” drivers don’t set prices, consumers don’t actually have much choice and resources are allocated by trade-secret algorithms. Our ignorance of how such things work is easier to ignore when a platform is establishing itself and sharing the benefits of its growth. This dynamic only starts to bother us after a platform wins, when there are fewer alternatives or none at all.When platforms become entrenched and harder for users to leave, the secrets they keep are reflected back to them as resentments. On Facebook, where every user’s experience is a mystery to all others — and where real-world concepts like privacy, obscurity and serendipity have been recreated on the terms of an advertising platform — users understandably imagine that anything could be happening around them: that their peers are being indoctrinated, tricked, sheltered or misled on a host of issues. These gaps in knowledge are magnified once a platform becomes involved in real-world events. Twitter is broadly understood to be a catalytic political force, but this understanding is usually half hunch — its relationship to the Arab Spring is still in dispute; its usefulness to Donald Trump will never be fully understood; and Twitter seems to be in no hurry to help figure it out. Similarly: Is YouTube reflecting a rise in reactionary politics, enabling it or creating it? These are already impossible questions to answer in full; that everything is unfolding inside of a closely guarded attention marketplace makes them difficult to even approach.So, did Facebook cause the gilets jaunes uprising in France? Maybe, interesting theory; meanwhile, though, I don’t even know why it’s recommending I friend someone I’ve never heard of. Did Facebook swing the 2016 election? Could have, as far as we know; anyway, I can’t even guess why Instagram started showing me a bunch of photos of a certain breed of dog or why it’s suddenly serving me ads for meal kits. I know how these things make me feel, but Facebook knows how they made me behave — knowledge it won’t soon share.It appears to be the tendency of the press, and of our imaginations in general, to extend these theories in a particular direction. After years of Facebook’s telling us how good it is at connecting people and influencing their decisions, it is tempting to say something like: Yes, O.K., then wouldn’t it have been easy to use these same tools to persuade people to vote for Donald Trump? Facebook has equivocated on this question in a telling way. It’s helpful to imagine what it would have to say to successfully combat claims Russia used its platform to swing the election: Sure, this many users saw propaganda but only for a moment; and besides, this content didn’t seem to affect their behavior in any way at all; sure, this amount of money was spent on ads, but those ads don’t appear to have done anything; yes, these Instagram accounts had that many followers, but more than half of them were bots themselves; O.K., 76 million people were exposed to this content in some way or another, but they mostly glossed over it, like spam.They’ve inched tellingly in this direction but going all the way would involve unflattering disclosure — the sort that would need to be legally compelled. Mainly, it would be tantamount to admitting that the systems we’re not allowed to know about — and the metrics we aren’t allowed to see — might not be quite as valuable, or as worthy of trade secrecy, as Facebook needs us to think they are. While it’s true that perceptions of the tech industry have shifted, they aren’t necessarily closer to reality. These companies mythologized their own omniscience when it was a boon to their business. Versions of these myths persist, but they’re no longer under their creator’s control — and they’re starting to bite back.John Herrman is a technology reporter for The Times.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byThe food writers Matt Lee and Ted Lee took jobs with a high-end New York caterer for a book that explores this little-understood but hugely influential business.By Kim SeversonOne June night in 2011, the food-writing brothers Matt and Ted Lee showed up to support a fellow Southerner who was cooking at the James Beard House.The 1840s brick townhouse in Greenwich Village where Beard once lived is a showplace for chefs looking for validation from the foundation that runs it. But it’s a notoriously stressful place to cook. The kitchen is hot and small, with limited access for prepping food. If you screw up in front of the influential guests, a shot at a national reputation can be dashed before dessert is served.Their friend, the chef Steven Satterfield of Miller Union restaurant in Atlanta, had to knock out 80 servings each of sautéed quail and braised oxtail crépinette, delicate dishes that can overcook in a minute. So he enlisted help from three of the best catering cooks in the city. As the Lee brothers watched, they unzipped their backpacks, unrolled the dish towels that held their knives and attacked the kitchen like Navy SEALs swarming a ship commandeered by Somali pirates.Later that night over drinks, the catering cooks said the dinner had been as easy as rolling out of bed. Try cooking 1,400 lamb chops to a perfect medium-rare at the same time, using nothing but sheet pans, Sterno and an upright aluminum cabinet on wheels called a hot box.[Learn how to talk like a caterer.]The Lees, who until that point considered catering the elevator music of the culinary arts, found themselves falling into a rabbit hole that would consume them for the next four years.They went undercover as catering cooks, and their dive into the world of mercenaries who work the fanciest parties in town has produced the new book “Hotbox: Inside Catering, the Food World’s Riskiest Business” (Henry Holt & Company, 2019). It’s a revelatory, detail-rich and often breathless examination of a cutthroat world where the demanding clients include billionaires and celebrity brides but the cooking conditions resemble a mobile Army hospital.The subject is a ripe one. A $12 billion-dollar-a-year industry in the United States, catering is rarely examined by food journalists or considered by diners, who are more focused on restaurants. Its influence is quiet but powerful. If you’ve ever had a miniature lobster roll, or sipped soup from a shot glass at a party, or attended a pop-up dinner, you can thank a caterer.Nowhere is catering practiced with as much cunning and challenge as in New York City. On any given week — and especially during the wedding and gala seasons — hundreds of thousands of people eat food cooked by caterers.Sometimes the meals are as low-stakes as a snack between sessions at a mind-numbing conference. Other times, a badly prepared $2,000-a-plate meal can hurt a charity that hoped to open wallets over short ribs with horseradish cream.It’s astonishing that the business doesn’t get the attention or respect afforded restaurants, the Lees write, “considering all that these catering chefs are up against and regularly conquer — their nerve-rattling tightrope sprints through A-list celebrity territory, the exquisite food torture, a season’s worth of MacGyver-y kitchen rescues that throw propriety, food safety, and convention out the door because ‘we have to make this work right now!’”The book is a departure for the Lee brothers, whose previous titles have been cookbooks, and whose other ventures include a Southern-food-of-the-month club, television work and, since 2013, a bespoke catering business in partnership with Duvall, an event planner in Charleston, S.C., where the two grew up.Ted Lee, 47, lives in Brooklyn with his wife, the artist E.V. Day. Matt Lee, 49, is raising three sons in Charleston with his wife, Gia Lee, a schoolteacher and real-estate agent.In some ways, the brothers were primed for the task. From 2004 to 2006, they wrote a column for The New York Times Magazine called The Industry, in which they spent time with produce buyers, cake movers and other unsung restaurant workers.“Hotbox” was also a chance to get off the cookbook conveyor belt.“We were at a pivot point,” Ted Lee said. “How much more does the world need to hear from two white guys who grew up in Charleston in the 1980s about how they cook?”To immerse themselves in the catering business, they persuaded Patrick Phelan, then the executive chef of the upscale New York caterer Sonnier & Castle and one of the chefs who swooped in to help Mr. Satterfield, to hire them.Taking turns, they worked for $10 an hour in the prep kitchen or for $25 an hour during the event — what in catering parlance is called the fiesta shift, when time is a cruel overlord and small mistakes have huge implications.The book explores their struggles to build 240 pepper-crusted beef-on-brioche snacks with celery root salad for the Park Avenue Armory gala in 2015, or peel 800 hard-boiled eggs to help Royal Caribbean cruises introduce a new line of restaurants to 1,400 guests. They handed hot Cafe du Monde beignets to Nancy Pelosi before she became speaker of the House, and grilled hot dogs to Martha Stewart at a $1.5 million Labor Day party in the Hamptons.The brothers became enamored of the tricks of the trade, which insiders refer to as “sheet-pan magic.” Did someone forget the colanders back at the main kitchen? Use a ballpoint pen to punch holes in the bottom of an aluminum foil pan. In a pinch, two metal hangers from the coat check can be fashioned into a whisk.Commandeer a woven bread basket if you can’t find any other way to dust 500 chocolate mousse cups with powdered sugar. And if a drunken uncle’s wedding speech is dragging on too long, you’d better figure out a way to keep the salmon warm without overcooking it.Their teachers through much of the journey were Jorge and Juan Soto, brothers from Mexico whom they met that night at the Beard House. The Sotos are masters of the hot box, the wheeled cabinet, with racks perfectly sized to hold sheet pans, that is the secret to New York catering.The boxes are meant to transport food, not cook it. But in New York, which restricts the use of propane and open flame, the boxes are deployed as bootleg ovens. With enough cans of Sterno and strategically placed sheet pans, a good catering chef can bring hundreds of rare filets mignons that had been browned in a deep-fat fryer back at the prep kitchen to temperature in a back room at the New York Public Library or the Whitney Museum of American Art.Conversely, fill a tray with dry ice, and the box can become an instant refrigerator.“It’s an insanely analog system,” they write, “a bit like piloting a hot air balloon, but it’s ruthlessly efficient, self-contained, safe, scalable, and cost-effective to run.”The Lees credit Jean-Claude Nédélec with inventing the hot-box system. Mr. Nédélec developed it and other essential pieces of off-site catering stagecraft when he was the banquet chef at the Plaza Hotel in the 1960s. He went on to become the executive chef at Glorious Food, a catering company that started in an apartment on 48th Street in the 1970s and dominated New York catering for two decades. But it was Donald Bruce White — a former Broadway actor who began his food career as a bit player on “Josie’s Kitchen,” a local cooking show that predated Julia Child’s “The French Chef” — who created the city’s modern catering industry in 1962, the Lees report.In what seems a foreshadowing of Uber Eats, Mr. White started delivering same-day meals ordered by telephone. Soon, he was directing entire parties in Park Avenue apartments.By the 1970s, New York was a city that loved catering. Martha Stewart jumped into the game, as did the powerhouse caterer Liz Neumark of Great Performances.By the 1980s, caterers had become full-fledged event planners, and their parties were as flashy as the decade. Charities began to use galas as fund-raising opportunities. Institutions like the Metropolitan Opera realized there was money to be made renting out space for lavish events. Casting cater waiters became an industry unto itself.By the 1990s, a new age of restaurant culture had dawned, and catering customers were demanding restaurant-quality food. Chefs like Daniel Boulud jumped into the game, but plenty of others realized it was one they didn’t like playing.“The way that a caterer thinks about feeding people in a large group setting is not the same as the way a chef thinks about it,” Mr. Satterfield said in an interview. “You need that catering mind.”The chef Bobby Flay told the Lees that when he opened a catering division of his Mesa Grill restaurant group around 1997, it “was the worst year of my life.”The Instagram era has brought a new level of performance to catered food, with meringues floating through parties suspended under white balloons, and waiters pedaling raw bars fashioned from wheelbarrows and bicycles. Tech and finance billionaires have raised the ante, too. One client, the Lee brothers report, regularly pays a young caterer to smuggle poulet de Bresse chickens from Paris on a Gulfstream jet at $200,000 a trip.It’s also an era of ultra-customization, which is the antithesis of catering. Couples don’t want a traditional fairy-tale wedding, they want a tale that’s never been told, the Lees write. Caterers are handed elaborate and often confusing menus that are meaningful to the couple but daunting to execute.The biggest headaches for modern caterers, the brothers posit, are food preferences and intolerances dressed in food-allergy drag. The elaborate assembly-line system designed to deliver hundreds of perfect plates in a 15-minute window is getting gummed up with special requests. Waiters face a barrage of questions from guests who want to know whether the main course contains soy or nightshades, or if the vegetarian option is laced with dairy.“Every clever caterer nowadays packs a pile of washed salad greens, a soy-free dressing, and a sheet pan of dry-grilled vegetables for occasions when it’s just impossible to make that one person happy,” they write.A nice side effect of the brothers’ time in the trenches is that they have become better home cooks. Throwing a dinner party for 10, once a stressful proposition, is a breeze.Their kitchens are better organized before and during a party, and they’ve started using the building blocks of a good catering kitchen: square, stackable Cambro containers and small plastic deli tubs. They’ve also become more comfortable making food ahead of time, and don’t worry about whether it’s kept at the absolute safest temperature.“We are so much more confident now because we’ve seen what’s possible on a huge scale,” Matt Lee said.And they’ve become better guests at catered events. When the cocktail hour ends and the chime rings for everyone to take their seats, they do.“When the service captain tells you sit, stop talking and sit,” Ted Lee said. “It’s critical. The quality of the salmon is at stake.”Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.

That can be optional,” another one said. “Try today — $99.”The sites, Roman and Hers, as well as others now make obtaining lifestyle drugs for sexual health, hair loss and anxiety nearly as easy as ordering dinner online.On the sites, people self-diagnose and select the drug they want, then enter some personal health and credit card information. A doctor then assesses their choice, with no in-person consultation. If approved, the medicine arrives in the mail days or weeks later.The sites invert the usual practice of medicine by turning the act of prescribing drugs into a service. Instead of doctors making diagnoses and then suggesting treatments, patients request drugs and physicians serve largely as gatekeepers.Some of these companies operate in a regulatory vacuum that could increase public health risks, according to interviews with physicians, former federal health regulators and legal experts. And federal and state health laws, written to ensure competent medical care and drug safety, have not kept pace with online services, they say.“It’s restaurant-menu medicine,” said Arthur L. Caplan, a medical ethics professor at New York University School of Medicine.After answering questions online, two reporters for The New York Times in California gained approval for generic Viagra prescriptions through Roman and Hims, a site run by the same start-up that owns the Hers site. A third Times reporter ordered Addyi, the libido drug, through Hers.Whether the sites’ screening processes are sufficient is open to interpretation. This year, a doctor in California, who had prescribed Viagra online through a site called KwikMed.com, surrendered his medical license after the state’s medical board accused him of failing to provide standard medical care like examining the patient and taking vital signs.Some start-ups, like Kick Health, sell blood pressure pills or other prescription drugs for unapproved uses like calming the symptoms of performance anxiety.One drug, Addyi, which can cause fainting if taken with alcohol, arrived without the necessary safety warning protocols created by the drug’s manufacturer.Much like Uber, which argues that it is not a transportation company even as it connects drivers and passengers, the drug sites argue that they are tech platforms, not health providers. The sites connect consumers — and often process their payments — to doctors who may prescribe drugs and pharmacies that can ship the medications.To comply with state laws, the doctors work for separate companies that cater to the sites. The doctors are typically paid for each health consultation, or by the hour, not the number of prescriptions written. The sites generate revenue for themselves by charging service or processing fees to consumers, the doctors or both.Kick, Roman and Hims each said they complied with laws and did not influence the doctors’ prescribing decisions.Zachariah Reitano, the chief executive of Ro, the owner of Roman, said his site encouraged people to tend to their health who might not otherwise have done so.“It provides more convenient, higher-quality, more affordable care for certain conditions and saves people a lot of time and energy,” Mr. Reitano said.Justin Ip, the chief executive of Kick, said his company was “trying to be careful and cautious” about complying with health laws. He added that federal marketing restrictions on drug makers did not apply to his company.Federal drug marketing rules apply to drug manufacturers, drug distributors, packers and their representatives. Whether the consumer drug sites fall into any of those categories is an unsettled question. And there is no single federal or state agency in charge of overseeing online prescription drug services.“Where are the regulatory agencies in this?” asked Dr. C. Neill Epperson, a women’s behavioral health expert at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. “How can this just be O.K.?”The new wave of sites that market drugs directly to consumers began popping up several years ago, promising to streamline medical care with software.Several gained traction with cheeky TV commercials, billboard ads and social media feeds featuring sexual imagery like cactuses. They use slick packaging, wrapping doses of Viagra in condom-size envelopes or sending chocolate along with birth control pills.The premise is so attractive to investors that Hims and Ro have raised nearly $100 million each. They have also tapped experts for advice, including Dr. Joycelyn Elders, a former surgeon general who is a medical adviser to Ro, and men’s health specialists at leading hospitals.Dr. Elders said she had signed on to advise Ro to promote accurate information about sexual health.Nurx, a San Francisco start-up that markets contraceptives for women, has raised more than $41 million. Keeps, a hair loss treatment site for men, is based in New York and has raised nearly $23 million.“We believe this is a radical new way of providing care — by changing unstructured interactions into structured care, by shifting work from M.D.s to algorithms where possible,” Andy Weissman, a managing partner at Union Square Ventures, wrote in a blog post in 2016 after his firm led an investment round in Nurx.For people who get nervous before public speaking, there is Kick, a San Francisco start-up that operates in 12 states. The site offers consumers a blood pressure drug,  propranolol, to calm a racing heart and shaking hands.But the site’s home page did not disclose that the medication was not federally approved to treat anxiety. In fact, it suggested the opposite: “FDA approved prescriptions tailored to you,” the home page said.After queries from a reporter, the site added a sentence on a drug information page noting that prescribing propranolol for anxiety was “off-label” — or not federally approved.The Food and Drug Administration generally prohibits pharmaceutical companies from marketing medicines for unapproved uses, as they have not been federally vetted for safety and effectiveness. Over the last decade, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson have each paid fines of more than $2 billion to settle government charges of illegally marketing unapproved drug uses.Doctors are permitted to practice medicine as they see fit, including prescribing drugs for unapproved uses. Mr. Ip of Kick noted that doctors regularly prescribed propranolol to treat anxiety.But state and professional ethical standards typically require doctors to establish relationships with new patients, and examine them, before prescribing a drug. The interactions with physicians through the sites can be quite limited.After submitting the information to Hims and being charged, a reporter received a message from a doctor saying he was a good candidate for erectile dysfunction treatment and asking if he had any questions. The reporter had no questions and ordered the drug.Roman, Hims and Kick each said they designed their systems to ask the questions doctors would ask of new patients. The companies said the questions changed based on a person’s previous answers, allowing for individualized diagnoses. The companies use algorithms to flag or weed out people with medical conditions, like high blood pressure, that could make certain prescriptions inappropriate.Some states specifically prohibit doctors from relying solely on online questionnaires to prescribe drugs to new patients. Hims, Kick and Roman said their processes were interactive and should not be considered questionnaires.In Ohio, state regulators said doctors must — at a minimum — communicate with patients in real time, through audio or video, to meet their standards.But Spence Bailey of Columbus, Ohio, said he had never spoken to a doctor by phone or on video when ordering hair loss medication from Hims, communicating only through the site’s messaging system.He said he was satisfied, but canceled his monthly subscription because it was too expensive.Hims said it complied with state medical board rules.On some sites, it can be unclear who is reviewing consumers’ health data and prescribing the drugs.A reporter in California who requested generic Viagra through Roman received a message from a doctor, including his name and a link to a page listing his medical school, qualifications and state licenses.But a different reporter in California, who requested generic Viagra through Hims, received a message without a doctor’s name.After being asked about the interaction by a Times reporter, the company said it had changed its software to require doctors to include their medical credentials on such messages.A week or two after reporters were approved for prescriptions, the medications arrived in discreet packages.A shipment of the Addyi libido pills, from Postmeds, a pharmacy based in Hayward, Calif., came with a colorful “usage guide.” “It’s time to get busy,” the guide said.The Hers questionnaire, as well as an online message from the doctor, had explicitly warned about fainting risks that can arise from taking the drugs with alcohol. But the usage guide made no mention of it. That potential danger was included only in the required F.D.A. information insert printed in a tiny typeface.Pharmacists dispensing Addyi “must counsel all patients on the need to avoid alcohol” with every prescription, according to protocols created by Sprout Pharmaceuticals, the drug’s manufacturer.Instead, the pills came with a card providing a phone number for a “drug consultation” with Postmeds.“The idea here is that there must be an added layer of professional counseling,” said Ned Milenkovich, a pharmacist and lawyer with the firm Much Shelist in Chicago.Cindy Eckert, Sprout’s chief executive, referred questions to Hers and the pharmacies it uses. Hers referred questions to Postmeds. Umar Afridi, Postmeds’ chief executive, said the required medical insert contained the alcohol warning, satisfying the counseling requirements.The start-ups have stayed under the regulatory radar partly by arguing that they are not health providers. But the lines between the companies and the entities handling the prescribing can blur.Ro’s terms of use policy says that another company, Roman Pennsylvania Medical, provides the sites’ doctors. And Mr. Reitano, Ro’s chief executive, said the start-up’s clinical directors and the owners of the physician company did not hold equity in Ro.But Roman Pennsylvania has the same address in New York as Ro, according to business registration documents. Its president, Dr. Tzvi Doron, is a Ro clinical director.Keeps, the hair-loss site, also has links to a physician corporation, KMG Medical Group, that supplies doctors to its users. Steven Gutentag, Keeps’s chief executive, said that KMG was an independent corporation and that Keeps did not control the doctors’ decisions.But the two entities are closely related. Keeps’s customers pay KMG Medical Group for their doctor consultations, and KMG pays Keeps’s parent company, Thirty Madison, for the patient software it uses and other business services.Then there is Dr. Michael Demetrius Karagas, a Texas physician who is KMG Medical Group’s owner. He, too, has close ties to Keeps: He is the father of one of its co-founders, Demetri Michael Karagas. Dr. Karagas did not respond to requests for comment.Mike Isaac, Jack Nicas and Tess Riski contributed reporting.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Winnie Hu[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]Los Angeles traffic is so bad that buses crawl along at less than 12 miles an hour. In San Francisco, car speeds have fallen to 10 miles per hour. And Seattle’s streets are so choked the city needs to find ways to have fewer cars altogether.Major cities across the United States are facing increasingly clogged roads and have had frustratingly little success in dealing with them. But now that New York has adopted congestion pricing in Manhattan, the rest of the country is far more likely to seriously consider embracing such a policy — even though it was once considered politically toxic, according to municipal officials and transportation analysts.“New York’s use of congestion pricing could be a game-changer,” said Travis Brouwer, an assistant transportation director in Oregon, which has considered congestion pricing for traffic-jammed Portland.“If New York City can prove that congestion pricing can work and gain public acceptance, it could give cities like Portland a boost as we look to introduce pricing.”New York, the country’s largest city, will charge drivers to enter Manhattan’s most congested neighborhoods as a way to raise money for public transit and to persuade people to abandon their cars. The tolls are expected to start in 2021.Philadelphia is now considering congestion pricing for the first time, closely watching New York’s move, “to see how this can help improve equity, safety, sustainability and mobility,” said Kelly Cofrancisco, a spokeswoman for Philadelphia’s mayor, Jim Kenney.Los Angeles and San Francisco are already conducting studies to lay the groundwork for congestion pricing, and Seattle’s mayor, Jenny Durkan, is leading efforts to have congestion pricing in place by the end of her first term in 2021.“It really does help to be able to point to some peer city and say ‘They’re doing this and it’s working,’” said Michael Manville, an associate professor of urban planning at The University of California, Los Angeles, who has advised Los Angeles on congestion pricing. “At the very least, it changes the conversation in other cities.”Not everyone is ready to sign up. Kathryn Barger, a Los Angeles county supervisor, has raised concerns that congestion pricing could unfairly penalize drivers in communities with limited public transit, where “driving isn’t a choice, it’s a necessity.”A handful of cities in Europe and Asia already have congestion pricing in place; it has helped clear roads in London, Stockholm and Singapore. But it has also been assailed by drivers and critics as an unfair tax that hurts the poor.Fueled by an economic boom, a revival of urban areas, a proliferation of Uber and Lyft cars and an explosive growth in package deliveries propelled by the rise of Amazon, the average speed in urban downtowns fell to 15 miles per hour last year, down from 18 miles per hour in 2015, according to INRIX, a transportation analytics company.“I believe the time has finally arrived to explore congestion relief pricing in major cities,” said Phil Washington, the chief executive of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority. “Here in Los Angeles, our congestion challenges are just as bad, if not worse, than Manhattan’s.”He added, “We cannot sit idly by and watch it get worse.”In New York, many details of a congestion pricing plan — including how much drivers will be charged — are still being worked out. The plan was the culmination of a campaign that started 18 months ago and drew transit groups as well as prominent business, civic and labor leaders, who saw no other way to tackle gridlock.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo staked his name on it and wielded his political power to push it forward, making it a centerpiece of the $175 billion state budget after past efforts had unraveled. Even Mayor Bill de Blasio, who had been lukewarm about congestion pricing and has had a frosty relationship with the governor, threw his support behind it. They had made the case that it was crucial for raising the money needed to modernize the city’s crumbling subway system.And city transit officials, facing a growing financial crisis, warned repeatedly that the alternative would be huge fare increases.Congestion pricing’s moment follows decades of failed efforts to unclog roads around the country. Historically, cities responded to congestion by building more roads or widening existing ones — only to find that those, too, became jammed, said Matthew Turner, an economics professor at Brown University.As a result, America’s roads are carrying more traffic than ever. The number of people driving to work climbed to about 130 million in 2017, up from 121 million in 2012, according to an analysis of census data by Social Explorer, a research company. Of those, more than 116 million drove alone, and only 14 million car-pooled. Just 8 million workers took public transportation.The increasing traffic has been accompanied by concerns over health, safety and environmental implications. The number of pedestrians killed in traffic in the United States is approaching a three-decade high.Traffic woes have emerged as the underside of successful cities: The boom leads to an influx of new residents, businesses and construction. More than two dozen major American cities, including New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Austin, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle, have more congestion now than a decade ago, according to an annual global traffic scorecard by INRIX.The most recent scorecard found that congestion left American drivers sitting in traffic an average of 97 hours last year, up from 82 hours in 2015. That, in turn, cost the economy roughly $87 billion in lost productivity last year, up from $74 billion in 2015, according to INRIX.“It only takes one car that doesn’t get through an intersection to block two lanes of traffic,” said Trevor Reed, an INRIX transportation analyst.In Seattle, Amazon’s relentless rise has helped to turn the city into a major tech hub. Now, major infrastructure and development projects are expected to lead to even more gridlock.“As we build a city of the future, we must reduce our reliance on cars,” Ms. Durkan said. “My goal is to make our downtown core a healthier place for all with fewer cars, a more equitable transportation system and less climate pollution.”Road pricing has been used on some American highways since the 1990s, with tolled express lanes — or so-called Lexus lanes — built alongside regular lanes, offering a faster alternative to drivers who are willing to pay for it.Cities are trying to figure out how to make it work on streets. “There’s a critical mass forming where people are saying, ‘enough is enough,’” said Stuart Cohen, the founding director of TransForm, a California-based group that released a recent report on congestion pricing. “They’ve tried everything else and nothing’s working.”Still, Charles Komanoff, a New York economist whose models were used to develop the congestion pricing plan, said the idea of “putting a price on driving” clashes with America’s car-loving culture in which driving wherever the road may lead is often seen as the ultimate freedom. He compared pushing congestion pricing forward to “shooting a rocket to the moon.” “There’s so much gravity — the forces opposing this are so powerful — it almost seems like defying nature,” he said.Oregon looked at congestion pricing in 2005, but “our traffic wasn’t that bad, so people weren’t willing to pay a toll to escape it,” Mr. Brouwer said. But Portland has been gripped by congestion as Amazon and others have opened offices. State officials are seeking federal approval for what would be the state’s first highway tolls on a seven-mile stretch through Portland.Congestion pricing has also been seen as a burden on drivers who are poor and have been displaced from downtown areas by rising housing costs, and now must drive to work because of minimal access to public transit.“Social equity was the conversation stopper when it came to congestion pricing,” Mr. Cohen said. “In West Coast cities, equity is very high on the political agenda.”But Mr. Cohen said gridlock also slows down the bus and transit services many poor people depend on. Congestion fees, he added, can be discounted or subsidized for impoverished drivers.In Los Angeles, public buses traveled at an average of 11.8 miles per hour last year, down from 12.2 miles per hour in 2013, according to transit data. Mr. Washington said he wanted to use the congestion fees to pay for transit improvements and to cover fares so that everyone can ride free.A spokeswoman for Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles said he has supported looking at congestion pricing “because it has the promise to dramatically reduce traffic and improve quality of life.”Still, congestion pricing remains a tough sell. After a recent report by Boston leaders and educators that recommended charging $5 to drive in some neighborhoods, Boston’s mayor’s office said the city would not be implementing congestion pricing.In New York, drivers would be charged for entering Manhattan below 60th Street, where the average speed for vehicles is down to 4.7 miles per hour, from 6.9 miles per hour in 1994.John Corlett, a lobbyist for AAA in New York, said the new fees could shift gridlock to other parts of the city if drivers bypass the central business district to avoid tolls. “To say this is going to reduce congestion may be a false hope,” he said.But Sam Schwartz, an architect of the city’s congestion pricing plan, said he had received calls from officials and others in more than a dozen cities that have been monitoring New York’s progress. “If you can do it in New York, you can do it anywhere,” he said.San Francisco is considering congestion pricing after trying other options to combat gridlock downtown, including expanded bus and rail service, installing dedicated transit lanes and added bike routes, said Tilly Chang, executive director of the San Francisco County Transportation Authority, which is leading the city’s congestion pricing effort.“Everyone agrees there’s a problem,” Ms. Chang said. “There are multiple views of the solution. But frankly, we’ve tried a lot of them and they’re not enough.”Follow Winnie Hu on Twitter: @WinnHuAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byThe conversationA long while.By Gail Collins and Bret StephensMs. Collins and Mr. Stephens are Opinion columnists. They converse every other week.Bret Stephens: Hi, Gail. I know you must be girding for the crushing defeat the Patriots will sustain this weekend.Gail Collins: My husband is from Boston and we have learned, from being a Patriots household in New York, what it means to be truly ostracized. There are probably more Republicans in our Upper West Side neighborhood than there are Patriots fans.I’m not normally a sports person. But Donald Trump has educated me in their big plus: Whenever things are terrible in the rest of the world, you can just talk with your friends, or neighbors or relatives, about who the best quarterback is. Or how the Mets will do this year. It’s a very unifying concept.Bret: And speaking of crushing defeats, that’s a fairly good description of what Trump has just sustained in his shutdown showdown with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer. As a purely political matter, do you think he can recover?Gail: I’m almost finished writing a book on the history of older women in America, and it is really a treat to watch Nancy Pelosi wiping the floor with Donald Trump. I’d be happy to see any reasonably progressive, reasonably sane politician doing the job, but this particular saga really tickles me.Bret: This is a good moment to admit that I was totally mistaken about Pelosi. I thought her election as speaker would play into Trump’s hands, because he would lampoon her as the quintessential left-coast liberal elitist. Instead, she wasted no time cutting his, er, fingers off.Gail: Have you noticed that he’s terrible even at the things he was supposed to be good at during his cheesy reality show period, like making deals and firing people?He’s toast. Do you agree?Bret: Anyone who survives a half-dozen bankruptcies and goes on to win the presidency should never be written off.Gail: Sigh. Good point.Bret: Trump is a master of inventing new dramas to make us forget the old ones. And if unemployment and growth figures remain good a year from now, he’ll still have a powerful argument for a second term.That said, Trump’s hopes of being re-elected depend on his appeal to his base, and his base support is eroding. A poll from earlier this month has him down a net of 10 points with Republicans, down 13 with white evangelicals and down 18 with suburban men. If I were looking at those numbers as the head of the Republican National Committee, I’d be thinking that Trump would be wise to declare that he won’t run for re-election. Whether he would do that is, of course, another question entirely.Gail: Well, you’re presuming he has a life outside of this.Bret: Depends on his legal jeopardy, I guess.Gail: If the jeopardy level is high enough, he’d need to run again just because you can’t indict a sitting president. I for one do not want to imagine a 2020 campaign in which the base believes he’s a martyr who has to be saved from imprisonment.Bret: Maybe Bob Mueller can offer him immunity if he promises not to run. O.K., now I’m dreaming.Gail: We’re both trapped in an anti-Trumpian vortex where we agree about so much, but I know that deep down you’re a serious conservative, particularly on economic issues. So I want to ask about … oh God, Davos.Bret: God is of no use in Davos, Gail. Go on.Gail: Davos, as you may have heard, is an annual gathering in Switzerland where the economic and political elite come to have dinners and chat and pontificate. This year there were two things that interested me. One was that Anthony Scaramucci was there. This is the guy who lasted 11 days as White House communications director, appeared as a contestant on “Celebrity Big Brother” and then vanished from the series to reappear at Davos.I truly believe that reality TV is a thermometer of our cultural mind-set. Maybe the Mooch connection is proof that Davos is indeed a magnet for the best and the brightest.Bret: My long-held view of Davos is that nothing good that happens there is real, and nothing real that happens there is good. The Mooch’s presence this year proves both those points. Go on.Gail: One big topic was what happens to working people when automation takes over the world. Don’t care so much what the Davosians thought as I do about your opinion. You wrote a really powerful column the other day about socialism ruining Venezuela. But I don’t see how capitalism survives a techno-boom where automation puts half the population out of work. Thoughts?Bret: I’m not too worried. Capitalism survived the transition from horse-and-buggy to the Model T. It survived the transition from an agricultural economy to a manufacturing economy to a service-based one. And it survived the creative destruction of countless other forms of employment. Where, for instance, are the typesetters these days?Gail: Well, they’re not creating hot new social media sites.Bret: Now the question everyone is asking is what will happen to all those truck and cab and Uber drivers — a total of three million professional drivers — once driverless cars become ubiquitous. There’s no doubt the transition will be painful for some of them, and policymakers need to be sensitive on that point. But if history is any guide, things will work out. Many of those drivers will find work in industries that currently don’t exist. Just ask yourself, where was the mobile apps economy at the turn of the century? Where was the internet economy in 1990, or the personal computing industry in 1975?Gail: I still don’t see the truck drivers working on mobile apps. And if you’re worried about the left’s solutions, I don’t see a whole lot of candidates running around talking about the state taking over the means of production.Bret: Just wait an election cycle or two.Gail: But if we’re moving to an economy in which trucks are automated, robots do all the warehouse work and some kind of artificial intelligence is taking orders at the restaurant, we’ll need a government that can create a whole lot of useful public service employment to make up the difference.Bret: Heaven forfend.Gail: And underwrite free college education for everybody who needs it.Bret: No!Gail: And assure lower-middle-class people decent housing.Bret: My soul is dying.Gail: All of which would have to be paid for by large taxes on the very rich.Bret: Now it’s dead.Gail: That’s one area where Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez makes a lot of sense.Bret: And buried.Gail: I love it when we have a real argument.Bret: You know, I was going to change the topic to Roger Stone, where we’d be nodding our heads in unison. But let’s explore our disagreements a bit more.Gail: Yeah, I suspect we are in accord about Roger Stone, career political con man and threatener of small, fluffy service dogs. So back to good government …Bret: I’m all for universities figuring out ways to become more affordable for those who need and deserve it, but making college free for everybody makes it bad for everybody. We would wreck a university system that’s still the envy of the world.Gail: Ahem. I believe I said free college for everybody who needs it. And happy to have vigorous government oversight. Employing talented Americans tossed out of their old jobs by robot accountants.But continue with your verbal shudder …Bret: As for affordable housing, I’d sooner trust the invisible hand of the market than the heavy hand of the state. Large taxes on the very rich won’t raise the kind of income you need, and sooner rather than later those taxes will land on the decidedly less rich. And A.O.C. should start mastering her facts rather than getting into Twitter wars with fact checkers.Gail: Hehehe. Knew I’d get you with A.O.C. That’s what people love about her.The weather is lousy, Bret, but I’m seeing a little bit of sunshine. The government’s running, for the moment. Nancy Pelosi knocked down Donald Trump’s wall plans. Roger Stone is indicted and the Mueller investigation is chugging right along. Now let’s raise some taxes and build some bridges.Bret: I was with you until you mentioned taxes. Purely theoretical question for you (and our readers) for our next conversation: If Congress would agree to cut the top marginal rate to 33 percent in exchange for a pledge by Trump not to run again, would you take it? I’m sure we’ll be hearing from readers on the comments page.Gail: Can’t wait to take this up.Bret: In the meantime, go Rams.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.Gail Collins is an Op-Ed columnist, a former member of the editorial board and was the first woman to serve as Times editorial page editor, from 2001 to 2007.  @GailCollins • Facebook Bret L.

Li Yuan, a technology columnist in Hong Kong, discussed the tech she’s using.You write about Chinese tech. What tech tools do you rely on to do your job, and what do you like about them?It’s not an exaggeration to say I live in and work on WeChat, the messaging app that’s the equivalent of WhatsApp plus Facebook plus PayPal plus Uber plus GrubHub plus many other things. As my iPhone battery use record shows, I spend about one-third of my daily nine-hour phone time on WeChat. That doesn’t include the two to three hours I use WeChat’s web version.I’m not alone in my heavy WeChat use. There are 800 million internet users in China, but over one billion WeChat accounts. Just about every Chinese online has at least one account, and some more than one. Over one-third of them spend four hours or more on the app each day. The prevalence has made WeChat an indispensable part of many people’s lives and work. Two years ago, I met two people who refused to use WeChat, and I thought about writing a story about how people like them navigated work and life. Before I got around to it, both became my WeChat friends.So as a journalist, I have to hang out on WeChat. I message and call my sources on WeChat. I keep an eye on WeChat Moment, which is similar to Facebook Timeline, and group chats so I’ll always be on top of what’s going on in China. When others pretend they are too busy to get back to me, I comment on their Moment posts and group chats to tell them that I know they aren’t so busy.By now, some readers must be screaming, “How about the censorship and government surveillance on WeChat?” Sadly, it’s just the way of life in China. I’m not trying to make light of the issue. I’ve been very critical of how the tech companies work with the government to censor and monitor the Chinese public. But the reality is that ordinary Chinese often feel powerless and fatalistic when it comes to censorship and surveillance. I’ve tried to persuade people to get on encrypted messaging apps such as Signal and WhatsApp but haven’t had much success. I also use Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter. I used to be an active Weibo user and still have a few million followers there. But after the government cracked down on Weibo a few years ago and shut down many of the most provocative and influential accounts, I don’t use it too often because the conversations are often dominated by celebrity news instead of discussions of current affairs. But Weibo is still a good place to check out the hottest topics and trends. That’s where I found people to talk to for a column I wrote about the generation that grew up without Google, Facebook or Twitter.How do people in China use tech differently, compared with people in the United States?The first thing many visitors to China notice is how mobile the Chinese are. Many Chinese never owned a laptop or a PC, and their first computer was their smartphone. Email never really took off in China. Some big corporations do use it. But people usually resort to WeChat for a quick response.Because of WeChat’s prevalence, few Chinese carry business cards any more. At many meetings in China, there’s a time when everybody takes out his or her phone and scans the WeChat QR codes of others to become “friends.” I personally like having contacts on WeChat rather than on business cards. Because it’s a social media platform, you learn about your contacts as individuals beyond their business titles.Many businesspeople I know have two or more WeChat accounts because WeChat allows only 5,000 contacts for one account. A young venture capitalist told me that it had taken him only two years to reach the limit. I don’t know how they manage so many contacts.Generally, Chinese are more receptive to new things and more tolerant of imperfect products, including mobile apps. Some commentators here say Facebook is almost a Chinese company because of its “move fast and break things” mantra. Many people in China’s internet industry work super-long hours to make sure they beat competitors to roll out new features first.Why are mobile wallets so popular in China?When I moved from New York to Beijing in 2008, China was still a cash-based nation. Not many people had credit cards, and it wasn’t easy for small businesses to get approval to install the machines. I used to have to go to the A.T.M.s all the time. Going to the banks, mostly giant state-owned enterprises, was torturously time-consuming. Then came WeChat Pay and Alipay, the mobile payment services from Tencent and Alibaba. Since so many Chinese were already on WeChat and were trained to scan QR codes, it took the two giants only some cash-bonus campaigns at grocery stores to convert people like my mom to mobile payments.Mobile pay is now available in almost every place I visit in China, including small towns. I’ve been carrying a 100-yuan ($15) bill in my wallet for months but haven’t found an occasion to use it. Everybody — hotels, department stores, taxi drivers, noodle stands — takes Alipay or WeChat Pay or both. Even tollbooths accept mobile payment. What are some hot new apps, tech products or internet services in China?The hottest app is a short video service, Douyin, which is called TikTok outside China. As my colleague Kevin Roose aptly put it in a recent column, it’s “a quirky hybrid of Snapchat, the defunct video app Vine and the TV segment ‘Carpool Karaoke.’”To be honest, I’m too old for the app — Douyin targets urban teenagers and 20-somethings — and have not spent much time on it. But I’ve seen some viral Douyin videos on Weibo and WeChat that are fun and goofy. Some young Chinese told me that they spend hours watching Douyin videos every day, which I would argue is the downside of the app. Its parent company, Bytedance, is very good at using artificial intelligence to push content based on users’ viewing history.The short video app that I check out from time to time is Douyin’s rival, Kwai. Kwai is popular in small towns and the countryside. You can watch young people chasing geese and getting married in white gowns in front of mud houses. I call Kwai the “Hillbilly Elegy” of China. It’s where you can get a flavor of what China is like outside the biggest coastal cities.Outside of work, what tech product are you into right now? I’m a very low-tech person! While my iPhone feels like an extension of my left arm, I don’t use many other electronics. I didn’t own a TV until a year ago and only watch Netflix sometimes. I bought a microwave this year, and it’s the simplest model because I knew I would use it only to reheat food.My biggest tech wish is for Google, Facebook, Apple or another company to build a technology that can break the Great Firewall, the system of filters and blocks that prevents Chinese from visiting thousands of foreign websites. Instead of kowtowing to the Chinese government’s demands in order to gain access to the market, American tech giants could do something heroic: Liberate hundreds of millions of people from information darkness.AdvertisementAdvertisement

Amazon may be pulling the plug on its Queens campus, but New York City’s tech boom is likely to endure.Long before Amazon announced that New York had won a share of its second-headquarters sweepstakes, tech was a rising force in the local economy. Google, which already has thousands of workers in New York, plans to double its work force in the city and build a $1 billion campus just south of the West Village. Facebook, Apple, Uber and other companies are also expanding their presences, as is a rising generation of homegrown companies.Even Amazon itself said Thursday that it planned to keep adding to its New York work force.30% of jobs25201510Wall StreetTech sector19901995200020052010201530% of jobs25201510Wall StreetTech sector199520052015“Every part of the city is feeling the impact of the technology boom,” said William C. Rudin, a developer and the chairman of the Real Estate Board of New York. “The geography of where these companies are, it’s not just Midtown South or Meatpacking. It’s downtown, it’s Midtown East, it’s going to Brooklyn, it’s going to Queens.”In terms of raw economic power, Wall Street still dominates. Its workers earn more than $400,000 a year on average, close to three times as much as tech workers. As a result, the finance sector accounts for a huge share of city and state tax revenue, and wields disproportionate political power.30% of pay252015Wall StreetTech sector19901995200020052010201530% of pay252015Wall StreetTech sector199520052015Mayors dating back to David Dinkins in the early 1990s have sought to make the city less vulnerable to the booms and busts of finance. Those efforts accelerated after the 2008 financial crisis, which wiped out thousands of jobs on Wall Street. Tech’s rapid expansion came at an auspicious time, helping the city rebound much faster than many experts had predicted.“There was a wide consensus that New York City needed to diversify its economy to add balance beyond Wall Street,” said Jonathan Bowles, executive director of the Center for an Urban Future, a New York-focused think tank. “I really think that tech has finally allowed New York to do that.”New York has never been a one-industry town. Even at its height in the early 2000s, Wall Street accounted for little more than 5 percent of the city’s jobs and 20 percent of its total pay. New York is a center of media, advertising and fashion. And for the accounting, consulting and law firms that serve those industries — as well as for the real estate moguls who build their office towers and condominiums.Share of jobsin New York CityShare of payin New York CityHealth care18%Wall Street19%Retail8Health care10Dining7Professionalservices8Real estate andconstruction7Other finance8Professionalservices6Real estate andconstruction7Media andadvertising54Wall StreetMedia andadvertising6Other finance4Government35TechTech3Retail4Colleges223Arts andentertainmentGovernmentDining22CollegesOther322Arts andentertainmentOther25Share of jobsin New York CityShare of payin New York CityHealth care18%Wall Street19%Retail8Health care10Dining7Professionalservices8Real estate andconstruction7Other finance8Professionalservices6Real estate andconstruction7Media andadvertising54Wall StreetMedia andadvertising6Other finance4Government35TechTech3Retail4Colleges223Arts andentertainmentGovernmentDining22CollegesOther322Arts andentertainmentOther25New York’s economic diversity is part of what drew tech companies to New York in the first place. When Google and other West Coast giants set up outposts here in the mid-2000s, they were mostly hiring advertising sales representatives and marketing managers, not hard-core coders.Gradually, however, New York began to become a force for tech talent. Media and finance firms were trying to become more digitally savvy and needed programmers. Universities — encouraged by successive administrations in City Hall — created and expanded programs to give students digital skills.As a share of the population, New York still has far fewer programmers, software developers and similar workers than Silicon Valley and Seattle. In raw numbers, however, the New York area has more such professionals than any other urban area.But as Amazon’s pullback in New York shows, the technology industry also has yet to fully integrate itself into New York’s power structure.$600,000NetflixPolitical donationsin New York StateAmazon500Apple400Facebook300Microsoft200Alphabet(Google)1002009-102011-122013-142015-162017-18ELECTION CYCLESPolitical donations in New York StateAlphabet (Google)AppleAmazonMicrosoftFacebook2017-18NetflixDEM.2015-16REP.2013-142011-122009-10$100,000$200,000$300,000$400,000$500,000$600,000Top political donorsGoldman Sachs1.FINANCIAL$1.6mil.New York Life Insurance2.FINANCIAL1.3National Assn. of Realtors3.REAL ESTATE1.3Operating Engineers Union4.UNION1.2Elliott Management5.FINANCIAL1.2American Federationof Teachers6.UNION1.1Int’l Assn. of Sheet Metal, Air,Rail and Transp.

Financial firms, labor unions and other traditional pillars of New York’s economy still dominate the ranks of the city’s top political donors.And while New York has a growing start-up scene, few major tech companies are based here.“New York’s cachet, New York’s strength, is as a global headquarters city,” said Kathryn Wylde, the partnership’s president and chief executive. “And if the C.E.O.s of the industry leaders are not here, we can’t continue to lead the world as a commercial center. We won’t have the magnetism.”Not everyone, of course, is pushing for tech to play a larger role in New York. Amazon’s plans were scuttled by a powerful backlash from unions, neighborhood groups and elected officials in Queens. Some of that opposition was fueled by the multibillion-dollar incentive package the city and state offered to lure Amazon. But critics also worried that the flood of well-heeled tech workers would drive up already sky-high rents.Dan J. Wang, a professor at Columbia Business School, said those concerns were particularly acute because of the size and concentration of Amazon’s planned campus, which he likened to the “company towns” of the early 20th century.“There is the possibility of displacement of existing businesses and of the exacerbation of inequality that already exists in New York,” Mr. Wang said.Other companies, such as Google, have been more subtle, building up presences in neighborhoods without taking over.That might explain why, before the furor over Amazon, tech’s rise had managed to stay largely beneath the radar.“Tech has become a huge and crucial part of the New York City economy,” Mr. Bowles said. “I’m not sure that most New Yorkers know that right now.”AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byDeep learning, deep insights, deep artificial minds — the list goes on and on. But with unprecedented promise comes some unprecedented peril.By Thomas L. FriedmanOpinion ColumnistAround the end of each year major dictionaries declare their “word of the year.” Last year, for instance, the most looked-up word at Merriam-Webster.com was “justice.” Well, even though it’s early, I’m ready to declare the word of the year for 2019.The word is “deep.”Why? Because recent advances in the speed and scope of digitization, connectivity, big data and artificial intelligence are now taking us “deep” into places and into powers that we’ve never experienced before — and that governments have never had to regulate before. I’m talking about deep learning, deep insights, deep surveillance, deep facial recognition, deep voice recognition, deep automation and deep artificial minds.Some of these technologies offer unprecedented promise and some unprecedented peril — but they’re all now part of our lives. Everything is going deep.Which is why it may not be an accident that one of the biggest hit songs today is “Shallow,” from the movie “A Star Is Born.” The main refrain, sung by Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, is: “I’m off the deep end, watch as I dive in. … We’re far from the shallow now.”We sure are. But the lifeguard is still on the beach and — here’s what’s really scary — he doesn’t know how to swim! More about that later. For now, how did we get so deep down where the sharks live?The short answer: Technology moves up in steps, and each step, each new platform, is usually biased toward a new set of capabilities. Around the year 2000 we took a huge step up that was biased toward connectivity, because of the explosion of fiber-optic cable, wireless and satellites.Suddenly connectivity became so fast, cheap, easy for you and ubiquitous that it felt like you could touch someone whom you could never touch before and that you could be touched by someone who could never touch you before.Around 2007, we took another big step up. The iPhone, sensors, digitization, big data, the internet of things, artificial intelligence and cloud computing melded together and created a new platform that was biased toward abstracting complexity at a speed, scope and scale we’d never experienced before. So many complex things became simplified. Complexity became so fast, free, easy to use and invisible that soon with one touch on Uber’s app you could page a taxi, direct a taxi, pay a taxi, rate a taxi driver and be rated by a taxi driver.Over the last decade, these advances in the speed of connectivity and the elimination of complexity have grown exponentially. Because as big data got really big, as broadband got really fast, as algorithms got really smart, as 5G got actually deployed, artificial intelligence got really intelligent. So now, with no touch — but just a voice command or machines acting autonomously — we can go so much deeper in so many areas.Scientists and doctors can now find the needle in the haystack of health data as the norm, not the exception, and therefore see certain disease patterns that were never apparent before. Machines can recognize your face so accurately that the Chinese government can punish you for jaywalking in Beijing, using street cameras, and you will never encounter a police officer. Indeed, with today’s facial recognition technology, I can dispense with the card reader at my office’s security gate and instead use each employee’s face as an ID. And cars can drive on their own.DeepMind, the artificial intelligence arm of Google’s parent, developed an A.I. program, AlphaGo, that has now defeated the world’s top human players of the ancient strategy game Go — which is much more complex than chess — by learning from human play. As The Times reported, DeepMind “showed yet another way that computers could be developed to perform better than humans in highly complex tasks” and to “mimic the way the brain functions.” DeepMind’s next breakthrough, AlphaZero, did not even need to learn from humans. It learned even faster by repeatedly playing against itself!Today “virtual agents” — using conversational interfaces powered by artificial intelligence — can increasingly understand your intent when you call the bank, credit card company or insurance company for service, just by hearing your voice. It means machines can answer so many more questions than nonmachines, also known as “humans.” The percentage of calls a chatbot, or virtual agent, is able to handle without turning the caller over to a person is called its “containment rate,” and these rates are steadily soaring. Soon, automated systems will be so humanlike that they will have to self-identify as machines.Automation is also going deep, fast. The Times’s Kevin Roose quoted Mohit Joshi, the president of Infosys, a technology firm that helps other businesses automate their operations, as saying in Davos last week: “People are looking to achieve very big numbers. Earlier they had incremental, 5 to 10 percent goals in reducing their work force. Now they’re saying, ‘Why can’t we do it with 1 percent of the people we have?’”But bad guys, who are always early adopters, also see the same potential to go deep in wholly new ways. They can fake your face and voice so well that they can create a YouTube video that will go viral of you saying racist things or make it look like the president of the United States just announced a nuclear attack on Russia. They can use technology to fake a bank manager’s voice so well that it can call your grandmother, and, with a voice command, ask her to transfer $10,000 to an account in Switzerland and she’ll do it — and you’ll never catch them in time.That’s why the adjective that so many people are affixing to all of these new capabilities to convey their awesome power is “deep.”On Jan. 20, The London Observer looked at Harvard Business School professor Shoshana Zuboff’s new book, the title of which perfectly describes the deep dark waters we’ve entered: “The Age of Surveillance Capital.”“Surveillance capitalism,” Zuboff wrote, “unilaterally claims human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data. Although some of these data are applied to service improvement, the rest are declared as a proprietary behavioral surplus, fed into advanced manufacturing processes known as ‘machine intelligence,’ and fabricated into prediction products that anticipate what you will do now, soon and later. Finally, these prediction products are traded in a new kind of marketplace that I call behavioral futures markets. Surveillance capitalists have grown immensely wealthy from these trading operations, for many companies are willing to lay bets on our future behavior.”Unfortunately, we have not developed the regulations or governance, or scaled the ethics, to manage a world of such deep powers, deep interactions and deep potential abuses.Two quotes tell that story: Last April, Senator Orrin Hatch was questioning Facebook C.E.O. Mark Zuckerberg during a joint hearing of the commerce and judiciary committees. At one point Hatch asked Zuckerberg, “So, how do you sustain a business model in which users don’t pay for your service?”Zuckerberg, clearly trying to stifle a laugh, replied, “Senator, we run ads.” Hatch did not seem to understand that Facebook’s business model is to mine users’ data and then run targeted ads — and Hatch was one of Facebook’s regulators.But then Zuckerberg was also clueless about how deep the powers of the Facebook platform had gone — deep enough that a few smart Russian hackers could manipulate it to help Donald Trump win the presidency.When faced with evidence that fake news spread on Facebook influenced the outcome of the 2016 election, Zuckerberg dismissed that notion as a “pretty crazy idea.” It turns out that it was happening at an industrial scale and he later had to apologize.Regulations often lag behind new technologies, but when they move this fast and cut this deep, that lag can be really dangerous. I wish I thought that catch-up was around the corner. I don’t. Our national discussion has never been more shallow — reduced to 280 characters.This has created an opening and burgeoning demand for political, social and religious leaders, government institutions and businesses that can go deep — that can validate what is real and offer the public deep truths, deep privacy protections and deep trust.But deep trust and deep loyalty cannot be forged overnight. They take time. That’s one reason this old newspaper I work for — the Gray Lady — is doing so well today. Not all, but many people, are desperate for trusted navigators. Many will also look for that attribute in our next president, because they sense that deep changes are afoot. It is unsettling, and yet, there’s no swimming back. We are, indeed, far from the shallow now.Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook, Twitter (@NYTopinion) and Instagram.Thomas L. Friedman is the foreign affairs Op-Ed columnist.

Here’s the sign-up.)Good morning,We return from the holiday with a look at the government shutdown that’s entering its second month, a new warning about Greenland’s melting ice, and a preview of today’s Academy Award nominations.The partial government shutdown is now in its fifth week, and some of the 800,000 federal workers who’ve been affected are turning to jobs like driving for Uber or substitute teaching. “It’s almost as if I’m starting over again from a teenager,” said a woman who began delivering takeout dinners and groceries after being furloughed at the Department of Agriculture.The shutdown is also hurting some of the most vulnerable, including the homeless and those who depend on federal rent subsidies.Catch up: Over the weekend, President Trump proposed restoring temporary protections for the undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border wall, an offer Speaker Nancy Pelosi immediately rejected. Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, could propose legislation today that would wrap Mr. Trump’s proposal into a package to reopen the government. News analysis: People who have done business with Mr. Trump say his current stance is consistent with negotiating tactics he used in the private sector: focusing foremost on claiming victory.The Trump administration announced last month that it was lifting sanctions against several companies controlled by an influential oligarch, Oleg Deripaska. The government characterized the move as tough on both him and Russia.But a confidential document signed by both sides suggests that the agreement is less punishing than advertised, freeing Mr. Deripaska from hundreds of millions of dollars in debt.How we know: The Treasury Department described the agreement in a letter to Congress that was released publicly. But the confidential document, which was reviewed by The Times, includes greater detail.Background: Sanctions were announced in April against Mr. Deripaska, six other Russian oligarchs and their companies in retaliation for “a range of malign activity around the globe.”The island’s enormous ice sheet is melting so quickly that it could become a major factor in rising sea levels within two decades, scientists said on Monday.The research found that ice loss in 2012 was nearly four times as much as in 2003 and that, after a lull in 2013-14, losses have resumed.The impact: The study is the latest suggesting that estimates of the effects of a warming planet have been too conservative and highlighting what scientists say is the need for a sharp reduction in emissions of planet-warming gases.Go deeper: Times journalists traveled to Greenland’s ice sheet in 2015 to find out more about the effects of climate change. Hours after the militant group killed dozens at a base in Afghanistan on Monday, the Taliban said they had resumed talks with American diplomats in Qatar.An Afghan official said the attack had targeted a center where pro-government fighters were receiving training from the country’s intelligence agency.Background: Last month, President Trump ordered the U.S. military to begin plans to withdraw about 7,000 troops from Afghanistan. But the violence there shows no sign of abating.Video replay was supposed to fix mistakes by officials on the field, but a blown call in the Saints-Rams game on Sunday exposed a weakness in the rule book.At stake was a trip to the Super Bowl. When officials most needed a replay, the rules for what is subject to review prohibited them from watching one.The 2020 election: Senator Kamala Harris of California is the latest Democrat to declare her candidacy for president. Ms. Harris, a former state attorney general, is the second black woman to serve in the U.S. Senate. Here’s who else is running.China’s slowdown: The country’s economy grew 6.6 percent in 2018, the weakest pace in nearly 30 years.Penalty for Google: France fined the company $57 million  for not properly disclosing to users how their data is collected.New Brexit plan: After the British Parliament rejected Prime Minister Theresa May’s proposal for withdrawing from the European Union, she returned with a Plan B. It looked a lot like Plan A.Warning at Davos: The annual meeting of the World Economic Forum began in Switzerland this morning, and one talking point is a letter saying investors should pay closer attention to global social tensions, rising debt and weaker American leadership.Protecting their boys: A community in Kentucky is rallying around the students of a Roman Catholic high school who were criticized after appearing in a video with a Native American man in Washington. Chris Brown in custody: The R&B singer was being questioned by the police in Paris today after he was accused of rape.Snapshot: Above, the memorial to the Rev.

Or hit Reply All again, saying something like, “Well, that was awkward.”Also, we checked out luxury versions of the rocking chair, a time-tested antidote to anxiety.The tournament now underway in Melbourne, once the least grand of tennis’s four Grand Slam events, has caught up.When the event began in the early 20th century, travel time for Americans and Europeans could be more than a month, so play was largely limited to Australians and New Zealanders.Jet travel made the trip easier. But for decades, low prize money and dates around the Christmas holidays kept many players away. Chris Evert played the Australian Open just six times; John McEnroe five; Bjorn Borg once.Over time, the prize money and ranking points increased, and the tournament shifted to the third and fourth weeks of January. In 1988, it moved to the brand-new Melbourne Park. Today, the “Grand Slam of Asia-Pacific” lures business support and fans from across the region.And now the stars line up. Serena Williams is seeking her eighth title, and Novak Djokovic is vying for his seventh. Catch up with our latest coverage here.That’s it for this briefing.

Once seen as a force for making our lives better and our brains smarter, tech is now accused of inflaming, radicalizing, dumbing down and squeezing the masses. Tech company stocks have been pummeled from their highs. Regulation looms. Even tech executives are calling for it.In the face of such a sustained assault, this might be a good moment for Big Tech to lie low. It could devote some of its mountains of cash — Apple alone has $237 billion in the bank — to genuine good works, and allay widespread fears it wants to control your data and your destiny.That is not the path the companies are taking.“The tech companies are not flinching,” said Bob Staedler, a Silicon Valley consultant. “Nothing has hit them on the nose hard enough to tell them to cut back. Instead, they are expanding. They’re going around the country acquiring the best human capital so they can create the next whiz-bang thing.”There is so much of life that remains undisrupted. The companies are competing to own the cloud — to become, in essence, the internet’s landlord. They have designs on cities: Google made a deal in 2017 to reimagine a chunk of waterfront Toronto from the ground up. Amazon is reworking the definition of community from the inside, as warehouses in rural areas provide the urban middle class with everything they want to stay home all weekend.These changes are only beginning to redefine society. When every home has an Amazon Echo, Google Home, an Apple HomePod or some other smart speaker, the companies are already signaling, all human and metaphysical needs will be fulfilled. For those who insist on venturing out, there will be driverless cars operated by Big Tech. And the companies are plunging further into artificial intelligence, with consequences unclear even to them.To accomplish all this, Big Tech needs hundreds of thousands of new employees, which means it needs somewhere to put them. This isn’t a matter of reconfiguring a floor or two at corporate headquarters. It means building new campuses around the country.Big Tech’s push into New York City and the Washington area has been well documented in recent months, with Google bulking up in the first and Amazon planning satellite offices in both. But even in its backyard of Silicon Valley, which is a mess of traffic congestion and housing prices that have attained levels even well-paid engineers can scarcely afford, there is a boom that, if anything, is accelerating.Anyone who wants to believe Big Tech is chastened should visit a section of San Jose just west of downtown, a jumble of carwashes and auto-body shops with a sprinkling of modern apartments. On a short street there is a house nearly a century old, a tiny thing with only one bath. Google bought it and another house last month in a package deal for $4 million, according to county documents reviewed by The Mercury News.Multiply that real estate transaction by dozens, big parcels and small, totaling hundreds of millions of dollars to date. Google is planning very long term here. The buses, light rail, Caltrain and Amtrak trains that converge on the Diridon Station transit center will give the company an opportunity to embed mass transit into its growth. The eventual result will be a new Google campus of eight million square feet with offices for 20,000 workers, a figure that is more than the company’s total employment in 2009.But Diridon Station is just a part of Google’s Silicon Valley expansion. A week before the company got the two houses, it bought a 100,000-square-foot building in Palo Alto, Calif., for $70 million.Facebook keeps growing, too. In the spring, it leased one million square feet in the Silicon Valley community of Sunnyvale for its fast-growing community operations team, which deals with safety and security issues confronting Facebook users. And it will soon move this year into 750,000 square feet in a San Francisco tower, making it the third-biggest tech tenant in the city, after Salesforce and Uber.In total, Google’s employment increased 21 percent in the last year. Facebook’s work force rose by 45 percent in that time, to 34,000, and it is advertising 2,700 additional jobs.Amazon’s head count tripled over the last three years, thanks to its warehouses and the acquisition of Whole Foods. It is only the second company in the United States to employ more than 500,000 people — and that is not counting its contractors.The expansion underlines the dizzying truth of Big Tech: It is barely getting started.“For all intents and purposes, we’re only 35 years into a 75- or 80-year process of moving from analog to digital,” said Tim Bajarin, a longtime tech consultant to companies including Apple, IBM and Microsoft. “The image of Silicon Valley as Nirvana has certainly taken a hit, but the reality is that we the consumers are constantly voting for them.”That’s evident in how robust Big Tech’s businesses remain. Last March, the research firm eMarketer said Facebook, including its less controversial photo-sharing site, Instagram, would earn $21 billion this year from digital ads in the United States. In September, it raised that forecast to $22.87 billion.EMarketer also revised up its forecasts of Google’s digital ad revenues in the United States for 2018, 2019 and 2020. The third big digital advertising recipient is Amazon, which is far behind the leaders but gaining ground fast.The contradiction is becoming increasingly obvious. One important way Big Tech serves its customers is by tracking their movements and purchases, which is beginning to unnerve at least some of us. In a Pew Research Center survey in June, 42 percent of adult Facebook users said they had taken a break of several weeks from the site. But even as we say we trust tech less, we invite it deeper into our lives.Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Alphabet, Google’s parent company, together generated $166.9 billion in revenue in the third quarter of 2018 alone — up 24 percent from a year earlier, when the four companies hauled in $134.4 billion.“Much as people are now wary or even unhappy with the outsized power held by Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc., they are simultaneously quite dependent on the services they provide,” said David Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Big Tech needs to be regulated, many are beginning to argue, and yet there are worries about giving that power to the government.“The government doesn’t have a good clue,” said Mr. Bajarin, the consultant. “They’re not even asking the kind of questions that would drive to regulation.”Which leaves regulation up to the companies themselves, always a dubious proposition.“For Facebook to have a better year in 2019, it needs to be more upfront and transparent,” said Debra Aho Williamson, an analyst at eMarketer. This was also the advice Facebook got for 2018, to little avail.All this could change if the anti-tech mood continues to swell or the economy hits a really rough patch. On the other hand, the last recession tended to work in Big Tech’s favor by giving smaller competitors even more to worry about.During the 2008 financial crisis, Amazon’s North American media sales increased 20 percent. Borders, one of its biggest book-selling competitors, saw revenue drop 9 percent, reported a record loss and was soon defunct.With so little to really worry about, Big Tech is planning for a future far beyond any present-day turmoil. Google, which has 3,500 job openings, says it is too early to say what the thousands of Diridon employees will do. But Jonathan Taplin, director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California, has a good idea: everything.“They’re in the transportation business, the medical business, every business,” said Mr. Taplin, a frequent critic of how Big Tech took over a decentralized, independent internet. “There is no aspect of your life that they will not be involved in.”Follow David Streitfeld on Twitter: @DavidStreitfeld.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byMirror, mirror, on the wall: Who’s the fittest of them all?By Courtney RubinOn Christmas of last year, the singer Alicia Keys, wearing red bauble earrings, posted a video on Instagram, in which one of her sons instructed her not to scream when she saw her present. But Ms. Keys danced and shrieked anyway, so much was her joy upon seeing a sleek 52-inch rectangular Mirror mounted on her wall.When turned on, the otherwise unassuming-looking bit of home décor morphs — like “Through the Looking Glass” gone athleisure — into a gym portal, offering screenings of some 70 live fitness classes per week, including boxing, dance cardio, high intensity interval training (H.I.I.T.) and yoga. Users are face-to-face with the instructor; you can see your entire body as well as a shrunken-down image of the instructor’s. The device is controlled by an app, so as to avoid fingerprints on the reflection. All the usual caveats about data collection apply.“I love this can you tell??” Ms. Keys captioned the post. Ms. Keys is one of the most vocal in a wave of high-profile early adopters of the Mirror, which first came on the market in September. Reese Witherspoon also recently posted a video to Instagram: using the device, which retails for $1,495, to take a boxing class. Ellen DeGeneres referred to hers as the “Magic Mirror” on her television show. Allison Williams works out with hers daily, according to her publicist, and Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Aniston ordered theirs after seeing it at friends’ houses. Kate Hudson talked about trying one in People magazine. Last week, a revered comic actress in her 60s was spotted in Mirror’s pop-up shop in the Flatiron district of Manhattan, buying two, though her publicist said “her name should not be used in association with it.”Almost every boutique gym has its celebrity followers, but not since SoulCycle’s heyday five to seven years ago, when Lady Gaga, Lena Dunham and Oprah Winfrey threw their birthday parties at the spinning studio and the designer Betsey Johnson wore SoulCycle leggings to the opening of a CFDA exhibit, has one fitness method attracted so many famous practitioners. (Lady Gaga bought a Mirror for her parents for Christmas.) In this case, it seems to reflect, as it were, their need for both privacy and — in the age of the selfie — carefully maintained social-media display.Brynn Putnam, Mirror’s inventor and a Harvard-educated former New York City Ballet dancer, said: “I think I knew we built something special, but I don’t think I expected this.”Ms. Putnam, 35, does Google those who have bought the Mirror, just as she used to with first-time clients at Refine Method, the eight-year-old boutique gym she founded. But often she only finds out whom the purchase is for when the company arrives at the customer’s home to install it, or when her company receives questions about putting the device on a very high-security Wi-Fi network.“That’s how we found out about Leslie Mann and Judd Apatow,” Ms. Putnam said, referring to the firewall issue. Her company, whose offices are in the NoMad neighborhood of New York and has raised $38 million in funding from investors including Spark Capital (Foursquare, Warby Parker) and First Round Capital (Uber, Blue Apron), is selling $1 million of the 1.4-inch-thick Mirrors per month, she said. There are buyers in all 50 states, with California, perhaps not surprisingly, the top market. Luxury hotels have begun installing Mirrors in suites and, in the case of the Mark, its $75,000-per-night penthouse. (Not all customers are 1-percenters, Ms. Putnam stressed; roughly 20 percent request financing.)Ms. Putnam is refreshingly new to the courting of celebrity, and speaks of influencers (she gave Mirrors to Sara and Erin Foster, who have a lot of famous friends) and “public clips” (those Instagram videos) with the delight and faint ostentation of someone who has just learned a foreign language.Previously, she had little patience for workout fads. A decade ago, as an instructor at various barre method gyms, she was scolded for substituting in moves, such as lunges, that she considered more effective. She created Refine (which has a devoted, though not boldfaced, following) after a year spent grilling sports scientists and professional athletes’ trainers about what got results. Mike Boyle, whose clients include N.F.L. players and other elite athletes, told her she was right about the lunges.At the time, the only studio Ms. Putnam could afford was a 500-square-foot ground-floor space on the Upper East Side that she had to give back to the church that owned it every Sunday for services. She designed a cable tower made of weighted sailing pulleys and tracks for strength exercises that could easily be taken down and remounted. (Her husband, Lowell Putnam, a founder and the C.E.O. of Quovo, a financial technology company, had grown up sailing.)But in the spring of 2016, newly pregnant, Ms. Putnam found herself in the strange position of being the owner of a gym with an optimized-down-to-the-minute workout she could not face doing.She didn’t like treadmills or exercise bikes enough to buy one, and when she tried to stream workouts, she couldn’t figure out where to set up her computer or phone so she could see it while moving. Around that time, she also conducted a Refine members survey about improvements she had implemented, including new class times, trainers and custom-made equipment. Turned out, simple mirrors she’d put in at the last minute were by far Refiners’ favorite change: They liked the instant feedback.“I almost missed it,” Ms. Putnam said. “Mirrors were something I took for granted because my entire career I worked out in front of them.”She spoke sitting on the sofa at the company’s Flatiron store, sipping a hot chocolate after six hours of interviewing potential Mirror hires. Occasionally, she stretched a leg above her in a perfect line, as if executing a tendu. On her feet were gray Allbirds, the only shoe she can tolerate after the Chanel ballet flats she bought (on a stylist’s advice) to “look like an adult” while promoting Mirror made her lose her toenails.“It’s the greatest irony of the world,” she said with a laugh. “One of the biggest things I was excited about when I stopped dancing was that I could keep my toenails going forward.”Mirror’s required $39 per-month subscription, on top of the outlay for the equipment, offers four levels of classes, absolute beginner to expert, and all can be modified according to injury or pregnancy (each instructor films substitute moves, which pop up on screen according to user preferences.) There is also a library of hundreds of on-demand classes, so in theory this cost can be amortized.Lindsey Bradley, an actress who lives in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn, says the workouts are as good a sweat as the boutique studios she used to attend as a ClassPass user. And as a bonus, she no longer has to stand on a chair to get a view of her outfit in a cabinet mirror.“I legit use it as my full-length mirror,” Ms. Bradley said. “You would never in a thousand years know it was a piece of workout equipment.” Ms. Bradley used to own an elliptical machine; it now functions as her mother-in-law’s clothing rack, she said.Next up for Mirror is personal training, which will start at $40 per session; the device has a camera, and yes, a lens cap, lest you be concerned about privacy issues. Also sports prep for children, because the Mirror is averaging 2.2 users per household, according to company figures. Later will come treadmill and spin workouts, like those offered by Peloton, a six-year-old company now valued at $4 billion that was recently mocked in a merciless Twitter thread.The Mirror company has ambitious plans for the device to be users’ third screen, after their phone and computer, with the capacity for everything from photo organizing to chat. Currently, users can shop through the Mirror, buying fitness gear and other instructor favorites. Ms. Putnam years ago turned up to a Physique 57 instructor audition wearing a T-shirt that hung to her knees and black track pants with a yellow stripe she borrowed from her mother (she still got the job), and so to handle this part of the business she hired Karla Welch, a celebrity stylist. Ms. Welch, Mirror’s creative director, has also helped spread the word to her clients: Olivia Wilde and Karlie Kloss are Mirror users.One challenge for Ms. Welch: No trainers can wear black, because it doesn’t show up against the background. For now, she is enjoying buying “trippy acid wash tights” and leopard-print sneakers.“When I go to SoulCycle, I like my instructor dressing crazy,” Ms. Welch said.To the disappointment of Mirror’s sales staff, Ms. Welch recently decreed that APL sneakers, not the $300 Yeezy Boosts she originally selected, should be worn in the store. Ms. Putnam surprised them with the Yeezys anyway.An earlier version of this article misstated the original location of Refine, a fitness studio. It was on the Upper East Side, not Upper West; and on a ground floor, not in a basement.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byNew York TodayBy Azi Paybarah [Want to get New York Today by email?

So far, there has been no damage from the winter use.Mr. Biederman said he uses the frozen fountain to get his staff thinking more creatively.“For us,” he said, “it’s become a symbol of thinking out of the box about the way we market the park.”— Corey KilgannonIt’s Friday — try to find an unplanned Instagram sensation.Dear Diary:My friend and I went to the Food Emporium on Eighth Avenue and 49th Street to pick up ingredients for a dinner party we were hosting.I was ravenous, so I bought a bag of chips as a personal appetizer.

The actresses Lori Loughlin and Felicity Huffman also face charges.Fallout is already coming. Mr. McGlashan was put on indefinite administrative leave from TPG.How the scheme worked, according to prosecutors:• William Singer masterminded the scheme through his Edge College & Career Network.• “There is a front door which means you get in on your own,” Mr. Singer told one parent in a conversation that was wiretapped. “The back door is through institutional advancement, which is 10 times as much money.” He promised a cheaper “side door.”• Parents paid Mr. Singer a total of about $25 million over eight years to bribe school officials into designating their children as recruited athletes.• Mr. Singer was accused of bribing athletic coaches to campaign for certain students who lacked athletic credentials to be admitted.• Indicted parents were also said to have paid to fake their children’s standardized tests, at a rate of $15,000 to $75,000 per exam.Britain is hurtling toward unknown political territory after Parliament again rejected Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan for leaving the E.U., Stephen Castle of the NYT writes.“Mrs. May had hoped that last-minute concessions from the E.U. would swing the vote in her favor, but many lawmakers dismissed those changes as ineffectual or cosmetic and voted against the deal, 391 to 242,” Mr. Castle writes.Lawmakers vote today on whether they wish to proceed with a no-deal Brexit. If they don’t, they will then vote on seeking an extension to the schedule for leaving.That course of action “does not solve the problems,” Mrs. May said last night. “The E.U. will want to know what use we mean to make of such an extension, and the House will have to answer.”But the result throws Britain into chaos. There are just 16 days to go before Brexit is scheduled to happen by default, and with control effectively wrestled from Mrs. May the nation is seemingly rudderless. Mrs. May could seek approval for her deal one last time; Parliament could try to arrange a second referendum; or there could be a general election to break the deadlock.And the business community is unimpressed. “It’s time for Parliament to stop this circus,” said Carolyn Fairbairn, the director-general of Confederation of British Industry. “This must be the last day of failed politics. Jobs and livelihoods depend on it.”More: The British government revealed plans to temporarily loosen tariffs under a no-deal Brexit, while also seeking to protect some industries, including ceramics and farming.While most of the world has grounded the jets, which have been involved in two fatal crashes within five months, American regulators have decided to keep them flying.European authorities banned the planes from the air, joining regulators in China, Indonesia, Singapore, India and Australia, as well as numerous airlines. Roughly two-thirds of the 737 Max 8 aircraft in the world are now grounded.President Trump spoke with Boeing yesterday, shortly after he had tweeted that airplanes were becoming “far too complex to fly.” In a conversation with Dennis Muilenburg, the company’s C.E.O., Mr. Trump was reportedly reassured about the safety of the Max 8 jets.The F.A.A. stands firm on its decision not to ground the aircraft, saying that it found “no basis” to do so. Elaine Chao, the U.S. transportation secretary, said that she and the F.A.A. would “take immediate and appropriate action” if necessary. (She also flew on a Max 8 yesterday.)But others disagree. Ray LaHood, a former secretary of transportation who grounded Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner in 2013 following fires in its lithium-ion batteries, said that it was the F.A.A.’s duty to ground the jets “until there is 100 percent assurance” of safety. Scott McCartney of the WSJ writes that the Department of Transportation, which is home to the F.A.A., has “shown a pattern of lax regulation” recently.The U.K. has joined the growing army of voices calling for checks on the power of Big Tech, with a government report that calls for an overhaul of antitrust policies. It was prepared by a panel led by Jason Furman, who was a top economic adviser to President Barack Obama. More on the news from Adam Satariano of the NYT:• “The 150-page report, ordered by the chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond, the country’s top Treasury official, said the country needed stricter rules on acquisitions in the technology industry and stronger oversight to make sure that new rivals cannot be squashed.”• “Mr. Furman’s panel called for the creation of a ‘digital markets unit’ that would require companies to allow consumers to move data from one service to another. Large companies would also have to make data available to competitors, a bid to lower barriers to entry by forcing them to share information.”• “The report also calls for a code of conduct to be drafted for the biggest tech companies that would be enforceable with fines.”• As Grep Ip of the WSJ notes, this is “a carefully calibrated proposal designed to contain Big Tech’s threat to competition while keeping the government’s hand on the industry and the internet as light as possible.”The White House’s chief trade negotiator, Robert Lighthizer, won’t say whether he believes that trade talks with China will yield the results that President Trump has demanded.“Our hope is we are in the final weeks of an agreement,” Mr. Lighthizer told the Senate Finance Committee yesterday, reports Alan Rappeport of the NYT.“We’re either going to have a good result or we’re going to have a bad result before too long, but I’m not setting a specific time frame and it’s not up to me,” he added. “I’ll work as hard as I can, and the president will tell me when the time is up, or the Chinese will.”The chances of success have risen and fallen in recent weeks. Negotiations have appeared to make progress on issues including currency manipulation and enforcement provisions. But fears about Mr. Trump’s erratic bargaining style — compounded by his decision to walk out on talks with North Korea — have given Chinese officials some jitters.Timothy Sloan went to Capitol Hill on Tuesday seeking to convince members of Congress that Wells Fargo had become a better bank — but by the time he left, few seemed to believe him, Emily Flitter of the NYT writes. Some highlights:• “Representative Katie Porter, Democrat of California, questioned Mr. Sloan about exactly how meaningful the bank’s commitment to change was, pointing out that its own lawyers had called such statements ‘corporate puffery’ in response to a lawsuit.”• “Representative Lance Gooden, a Republican from Texas, asked why Wells Fargo was taking longer than expected to refund money to customers it had tricked into buying auto insurance. Mr. Sloan said the bank had engaged in ‘a give-and-take’ with the comptroller about how much to refund.”• “A spokesman for the bank’s primary regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, released a statement on Tuesday saying officials were ‘disappointed’ in the bank.”Mr. Sloan was the first of a parade of bank executives summoned to testify before the committee.

You think that’s mean? No, it’s smart.”Other highlights from Mr. Stone’s activities in New York:1980: He helped run Ronald Reagan’s presidential campaign in New York and Connecticut. The Times called him “equally adept at cajoling or threatening.”1982: Mr. Stone’s 30th birthday party was hosted at the 21 Club in Midtown by Roy Cohn, Senator Joe McCarthy’s right hand man during the Communist witch hunts of the 1950s. (Among Mr. Cohn’s later clients: Donald Trump.)2000: Mr. Stone and Mr. Trump agreed to pay a $250,000 fine to the state and apologize for running newspaper ads under the name of a front group for Mr. Trump’s lobbying effort against casino interests in the Catskills.2007: Mr. Stone was forced to quit working for the New York State Senate leader Joseph Bruno after he was accused of making a threatening phone call to the ailing father of Gov. Eliot Spitzer. (Mr. Stone denied it to me and told me he was getting a tattoo of Richard Nixon’s face on his back during the time of the alleged call.)2008: Mr. Stone took credit for unearthing evidence that drove Mr. Spitzer from office, which Mr. Stone said he obtained from a prostitute at a sex club in Florida.2010: Mr. Stone advised the campaign for governor of Kristin M.

But the hamburger chain — whose first location in New York City opened in 1930 — now offers a plant-based “Impossible” burger that “bleeds."The website Eater called it “one of the country’s best fast-food burgers, period.”“The searing process imparts them with a golden, caramelized, Maillard-style char,” Eater raved. “This stands in stark contrast to the chain’s standard slider, where a paper-thin beef patty, plagued by a sickly gray hue, looks like someone shaved the wrong end of a cow over a mandoline and microwaved the result.”Reservations are going fast.It’s Monday — nothing’s impossible.Dear Diary:When Sam and I broke up, I decided to sell everything. New York makes it easy.The woman who bought our kitchen table was from Williamsburg. She appeared to be around my age, late 20s, but I could be wrong. She left in an Uber after I detached the legs for her.A friend bought a pair of printed fabric chairs for $80. She also took some shelves and a plant. Sam never watered the plants anyway. One time I joked that all of our plants had an absent father. It’s the kind of joke that makes me sad now.The blue couch went to two girls from Crown Heights. They were younger than me, but not by much. I told them it was comfortable enough to sleep on if you removed the back cushions. Sam’s dad slept on it when he visited from California.The bookshelf went to a former co-worker who lives in Manhattan. I kept the books.I sold the night stands to Julia, a hometown friend, someone I knew could handle color. They were bright yellow.I sold the coffee table to a very demanding woman who contacted me through Craigslist. It was the first time I had ever gotten a cashier’s check.A couple bought the curtains. They didn’t need the curtain rod so I left it for the next tenant.The red kitchen chairs were Sam’s. They were harder to sell, but someone eventually bought them for $40.

The decline has been broadly felt, with all major advanced economies, including the U.S., and most major emerging-market economies seeing deterioration in their outlook.”• The I.M.F. pointed to “trade tensions and tariff hikes between the United States and China, a decline in business confidence, a tightening of financial conditions, and higher policy uncertainty across many economies” as reasons for the slowdown.Don’t panic. As Daniel Moss of Bloomberg Opinion points out, the numbers aren’t so bad:• “Yes, it’s a cut. But not a dramatic one. These numbers are a ways from one I.M.F. definition of recession, 2.5 percent, and miles from the contraction recorded in 2009.”• “It’s entirely possible the world economy muddles through this year. It might be messy, and there will be regional divergences aplenty. The economy may not feel great, particularly depending on where you are. That doesn’t mean it’s terrible.”Federal prosecutors unveiled new money-laundering charges against 16 parents in the college bribery case, including the actress Lori Loughlin, the former TPG executive Bill McGlashan and the former Pimco C.E.O. Douglas Hodge.The new charges carry tougher penalties than the first wave of accusations of mail and wire fraud. The original charges command a fine of at least $250,000, while money laundering involves fines of $500,000 or twice the value of the property involved.Some legal experts think jail time is possible for these defendants. Duncan Levin, a former federal prosecutor, told the WaPo that money-laundering charges are “one of the most powerful weapons” that the Justice Department can wield in court, and can lead to much longer sentences than simpler fraud charges.The new charges may be an attempt to force cooperation, legal commentators added. Some defendants, including the actress Felicity Huffman and the onetime corporate lawyer Gordon Caplan, said this week that they would plead guilty to the lesser wire fraud charges. They haven’t been charged with money laundering.Mr. McGlashan still plans to fight. The financier is accused of paying $50,000 to cheat on his son’s ACT and agreeing to pay $250,000 to help get him into U.S.C. But a lawyer for Mr. McGlashan said, “The prosecutor’s case against Mr. McGlashan is deeply flawed and ignores important exculpatory facts.”Lawmakers on both sides of the Atlantic are clamping down on misleading tactics used by some major tech companies to gain data from users.• Facebook will change its terms of service after bowing to pressure from the European Commission. The company “will spell out for users how the social-media platform makes money by using their personal information to sell targeted advertising, and clarify that it can be held liable for misuse of such data,” the WSJ reports.• American lawmakers are scrutinizing how users are coaxed into handing over data. So-called dark patterns, like user-interface designs that encourage people to share data that they may otherwise have kept private, are the focus of a new bill introduced by Senators Mark Warner and Deb Fischer.“For years, social media platforms have been relying on all sorts of tricks and tools to convince users to hand over their personal data without really understanding what they are consenting to,” Mr. Warner said in a statement.“Our goal is simple: to instill a little transparency in what remains a very opaque market and ensure that consumers are able to make more informed choices about how and when to share their personal information.”These are the latest efforts to regulate Big Tech, part of a campaign that is gathering pace among lawmakers around the world.Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain is in Brussels again today for a summit meeting with European leaders, where she will seek an extension to the troubled Brexit process. She’s unlikely to get exactly what she wants.Mrs. May went on a “begging tour,” in the words of the German publication Der Spiegel. She visited Berlin and Paris yesterday to plead with national leaders to grant her more time to salvage her faltering withdrawal plans, Stephen Castle of the NYT explains.Mrs. May wants to delay Brexit until June 30. But that would require her to get a deal through Parliament quickly, which seems unlikely. If she can’t secure an extension, Britain would crash out of the bloc without a deal on Friday.The E.U. is open to a longer postponement. The European Council president, Donald Tusk, is said to prefer an extension as long as a year, Bloomberg reports — with the option of an early exit if the British government ends its deadlock. (France reportedly wants such an extension to carry strict conditions.)The hope for a longer extension is that a deadlock could be broken by any of these events happening by the end of the year:• Parliament approving a deal.• A general election.• A second referendum.• A new prime minister.More: How London banks are trying to dodge Brexit.Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told House lawmakers yesterday that his department had discussed the potential release of President Trump’s tax returns with White House lawyers.It was the first public acknowledgment that such discussions have taken place. Mr. Mnuchin, whose department oversees the I.R.S., will have a role in deciding whether to honor Democrats’ request for the president’s tax returns.The Treasury secretary said that he hadn’t personally spoken with anyone from the White House, and that the discussions so far had been “informational.” He added that he had not been briefed on the talks otherwise.Democrats have demanded the returns under a legal statute that they say gives them a right to the information. Mr. Trump and his staff have said they will fight the request.Mr. Mnuchin deflected questions on how he will proceed. He told lawmakers that he wouldn’t let politics interfere with his decision, but added that Mr. Trump had a right to privacy.Democrats were angry. “I think the fact that there was any communication with the White House about this is deeply troubling and certainly violates the spirit of the law, if not the letter of the law,” Representative Carolyn Maloney of New York said.The firm said yesterday that it planned to raise its minimum wage over the next two years — just a day before its C.E.O., Brian Moynihan, is set to testify alongside other banking chiefs on Capitol Hill, Emily Flitter of the NYT reports.• Mr. Moynihan said yesterday that Bank of America’s lowest-paid employees would earn $17 an hour starting next month. That will gradually tick up to $20 an hour.• “It was another example of how big banks are trying to deal with shifting political winds in Washington, where they face new scrutiny under the Democrats, who now control the House of Representatives,” Ms. Flitter writes.• Mr. Moynihan and the C.E.O.s of JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and other banks are scheduled to testify before the House Financial Services Committee this morning.• “The banks’ leaders must explain to progressive representatives like Maxine Waters of California and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York why they are paid more than 700 times what low-wage workers, including some tellers in their branches, earn each year.”• They will also be asked about diversity, fair lending and the financial services industry’s ties to gun makers.You can watch the hearing here at 9 a.m. Eastern.Magic Johnson unexpectedly resigned as the L.A.

Sign up here.The Justice Department partly unsealed a pair of indictments yesterday that accuse the Chinese telecommunications firm of trying to steal trade secrets, evade economic sanctions on Iran and obstruct a criminal investigation into its behavior.The context: The charges come as officials from Beijing and Washington prepare to continue trade negotiations and as the Trump administration tries to shoulder Huawei out of international efforts to build the next generation of wireless networks, known as 5G. The company has denied the claims; a spokesman for China’s industry and information technology ministry called them “unfair and immoral.”The allegations: The U.S. says that Meng Wanzhou, Huawei’s chief financial officer and the daughter of its founder, Ren Zhengfei, participated in a plot to defraud four large banks into clearing millions of dollars in transactions with Iran in violation of international sanctions. American officials say that Huawei tried to impede their investigation by destroying evidence and by moving employees out of the U.S. to prevent them from being called as witnesses. The company, prosecutors say, also stole information about a phone-testing robot called Tappy from T-Mobile facilities in Washington state and encouraged employees to steal other confidential information from competitors.What now: Matthew Whitaker, the acting attorney general, said that the U.S. government wants to have Ms. Meng extradited from Canada, where she was detained last year at Washington’s request and where officials are now on tricky political turf trying to balance American and Chinese interests. The tussle has the industry on edge; an internal assessment from Deutsche Telekom concluded that the 5G rollout in Europe would be delayed by at least two years and cost billions of euros if governments banned Huawei, whose technology underpins much of the current network infrastructure.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________The Huawei charges will complicate negotiations on Wednesday that were already expected to be tense.A delegation of dozens of Chinese representatives led by Vice Premier Liu He will meet near the White House with a group headed by Robert Lighthizer, President Trump’s top trade negotiator, and Steven Mnuchin, the treasury secretary. On Thursday, Mr. Liu is expected to meet with Mr. Trump.Mr. Mnuchin said there had been “significant movement” on talks that involved “very complicated issues,” including intellectual property protections and questions of enforcement. The Chinese may offer to increase their purchases of U.S. farm products and energy, and slightly change their industrial policies, while pushing back on demands to eliminate subsidies to favored industries.The parties have until early March to reach an agreement, or else risk an escalation in the trade conflict.Mr. Trump is being pressured by the markets and the corporate sector to deliver a deal. A recent survey found that his trade policies had led more than a third of American manufacturers to raise prices. Yesterday, the chip maker Nvidia and the bulldozer builder Caterpillar both issued warnings about business conditions in China.As Eswar Prasad, the former head of the International Monetary Fund’s China division, notes:“The damaging economic effects of the shutdown and Trump’s desire to score a cleaner win at least on trade could also make U.S. negotiators somewhat more flexible and willing to strike a deal.”The five weeks when much of the government was out of commission cost the U.S. economy $11 billion, nearly a quarter of it permanently lost, the Congressional Budget Office said yesterday.That’s nearly double the $5.7 billion President Trump is seeking for a southern border wall — a project he still wants and is still threatening to shut down the government to get.The damage will be mitigated somewhat as furloughed workers start to receive their back pay, but with the government only funded for three weeks, many federal employees plan to hold off on spending.Here’s another wrinkle: Government statisticians just now returning to work are behind on collecting and analyzing figures on retail sales, manufacturing data, housing statistics and other information. Investors, executives and analysts nervous about signs of weakness in the economy are grasping for details about the labor market, inflation and business spending. And when the Federal Reserve’s policymaking group meets starting today, it will be missing some of its customary guides.Howard Schultz, the former chief executive of Starbucks, told Andrew yesterday that he was not fazed by criticism that his potential presidential bid as an independent could strengthen President Trump’s chances for re-election.“Nobody wants to see Donald Trump removed from office more than me,” Mr. Schultz said at an event in a Barnes & Noble bookstore in New York to kick off his national book tour.Responding to critics: Mr. Trump said in an early morning tweet that Mr. Schultz did not have the “guts” to run, a taunt that Mr. Schultz called “childish.” Michael Bloomberg, another possible presidential contender, condemned independent bids.Hecklers in the crowd: “Don’t help elect Trump,” yelled one protester, who was escorted out of the event in New York. Mr. Schultz was interrupted a second time by a man who chanted, “Health care is a human right.”More: Bill Burton, a former adviser to President Barack Obama, pushed back against criticism over his decision to join Mr. Schultz’s team. And the harsh response on social media to a potential Schultz candidacy could affect the Starbucks brand, according to the Washington Post.Carlos Ghosn, the global auto chief indicted on charges of financial wrongdoing, remains consigned to a small cell after a Tokyo court again denied his bail request. His predicament has turned a spotlight on the Japanese criminal justice system, writes the NYT’s Motoko Rich:The lawyers can detain defendants for more than three weeks before bringing charges, arrest suspects multiple times to extend their detention and interrogate them without their counsel.Some in the West have reacted strongly to the power that prosecutors have wielded. “This is an approach to the rights of accused people that one would expect in a dictatorship, not in Japan,” one critic wrote.BlackBerry named Bryan Palma, a senior vice president at Cisco, as its chief operating officer and president.

(Want this by email? Sign up here.)The digital pin board company disclosed today that its I.P.O. would value it at less than its last private fund-raising round. That’s a big warning sign for other tech companies that are poised to go public this year.The high range of Pinterest’s I.P.O. would value it at $11.3 billion, below the $12 billion attained from private investors two years ago. In Silicon Valley speak, that’s a “down round” — something companies generally hope to avoid because it undermines confidence.Coupled with early volatility in Lyft’s first days of trading, the Pinterest offering suggests that public market investors are wary of maintaining high valuations for tech start-ups, especially given that many won’t turn a profit for years.It comes as a slew of unicorns are preparing to go public, including Uber (whose I.P.O. was expected to give a valuation as high as $120 billion), the workplace messaging platform Slack and the software company PagerDuty.But there’s some reason not to panic yet. After initially falling below their I.P.O. price, Lyft shares bounced back. Other companies have gone on to do well after down rounds: For instance, the file-sharing company Box is trading well above its debut price two years after its I.P.O. And Pinterest could end up pricing its offering higher if investor demand proves robust during its road show.More I.P.O. news: Though many investors are betting against Lyft’s newly public stock, the high-profile short seller Andrew Left isn’t among them. The Bridgewater Associates founder argued last week that capitalism “needs to be reformed.” Now he has outlined how he would do it:Declare the wealth and opportunity gaps a national emergency. “I have a principle that you will not effect change unless you affect the people who have their hands on the levers of power so that they move them to change things the way you want them to change,” he writes.Devise clear metrics for success. “I’d bring that sort of accountability down to the individual level to encourage an accountability culture in which individuals are aware of whether they are net contributors or net detractors to the society, and the individuals and the society make attempts to make them net contributors.”Redistribute resources to eliminate disparities. Mr. Dalio’s personal recommendations include:• Creating private-public partnerships that would vet and invest in projects that produce both social and economic returns.• Raise taxes on pollution and other causes of bad health.• Impose targeted tax increases on the wealthiest to pay for social welfare programs to bolster economic productivity.Better coordinate monetary and fiscal policies, so that more money ends up in the hands of people who will spend it (the lower and middle classes) as opposed to saving it (the wealthy).The British government has proposed sweeping new powers to regulate harmful content and false information, recommending one of the world’s most aggressive actions to police the internet, Adam Satariano of the NYT reports.• A regulator would be given the power to “issue fines, block access to websites if necessary and make individual executives legally liable for harmful content spread on their platforms.”• Terrorism, inciting violence, encouraging suicide, spreading disinformation and cyberbullying are among the topics that companies would be required to address. The rules would apply to social media platforms, discussion forums, messaging services and search engines.• Facebook and Twitter will work with the government, representatives from the companies said.“Actions in Britain and elsewhere signal a new era for the internet. Western democracies have largely avoided regulating online communication,” Mr. Satariano writes. But governments have become more willing to intervene “as evidence mounts that online actions are having harmful real-life consequences by contributing to violence, compromising elections and spreading hateful ideologies.”“In the United States, where free speech is more of a core value than in other nations, there’s been less momentum to regulate internet content,” Mr. Satariano adds. But even in America, there is increasing support for new rules.President Trump is ready to nominate Herman Cain and Stephen Moore — two vocal supporters of his policies — to the Federal Reserve board. Many analysts say such a move would politicize the central bank. Neil Irwin of the Upshot takes a look at what that would mean.Historically, Fed appointees have generally been economic experts who kept their political views out of policy discussions.Mr. Moore and Mr. Cain wouldn’t change much at first. They’d hold two of 12 votes on the Fed’s Open Market Committee, so their ability to swing other governors would depend on their politicking abilities.But over time, the Fed could lose credibility. “The United States’ role as the global reserve currency — which results in persistently low interest rates and little fear of capital flight — is built in significant part on the credibility the Fed has accumulated over decades,” Mr. Irwin writes.The financial world is watching closely. “I think it’s a very big benefit to the U.S. economy and the financial markets that we have a strong and independent Fed, and I hope that continues,” Ed Keon, the chief investment strategist at QMA, told CNBC.Nissan shareholders voted today to remove their former chairman, Carlos Ghosn, from the board altogether, the WSJ reports.• “Much of the meeting was devoted to questions from angry shareholders, with many demanding Nissan executives step down for failing to find alleged wrongdoing.”• “In response to a shareholder who accused Chief Executive Hiroto Saikawa of failing to take responsibility for any of the alleged wrongdoing, Mr. Saikawa said: ‘I never said we didn’t have responsibility. The problem built up over 20 years, and we cannot correct it overnight.’ ”Mr. Ghosn will be replaced by Renault’s chairman, Jean-Dominique Senard. Greg Kelly, who is accused of abetting inaccurate disclosure of Mr. Ghosn’s compensation, was also voted off the board.More: Mr. Ghosn’s wife has appealed to the French government to help her husband.Prime Minister Theresa May sought to rekindle cross-party talks about her Brexit deal yesterday, just days before Britain is due to leave the E.U. without a deal, Benjamin Mueller of the NYT reports:• Mrs. May is seeking a way to persuade members of the opposition Labour Party to back her deal.• But Labour leaders maintained on Sunday “that Mrs. May had not yet bent to any of their demands on the withdrawal.”• “And whatever overtures she makes to Labour, analysts said, she will struggle to guarantee that her successor as prime minister or a future Parliament will not rip up any compromise deal — a major sticking point in the cross-party talks.”Mrs. May will try to get another extension from Brussels this week. What such a delay would look like is undecided: Mrs. May wants a simple extension, while the European Council’s president, Donald Tusk, wants something more flexible. Either way, it will require the support of all 27 E.U. leaders at a summit meeting on Wednesday.If she doesn’t get an extension, Britain may crash out of the E.U. without a deal — or remain in the political bloc.Kirstjen Nielsen resigned as the secretary of homeland security yesterday.

By Danya IssawiThere are some lessons that can only be learned after your wedding day. We asked our readers to share some of what they had learned from their trips down the aisle. Here is a selection of tales of lost rings, ripped gowns and sweaty nuptials from former brides and grooms.It’s O.K. to not invite people. We stressed over the guest list for a long time, but by keeping it to close family and friends we were able to spend quality time with all our guests. Looking back, I know that the day wasn’t just for us. It was also to celebrate the love and support of those who helped us get to this point in our lives, as a couple and as individuals. I was lucky enough to dance with my grandfather at my wedding. It was the last time we were together as a family, he passed a few months after. It will remain one of my favorite memories of that day.Amelia Hoffman, New York Our wedding rings were kept in one jewelry box that our best man was holding in his pocket. My ring had a bracket with the center engagement ring inside; my husband's ring was in the pocket of the box. We repeatedly told the best man that my ring was loose, so be careful opening the spring-loaded box. Unfortunately, that advice wasn't enough. As I was coming down the aisle with my father, he opened the box to get the rings ready without looking at it closely. My ring popped out and fell to the deck of our Waterside Lake ceremony. The engagement ring popped out and fell into the lake! Our best man crashed to the deck, but couldn’t save it. My husband thought he passed out from the 90-degree weather, but soon learned that my engagement ring had fallen into the lake. I didn't know this happened until the middle of the ceremony when my husband had the ring in his hand, and I whispered “Where's the other half?” He said, “Just roll with it." So the lesson learned: Have the rings in separate boxes or have them tied to a pillow. Fortunately, we had a successful ending with a ring retrieval. We used the photographers light and a very trustworthy friend in the lake. My ring was presented to me at the reception, and all was made good again.Leann Diederich, Bellefonte, Pa.I wish I had stayed in close touch with the caterer the week leading up to the wedding. Because of a miscommunication, I walked into my reception to find the wrong entree on the tables. Check in all week long as you prep for the reception, and triple check the menu for any changes. My brother-in-law went out and bought a bottle of each of the wines the caterer had suggested for his daughter's upcoming wedding so he could sample them at home. This was a genius idea. You could taste them at a leisurely pace, and you can also know what they taste like an hour after they've been opened.Kelly Caldwell, New YorkMoney saved! We got married in our living room. Then, five months later, we had a cookout with a D.J., open bar and food. Everyone said they had a blast, and a couple people even thanked us for being “nontraditional.” We invited all of our friends in town, got a couple of Airbnbs and planned a Detroit-themed weekend. We spent $3,000 for everything, cash. Then saved up and spent $15,000 on our two-week honeymoon to East Africa.Megan Watt, DetroitTake location seriously because your photos show so much more than a beautiful view. I loved that we had our wedding in Mexico, but the weather wasn't for the faint of heart. We didn't even make it to pictures before our wedding party was sweaty, hot and out of their suits. Yes, aesthetics are the ultimate goal, but unhappy people aren't fun. And that's the point of weddings: fun.Elizabeth Kelley, Columbus, Ohio.Just as my then-fiancé and I stood up from this photo, he stepped on my dress and ripped part of the train. I'd been so careful to shield my dress from horses, dirt paths, unfinished wood, my own heels and grass. None of this was easy when you're getting married in a field outside of a ski lodge in Idaho. In one second, all of that work was rendered fruitless. I wish someone had told me that no wedding is perfect, that something is always going to go wrong. More likely, numerous things are going to go wrong. The hairstylist will get amnesia and forget what you agreed on (this also happened to me). The cake will fall apart. The flowers won't arrive until after the ceremony. People will give toasts regardless of your efforts to stop them from grabbing a microphone after a bottle of wine. That's just what weddings are like, and that's O.K. It's more than O.K. A perfect wedding is a boring wedding. It's the things that go wrong that become the stories you'll tell the most after the fact, especially when you're trying to comfort other brides. Kate Wutz, Ketchum, IdahoDon’t let your girlfriends have the keys to your wedding suite. They put crackers in our bed and said it was an old Swedish tradition. It ruined our sleep and we were so tired from the long day.Kari Olsson, Walnut Creek, Calif. Don’t get a wedding planner. Also, no need to spend money on small details (stationery, table décor, etc.). No one will remember them anyway.Augusta Powell, Baldwin, N.Y.Don’t make assumptions about how many guests will decline. Plan as if each invitee will be there. This means you need to think carefully and practically about the guest list. We started with a large list and delicately (and sometimes uncomfortably) whittled it down. This is your day. Who do you actually want to share it with?Raina Allair and Matthew Kallman, New YorkAs a professional event planner, I thought I would handle my own wedding planning easily. In reality it meant that I overthought and second-guessed every decision because I thought it had to be “perfect” — in hindsight, I wish I had realized that “good” was fine! I sent my bridesmaids dozens of emails with ideas for which bracelet I should wear. I researched countless floral arrangements and color schemes. I meticulously sewed 100 napkins in vintage floral fabrics. And for what? I wish I'd just relaxed, and enjoyed the process, and stopped doing so much work to decide everything. I always joke with my brides now, “Did you keep dating after you got engaged, or did you stop looking for a partner? Were you able to meet every single available person out there, or did you stop when you found one you liked?” I wish I'd applied that lesson to my own event and looked at a floral arrangement and said, Yup, that works just fine.Lisa Sullivan, Columbus, OhioWear whatever shoes you want. I wore Toms, because they're comfortable. People will try and tell you that you should wear cute sandals or heels, but believe me you will thank yourself if you wear shoes that you enjoy. They're your feet and you have to stand a lot of the day. Be comfy.Josie Crotty, Columbia, Md.Get a day-of-wedding coordinator! Our hired transportation for guests to the venue dropped the ball, leaving many stranded without a ride. The minutes before walking down the aisle were not spent sipping champagne but on the phone screaming at the bus company while my brother was helping great-aunts figure out Uber. We spent a lot on the wedding, and I wish we spent just a little bit more for someone to handle the hiccups in the day.Cate Star Kelly, SeattleAlthough now 41 years ago, I still give all brides the same advice: Make sure your band is listed in the contract by musician’s name and instrument. I booked my band with a band leader who played at the Chicago Gold Coast Hotel. I verbally specified a piano, sax, drums and bass and said I hated electric guitars and accordions. But it wasn’t written in the contract. So guess what showed up! My only compensation was that my lawyer uncle got a 50 percent refund, but it was too late to change out the musicians that night!Stefanie Livolsi, Pasadena, Calif.I always dreamed of the perfect fall outdoor event. I was glued to the weather reports leading up to the ceremony. It didn't rain, thank goodness, but it was very hot and humid despite it being October. My husband's glasses fogged up during the vows and his best man was sweating more than I thought humanly possible.Gina Hill, AtlantaMake backups of everything that is important to you, both on paper and in terms of equipment. Oh, and don’t pay your wedding vendors through PayPal.Tara Tyrrell, BostonI neglected to slide some tissues up the sleeve of my lacy top. I spent much of the ceremony sniffing and trying to unobtrusively wipe tears of joy from my face. Oh, and we also forgot to make sure our cameras had fresh batteries for their flash attachments, But that's no longer the problem it was in 1973!Sharon Smith, Brentwood, Calif.Don't stress over the small details. They almost never matter. Some brides and grooms want to plan the perfect wedding party and often get so absorbed in the planning that they think that the small things (tablecloth material, uplight color, entrance songs) will make or break the night. They forget about the important things (spending time with each other and families). As long as the two people getting married are happy (and the guests are well fed), the celebration will go down as a good one.Supriya Sarkar, Atlanta If there is still time: Elope, elope, elope.Finn McMahon, Winnipeg, Manitoba, CanadaI wish I had asked our photographer to take a group picture at every table. I know it’s cheesy, but it ensures that you have a memory of everyone who was there. Our album is beautiful, but it pains me that some of our friends and loved ones aren’t pictured at all.Lauren Covello Jacobs, Astoria, QueensAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byThere are other tools that don’t involve quite the risks and challenges of targeting the richest families. By Neil IrwinWhen the United States government wants to raise money from individuals, its mode of choice, for more than a century, has been to tax what people earn — the income they receive from work or investments.But what if instead the government taxed the wealth you had accumulated?That is the idea behind a policy Senator Elizabeth Warren has embraced in her presidential campaign. It represents a more substantial rethinking of the federal government’s approach to taxation than anything a major presidential candidate has proposed in recent memory — a new wealth tax that would have enormous implications for inequality.It would shift more of the burden of paying for government toward the families that have accumulated fortunes in the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars. And over time, such a tax would make it less likely that such fortunes develop.It would create big new challenges for the I.R.S. in ensuring compliance. There is a reason many European countries that once had a wealth tax have abandoned it in the last couple of decades.And that’s before you get to the legal and political challenges. There is an open debate around whether a wealth tax is constitutional. And some of the most powerful families in the country would certainly deploy their vast resources against a wealth tax, and against any candidate who embraces it.The comedian Chris Rock had a routine in the early 2000s in which he expounded on the distinction between those who are rich and those who are wealthy.Shaquille O’Neal, the star basketball player, was rich, Mr. Rock said. The team owner who signed his paycheck was wealthy. And that, in a nutshell, gets at the conceptual difference between trying to tax people’s income, as the tax code does today, versus their wealth.The C.E.O. of Walmart makes about $22 million a year. He is rich by any definition. But the Walton family, descendants of the company’s founder, are mind-bogglingly wealthy. The Bloomberg Billionaires index estimates that Sam Walton’s three living children are worth around $45 billion each, putting them each among the 20 wealthiest people in the world.A family that has accumulated enormous wealth can escape with surprisingly low income levels, and therefore tax burdens.In an extreme example, Warren Buffett owns enough stock in Berkshire Hathaway to put his estimated net worth at $84 billion, but he pays himself $100,000 a year to be its chief executive. Even in years when his wealth rises by billions, he must pay tax only on his comparatively modest income and on the gains from shares that he chooses to sell.Ms. Warren and other advocates of a wealth tax argue that this accumulation of untaxed or lightly taxed wealth is a bad thing. They say that it enables the creation of democracy-distorting dynasties who accumulate political power, and that tax policy should be used to rein them in more than the current tax code does.Developed by Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, two University of California, Berkeley, economists who are leading scholars of inequality, the proposal is to tax a family’s wealth above $50 million at 2 percent a year, with an additional surcharge of 1 percent on wealth over $1 billion.Mr. Saez and Mr. Zucman estimate that 75,000 households would owe such a tax, or about one out of 1,700 American families.A family worth $60 million would owe the federal government $200,000 in wealth tax, over and above what they may owe on income from wages, dividends or interest payments.If the estimates of his net worth are accurate, Mr. Buffett would owe the I.R.S. about $2.5 billion a year, in addition to income or capital gains taxes. The Waltons would owe about $1.3 billion each.The tax would therefore chip away at the net worth of the extremely rich, especially if they mainly hold investments with low returns, like bonds, or depreciating assets like yachts.It would work a little like the property tax that most cities and states impose on real estate, an annual payment tied to the value of assets rather than income. But instead of applying just to homes and land, it would apply to everything: fine art collections, yachts and privately held businesses. They are both philosophical and practical.On the philosophical side, you can argue that people who have earned money, and paid appropriate income tax on it, are entitled to the wealth they accumulate.Moreover, the wealth that individual families accumulate under the current system is arguably likelier to be put to work investing in large-scale projects that make the economy stronger. They can invest in innovative companies, for example, or huge real estate projects, in ways that small investors generally can’t.It could disincentivize the kinds of moonshot investments that don’t pay steady, predictable returns but can transform society. After all, if wealthy investors are on the hook for a wealth tax every year, they may strongly favor investments that pay a steady, reliable dividend over those that are risky and will take many years to pay off.Then there are the practical concerns.Figuring out a person’s total net worth can be a lot of work. Just ask anyone who has had to sort through a large estate after the death of a relative to submit estate taxes.If the deceased owned financial assets like stock and bonds, it’s pretty easy to check a brokerage statement and surmise the value. But if the estate consisted of a collection of rare antiques — or interests in various real estate or oil and gas projects, or closely held companies — estimating the value is harder.It can require an army of appraisers and other experts and an often prolonged period of I.R.S. audits and disputes over valuation.“Presumably, a wealth tax would apply to the same sort of base, except that it would be annual rather than just when a person dies,” said Beth Shapiro Kaufman, an estates lawyer at Caplin & Drysdale.The very wealthy would have a permanent, continuing need to tally the value of their assets and defend those valuations to the federal government. The Warren plan includes substantial new funding for I.R.S. staff to enforce the law.And some people may have their wealth tied up in things not easily converted to cash. An early investor in Uber or another company that has achieved a high valuation without going public might have a high enough net worth to owe a wealth tax, but not the easily accessible funds to pay it.Mr. Zucman argues that people wealthy enough to owe this tax would generally have ample access to credit, and that the law could even be structured to let people pay their tax obligations with illiquid assets.Gene Sperling, a former National Economic Council director in the Obama and Clinton administrations who now supports a wealth tax, said: “If we were sitting here in 1932 saying we need to create a Social Security system, it would have seemed very complex, but if it’s important enough, you don’t let some complexity become a reason not to push forward.”The wealth tax Ms. Warren proposes would also apply to assets that American citizens own overseas. So in theory, a wealthy American citizen would owe tax on his Panamanian bank account and his Swiss ski chalet.Ensuring payment would be tricky, which is why the proposal includes all those new I.R.S. employees and stronger international coordination to stop tax avoidance and evasion — as well as an “exit fee” that Americans would need to pay if they sought to renounce their citizenship.There’s an old line attributed to a 17th-century French politician that the art of taxation is to pluck a goose so as to obtain the largest possible quantity of feathers with a minimum amount of hissing. In the recent past, wealth taxes have failed that test.In the early 2000s, 10 developed countries had a net wealth tax, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. That is now down to three, the O.E.C.D said: Switzerland, Norway and Spain. France recently changed its wealth tax into a tax only on real estate, more akin to the American property tax.One problem was that some of the wealth tax plans kicked in at a relatively low level, meaning a vast number of upper-middle-class people faced its nuisance and expense. In Europe, especially, it created incentives for people to relocate.Mr. Zucman says the United States, as a large country, is better positioned than small countries where wealthy citizens are likely to be highly mobile already. The idea is that Americans will be less likely to renounce their citizenship to avoid paying out a couple of percent of their net worth every year.An income tax is clearly authorized by the 16th Amendment, which states that Congress has the power to “lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived.” A wealth tax is more likely to raise constitutional questions, and it’s a near certainty that well-funded opponents would wage a legal battle against it.(Josh Barro at New York Magazine lays out the legal questions here.)There is. Some tax experts say changes to existing law would accomplish many of the goals of a wealth tax.One example that Leonard Burman of Syracuse University and the Urban Institute has suggested is to eliminate a provision of current law in which assets that increase in value can go essentially untaxed across generations.If you start a company and its value appreciates over your lifetime, then it is transferred to a family member upon your death, no capital gains taxes are collected on those decades of appreciation. The family member gets to start over at its current valuation for capital gains purposes.This “step-up” provision is one of numerous ways that families can accumulate great wealth with minimal taxation. It could be eliminated. Laws could be changed to make it harder to avoid the estate tax, which currently kicks in at about $11 million for an individual and about $23 million for a married couple.If you want a tax system that leans more aggressively against dynastic wealth and high inequality, there are, in other words, tools that don’t involve quite the risks and challenges of a wealth tax.But those are a lot harder to capture in a campaign ad, and in the public imagination.An earlier version of this article misstated the threshold for estate tax. It is around $23 million for a married couple, not around $11 million.Neil Irwin is a senior economics correspondent for The Upshot. He previously wrote for The Washington Post and is the author of “The Alchemists: Three Central Bankers and a World on Fire.”  @Neil_Irwin • Facebook Advertisementcorner officeThe founder and chief executive of Code.org, who was born in Iran, says computer science is a “foundational skill,” one that future doctors, lawyers and politicians should all possess. Hadi Partovi, the founder of Code.org.CreditCreditMatt Edge for The New York TimesSupported byBy David GellesJust how much influence should Silicon Valley have over the classroom? It’s a question roiling educational circles, and one The New York Times explored in a recent series of articles. At the center of the debate are organizations like Code.org, a nonprofit group that advocates computer science training and provides coding curriculum for schools around the country. Founded by Hadi Partovi, an Iranian immigrant who had an enormously successful career in the technology industry, Code.org is backed by companies including Google, Facebook and Microsoft.Mr. Partovi grew up in Iran during the revolution, moving to the United States when he was 11. He attended Harvard, then joined Microsoft, where he worked on Internet Explorer during the browser wars. After leaving Microsoft he founded Tellme Networks, which was acquired by Microsoft for $800 million. He is also an angel investor, and was an early backer of Facebook, Dropbox and Airbnb.Mr. Partovi’s relatives are similarly precocious. His twin brother, Ali, also founded a company that was sold to Microsoft. And his cousins include Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive of Uber, as well as senior executives at Intel, Google and Allen & Company, the influential investment bank. This interview, which was condensed and edited for clarity, was conducted in San Francisco. What was your childhood like? When I was 7 and the country was going through a revolution and war, I don’t remember thinking, “Oh my god, I’m suffering hardship.” I had no context. I just was like, “O.K. This sucks. But I can just go on with the day.” I got used to seeing people getting killed and waking up every morning to go to the roof to see which houses near us were still standing or not. Thinking about it now, I’m like, “God, that’s horrible.” Back then, that was just routine.What did your parents do? Both my parents were educated in the United States. My dad had gone to M.I.T. My mom was a computer scientist from Boston University. And we had a whole lot of extended family here.Part of the challenge for me living in Iran was that my entire family, other than my mom and dad and brother, basically had left and fled the country, and we stayed behind. The reason we stayed behind was that my father had started the technology university there, and he said, “The country’s going through all this challenge, but if the education system falls apart, who knows what’s going to happen?”When did you get interested in technology? My dad started teaching us on a programmable calculator when my brother and I were 8 years old. And then the next year, he brought a Commodore 64 home. In Iran at the time, there was nothing fun to do. There was no Xbox, no PlayStation, no internet. We had one TV channel; it was all propaganda. There were no sports in school. So for us, this computer was an escape from just a horrid life situation. It was really the only good thing we had in our life.How did you get out of Iran?To get the permission to leave, my dad had to promise the minister of education that he was coming back — that he wasn’t taking his family to leave forever. He was like, “I give you my word. I’m coming back.” And when we came to America, pretty much the first thing he did was to say, “All right. I’m going back. You guys can stay here.” My mom was like, “What are you talking about? We’re done with that country.” And he said, “I just want to go for one or two years because I gave my word, and then I’ll join you guys.” So we spent a year or two in America with our dad living in Iran, only because he wanted to stay true to his word.Tell me about arriving in the United States.We were not well-off at all. Our family couldn’t afford a home. So all four of us lived in one bedroom in my grandma’s house in one bed, which is an awkward thing to do when you’re 12 years old. My parents worked three jobs, but they put all of the money toward our education. That left an imprint of how important education is. Education is the No. 1 thing you should invest in.You have many relatives who’ve also been successful in the technology industry. How do you explain that? Entrepreneurship is in my family’s blood. My grandfather and all of his brothers started a great company together almost 100 years ago. It was called Alborz Corporation, and it was one of the largest industrial companies in Iran. They started by being a trading company and importing goods, but then all the most popular goods they’d import they’d start manufacturing locally, in partnership with whoever was the original producer. Then the entire company was taken away by the government as part of the revolution. So growing up in America, there was this desire for us to effectively make back the money that our family had lost.After you graduated college you went to work for Microsoft. What did you work on while you were there?The project I’m most proud of is Internet Explorer. Today, Internet Explorer is the dead bastard stepchild of the Web browser market. But I joined that team when it was nine people and two years behind Netscape Navigator in the famous browser wars. It was one of the craziest start-up experiences in a very large company. My proudest creation there was Internet Explorer 5.0 and 5.5. At the time it was a really fantastic product.It’s a bit hard to imagine Microsoft acting like a start-up.The Internet Explorer team was probably the hardest-working team I’ve ever been on. And I’ve been at multiple start-ups. We would have foosball tournaments for the team at 2 a.m., just to get everybody’s energy back up to continue working. Everybody was working every day, every night. One of the team managers had a sign on his door saying, “This is why I’m going home this evening.” And it was a picture that his daughter had made of the family that showed mommy and daddy and son. But, the picture of daddy was a car leaving the garage. There were many divorces and broken families and bad things that came out of that. But what I learned was that even at a 20,000-person company, you can get a team of 50 or 100 people to work like their life depends on it.You’ve gone on to be an angel investor. How do you decide which companies to invest in?I give coding interviews to the chief technology officers of any start-up I invest in. When I met Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi from Dropbox, I flew them out to meet in Seattle, and I had them both do coding interviews in my house. I had them take a list of numbers and remove all the duplicates from the list. And the other was to write the code to shuffle a deck of cards. So, relatively simple stuff. I mean, you should be able to do it in 20 minutes if you know what you’re doing. It’s not rocket science.I’m not a coder. Is there one right answer to those questions?No. There’s a little back and forth of seeing how you’re going to go about the problem. And also since these were two that were going to be start-up founders, what are their communication skills like? Because if the C.E.O. just writes the answers and gives it back to you, that’s different than if they walk you through their thinking and explain why they come up with something. When you’re interviewing a potential leader you need to look for both of those things.How did Code.org get started?The moment of inspiration was the day Steve Jobs died. I had wanted to make a video that featured the best technologists talking about the importance of computer science, and I was like, “God. The best of them just died. He can’t be in my video anymore.” That gave me the onus to start Code.org.And why is it so important that kids learn to code? The idea for Code.org isn’t that every kid should learn to code, it’s that every school should teach computer science. We use the word “coding” because it’s more hip. But computer science really is a subject that needs to be taught. And the reason for this isn’t because there’s so many coding jobs or that coding pays well or things like that. The reason is because computer science is foundational. Every school teaches biology, every school teaches chemistry, every school teaches algebra. You wouldn’t envision going to a school that just said, “We don’t teach that.” We’ve done some reporting on the influence that big tech companies are gaining over educational curriculum. Is that appropriate? What Code.org does is focus primarily on foundational learning. And even when we involve our industry donors, we’re very clear with them that what we’re doing isn’t vocational. You can’t take Code.org’s courses and then get a job at Google. But it gets you interested that maybe, hey, I might want to pursue that.There are a few companies that are proactively trying to get their platform into schools or trying to sell their devices into schools and there’s some self-interest there, but the Code.org ecosystem doesn’t have that. Do you think there should be legislation that mandates schools teach computer science?I believe schools should be mandated to teach computer science. You would never send your child to a school that didn’t teach math. In the 21st century, computer science is as important as biology. Understanding photosynthesis or H2O or electricity is just as foundational as understanding how the internet works or what an algorithm is. These things are impacting our daily lives. We need future lawyers and doctors and politicians to all understand it. We’re not trying to prepare kids for jobs. We’re trying to prepare kids for life.David Gelles is the Corner Office columnist and a business reporter.

But big fights still await.By Vivian WangALBANY — The words “Albany” and “lively” are not often used together, but on Wednesday, the first day of the year’s legislative session, the halls of the New York State Capitol were roaring.Legislators shouted greetings down the ornate Romanesque hallways. Aides jogged between offices. Lobbyists swarmed the elevators and rifled for business cards.In the coming months, there will be bills to pass and deals to cut. Egos and relationships will bruise along the way. But on the first day, optimism was the dominant emotion, at least for Democrats, who this year will control both chambers of the Legislature and the governor’s office for the first time in a decade.That optimism became especially clear just after 1 p.m., when Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins formally ascended the dais as the first woman ever to lead the Senate majority. As the applause settled and the senators, both Republican and Democratic, took their seats after a standing ovation, Ms. Stewart-Cousins — wearing a custom scarf emblazoned with New York State’s seal — nodded to the historic nature of her ascent.“Not that long ago, women weren’t even allowed to walk on the floor of these chambers,” she said.Ms. Stewart-Cousins then proceeded to list the many reforms she said will follow this year. A sampling: the codification of abortion rights under state law; expansion of voting rights; protection of child sex abuse victims; bail reform; a revamp of campaign finance laws.“There is nothing to stop us, and there is so much more that we have to accomplish,” she said.While that may be true on some bills — the ones above are expected to sail through — on others, fissures are already showing. And for the most part, the disagreements are within the Democratic Party: between urban legislators and those from outside cities, moderates and progressives.In other words, the liveliness of the first day is sure to continue in the months ahead, but the fate of the optimism remains to be seen.Here are five of the most pressing and vexing questions that loom in Albany:The subways need money. The subways have no money. On that much, lawmakers agree. But when it comes to how to get that money, things get complicated fast.The most high-profile suggestion is congestion pricing, which would charge drivers who enter parts of Manhattan during the busiest times of day. Mr. Cuomo has declared it the “only realistic option” for saving the subway, and groups from unions to real estate developers have backed it. But the plan foundered last year after lawmakers outside Manhattan said it would burden constituents in transit-starved areas who had no choice but to drive.It was a rare issue that fell not along partisan lines but rather geographic ones. This means the Democratic takeover of the Senate does not necessarily mean the proposal will fare any better this time. Ms. Stewart-Cousins represents suburban Westchester, and has said congestion pricing is one of many options she will examine.Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz, a Bronx Democrat, said he had seen no indication that revenue would go toward urgent repairs, rather than flashier projects like the new Second Avenue subway stations.“If I had to make a list of priorities, adding a few subway stations to the richest neighborhood in the country wouldn’t have been my top,” he said, adding, “We have to remember that we have five boroughs, not just Manhattan.”But other funding proposals, such as a tax on high earners, have been shot down by Mr. Cuomo and others. Assemblyman David I. Weprin, a Democrat from Queens, said he would support a tax on commuters from outside the city, but that idea cost Senate Democrats their last majority in 2010. Even a halfway measure last year, which put a surcharge on for-hire vehicles such as taxis and Ubers, has stalled after outcry from taxi drivers.And even if congestion pricing does pass, it would not cover all the needed subway repairs.But hey, at least the L train is staying open.New York’s rent stabilization laws expire in June, and activists and lobbyists are already arming for what they say will be one of the year’s biggest battles.Tenants’ rights advocates say this is their chance to end loopholes that help landlords remove apartments from rent stabilization. Bills that lawmakers may tackle relate to vacancy decontrol, which lets landlords deregulate certain apartments when they become empty; preferential rent rates, which can disguise illegally inflated rent; and the use of major capital improvements to allow landlords to raise rents after big renovations.But the real estate industry has long been a source of political donations, funneling money to Mr. Cuomo and the long-reigning Senate Republicans. This year, as the political winds shifted, developers began giving to the Senate Democrats, and they also fueled the wins by Mr. Cuomo and the new state attorney general, Letitia James.Still, there are signs of the industry’s weakened grip. Several newly elected lawmakers have pledged to fight for universal rent control; Senator Michael Gianaris, the chamber’s No. 2 Democrat, has stopped accepting real estate donations, as his Queens district has seen an influx of young and vocal progressives.Michael McKee, treasurer of the Tenants Political Action Committee, an advocacy group, said he was optimistic but not naïve about winning stronger rent laws.“We obviously can’t take anything for granted just because we have a Democratic majority,” he said. “We’re going to have to work very hard for this, because we have powerful enemies and they have a lot of money.”The issue of school funding has perhaps offered the clearest sign that a Democrat-run Albany does not mean one big happy family.The trouble started in December when Mr. Cuomo called a 1993 lawsuit, which successfully argued that the state had underfunded public schools, a ghost of the past. Six newly elected senators hit back to say the state still owed districts money. “And if the governor tries to deny me that, then he’s got a fight on his hands,” Senator Robert Jackson, who was one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit, said in an interview.Lawmakers, advocacy groups and Mr. Cuomo have continued to trade barbs on the topic, with the governor comparing his critics to people who believe Earth is flat.New York State United Teachers, the state’s powerful teachers union, has also called for more funding. It is still pushing to increase oversight of charter schools and decouple teacher evaluations from test scores — a measure that both chambers actually agreed on last year, but that ultimately died amid end-of-session horse-trading.A bill to create a Medicare for all-styled system for New York would be one of the most expensive items the Legislature could take up this year. It has passed the Assembly several times, and Senate Democrats have pledged their support, too. The idea has high-profile backers including the City Council speaker, Corey Johnson. So it should fly through, right?Not exactly.Powerful insurance companies and business councils have hired lobbyists and rolled out campaigns to oppose the plan. They warn of job loss and new taxes. (A study by the RAND Corporation last year found that single-payer could save the state money, but that the findings were “highly uncertain.”)Mr. Cuomo — a fiscal moderate — may also not run to sign such a bill. He has called single-payer “conceptually” the right idea but said it would be better tied to action on the federal level, citing the huge upfront cost to the state.“I have a lot of great ideas of Christmas gifts that I want to get, but then I’m going to have to deal with the reality of the cost and the budget,” he said in a radio interview.If a promise to clean up Albany is a prerequisite for any candidate’s stump speech, a failure to do it seems the norm once they are elected.Like congestion pricing, this issue doesn’t fall neatly along partisan lines. (Both the former Democratic Assembly speaker and the former Republican Senate leader were convicted recently, as were aides to the governor.) And the issues on the table are myriad, from legislators’ outside income to bid-rigging scandals.One of the ugliest fights so far — and the session hasn’t even started! — stems from an outside panel’s recommendation last month that legislators receive their first pay raise in 20 years. But the rub was the proposal to cap outside income, which has been at the heart of corruption woes. The Assembly speaker, Carl E. Heastie, was decidedly not pleased by that caveat, accusing the commission of overstepping its bounds and calling one of its members a “chicken” and a rubber stamp for the governor. Mr. Heastie has promised to address the issue somehow this year, though he’s been short on details.Then there are the escalating threats over who will investigate the other more. Several Democratic legislators have promised to make the Legislature a more robust investigative body, open to probes of the governor’s office. Mr. Cuomo, in turn, threatened to investigate them right back, in what he called “an investigations battle.”“Every grant that the Legislature does goes through my government, so I can investigate every one of those,” he said in a radio interview.The Legislature’s track record on actually moving oversight bills does not inspire confidence. Last session, the Senate passed a bipartisan bill to clean up the state’s contracting process and create a “database of deals” to track state subsidies. The Assembly refused to take it up. Still, some reformers are optimistic that the wave of energetic progressives will finally force lawmakers to act. Or as Senator Alessandra Biaggi, a newly elected Democrat from the Bronx who will lead the chamber’s ethics committee, put it: “Let me get to work!”Vivian Wang is a reporter for the Metro Desk, covering New York State politics in Albany.

Then everyone watched the company’s sizzle reel: Ms. Tosi riding a bike through the city. Ms. Tosi discussing failure. Ms. Tosi making the cakes with no side frosting that have become so popular the model and cookbook author Chrissy Teigen documented her attempt to make one for her 33 million followers on Twitter and Instagram.Next up were clips from her star turn as a judge on “MasterChef Junior,” the Fox show whose seventh season begins on Feb. 26, and the seminal moment in 2009 when Anderson Cooper swooned over her famous Crack Pie on “Live With Regis and Kelly.”Then they reviewed handouts of the company’s mission statement. Ms. Tosi read the last few lines aloud: “Dessert! Baked goods! Me! You! We are the conduit for it all. Milk Bar is Magic. Milk Bar is a movement.”Milk Bar is also a brand that QSR magazine, the trade journal for quick-service and casual restaurant chains, just named one of the most innovative fast-casual start-ups in the country.The 16th Milk Bar opened in Cambridge, Mass., on Feb. 2 to a line three blocks long. This week, they moved the company headquarters from a Williamsburg basement to a fancy building in Manhattan’s NoMad neighborhood. The number of employees has jumped by 70 percent in the past year, to 381. Ms. Tosi has installed an almost all-woman management team led by Sujean Lee, a former senior vice president at Chobani.Later this year, Ms. Tosi’s most ambitious project will open in the Ace Hotel. Her New York flagship store will have a build-your-own-dessert station and a mini bodega. She’s paying for it with some of the more than $10 million from RSE Ventures, an investment firm founded in part by the vice chairman of the Miami Dolphins, Matt Higgins, who also stars on “Shark Tank.”All of this is head-spinning, especially for New Yorkers who remember waiting in line at the first store in the East Village, hoping the compost cookies weren’t sold out.Ms. Tosi, 37, is an introvert in overalls who carries math problems in her purse, along with embroidery thread to make friendship bracelets. Now, she has to figure out how to maintain the Milk Bar magic while running a multimillion-dollar business.“Growing fast feels like selling out, but I realized if we controlled the growth it could be really cool, too,” she said during a 12-hour day of trainings, tasting and meetings.She knows at least one thing: She doesn’t want a Milk Bar on every corner, like Starbucks. “I sat with it and lost a lot of sleep over it and finally I was just like, ‘That’s just not what we are,’” she said.Still, there is no lack of ambition in the Milk Bar universe. People who manage the brand talk about making Milk Bar a verb, like Google or Uber, so at 2 p.m. someone might turn to a co-worker and say, “Let’s Milk Bar it!” and head out for cookies.“We want to tap into the person who is like, ‘I just want to live my truth in my own weird, quirky way,’” said Sarah Tabb, the senior director of marketing, who spent six years as a brand manager for Coca-Cola.Ms. Tosi plans to open Milk Bars in cities where there’s already a fan base, including Chicago and Miami. The company is upgrading its e-commerce, which is about a third of the business.Then there is her holy grail: the grocery store. As someone with roots in central Ohio who grew up on hot dogs, Doritos and ranch dressing, she is a deep fan of packaged food, and the supermarket remains an inspirational touchstone. Milk Bar desserts on the shelves of America’s suburban grocery stores, she said, are her gift to children looking for creative inspiration in a sea of mass-market blandness.But building an empire comes with a challenge familiar to many niche food entrepreneurs riding a growth spurt: “How do you do that,” she said, “without being like any other hockey-stick white dude?”Ms. Tosi may be the unicorn that can, said Doug Quint, a founder of Big Gay Ice Cream, another only-in-New York brand that began just after Milk Bar and also is expanding.“It takes a little time before you realize her genius,” he said. “It’s all so deep in her, she doesn’t even recognize it.”One hurdle on her way up was changing her relationship with David Chang, the chef who first hired her to handle office business and later made her pastry chef for his Momofuku restaurants. He knew she wanted to open her own bakery, and gave her the seed money to do it.For years, the bakery has operated independently of the Momofuku empire, but Mr. Chang remains a business partner. As Ms. Tosi sought more autonomy for herself and Milk Bar, there were arguments and frustration.“She was becoming her own thing, and I didn’t know how to deal with it,” Mr. Chang said in an interview. “I wouldn’t say it was rough, but we didn’t have any reference points. I don’t think we knew how to talk to each other as business people.”Both describe their relationship, then and now, as brother-and-sister. She still seeks his advice, which he now gives only when asked. “Telling her something head-on isn’t the right approach,” he said. “No one wants to tell Tosi she’s wrong.”She remains one of the boldest, most ambitious people he knows. “Always bet on Christina,” he said.Ms. Tosi credits her upbringing for her determination. She wasn’t allowed to say, “I can’t” or “I’m bored.” Her mother was a no-nonsense accountant who still makes her signature headscarves by hand. Her father was an agricultural economist. They divorced when she was a teenager.“We were always told, ‘Be yourself and do what’s right and do your best,’” said her older sister, Angela Morrison. But Ms. Tosi was particularly driven.“Sometimes I tell her, ‘Christina, not everyone is you,’” she said.To watch Ms. Tosi in action is to understand focus at a new level. She samples every type of cookie and batch of soft-serve when she walks into any of her stores, noting in an instant if the batter was overmixed or if the soft-serve temperature is off. Earnest test-kitchen bakers present her version after version of new products, each gram of salt, fat or flavoring precisely calibrated. The day of the orientation, Anna McGorman, the director of culinary operations, was taking another swing at a chocolate Milk Bar birthday cake. It was still a miss, albeit barely. The cake was chocolate, but it tasted too much like yellow cake and not enough like birthday cake. Ms. Tosi suggested more dark vanilla to balance the “creamy, dreamy vibe” of clear vanilla.She knows her desire for perfection can be maddening. “I have too many opinions, and I like to know everything,” she said. “That slows me down a lot.”Not everything Ms. Tosi touches is gold. She had to abandon plans to sell her line of fresh juice at the bakeries. Even though she likes to balance her daily cookie consumption with a green juice, customers didn’t.Some people still find the term Crack Pie more offensive than cute, or at least inappropriate. To sell a packaged version at Target, she had to rename it Milk Bar Pie Mix.Ms. Tosi has found a perfectionist partner in Will Guidara, who is growing his own empire, the hospitality group Make It Nice, with the chef Daniel Humm. Their flagship is Eleven Madison Park, considered one of the best restaurants in the world.The two married in 2016, in a summer-camp-themed wedding that made the pages of People magazine and moved into a penthouse on West 19th Street, which they bought for $3.7 million. They remodeled it into a sleek blur of thick marble countertops and Gaggenau appliances. Her old furniture, much of it funky and secondhand, went to her offices.She complains about the way Mr. Guidara, who has described himself as an “exceptionally anal person,” arranges her coffee cups by color. “And I have a wine decanter now,” she said, shaking her head in disbelief.To balance things out, she keeps a large family of plants she has nurtured from cuttings along the windowsills and an assortment of her favorite objets d’art, including her Popsicle-stick projects.Mr. Guidara, 39, says his wife is the ideal mix of intensity and graciousness. “What’s amazing to me is, she hasn’t really changed in the most hilarious ways,” he said. She won’t let him buy her expensive treats like handbags, and prefers high-tops and jewelry she makes herself.“It kind of drives me crazy,” he said.She rarely eats at her husband’s restaurants. It’s too public, and the extra attention from the staff makes her nervous. “I want to go out and disappear,” she said. Ms. Tosi says one of her few indulgences is travel, but sometimes it’s just an impromptu train trip to visit her mother and sister, who live near each other in Reston, Va. After years of scraping by on staff meals and $4 bodega sandwiches, having whatever she wants delivered seems like an extravagance, too.“It’s this luxury of being like, ‘I’ll have dumplings as my appetizer and pizza as my main course, and then I have a bunch of cookies in the freezer,’” she said.With her business in overdrive, life has become more complex. It’s a far cry from Milk Bar’s early days, when everything was Tang toast and sprinkles and D.I.Y., right down to its distinctive logo, which she created simply by typing the word “milk” in Brush Script Medium.“Keeping the dream going is a different thing now,” she said. “How do you strip it back down to Brush Script Medium when you know too much?”Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.

(Want this by email?

The resulting analysis included “crucial flaws,” according to the investigation.• And Bloomberg reports that as early as seven years ago, F.A.A. employees warned that Boeing “had too much sway over safety approvals of new aircraft.”Boeing said in a statement on Sunday that “aircraft certification processes are well established and have consistently produced safe aircraft designs.” It added that the “737 Max certification program followed the F.A.A.’s standard certification process.”The ride-hailing company will start the road show for its I.P.O. today in New York City. It won’t be short on ambition: Lyft hopes to achieve a valuation of as much as $23 billion.In its updated prospectus, Lyft said that it hopes to raise nearly $2.4 billion from its I.P.O. That figure is close to the $2.16 billion in revenue that it generated last year.At the high end of its proposed stock price, $68, the company would be valued at $23 billion. That would make the stakes held by each of the company’s founders, Logan Green and John Zimmer, worth hundreds of millions of dollars apiece. The company is expected to price its offering on March 28, and would then trade on the Nasdaq the next day.Lyft is poised to become one of the biggest market debuts by a tech company since the Alibaba Group’s I.P.O. in 2014. (Until Uber goes public later this year, at least.)But the I.P.O. is not without controversy. It’s facing backlash from investors who aren’t happy about a dual-class stock structure. Paul Singer, the head of the activist hedge fund Elliott Management, is one of them, writing in an FT op-ed:“Those with the insight and daring to found a business deserve our respect. But once they sell the vast majority of the company to the public, they should not be allowed to run it forever without any shareholder input. Public ownership must mean public accountability.”The two German lenders announced yesterday that they will formally begin merger talks. Now they must convince critics that combining is a good thing.Deutsche Bank said it was reviewing “strategic options” for shoring up its profitability and growth. Christian Sewing, the firm’s C.E.O., told employees, “I have consistently stressed that consolidation in the German and European banking sector is an important topic for us.”The combined bank would be one of Europe’s biggest, with $2 trillion in assets and about one-fifth of all private customers in Germany.Going public signals that the deal has political backing. Germany’s finance minister has argued that the country needs a strong national champion to compete against foreign banks. (Here is the FT’s list of the key decision-makers for any deal.)But opposition to a merger is strong. German unions have criticized the plan, fearing tens of thousands of job cuts. And Elisa Martinuzzi of Bloomberg Opinion warns that it wouldn’t fix the bigger problems in the German banking system.The Trump administration’s campaign to prevent countries from using Huawei equipment in their 5G wireless networks has faltered, Julian E. Barnes and Adam Satariano of the NYT write.American officials have been pressuring and threatening other nations to shun Huawei. The push is rooted in U.S. concerns that Chinese telecom companies are a significant security threat, and could help Beijing spy on other nations.But it’s not really working. Britain, Germany, India and the United Arab Emirates have all signaled that they are unlikely to follow America’s lead.The U.S. campaign has been criticized for a lack of evidence. American intelligence briefings have reportedly failed to clearly show how the Chinese government has used Huawei to steal information. (Read what five experts and two senators have to say about whether it is a threat.) Some European and Asian officials also believe that President Trump may not fully support the fight.American officials want to find other ways to curb Huawei’s rise, Mr. Barnes and Mr. Satariano write, “including possibly restricting American companies from supplying Huawei with key components that it needs to build 5G networks across the world.”More: Huawei has built its own operating system for smartphones and computers, to be used if the company can no longer use software developed by Google and Microsoft.The financial sector hasn’t felt the impact of #MeToo as much as other industries. But as David Gelles of the NYT reports, a lawsuit against the asset manager TCW could change that.• Sara Tirschwell, who created a distressed-debt fund at TCW but was fired in 2017, has sued the firm; her former boss, Jess Ravich; and the C.E.O., David Lippman. She claimed that her dismissal was retaliation against her for reporting a sexual harassment claim against Mr. Ravich, gender discrimination and a breach of contract.• Ms. Tirschwell alleges that Mr. Ravich pressured her into sex several times during her tenure with the firm. The first encounter made her feel, according to her lawsuit, “as if rejection would mean the end of Ravich’s crucial support.”• TCW, Mr. Ravich and Mr. Lippman denied the allegations. “I was Sara’s biggest supporter at TCW and had no role in the decision to fire her,” Mr. Ravich said.• So far, there’s been no talk of a settlement. Mr. Gelles writes, “Days in court have been rare for the movement — and rarer still for Wall Street, where grievances are typically dealt with in private, and by wire transfer, when they are dealt with at all.”Despite delivering disappointing returns to investors, many C.E.O.s saw their compensation climb last year, according to the WSJ.• “Median compensation for 132 chief executives of S&P 500 companies reached $12.4 million in 2018, up from $11.7 million for the same group in 2017,” the WSJ calculates.• “Most of these C.E.O.s received substantial raises — the median was 6.4 percent — even though the December stock-market swoon meant most of the companies finished out the year posting sluggish shareholder returns.”• “Markets did pretty well, companies did well, and the economy held up,” Robin Ferracone, an executive-pay consultant, told the WSJ.• But she also said that boards may have been thinking forward to an economic slowdown, adding, “They know they’re going to have to bring it down when the bloom’s off the rose.”The shooting at a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, was designed to go viral on the internet. What can we do about it?“The attack was teased on Twitter, announced on the online message board 8chan and broadcast live on Facebook,” Kevin Roose of the NYT writes. “The footage was then replayed endlessly on YouTube, Twitter and Reddit, as the platforms scrambled to take down the clips nearly as fast as new copies popped up to replace them.”“Online extremism is just regular extremism on steroids. There is no offline equivalent of the experience of being algorithmically nudged toward a more strident version of your existing beliefs,” Mr. Roose adds. “People become fluent in the culture of online extremism, they make and consume edgy memes, they cluster and harden. And once in a while, one of them erupts.”But telling terrorists from trolls isn’t easy for tech companies, Christopher Mims of the WSJ argues. Knowing which online extremists will erupt with an act of violence can be virtually impossible, and their broadcasts of sudden acts of violence can be hard to automatically block.More needs to be done. “We need to understand and address the poisonous pipeline of extremism that has emerged over the past several years, whose ultimate effects are impossible to quantify but clearly far too big to ignore,” Mr. Roose writes. “It’s not going away, and it’s not particularly getting better.”PG&E is reportedly close to naming Bill Johnson, the outgoing head of the Tennessee Valley Authority, as its next C.E.O.Google named Scott Beaumont, the head of its greater China and Korea operations, as the chief of its Asia-Pacific team.Stuart Benson resigned as the C.F.O. of MoviePass.Princeville Capital, a venture capital firm that invests in climate technology, has recruited Leonardo DiCaprio as an adviser.Deals• Fidelity National Information Services agreed to buy an international payments processor, Worldpay, for $34 billion.

That is from Risk Advisory’s annual survey about global corruption challenges, based on the company’s due diligence on 187 countries over the past year.• “The index’s most challenging countries are those assessed to have a high risk of both petty and grand corruption, less stable regimes and low availability of public information and business intelligence,” Risk Advisory explains.• Turkmenistan faces the world’s largest corruption challenges, followed by Libya and Somalia. Those three are also the hardest countries in which to obtain reliable data.• The industries most affected by the challenges of corruption are construction and development, infrastructure, and oil and gas.“The U.S. and Canada remain among the ‘safest’ jurisdictions in our index from an anti-corruption perspective,” Tom Smith, the head of business intelligence for North America at Risk Advisory, said in a statement. “That said, petty corruption remains a concern for our clients in both countries, especially in the real estate and construction industries.”A decade on from the 2008 financial crisis, the leaders of some of the largest U.S. banks will gather in Washington to testify before the House Financial Services Committee.This is part of a push by House Democrats to examine the industry. And according to written testimonies published yesterday, the bank C.E.O.s plan to offer a unified message: Regulation has made the financial system less risky. Here’s what the executives will say:• David Solomon of Goldman Sachs: “Today the U.S. financial system is substantially safer and more resilient against failure or disruptions in critical services.”• Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase: “Through regulatory reform efforts, we have fundamentally improved the safety and soundness of our financial system, substantially raised capital and liquidity requirements at our largest institutions and established a credible resolution planning process to ensure that taxpayers will no longer be on the hook in the event of failure.”• James Gorman of Morgan Stanley: “We have significantly transformed Morgan Stanley over the last 10 years. We are now a safer and sounder financial institution focused on helping our clients finance economic growth, job creation, retirement security, college savings, and more.”• Michael Corbat of Citigroup: “Since the crisis, Citi has become a smaller, safer, stronger and far less complex company. We have transformed our institution, not just in terms of capital, balance sheet, or earnings, but also in terms of our controls, which include risk management, audit and compliance.”The Trump administration has proposed imposing tariffs on $11 billion worth of imports from the European Union, to punish the bloc for providing what it says are unfair subsidies to Airbus, the WSJ reports.The W.T.O. says European subsidies to Airbus have harmed the U.S., according to the office of the U.S. trade representative, an argument that it has made since 2004. The new tariffs — which would affect products like helicopters, motorcycles, cheese and wine — would come into effect when the W.T.O. confirms the extent of the subsidies’ harm this summer.“The time has come for action,” Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative, said. “Our ultimate goal is to reach an agreement with the E.U. to end all W.T.O.-inconsistent subsidies to large civil aircraft. When the E.U. ends these harmful subsidies, the additional U.S. duties imposed in response can be lifted.”Expect blowback. The E.U. has been dragging its heels on devising a strategy for trade discussions with the U.S. to avert new American tariffs on European car imports. The latest news could make that more complicated.Saudi Aramco’s first international bond offering is poised to be a runaway success. Despite concerns about the Saudi government, investors are leaping at the chance to invest in the giant oil company, Stanley Reed and Michael de la Merced of the NYT report.The order book for the bond sale has surpassed $85 billion, according to Bloomberg. Aramco had initially planned to sell about $10 billion worth of debt to help finance its $69 billion takeover of Sabic, a Saudi chemical producer.Aramco executives got the red carpet treatment everywhere they went to hawk the bond offering last week. In London, prospective investors crowded into the upscale Corinthia hotel to hear about the deal. In New York, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase personally pitched the sale.The attraction is simple. Aramco is wildly profitable — it made $111 billion last year — and dominant. “The more someone doesn’t need money, the more we want to give it to them,” Reza Karim of the fund manager Jupiter Asset Management told the NYT.But some analysts worry about Aramco’s future. Both the Sabic deal and a push to take Aramco public are being driven by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a change to the historical norm in which the Saudi royals basically left the company alone. (The crown prince plans to use the proceeds to wean Saudi Arabia off its dependence on oil.)Aircraft manufacturers like Boeing rarely face a criminal investigation over plane crashes. But Peter Henning of DealBook asks: What federal criminal laws are investigators looking at as they pore over Boeing’s records?• “One statute they may consider is the federal false statements law. The broad statute is used when a company provides information to a federal agency like the Federal Aviation Administration to certify the safety of a plane and makes it a crime to provide an agency with ‘any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation.’ ”• The criminal investigation may also examine a statute that “makes it a crime to ‘knowingly and with intent to defraud’ falsify or conceal a material fact about an aircraft part, or to make ‘any materially fraudulent representation’ about a part. It can be applied to conduct outside the United States so long as the company is organized under the laws of this country.”• And “if there is evidence of fraud and not just false statements, the Justice Department could also pursue a wire fraud case.”“There is danger in any criminal investigation because even the hint of possible misconduct could have significant consequences as it tries to deal with the fallout from crashes of its best-selling aircraft.”More: It isn’t just anti-stall software in the 737 Max jet that may need updating. And investigators still have questions about how the pilots of the doomed Ethiopian Airlines flight reacted to their plane’s problems.As House Democrats battle with President Trump over his tax returns, a key figure in that fight has emerged: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, according to Alan Rappeport of the NYT.Mr. Mnuchin oversees the I.R.S., which is expected to decide whether to accede to lawmakers’ demands for six years’ worth of Mr. Trump’s returns. Democrats are using a little-known provision in the tax code that they say entitles them to the documents.Mr. Trump has denounced Democrats’ request as political harassment. The acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, has pledged that they will “never” see the returns.Mr. Mnuchin has been more cautious. In October, he said that if Democrats won the House and requested the returns, he would work with government lawyers to see if the demand was legal. More recently, he said he would protect the president’s privacy rights.But he will have a tough day on Capitol Hill today, where in back-to-back hearings he’ll face questions about how he plans to handle the tax return issue.The Hollywood actress was one of several parents to admit yesterday that she participated in a huge scheme to get their children into top schools using bribes, Kate Taylor of the NYT reports.• Ms. Huffman acknowledged that she paid $15,000 to have a proctor correct her daughter’s answers on the SAT. “This transgression toward her and the public I will carry for the rest of my life,” she said in court. “My desire to help my daughter is no excuse to break the law or engage in dishonesty.”• Last week, Gordon Caplan, the former co-chairman of the law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher, said he planned to plead guilty as well.• Ms. Huffman will plead guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. She will probably get a lesser punishment because of her guilty plea (and because her payment to the scheme was one of the smallest in the case).• Prosecutors said that 14 people — 13 parents and one coach — would plead guilty in the case. Overall, 33 parents have been charged.• Other prominent defendants in the case, including the actress Lori Loughlin, haven’t yet entered a plea.President Trump forced out Randolph Alles, the director of the Secret Service, yesterday, continuing a purge of leaders at the Department of Homeland Security.The law firm Lowenstein Sandler has hired Rachel Maimin, a former federal prosecutor who worked on the government’s case against Michael Cohen, and Gregory Baker, a former senior lawyer at the S.E.C., as partners.Nomura’s chief risk officer, Lewis O’Donald, is one of a dozen senior executives leaving the Japanese bank amid deep cuts to its operations.Katrina vanden Heuvel will step down as publisher of The Nation after 24 years.Deals• Dan Loeb’s Third Point is reportedly preparing another activist campaign at Sony.

Please email thoughts and suggestions to business@nytimes.com.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byGood Friday morning. Here’s what to watch for. (Want this by email? Sign up here.)President Trump is optimistic about striking a trade deal with China — but Chinese officials are hesitant, according to Keith Bradsher and Ana Swanson of the NYT:“Beijing officials are wary” that what currently looks like a positive trade deal for them, which doesn’t require big changes to the economy, could turn bad, Mr. Bradsher and Ms. Swanson explain. They worry about “Mr. Trump’s propensity for last-minute changes,” according to unidentified sources.Those fears could derail a planned summit meeting between President Trump and President Xi Jinping of China, where Mr. Trump hopes to sign a deal. “Persuading Mr. Xi to attend such a summit meeting is no easy task, given his imperative of appearing strong before a domestic audience,” Mr. Bradsher and Ms. Swanson note.“The biggest barrier to a deal continues to be the enforcement of terms,” Mr. Bradsher and Ms. Swanson add. “The United States has insisted that it retain the right to raise tariffs if China violates the agreement, without retaliation by Beijing. But some Chinese officials have criticized the arrangement as a potential infringement of China’s sovereign rights.”More: China exports and imports both fell in February, as an economic slowdown and trade fights weighed on the nation.The dust has settled on Mark Zuckerberg’s surprise announcement that the social network would refocus its business on privacy. Now, people are starting to dissect what, exactly, the news means for its business model.“Facebook is entering a transition phase where it will continue to sell targeted ads on its public social networks, while inventing a new business model,” Thomas Husson, a senior analyst at the research company Forrester, told the FT. In other words, think of it as less of a pivot and as more of a diversification.So it will “still gather data from its existing sources,” Christopher Mims of the WSJ writes, “but also increasingly from messaging apps. These would double as interfaces with businesses and, eventually, usurp the functions of our credit cards and digital wallets.” Expect to see Facebook make announcements about payments, commerce and its own crypto token in the not-too-distant future.Diversification is a play for long-term survival, especially if regulators clamp down on the mass collection of data and targeted ads that have been the company’s bread and butter. The faster Facebook can spin up alternative revenue streams — and acting as a global payments network could be a lucrative one — the better its chances of continuing to grow.Bank of America released a report yesterday, on the eve of International Women’s Day, that shows the state of the global disparity in wealth between men and women. There’s reason for both hope and dismay, according to Ortenca Aliaj of the FT.The good:• The report says that improving women’s equality could raise global growth over the next six years by $28 trillion — or, as Ms. Aliaj writes, “roughly the same as the U.S. and China’s combined annual economic output.”• Women are expected to control $72 trillion of global financial assets by 2020, double what they held in 2010.The bad:• “The economic gender gap is closing at a ‘snail’s pace’ and it could take another 202 years to reach equality at the current rate.”• “Women in western Europe might start earning the same as men for the same roles in 60 years, while women in North America might have to wait another 165 years, the report calculated.”• “Data compiled from more than 10,000 respondents showed that men were more optimistic about higher pay rises over the next year while women expected to perform at least two and a half times more unpaid work than men.”More: The private equity and venture capital industries have $3 trillion in assets under management — but female entrepreneurs receive just a fraction of it, according to a new report.As Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant, takes the U.S. government to court over a ban limiting the use of its products in federal agencies, the company has won the support of its government.• “We support relevant companies and individuals to take up legal weapons to safeguard their rights and interests, and not be silent lambs,” Wang Yi, Beijing’s top diplomat, said at a news conference yesterday.• “What we’re standing up for is not just the interests of a company, but also a country or nation’s legitimate right to innovate and by extension the basic right of all countries who wish to climb up the technology ladder,” he added.But Mr. Wang’s comments don’t address U.S. claims that Huawei equipment could be used by China to spy on American communications. As CNBC notes, Chinese law suggests that domestic companies are legally obligated to help the government with intelligence work — and may be forbidden from talking about it.With less than a week to go before Parliament makes a final vote on Prime Minister Theresa May’s Brexit deal, she is expected to try to shift the focus from Britain to the E.U.“Just as MPs will face a big choice next week, the E.U. has to make a choice too,” Mrs. May is expected to say in a speech today, according to the BBC. “It is in the European interest for the U.K. to leave with a deal.”“The decisions that the European Union makes over the next few days will have a big impact on the outcome of the vote,” she will add, referring to her hope that European officials will make binding legal changes to the Irish border details of her deal. Those look necessary if Mrs. May is to win over lawmakers.Such a public plea for compromise shows how tough the negotiations have been. “Talks are expected to continue into the weekend,” Bloomberg notes. “If they fail, Parliament will likely vote against May’s deal for the second time, plunging the country into political chaos.”Just a few months ago, the European Central Bank put the brakes on a vast economic stimulus program. Yesterday, it unexpectedly reversed course, Jack Ewing of the NYT writes:• The E.C.B. voted unanimously “to bring back a stimulus measure intended to encourage lending. The move will help banks in countries with weaker economies like Italy that may have trouble raising money on capital markets at reasonable rates.”• “The bank also pushed back the date of its earliest possible increase in benchmark interest rates by at least four months.”• “The quick turnabout, from confidence to concern, reflects the broader weakness in the global economy. A slowdown in China, exacerbated by rising trade tensions with the United States, has reverberated around the world, dragging down growth in Europe and elsewhere.”• “Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, implicitly blamed White House policies for the economic damage behind the decision. ‘Lower confidence produced by the trade discussions’ was a key cause of economic slowdowns in Europe, China and emerging markets, Mr. Draghi said.”• “He added, though, that he did not expect a recession.”You might think that Martin Shkreli, the “pharma bro” imprisoned for fraud, would have curtailed his business efforts. You’d be wrong, as Rob Copeland and Bradley Hope of the WSJ point out.• “Wielding little more than a contraband smartphone, the disgraced pharmaceutical executive remains the shadow power at Phoenixus AG,” the company that, under a different name, drew outrage for jacking up the prices of rare drugs.• He conducts drug research from the prison’s computer lab and, until recently, tweeted insults at the likes of Jack Dorsey of Twitter.• His friends at a prison in Fort Dix, N.J., include inmates like “Krispy” and “D-Block.” (Their reported nickname for Mr. Shkreli is unprintable here.)• “A few weeks ago he rang up his handpicked chief executive during a safari vacation — to fire him, according to a person familiar with the exchange.” That was later changed to a suspension.• “His back-of-the-commissary-envelope calculation indicates that Phoenixus could be worth $3.7 billion by the time he is due to be freed in 2023, according to a person familiar with his thinking.” His business plan involves buying rare drugs and spending on research and development.• But minority shareholders in the company are tired of Mr. Shkreli’s behavior. “This investment is an absolute disaster,” Sabine Gritti, one of those investors, told the WSJ.Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, Slack and a host of other Silicon Valley companies are poised to go public this year, making employees and investors who own shares very rich. Nellie Bowles of the NYT explores how they plan to spend their wealth:They will push up real estate prices. The Bay Area, known for its unaffordable housing, may get even pricier. “People are like, ‘I’m not going to sell till next year, because there are going to be bajillionaries everywhere,’” Herman Chan, a real estate agent with Sotheby’s, told Ms. Bowles.There will be parties. Companies that go public want to celebrate, and hospitality companies are happy to oblige. One planner told Ms. Bowles that start-up I.P.O. party budgets can exceed $10 million, adding, “They’re wanting to bring in A-list celebrities to perform at the dinner tables for the executives.”Trophy purchases will be made. But wealth advisers are trying to persuade new clients to show a little restraint. “I don’t think a lot of them think there ever could be a downturn,” Ryan S. Cole of Citrine Capital told the NYT, adding, “They shouldn’t be buying boats.”Jan Stahlberg, a co-founder of the Swedish private equity firm EQT, is leaving to start an impact-investing fund.Deals• Norway gave its sovereign wealth fund permission to sell off its holdings in pure-play oil companies.

A judge approved it yesterday, and an appeal by prosecutors was rejected. Mr. Ghosn paid his bail in cash today before his release.Things are looking up for him. Japanese prosecutors convict 99 percent of indicted defendants. But now that he has a new lawyer and has focused international attention on the Japanese criminal justice system, Mr. Ghosn’s case is “increasingly looking like it’s not a slam dunk” for prosecutors, Stephen Givens, an American corporate lawyer in Tokyo, told Mr. Dooley.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in New York, and Michael J. de la Merced and Jamie Condliffe in London.____________________________Mike Bloomberg announced yesterday that he won’t pursue the Democratic Party nomination next year. Instead, he’ll spend his billions on philanthropy — and working to defeat President Trump.It’s an acknowledgment of the long odds against him, as a pro-business centrist at a time when the Democratic front-runners are embracing Medicare for all and the Green New Deal.He had “a real but narrow path” to the nomination, according to his advisers, which could have disappeared if Joe Biden runs. Mr. Bloomberg conceded this in a Bloomberg View op-ed, writing, “I am cleareyed about the difficulty of winning the Democratic nomination in such a crowded field.”Instead, he’ll remain focused on fighting climate change. His latest effort is on reducing and eventually eliminating the use of fossil fuels. He will also promote gun control, and maintain his political organization to aid the eventual Democratic nominee.Mr. Bloomberg’s decision may weigh on Howard Schultz, the other centrist, pro-business billionaire considering a presidential bid. If Mr. Bloomberg, with an established political brand and an estimated $55 billion fortune, doesn’t think he can spend his way to victory, critics will ask how a less-famous, less-wealthy billionaire could.Conspicuously absent from Premier Li Keqiang of China’s speech to lawmakers yesterday was any mention of the nation’s plan to become a global tech powerhouse, Lingling Wei of the WSJ notes.Mr. Li used to champion “Made in China 2025,” a plan under which the country would quickly increase its capacity to design and produce advanced technologies, reducing its reliance on trading partners and even undercutting rivals like the U.S. He gave it pride of place in his previous three annual speeches.But that vision alarmed Washington. “Officials in the Trump administration have called the plan a threat to fair competition, saying it encourages state subsidies for domestic companies and forces technology transfer from foreign companies with the aim of driving them out of business,” Ms. Wei writes.Now the name has gone, but the ambitions remain. Mr. Li didn’t use the words “Made in China 2025” yesterday — but he did talk about advanced computing, biotech and alternative energy. And he promised to “make China strong in manufacturing” and “encourage more domestic and foreign users to choose Chinese goods and services.”The bigger question is what this means for Beijing’s trade talks with the U.S. Hard-liners in the Trump administration fear that China may promise policy changes, then simply go on as before.U.S. companies returned $1.25 trillion to investors through share buybacks and dividends last year, a new high, Robin Wigglesworth of the FT reports.Corporate America has paid out $8 trillion through buybacks and dividends to investors over the past decade, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices.How much? By Mr. Wigglesworth’s estimate, that’s “more than enough to buy all the major listed companies of the U.K., France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Sweden” at current prices. Or just about all the gold ever mined.Those numbers will fuel the battle over buybacks. While supporters say they’re good for companies and investors, critics — including senators of both parties — argue that they come at the expense of raises for workers and investment in R.&D. That debate will rage on.Britain’s central bank is working to help its financial system weather the turbulence that would accompany leaving the European Union without a withdrawal agreement, the FT reports.British banks are strong enough to withstand the potential disruption, the Bank of England says. But “financial stability does not guarantee market stability or economic stability,” Mark Carney, its governor, told British lawmakers yesterday. He predicted “significant market volatility.”Weekly auctions of euros, as part of an arrangement with the European Central Bank, will help the bank to maintain its cash levels. It already has similar arrangements for the dollar, and recently announced weekly auctions of British pounds.“The new swap line is ‘a further prudent precaution’ to ensure financial markets can function smoothly in the months spanning Britain’s departure from the E.U.,” the FT reports. The bank’s Financial Policy Committee has also “taken action to address the main risks of disruption for U.K. insurers, asset managers and clearing houses.”As Deutsche Bank tries to turn itself around, it is relying in large part on Matt Zames, a well-known Wall Street veteran who now works for one of its big shareholders. More on that from Jenny Strasburg of the WSJ:• Mr. Zames rose through the ranks at Bear Stearns and then helped JPMorgan Chase move past its “London whale” trading disaster. He’s now at Cerberus Capital Management, the investment firm that has a stake in Deutsche Bank and is also a paid adviser to it.• Soon after Cerberus was hired, Mr. Zames spent weeks at Deutsche Bank’s offices. “He quickly focused on what Cerberus considered a key to Deutsche Bank’s revival: that it move quickly to take more risk with its cash,” Ms. Strasburg reports.• He has also met with Germany’s deputy finance minister, Jörg Kukies, to discuss a potential merger of Deutsche Bank with Commerzbank (in which Cerberus also holds a stake).• Mr. Zames’s advice reportedly hasn’t always gone down well with the bank’s executives: “Finance chief James von Moltke last fall told colleagues he felt Mr. Zames was pressuring him to move too quickly to loosen constraints on investing the bank’s cash cushion.”• But Mr. Zames reports directly to Christian Sewing, Deutsche Bank’s C.E.O. And, as Ms. Strasburg writes, “Some insiders and trading partners half-jokingly call Mr. Zames the ‘virtual C.E.O.’”Goldman Sachs is embracing a more casual dress code, according to Laura Noonan of the FT. That means bankers can shed their suits for … slightly more dressed-down outfits.Goldman didn’t give specifics. No items of clothing have been allowed or banned; instead workers were told to “exercise good judgment” and dress to meet client expectations.The move was announced by David Solomon, Goldman’s C.E.O., who also happens to be a D.J. on the side. It’s meant to appeal to younger workers whom the firm hopes to hire.The bank is following rivals like JPMorgan Chase in embracing a more relaxed dress code. Goldman actually let its engineers dress more casually nearly two years ago, leading to some junior workers being advised against wearing “ripped and overly tight T-shirts.”But business casual has limits on Wall Street. JPMorgan bankers shunned jeans for fear of their bosses thinking they had no client meetings. (That said, Goldman bankers on the West Coast have been known to occasionally dress more casually — think jeans and sneakers — to fit in with their tech and media clients.)Scott Gottlieb unexpectedly announced  plans to resign as commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration this month.The founder of Papa John’s pizza, John Schnatter, will step down from the board after someone else is chosen to fill his board seat.Anheuser-Busch InBev reportedly plans to replace Olivier Goudet as chairman amid concern that his day job at the food conglomerate JAB has created conflicts of interest.President Trump plans to nominate Jessie Liu, the U.S. district attorney for the District of Columbia, for associate attorney general.Deals• Grab, the Southeast Asian ride-hailing company, raised $1.4 billion from SoftBank’s Vision Fund.

And why President Trump’s battle hasn’t helped narrow the trade deficit.The Chinese telecom giant plans to take the U.S. government to court for banning federal agencies from using its products, Ray Zhong and Paul Mozur of the NYT report.• “The move could be aimed at forcing the United States government to more publicly make its case against the Chinese equipment maker.”• “It is part of a broad push by Huawei to defend itself against a campaign led by the United States to undermine the company, which Washington sees as a security threat.”• Huawei’s lawsuit will challenge a section in a defense-spending law that blocks federal agencies from using its equipment. The company will argue that the provision amounts to a “bill of attainder,” or a legislative act that singles out a person or group for punishment without trial.• Huawei’s C.F.O., Meng Wanzhou, has already sued Canadian authorities for arresting her and moving to extradite her to the U.S.• Not everyone thinks that Ms. Meng’s legal action is sensible. “The quest for justice is everyone’s right,” Tim Culpan of Bloomberg Opinion writes, “yet Huawei risks coming off as belligerent instead of the calm and trustworthy partner it’s trying to portray.”On Friday, the Trump re-election campaign — including its manager, Brad Parscale, and an adviser, Newt Gingrich — called for a nationwide “wholesale” 5G network, that would allow the government to control the spectrum and find a way to share it with carriers.“A 5G wholesale market would drive down costs and provide access to millions of Americans who are currently underserved,” Kayleigh McEnany, the campaign’s national press secretary, told Politico.The news was met with surprise as it’s at odds with current White House policy. Axios says it was unable to find telecom policy advisers inside the Trump administration “who knew in advance from the Trump campaign that it would make this announcement.” The telecoms industry has long argued against nationalized 5G networks.The campaign later walked back its comments. “The White House sets the policy on 5G and all issues,” Ms. McEnany said in a statement. “The campaign fully supports the president’s priorities and his policy agenda.”But it raises concerns about what happens next. The administration previously contemplated taking a role in 5G, as detailed in a National Security Council memo leaked early last year. Brendan Carr, an F.C.C. commissioner, called such a move “China-like nationalization.”In the wake of Amazon pulling out of plans for a campus in New York City, the NYT studied the tactics the company has used to drive hard bargains all over the country.• Amazon closed its only warehouse in Texas after state officials pushed the company to pay nearly $270 million in back taxes in 2010. Texas eventually waived the taxes in exchange for new warehouses.• South Carolina officials denied Amazon a sales tax break in 2010, but gave the company an exemption after it threatened to stop hiring there.• The company has collected over $2.4 billion in taxpayer subsidies for its locations, according to Good Jobs First, a nonprofit that tracks corporate tax breaks.• “They are just as cutthroat as can be,” Alex Perlstein, vice president of Market Street Services, told the NYT.• And Amazon has no regrets, according to the NYT: “Asked recently by a business publication if Amazon would change anything about the headquarters search in retrospect, Holly Sullivan, the Amazon executive who led the search, said: ‘You know, no. I think it was rewarding for us internally.’”Meanwhile, the NYT editorial board supports New York officials’ efforts to lure Amazon back: “Progressives shouldn’t stand athwart progress, yelling stop.”More: How Hollywood disrupted Jeff Bezos’s life as Amazon sought to disrupt its business.

Here’s what some of them had to say about the future of artificial intelligence regulation:“The idea that these companies who are not accountable to us or elected by us should get to decide sort of the new safeguards of society, that seems like the wrong way to do it,” said Sam Altman, the president of Y Combinator.“We think democratically elected governments should be in the business of regulating technology companies — not the other way around,” Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, said.“We’re fans of regulation when it’s smart regulation,” Kent Walker, Google’s chief legal officer, said. “What do I mean by that? So, regulation that starts out with a really crisp definition of what’s the problem you’re trying to solve? That is then narrowly tailored to solve that problem and minimize blowback and side effects.”“I’ve found the European Commission to be very well-reasoned and thoughtful in their approach, and really putting consumers first,” Evan Spiegel of Snapchat said. “The more that companies can align with the government to do what’s right for customers, I think everyone will win there.”A fierce lobbying battle has arisen over an unlikely product, according to the NYT: human excrement, and more specifically its use in treating disease.• The skirmish is over the future of fecal microbiota transplants, a therapy that “transfers fecal matter from healthy donors into the bowels of ailing patients, restoring the beneficial works of the community of gut microbes that have been decimated by antibiotics.” The treatment is especially effective in treating Clostridioides difficile, also known as C. diff, a debilitating bacterial infection.• “At the heart of the controversy is a question of classification: Are the fecal microbiota that cure C. diff a drug, or are they more akin to organs, tissues and blood products that are transferred from the healthy to treat the sick?”• Most material currently used in fecal transplants comes from OpenBiome, a public stool bank in Massachusetts. But the F.D.A. has recently increased oversight that raised prices.• Several drug companies, including Rebiotix and Seres Therapeutics, have raised tens of millions of dollars from investors and begun lobbying the F.D.A. (A critic told the NYT they were the “poop drug cartel.”) The market for drug-based treatments of C. diff is estimated to eventually reach about $1.7 billion.• “At stake, some researchers says, is the future of pioneering therapies that harness the human microbiome — the trillions of organisms that colonize the body and are increasingly seen as critical for healthy brain development and immune function.”Ray Kelvin, the founder and C.E.O. of the British fashion chain Ted Baker, resigned amid accusations of inappropriate behavior.Fabio Schvartsman “temporarily” stepped down as Vale’s C.E.O. in the wake of a deadly dam burst in Brazil.KKR hired Kate Richdale, most recently the chairwoman of Goldman Sachs’s investment banking team in Asia, as its head of strategy and business development in the same region.John Havens stepped down as chairman of the hedge fund Napier Park Capital after being charged in a prostitution ring bust.The insurer Aviva named Maurice Tulloch, the head of its international operations, as its next C.E.O.Deals• Lyft publicly filed for an I.P.O. on Friday, revealing surging revenues but nearly $1 billion in losses.

Gregg Foreman — the lithe, former music director for the musician Cat Power with Joan Jett hair — who played songs by the Cure on the piano. There was the bride’s walk down the aisle with her parents, to the cascading drumbeats of the eerie first bars of “Atmosphere” by the post-punk band Joy Division. There was the irrevocable fact that several yards away, entertainment industry legacies — from Mickey Rooney to Johnny Ramone — lay deceased.“I don’t know why, I’ve always loved cemeteries,” said Ms. Grossan, 30, “Père Lachaise in Paris is one of my favorite places; Green-Wood in Brooklyn. I don’t think they’re morbid. I think they’re beautiful.” Mr. Ayers, 46, agreed: “It’s like a beautiful park.”It was at another wedding reception in June 2016 at House of Yes, an events space in Bushwick, Brooklyn, where Mr. Ayers first spotted Ms. Grossan. “I remember thinking, who is that beautiful woman standing there?” he said. The two were in attendance to celebrate the marriage of respective co-workers: Anna Bond with whom Mr. Ayers worked at 4AD, an independent record label where he is currently the United States label manager, and the groom, J. Edward Keyes, who was Ms. Grossan’s then-boss at Bandcamp, a self-publishing music platform where she was a senior editor.Mr. Ayers waited to make his move until he saw Ms. Grossan chatting with Joan LeMay, a friend from Seattle, where from 1997 to 2008, he ran Sonic Boom Records and was a drummer in indie rock bands like the Long Winters.Mr. Ayers greeted his friend, who introduced him to Ms. Grossan. “My first impression was that he was wearing this fabulous suit with cool glasses,” she said of Mr. Ayers’s signature oversize frames.The pair spoke for a few minutes before rejoining the party, and then found each other again, talking for an hour against the backdrop of karaoke. They spoke about music. At 24, Ms. Grossan had been appointed the series editor of the publisher Bloomsbury’s 33⅓ Series, a collection of biographies about individual music albums and artists. “I, and anyone else who had ever heard about it, was impressed by that,” Mr. Ayers said.Mr. Ayers is the son of the noted jazz composer and vibraphonist, Roy Ayers, with whom he has had a distant relationship. He was given a drum set at age 2 by his uncle, the jazz musician Alan Braufman, and has made music his lifeblood since.“I remember someone telling me that night: ‘Oh that’s Nabil Ayers from 4AD, that guy’s a big shot,’” Ms. Grossan said. After the two parted ways, Ms. Grossan followed Mr. Ayers on Twitter in the Uber ride back to her home in Crown Heights, Brooklyn.The next day, Mr. Ayers reached out to Ms. LeMay with a request: Could she ask Ms. Grossan to pass along her email address? Once in hand, Mr. Ayers sent Ms. Grossan a casual message mentioning Skee-Ball, which Grossan had revealed was a talent. Two days later, Mr. Ayers was surprised he hadn’t heard back. “I thought it was weird. We’d gotten along well, and my friend had asked her if it was O.K. to get in touch.”After giving the go-ahead, Ms. Grossan thought it was odd that she hadn’t heard from Mr. Ayers. “I checked the spam folder and was like, ‘No way, this doesn’t happen.’” There was Mr. Ayers’s email from his 4AD address.Ms. Grossan responded immediately and the two made plans to meet the following Sunday for a drink. On the Thursday evening beforehand, however, Ms. Grossan was seated at a table in the Hammerstein Ballroom at the Libera Awards — a ceremony honoring the indie music community — and heard Mr. Ayers’s name announced. She looked up to see him walking on stage to accept an award on behalf of the singer/songwriter Grimes for the video “Kill V. Maim.” Ms. Grossan emailed him: “Short and sweet — great speech.”They found each other after the program and Ms. Grossan invited Mr. Ayers to join a group heading to a karaoke bar (note: for how much karaoke appears in this story, the groom does not particularly enjoy it). There, jammed into a bench with industry peers, Mr. Ayers was enchanted as Ms. Grossan sang the grim, rapid fire lyrics to System of a Down’s “Chop Suey” with perfect elocution. “She took her shoes off for the song, and I was like, ‘Woah, she’s really going to do it,’” Mr. Ayers said. “I was really impressed.”The group dispersed and Ms. Grossan and Mr. Ayers wound up at New Wonjo in Koreatown, talking over cold noodles late into the night. That night the couple kissed for the first time.It would be the first of many dates.“Most of the men in the music journalism space are obnoxious: They’re proud of knowing the names of every single album,” Ms. Grossan said. “But Nabil knows more than everyone and is so understated. He never tries to display his knowledge to anyone. He’s just excited to talk about it.”Like the tongue-twisting lyrics to “Chop Suey,” the relationship moved at a heady clip. On an early date, Ms. Grossan mentioned that her favorite album was Hole’s “Celebrity Skin;” several weeks later, on her birthday in July, Mr. Ayers gave her a copy in vinyl. That month, the pair decided on impulse that Ms. Grossan would be Mr. Ayers’s date to a September wedding in Paris. And in October, Mr. Ayers met Ms. Grossan’s father, the television producer Mark Grossan, in a hot tub during Orange County’s Beach Goth music festival. By Christmas, they had plans for Ms. Grossan to move into Mr. Ayers’s Brooklyn Heights apartment when her lease was up in May.In early 2018, Mr. Ayers began looking for rings to propose to Ms. Grossan. Once he found one — a vintage emerald cut diamond with two baguettes that reminded him of the Art Deco angles of the Chrysler Building — he put his plan in motion. He had arranged to have Julien Baker, Ms. Grossan’s favorite musician, perform a private serenade during the Sasquatch Music Festival in George, Wash., on May 25, 2018.But the couple was running late that day. Ms. Grossan got her first speeding ticket while they were en route to the Gorge Ampitheater from Seattle. She was frazzled as Mr. Ayers hurried her through security, texting with Ms. Baker’s manager about the mere minutes they had before the musician was due on stage. Telling Ms. Grossan they were hurrying to meet a friend at a backstage video shoot, Mr. Ayers wove them through the 20,000-person crowd, past the tour buses, and around a bend behind the stage. There, they found Ms. Baker and her violinist on a cliff overlooking the gorge. She started playing “Love Me Tender” by Elvis. When the violin solo began, Mr. Ayers dropped to one knee and asked Ms. Grossan to marry him.The couple chose to marry in Los Angeles, where Ms. Grossan grew up and where her grandparents, Murray and Rosalyn Grossan, 95 and 94, live. (They were unable, however, to attend the wedding). Mr. Ayers had recently organized a show at the Hollywood Cemetery and thought it might dually be suitable for matrimony. On the summer day when Ms. Grossan and her mother toured the cemetery for a visit, the staff was cleaning up the site of the memorial for Chris Cornell, Soundgarden’s frontman.On the evening of Dec. 20, however, morbidity was the last thing on the minds of the 125 friends and family who gathered in the temple of Masonic Lodge in festive interpretations of “glamour goth,” the couple’s suggested attire for guests. This meant oversize earrings, peacock feathers, sparkly slides, tattooed fingers, faux fur and evening gowns, with an over-index of black rimmed glasses paired with long rocker hair.“Each of you are glowing tonight, and the love of life that you are share with each other helps to light this world around us,” said the officiant, Rabbi Michele Ellise Lenke, under a white huppah in the temple room, which was a vision in crimson, from carpet to walls, with a Masonic Eastern Star hanging in the center. “Julien Baker may sing about turning the lights out,” the rabbi said, “but my wish for you is to keep shining bright.”In his vows, Mr. Ayers spoke of his respect for Ms. Grossan’s drive and ambition, and called her his motivation in life. “I’ve always been a happy person,” he said. “It’s become clear to me that you’ve always been a happy person. So it’s hard to believe that I would meet someone who has made me infinitely happier, but you’ve done that.”Ms. Grossan, who is taking her husband’s last name, praised his accomplishments and his “infectious warmth.” “Waiters, bartenders, shopkeepers and strangers we meet are immediately drawn to you,” she said. “It’s like the whole world is completely in love with you, but not as much as me. I vow to protect and cherish that feeling.”In toasts over dinner in the building’s Eastern Star Room, where guests drank sparkling Topo Chico water, natural libations from Silverlake’s Psychic Wines, and ate a Mediterranean buffet feast, Mr. Ayers was referred to by a co-worker, Gabe Spierer, as “the nicest guy in rock.”(“Not only rock, but one of the nicest guys in earth, wind and water,” Matt Berninger, the frontman for the rock band the National amended later in the evening).Mr. Ayers’s mother Louise Vesper, a former ballet dancer, recalled seeing the body language between the couple for the first time, and praised the fact that “in their busy lives, they still make time for their parents.” The party moved back across the hall to the Masonic Temple for dancing, and then onto an after party at Brass Monkey — for karaoke, of course.ON THIS DAYWhen Dec. 20, 2018Where The Masonic Lodge at Hollywood Forever Cemetery, Los Angeles.

Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I’m Lisa Lerer, your host.When people talk about the emerging 2020 Democratic primary field, it can sound an awful lot like the opening lines of a children’s book.One candidate, two candidates Old candidates, new candidatesSome are slightly left, some are farSay! what a lot of candidates there are.But there’s one thing many leading Democrats seem to agree on: Kamala Harris is a formidable contender. When you ask 2020 candidates, likely candidates and members of their teams what possible opponent they worry about, the California senator’s name comes up frequently.Those concerns only grew on Monday when Ms. Harris formally announced her presidential bid: She matched Senator Bernie Sanders’s record by raising $1.5 million from 38,000 donors in the first 24 hours of her campaign.So why is a first-term senator, with little experience outside California state government, making Democrats so nervous?• She doesn’t fit into a neat ideological lane. As my colleague Astead Herndon wrote on Monday, Ms. Harris comes out of the Bay Area’s Democratic establishment. But since joining the Senate in 2017, she’s embraced elements of a Sanders-lite liberal agenda, backing “Medicare for All” and rejecting most corporate donations. As a result, her team argues, she can appeal to a wide array of factions in the party.• She would make history. Should she prevail in the primary season, Ms. Harris would be the first African-American woman and the first person of Asian heritage to be a major party nominee. As a graduate of Howard and a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the oldest black sorority, Ms. Harris has deep ties to the black community.• The primary map favors a candidate who can win strong support from black voters — and California. It’s no accident that Ms. Harris is making her first campaign stop on Friday in South Carolina, where African-Americans will likely make up a majority of the electorate in that state’s early primary. The rising popularity of early voting also means that primary voters will start casting ballots in her native state of California on the day of the Iowa caucuses; in diverse states of Illinois and Ohio, voters can start casting early ballots before New Hampshire holds its primary.After Iowa and New Hampshire, the race moves to potentially favorable terrain for Ms. Harris: Nevada, which borders California and has a large Latino population, then South Carolina. Then, on Super Tuesday, California will be among the states voting, as will four southern states where black voters made up more than a quarter of the 2016 primary electorate.Even with these advantages, Ms. Harris still has plenty to worry about. Already, she’s fending off attacks on the “tough-on-crime” positions she took as a prosecutor in California. In her first remarks after announcing her campaign, Ms. Harris described the criminal justice system as “horribly flawed.” And her liberal bona fides may be found lacking by an insurgent wing that is ascendant in the party.Obviously Ms. Harris does not have anything locked down. (Need I take you back to the winter of 2007, when Hillary Clinton led primary polls by double digits.) We’re in the early stages of what will likely be a very, very long primary contest. A lot can happen.Just ask Howard Dean.____________________Advisers to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. are circulating a document to his supporters that outlines a rationale for him to run for president and rebuts potential lines of attack — the latest indication that Mr. Biden is leaning toward a 2020 bid but has not yet fully committed.The talking points, which were sent to The Times’s Jonathan Martin by an ally of Mr. Biden, reflect some of his core arguments he would make if he does enter the Democratic primary. He and his advisers contend that his long experience in politics — he served in the Senate for over 35 years — would represent an appealing contrast to President Trump’s erratic style.“In a time of almost unprecedented political chaos under a President whose first and last thought every day is about himself, his image, and using the most powerful office in the world to enrich himself, Americans are reacting to — and looking for — the trustworthy, compassionate leadership that Joe Biden has brought to the national and international stage his entire career,” the document states.But what is more revealing about the 10-paragraph document is that Mr. Biden and his small circle of aides feel the need to sketch out his message before he announces his candidacy. It is, a Biden ally said, “a distillation of his thinking.” The decision to put these thoughts on paper while other Democrats are announcing full-blown campaigns indicates Mr. Biden is still eager to gauge reaction to his candidacy before taking the plunge.To that end, the talking points attempt to grapple with some of the most frequent critiques of Mr. Biden:• That his initial lead in some Democratic primary polls is simply based on name identification and will melt once other candidates become better known?“He is passionate, he is empathetic, he is trustworthy — and voters know these things about him,” the document states. “It’s why he’s atop so many polls — it’s not because voters know his name, it’s because they know his character.”• That he is too moderate for today’s Democratic voters and will struggle with liberals?“He was outspoken on LGBTQ rights even when every pundit around said that it was a political mistake,” according to the talking points, adding that he also sought to address climate change early in his career and is an unwavering ally of organized labor.• At 76, Mr. Biden may be too old to run for president?He campaigned for nearly 70 candidates, across the ideological spectrum, “across 26 states in the last two years.”Stay tuned, folks.____________________Drop us a line!We want to hear from our readers.

More videos later emerged that complicated the story, showing the encounter had been preceded by African-American protesters, who identified themselves as Hebrew Israelites, shouting slurs at the students.The incident has emerged as a kind of Rorschach test for views on politics, race and the Trump administration.We talked to Elizabeth Dias, The New York Times religion correspondent who was in Covington, about what she discovered about our political culture.Lisa: Why did this video touch such a nerve? Elizabeth: There are these flash points now in our political culture. This one was particularly polarizing because it touched every nerve — race, President Trump and the behavior of young white men.As a religion reporter, I’ve covered a lot of sensitive topics and the level of vitriol and aggression from the right and the left about every part of this story is remarkable. Some of the people involved in the videos have been experiencing threats of violence all weekend. So what did you learn about the context for these videos? When you actually are on the ground, in the kids’ community, you start to get an idea of the cultural context behind these kinds of inflamed moments. The school is in an overwhelmingly white, heavily Republican and Catholic area. The boys in the video, their school is known around town as the “Colonel Crazies” for their intense school pride and their all-male brotherhood. And now the Catholic community and the parents of these kids are joining together to protect them.The last time the country was this intensely focused on Catholic high school boys was during the Kavanaugh hearings. This time we’re seeing it in a pocket of the country that fueled Mr. Trump’s election.And with the videos, there’s now this fight over whose narrative wins out.What does this incident tell us about our political culture?So Covington, where this happened, is right across the river from Cincinnati. The Covington area voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, while the Cincinnati area has become increasingly blue. They are very close, but may have very different realities of what it is to be American.How have politicians tried to capitalize on this episode?Mr. Trump jumped into the fray praising the Covington Catholic boys and used the moment to attack the media. I wouldn’t be surprised if the kids get a visit to Washington or the White House or even the State of the Union, if it happens. The right already sees this as part of their narrative — that Christians are under attack.____________________• Furloughed federal workers try to join the gig economy. One woman’s haul on Uber?

Sign up here.)A federal appeals court ruled against the Justice Department on its bid to block AT&T’s $85.4 billion takeover of Time Warner. It’s the final blow to the government’s two-year effort to thwart one of the biggest media mergers in years.A three-judge panel ruled that a lower court had applied antitrust laws correctly. “The government’s objections that the District Court misunderstood and misapplied economic principles and clearly erred in rejecting the quantitative model are unpersuasive,” Judge Judith Rogers wrote on behalf of the panel.AT&T is free to reboot Time Warner. Now a division known as WarnerMedia, it will be turned into a streaming-video business — AT&T’s version of what has become the TV industry’s go-to strategy. Among its planned products: a service that combines HBO, Warner Bros. movies like “Wonder Woman” and shows like “Friends.”The Justice Department won’t appeal the decision. The court’s ruling was a blow to the department’s top antitrust official, Makan Delrahim, who had hoped the case would strike a blow against so-called vertical mergers, which combine companies with complementary businesses.Where should Mr. Delrahim look now? Joe Nocera of Bloomberg Opinion argues that there are far larger consolidation problems in other industries, including tech and airlines.Many executives facing a contempt of court allegation from the Securities and Exchange Commission would stay quiet.

Tesla lawyers conceded to the S.E.C. that they did not vet a tweet by Mr. Musk about production targets, though they helped write a subsequent “clarifying” tweet.The S.E.C. must try to punish Mr. Musk, some experts say. Officials “have to enforce this settlement,” Charles Elson of the University of Delaware told the FT. “If they let this go, then every C.E.O. will be saying they’re special.” But other lawyers think Mr. Musk’s actions underscore how toothless the S.E.C. is.All eyes will be on Michael Cohen at 10 a.m. Eastern today as he testifies before the House Oversight and Reform Committee. Mr. Cohen, once President Trump’s personal lawyer, has prepared testimony in which he’s expected to call his onetime boss a “con man” and a “cheat,” Nicholas Fandos and Maggie Haberman of the NYT report:• “Mr. Cohen is likely to lay out a picture of Mr. Trump that is fundamentally at odds with the take-charge, top-flight businessman persona he developed on the reality show ‘The Apprentice’ over the course of a decade.”• “Among the most explosive and potentially damning aspects of Mr. Cohen’s testimony before the oversight committee will be providing evidence of potential criminal conduct since Mr. Trump became president, according to people familiar with the plans.” Some of that is tied to hush payments made to the porn star Stormy Daniels.• Mr. Cohen is also expected to discuss the role of Allen Weisselberg, the Trump Organization’s C.F.O., in those payments, as well as how long Mr. Trump continued to discuss plans for a Trump Tower in Moscow in 2016.• “He will also describe the president inflating or devaluing his net worth, referring to a financial statement of Mr. Trump’s that Mr. Cohen has in his possession, the people said.”• The scheduled testimony has already sparked some controversy, with Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican and ally of the president, threatening to reveal what he said were Mr. Cohen’s extramarital affairs. Mr. Gaetz subsequently apologized.Prime Minister Theresa May has agreed that Parliament should have the option of seeking to delay Britain’s exit from the E.U., Stephen Castle of the NYT reports.Her new plan offers lawmakers a vote on her Brexit deal by March 12. If that is rejected, a second vote by March 13 will let Parliament choose to leave the E.U. without a deal. If that is rejected, a vote will be held by March 14 that would allow lawmakers to request a “short, limited extension” to the process.“Mrs. May’s reversal was striking because she had insisted dozens of times in Parliament that Britain would definitely leave the European Union on schedule on March 29,” Mr. Castle writes. But it is “the latest in a long line of retreats as she has struggled to cajole the fractious Tories into supporting a revised version of the deal.”“While her move lessens significantly the risk of a potentially disastrous ‘no deal’ Brexit by the March 29 deadline, an extension of the negotiating period will merely delay that danger by a couple of months, not end it,” Mr. Castle adds.All 27 other E.U. governments would have to approve a postponement, and “unless Britain plans to hold a general election or another referendum, the delay is not likely to extend beyond early July, when a newly elected European Parliament is scheduled to meet.”More: The news reduces the significance of a series of parliamentary votes on a Brexit motion scheduled for later today. The pound is rebounding. And the E.U. has agreed on tough rules for London-based financial services companies operating on the Continent after Brexit.The Federal Trade Commission announced yesterday that it had a new team of officials to police tech giants.The task force will have 17 staff lawyers dedicated to “monitoring competition in U.S. technology markets, investigating any potential anticompetitive conduct in those markets, and taking enforcement actions when warranted.”Tech “grows more important every day” in both the economy and daily life, the F.T.C.’s chairman, Joe Simons, said. “It makes sense for us to closely examine technology markets to ensure consumers benefit from free and fair competition.”It’s not the F.T.C.’s first move against the tech giants. It was reported earlier this month to be considering a record multibillion-dollar fine for Facebook over privacy violations. And critics have increasingly called for breaking up big tech companies — especially the likes of Facebook, which controls Instagram and WhatsApp.The F.T.C. competition director sees “distinct challenges” for antitrust enforcement in tech. That director, Bruce Hoffman, is also quoted at the Verge as suggesting that some companies could be forced to “spin off” previous acquisitions.President Trump’s decision to cap a popular tax break will affect 11 million filers this year, Jim Tankersley of the NYT reports:• A $10,000 cap on deductions of state and local taxes from federal income taxes, which was intended to reduce the cost of Mr. Trump’s $1.5 trillion tax cut, will mean filers cannot deduct $323 billion on their 2018 federal returns.• “Many filers will benefit from different parts of the tax cuts, such as the elimination of the alternative minimum tax and the reduction in marginal tax rates. Additionally, the law doubled the standard deduction that taxpayers may take, along with a host of other tax changes,” Mr. Tankersley writes.• “The so-called SALT cap is, however, most likely to affect the richest Americans: More than half of the tax increases from the change will fall on the top 1 percent of income earners, according to estimates by the independent Tax Policy Center in Washington.”Some of the biggest figures in finance and economics have conflicting takes.The Fed’s chairman, Jay Powell, told the Senate Banking Committee yesterday that current economic conditions were “healthy” and their outlook “favorable.” But he added that there were “crosscurrents and conflicting signals,” which meant that financial conditions were “now less supportive of growth than they were earlier last year.”Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase is also wary. “We are prepared for a recession,” he said in the bank’s annual presentation to investors yesterday. “We’re not predicting a recession. We’re simply pointing out that we are very conscious about the risks we bear.”But Goldman Sachs is more sanguine. In a note published yesterday, economists at the firm argued that “some green shoots are emerging that suggest that sequential growth will pick up from here.” They believe the U.S. economy stands a good chance of picking up, and that China’s might, too.Deutsche Bank hired Robert Innocentin from Bank of America as a managing director for its financial sponsors team, part of its investment-banking business.Goldman Sachs has reportedly hired 100 employees to work in its nascent corporate cash management business, which aims to challenge Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase.Deals• EBay is reportedly near a deal that would give the activist hedge funds Elliott Management and Starboard Value seats on its board and prepare the online marketplace for a breakup.

David, a Mexican by birth and a Mérida resident by choice, deftly picked out the vacationers (in short pants, like myself, because of the heat) from the locals (in long pants, like David, because of the insects).An elegant blonde woman in slacks drifted over to the table to say hello to David — Elena, he explained, a fashion designer from Milan. A few minutes later a tanned couple, the husband leaning on a cane as a result of a riding accident, dropped by — Ralf and Yvonne, the Germans who run the Yucatán Polo Club. After lunch we stopped at Ki’Xocolatl — the chocolate store next to the restaurant run by two Belgians — and bumped into Carmen, a painter from Mexico City, and Marcela, a Yucatecan artist who got out her phone to show me pictures of the sculptures she makes from sisal fiber.So it goes in Mérida, the capital of Mexico’s Yucatán state and a magnet for creative souls from both sides of the border and beyond. They come from the United States and Canada, Mexico City and Europe, lured by the city’s un-Disneyfied Mayan and colonial heritage. Among the expats: the artists James Brown and Jorge Pardo, the designers Laura Kirar and Marjorie Skouras, and the chefs Jeremiah Tower and (until his death in 2016) David Sterling. Just don’t call it the next San Miguel de Allende. “People go to San Miguel to retire,” David, acting as both my host and tour guide during my first visit to the city, said back in the car. “Here you come and work. I think the heat wakes you up.”The heat — or maybe it was the food — was having the opposite effect on me. But our Uber driver, Israel, a Yucatecan of Lebanese descent, cranked up the AC in his Dodge Neon. The radio was also rousing: Israel blasted KIIS FM (“You’re the One That I Want”) as he negotiated the narrow streets lined with tall colonial houses in sherbet colors back to David’s place.We had spent the morning driving around the centro historico. Mérida, named for the ancient Spanish city, was founded in 1542 by the conquistador Francisco de Montejo y Leon on the site of the Maya city of T’ho. On La Plaza Grande (the main square) David pointed out the Catedral de San Ildefonso  and the Casa de Montejo, both constructed of stone from the ancient pyramids and temples, both dripping with Renaissance ornamentation. “You see the Roman influence, just as there was the Roman influence in Mérida, Spain,” David explained. “The French came later.”On cue, Israel had turned up the Paseo de Montejo, the city’s main artery, and suddenly we were surrounded by palm-shaded mansions in the Beaux-Arts style — the trophy homes of the 18th- and 19th-century millionaires who made their fortunes producing henequen (or sisal) from the agave plant. The rich Yucatecans rejected Hispanic culture in favor of all things French, and Paseo de Montejo bears more than a passing resemblance to a street in old New Orleans, which happens to be a sister city.The pale blue exterior of the 200-year-old house in the Santiago barrio that David and his partner, Robert Willson, bought a few years ago is reserved, almost anonymous. Inside it looks the way you might imagine a casa restored by two guys who used to run one of Los Angeles’s premier design showrooms would look. There are 20-foot beamed ceilings and boldly patterned concrete tile floors, terra cotta sphinxes and French chairs made of steel and twine. The lush scent of plumeria wafts from the courtyard, where a Piranesi-inspired mural overlooks a turquoise pool.“People come here and visit ruins and cenotes the first time,” David had told me, “look at houses the second time, and buy a house the third time.” Happily for first-time visitors, more than a few of those who return and buy renovate their homes as boutique hotels or rentals. Hotel Diplomat, down the street from David’s place, is one of the more intimate B & B’s, with just four rooms, while Casa Lecanda, two blocks from Paseo de Montejo, is one of the more luxe ones. Urbano Rentals offers several meticulously restored town homes in the centro historico. I repaired to my guest room, settling in for a siesta on the steel canopy bed. An Olivia Newton-John/John Travolta ear worm had worked its way into my head, but at some point I dozed off. When I awoke my room was dark, and rain pelted the roof — a steady, cooling volley punctuated by rumbling thunder.Luckily Israel’s musical tastes were varied. The next morning, he was playing Mexican techno. In a light drizzle we set off for the ruins of Uxmal, a Maya city 50 miles south of Mérida, known for its ornate Puuc-style architecture and its fine state of preservation.10 milesYucatán Polo ClubTatemarSan MiguelMexicoMérida detail belowPlantel MatildeChablé Resort & SpaGulf of MexicoYucatÁnYucatÁnMexico CityMéridaMEXICOUxmal400 milesCentro Cultural La CúpulaMéridaCasa LecandaCatrínPatronato HistoricoLagaláHotel DiplomatFundación de ArtistasKi’XocolatlGaleria la EskaleraApoalaCatedral de San IldefonsoCasa de MontejoBy The New York TimesUxmal, population 20,000, give or take, was founded about 500 AD by Chac Uitzil Hun, I learned from my guide, Fabio, a Yucatecan with a mouth full of gold and a wicked sense of humor. We made our way around the Pyramid of the Magician, the site’s tallest structure, to the grass-covered Ballcourt. Competitions here generally concluded with a human sacrifice, Fabio said, doing a little pantomime of the victor having his heart ripped out and offered to the gods, his gold teeth sparking in the mist.We climbed the steep stone steps to the Governor’s Palace, whose massive mosaic facade boasts 103 masks of the rain god Chac (no cenotes nearby). As we passed a group of German tourists sharing a joint, one of them lost her footing on the steps. “Careful,” Fabio warned. “We lost someone here yesterday.”“They say that to everyone,” David observed when I told him about it back in the car.After touring the oldest remnants of Yucatán civilization, we set out for its newest frontier. Many of the affluent Mexicans moving to Mérida are settling not in centuries-old casas in town or haciendas in the country but in the spanking new suburbs of el norte — a long swath of gated communities and giant malls to the north of the city. Our destination was a restaurant called Tatemar in Plaza La Isla, a just-opened 180-store mall developed by Carlos Slim, the richest man in Mexico (and an investor in The New York Times).Carlos Arnaud, who owns the Oaxacan-flavored Tatemar with his sister Sara, steered us to a table overlooking La Isla’s artificial lake and handled the ordering: grouper with guacamole, octopus with maize purée, pork and shrimp tacos. “Here in the Yucatán, Mayan culture was untouched until the Spanish,” he said, joining us at the table. “Oaxaca is more of a melting pot, so you carry the tradition of cooking with corn and beans, but in a different way, using chocolate and moles.”Traditional Yucatecan cuisine, on the other hand, weds Mayan ingredients (corn, chilis, pumpkin) with culinary contributions from Spain (pork, lard, Seville orange) and other parts of Europe. Mr. Tower, the chef, who has lived in Mérida for the last decade, haunts the city’s food stalls for fried pork belly and other Yucatecan staples. Gringos who want to master time-honored recipes like pavo en relleno negro (roasted turkey in charred chili sauce) can take classes at Los Dos, the cooking school founded by David Sterling.Meals can go on for hours here. We were in Tatemar until sundown, feasting and chatting. David and Carlos spoke in glowing terms about Mérida’s rapid growth. When he arrived here four years ago, David said, there were seven Starbucks; now there are 18. “The first wave of discovery was like 10 years ago,” Carlos noted. “Tulum went through all the stages of growth in five years. You can’t grow there like you can here because of the size.”When we left the mall the sun was sinking below a stand of tamarind trees. Suddenly there was an explosion of bird chatter — the evening song of blackbirds known locally as X’Kau — a reminder that, for all the golf courses and Porsche dealerships, we were still in the jungle.Among Mérida’s best exhibition spaces, Lagalá, Galeria La Eskalera, the Fundacion de Artistas, and Centro Cultural La Cupula are all in the centro historico. La Cupula, a sprawling garden-linked complex, hosts music, dance and theater performances as well as exhibitions. A show of David’s recent paintings happened to be up when I was in town, so we swung by the morning of my last day in the city. “Predictions and Sortileges” is a series of canvases, executed in white acrylic on brightly painted backdrops, about fortune telling. We paused in front of a painting of a female medium with a pair of birds on her head, surrounded by a faithful audience. “She gets power telling people what they want to hear,” David explained. “Like Trump.”We had been asked to lunch at the country hacienda of Laura Kirar, the designer, and her husband, Richard Frazier. So we picked up a roasted chicken at a roadside stand, and Israel navigated a series of narrow village roads lined with shacks in taffy colors and teeming with mototaxis, pedestrians and dogs that seemed oblivious to both.Hacienda Subin is a romantically crumbling 18th- and 19th-century Moorish-style compound on 40 acres in the jungle. Like the other haciendas in the area it was once part of a henequen ranch. Laura and Richard, who moved here from New York full time a year and a half ago, are living in a pool house they built while they painstakingly restore the main buildings. “It’s like children,” Richard said, pouring coffee sweetened with agave nectar. “You don’t know what you’re getting into until it’s too late.”Dozens of the sisal haciendas outside Mérida have been renovated as resorts. One of the newest and poshest is the Chablé Resort and Spa, in Chocholá — 38 modern casitas, each with its own pool and hammock, on the jungled grounds of the former henequen estate Hacienda San Antonio Chablé. As for Hacienda Subin, Richard and Laura are rehabbing its factory building as a multipurpose space for community events.Expat colonies can be insular, but Mérida’s outlanders are establishing deep roots here. On our way back to the city we stopped at Plantel Matilde, a 39,000-square-foot arts center rising like a modern acropolis in the middle of the jungle. Conceived by the Mexico City sculptor Javier Marin, Matilde serves as a campus for international art students and local schoolchildren as well as a studio and exhibition space for the artist.After a full day my host had planned a casual dinner back in town. But this was Mérida: the meal, at a simple cantina called Catrin, was a long, festive, Mezcal-fueled affair. Richard and Laura showed up, as did Marcela, the sisal sculptor. There was Jason, an artist from Chicago, and Kate, from Poland, who did hair, and Ross, from New York, who works in real estate.We passed around platters of cactus salad and vegetarian flautas and empanadas. The conversation returned to Mérida’s recent growth. Not everyone shared David’s and Carlos’s enthusiasm for the changes. Jason groused about the traffic and noise. Ross said the Levi’s plant was polluting the water with toxic dyes.“We need Ross just to make sure it’s not all puppies and rainbows here,” said Laura. “If you quote me make sure you say it was after a couple of tequilas.” Laura also opined that anybody looking for “a good place to be creative” still couldn’t do better than Mérida — a point disputed by no one.Follow NY Times Travel on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

Then he was convicted in 2012 of tipping an insider-trading ring. Now Mr. Gupta, who served two years in prison, has spoken to Andrew about his plight.Mr. Gupta still says he’s innocent of securities fraud, despite having been convicted of illegally slipping the hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam confidential information about Goldman Sachs. His only regret? Being a little too loose-lipped about corporate secrets.Mr. Gupta forgave Mr. Rajaratnam when the two shared prison time. “We played Scrabble in prison together. We played chess. We had breakfast together,” Mr. Gupta told Andrew.But he definitely hasn’t forgiven Preet Bharara, the prosecutor who put him behind bars. “Go after the hedge funds and their circle, play up the story in the press, and maybe no one would notice that the big banking executives were continuing to walk free,” Mr. Gupta wrote in a new book, out next week.Since being released three years ago, Mr. Gupta has done some consulting in India, but hasn’t reconnected with many business associates from his previous life. “I didn’t want to put them in a difficult position,” he said.But he’s learning to move on. “Don’t get too attached to anything — your reputation, your accomplishments or any of it,” Mr. Gupta told Andrew. “This thing unjustly destroyed my reputation. That’s only troubling if I am so attached to my reputation.”European leaders have pushed back the deadline for Britain’s exit from the bloc, giving Prime Minister Theresa May and British lawmakers more time to avoid a no-deal Brexit, Stephen Castle and Steven Erlanger of the NYT write.“Britain’s exit date will be pushed back to May 22 if next week Mrs. May can persuade lawmakers in Parliament to accept her plan for leaving the bloc, which they have already rejected overwhelmingly, not once but twice.”“If she cannot persuade lawmakers to accept her plan, Mrs. May will get a shorter delay in exiting the European Union — until April 12. But Britain could stay in the bloc longer if it decides it needs more time for a more fundamental rethink of Brexit.”The E.U. doesn’t want Britain to crash out. But officials “made it clear that it is for Britain to make serious choices, and soon, and that failure should not be laid at the door of Brussels,” Mr. Castle and Mr. Erlanger write.More: Over two million people have signed a petition to cancel Brexit. And Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority warned that the finance industry still faces big risks in a no-deal scenario.The embattled plane maker will install an extra safety alarm in its 737 Max jets after two fatal plane crashes. But it’s unclear whether that, together with a forthcoming software upgrade, will be enough to prevent future catastrophes.The new feature warns pilots  if a plane’s “angle of attack” sensors, which determine the pitch of the plane’s nose, disagree with each other. A faulty sensor is suspected of triggering anti-stall software that may have helped cause the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines crashes. Until now, this warning system was an optional extra on the Max jets.But it’s only one of two features that experts say could help make the planes safer, according to the NYT. The other is an indicator that displays the sensors’ readings, which will remain an optional feature. Neither has been mandated by the F.A.A.The move highlights Boeing’s practice of selling add-ons. The planemaker has made a lot of money by offering features as upgrades — some of which are important safety items, the NYT reports. (Among them: a backup fire extinguisher for the cargo hold and oxygen masks for the crew.)But the damage continues to grow. Indonesia’s Garuda airline said today it was seeking to cancel a $4.9 billion order of Max 8 jets. “Our passengers, psychologically, they don’t trust flying with Max anymore,” a spokesman for the airline told the NYT.Small countries, big companies and even just wealthy people can now turn to gun-for-hire hackers to settle their scores, according to an NYT investigation — turning the business into a multibillion-dollar industry.Privatized cyberspying has taken off. Two companies — NSO, an Israeli company, and DarkMatter, based in the United Arab Emirates — have developed sophisticated espionage operations, helped by former government hackers on staff. They help governments perform legitimate law enforcement investigations.But there’s a darker side. The Mexican government is suspected of using NSO tools to spy on its own citizens, including journalists and activists. Saudi Arabia has been accused of using NSO products to spy on associates of Jamal Khashoggi. And former DarkMatter employees told the NYT that the U.A.E. used the firm’s tools to spy on Ahmed Mansoor, a prominent human rights activist.And it’s lucrative. “Francisco Partners, a private equity firm, purchased a 70 percent stake in NSO for $130 million in 2013. Last month, NSO’s co-founders raised enough money to buy back a majority stake in NSO at a valuation of just under $1 billion,” the NYT reports. Moody’s estimates that the so-called lawful intercept spyware market is worth $12 billion.Intellectual property rules for new pharmaceutical products could derail President Trump’s push to get his revised North American Free Trade Agreement through Congress, Ana Swanson of the NYT reports.• “While Mr. Trump secured Canada’s and Mexico’s signoff on the new agreement last year, the trade pact must be ratified by legislators in all three countries, including by Congress.”• “Democrats, who now control the House, have already made it clear that they will not approve the new trade deal without significant changes to labor and environmental provisions.”• “Now, they are also looking for revisions to the trade deal’s pharmaceutical provisions, in particular a measure providing an advanced class of drugs called biologics 10 years of protection from cheaper alternatives.”• “A similar conflict over drug industry protections helped delay and ultimately sink the prospects for another trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership.”Jared Kushner, President Trump’s son-in-law, went to Saudi Arabia in October 2017 in his role as a White House adviser. But his brother, Josh, was there the day before on behalf of his investment firm, David Kirkpatrick of the NYT reports — raising questions about whether Jared could be evenhanded in dealing with the kingdom.• “Josh Kushner had spent the three days before his brother’s arrival at an investor conference, where Prince Mohammed had promised to spend billions of dollars on a high-tech future for Saudi Arabia.”• Jared Kushner cut ties to Josh’s venture firm, Thrive Capital, including by selling his interest in its funds, after he joined the Trump administration. Previously, he had appeared to be closely involved in Thrive’s operations. Meanwhile, Josh Kushner has kept his distance from his brother.• But, Mr. Kirkpatrick writes, Jared “was nonetheless discussing American policy with the rulers of the kingdom at virtually the same time that his brother was talking business with their top aides.”• “It is reasonable to question Jared Kushner’s ability to be impartial,” Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, told the NYT.More Kushner news: Charles Kushner, the father of Jared and Josh, has publicly defended both his real estate company and Jared. And the chairman of the House Oversight and Reform Committee claimed that Jared uses WhatsApp for official government business. Policy reversals at the Fed and the European Central Bank often catch economists off guard. But they can have a profound effect on nations that don’t use the dollar or the euro, the WSJ reports.• “Switzerland and countries near the eurozone but not part of it — like Sweden and Denmark — rely on the bloc for much of their exports and imports.”• “That makes growth and inflation highly dependent on the exchange rate.”• “Central-bank stimulus tends to weaken a country’s exchange rate, so when the E.C.B. embraces easy-money policies, as it did two weeks ago, it tends to weaken the euro against other European currencies, such as the Swiss franc.”• “Because the E.C.B. is so large, Switzerland and others can do little to offset it.”As a result, small countries often adopt negative interest rates despite having otherwise healthy economies. That can be costly, particularly for commercial banks that have to pay the equivalent of billions of dollars to store funds.As speculation swirls about the exact timing of Robert Mueller’s imminent submission of his special counsel report on the Russia investigation, James Comey, the former F.B.I. director, writes in an NYT Op-Ed what he hopes to see:• “I have no idea whether the special counsel will conclude that Mr. Trump knowingly conspired with the Russians in connection with the 2016 election or that he obstructed justice with the required corrupt intent. I also don’t care.”• “I am rooting for a demonstration to the world — and maybe most of all to our president and his enablers — that the United States has a justice system that works because there are people who believe in it and rise above personal interest and tribalism.“• What Mr. Comey personally doesn’t want to see: an impeachment of President Trump, because “a significant portion of this country would see this as a coup.”Wells Fargo directors are reportedly in talks to hire Harvey Schwartz, the former president of Goldman Sachs, as their bank’s next C.E.O.Ford Motor hired Tim Stone, who was most recently the chief financial officer of Snap, as its next C.F.O., replacing Bob Shanks.Freddie Mac has named David Brickman, its president, as its next C.E.O., replacing Donald Layton.President Trump plans to name Michael Kratsios as his administration’s first chief technology officer.Deals• Shares in Levi Strauss jumped 31 percent in their first day of trading yesterday.

Trump into office in style two years ago, and it is now clear just how enthusiastically his inaugural committee went to town with it.There was $10,000 for makeup for 20 aides at an evening inaugural event. There was another $30,000 in per diem payments to dozens of contract staff members, in addition to their fully covered hotel rooms, room service orders, plane tickets and taxi rides, including some to drop off laundry.The bill from the Trump International Hotel was more than $1.5 million. And there was a documentary, overseen by a close friend of Melania Trump’s, that was ultimately abandoned.The details of the expenditures, gleaned from interviews and from documents reviewed by The New York Times and not previously made public, show that the committee spent heavily on nearly every aspect of the events surrounding the inauguration.In 72 days, it laid out about $100 million, roughly twice as much or more than was raised by Barack Obama or George W. Bush for their first and second presidential inaugurations.The expansive spending reflected Mr. Trump’s desire to make a grand entrance, with roughly 20 events around Washington, people familiar with the events said. It also had the hallmarks of previous Trump efforts, such as the campaign, with some Trump-family friends circumventing existing chains of command.Disclosure of the spending details comes at a time when the inaugural committee is facing legal scrutiny over the donations that funded it.Inaugural committees are required to document every donation with the Federal Election Commission, and the Trump team’s reports are now under investigation by federal prosecutors in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Investigators are also looking into whether any foreign donations, which are illegal in the United States, were passed through Americans, and whether any donations went unrecorded, people familiar with the inquiries said.People involved with the committee have said that they vetted all donors, but that they could do only so much to prove someone’s money was their own. False statements to the Federal Election Commission can be a crime.The investigation by federal prosecutors in Manhattan was prompted at least partly by a recording that Mr. Trump’s former lawyer and fixer, Michael D. Cohen, made of a conversation he had with a central figure in the inaugural planning, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, shortly after Mrs. Trump ended Ms. Winston Wolkoff’s role as an unpaid adviser to the first lady. Ms. Winston Wolkoff was dismissed after initial reports about the amount of money taken in by the entity she formed to help produce the inaugural.There is no indication of any investigation into the inaugural committee’s spending. For the most part, inaugural committees are free to spend the money they raise from private donations as they wish.The bulk of the money for the inaugural committee came from big corporations, like AT&T, Bank of America and Pfizer, and wealthy Republicans donors, like Sheldon G. Adelson and Andrew Beal.Given the short time frame between Election Day and Inauguration Day, inaugural committees cannot always seek out the lowest bidder. In the case of Mr. Trump’s inaugural, some staff members and major vendors were veterans of previous inaugurations.Much of the spending, while outsize, was mundane. Documents reviewed by The Times accounted for the entire $107 million raised for the inaugural, with most of the money going to payroll expenses and roughly 40 entities, the bulk of which were hotel chains and other vendors.Roughly $5 million went to charity, which organizers have noted is the most ever for an inaugural committee.But millions were written off in lost revenue. That included $6.4 million for blocks of hotel rooms booked for guests who ended up arranging their own accommodations. The Republican National Committee booked the excess hotel rooms before the inaugural staff was even formed, but the committee had to pony up when only half as many rooms were used as the party organization had expected.Another $1.2 million in revenue that the committee expected to recoup for a media center never materialized.Other arrangements by the inaugural committee also proved unusual.Ms. Winston Wolkoff, then a close friend of Mrs. Trump’s, was initially signed to a $1.6 million contract. Along with a friend, Jonathan Reynaga, she formed WIS Media Partners, a firm that oversaw broadcast rights for the inaugural events and worked on the documentary project featuring interviews with top inaugural committee officials.The idea was to sell the rights to a major distributor. The project was later abandoned, although the interview footage still exists, as do copies, according to three people familiar with the effort.WIS Media Partners became the inaugural committee’s top vendor, acting as a kind of general contractor and overseeing a series of events. It received nearly $26 million, much of which was paid out to other vendors.Steve Kerrigan, who was chief of staff for Mr. Obama’s first inaugural committee, said that the firm’s $1.6 million “supervisory fee” was the equivalent of “roughly one-fourth of what we paid our entire 450-person staff” in 2009. Even if Ms. Winston Wolkoff shared the fee among more than a dozen other top managers, as she and others say she did, the charge itself, Mr. Kerrigan said, was “outrageous.”Greg Jenkins, the executive director of Mr. Bush’s second inaugural, said, “I have never heard anybody getting that kind of fee associated with any inaugural, ever.”Ms. Winston Wolkoff often fought with other top aides, according to people with direct knowledge of events. She was known to threaten to have senior officials fired, at times brandishing a cellphone and saying she would text Mrs. Trump or Ivanka Trump, the president’s elder daughter, conveying a sense of authority that people later came to realize she did not have, three people with direct knowledge of the events said.A lawyer for Ms. Winston Wolkoff declined to comment.A spokesman for WIS Media Partners said all of the firm’s charges “were vetted, authorized and signed off on” by the committee’s top officials, including Thomas J. Barrack Jr., the committee’s chairman; Rick Gates, the deputy chairman; and Sara Armstrong, the chief executive.He said the firm’s fees were “significantly below” the customary charges “for equivalent productions,” and that officials provided the inaugural committee with “all its audited records and receipts.” He said the company could not reveal more because it is legally barred by the inaugural committee from discussing its work on the inaugural events.In a statement, Mr. Barrack said he continues “to be proud of the incredible work of all those that were part of the committee” and that it “complied with all laws and regulations, and its finances were fully audited internally and independently. The donors were fully vetted and disclosed to the Federal Election Commission as required.”Mr. Trump’s inaugural committee has come under scrutiny in the past for its high administrative and logistical costs. The new details help flesh out how the inaugural spent the money. Among the payments was more than $2 million spent on the firm of the Trump campaign official Brad Parscale for online advertisements to drum up inaugural crowds.Another $2.7 million was spent on flying in a performance group working with Steve Wynn, the casino magnate and friend of Mr. Trump.The Trump International Hotel was paid more than $1.5 million for services including the use of a ballroom, an “annex” and a space called the townhouse, according to records and people familiar with the payments.While two other hotels, the Willard and the Fairmont, collected as much or more, Mr. Trump’s hotel was also favored by vendors who billed their expenses directly to the committee.Over all, the Trump team’s spending appears “astronomical,” said Emmett S. Beliveau, who was chief executive of Mr. Obama’s first inaugural committee.Mr. Jenkins, who handled the Bush inaugural, said the scale of the Trump team’s spending “blows me away.”Ms. Winston Wolkoff and Mr. Reynaga brought in nearly three dozen staff members, some of whom flew in from Los Angeles or other cities and remained on the East Coast for weeks. WIS also helped bring in a New York-based party planner named David Monn, who refused to sign a contract, according to two people familiar with the arrangement. Mr. Monn charged the committee a total of $3.7 million, from which he paid subcontractors.Among other tasks, Ms. Winston Wolkoff and colleagues managed the 500-person black-tie dinner hosted by Mr. Barrack at the neo-Classical Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium and a 1,500-person “candlelight” dinner at Union Station. They decided the decorations were not elegant enough and needed to be enhanced.Mr. Monn spent $924,000 on seven-foot-high wreaths, moss-covered obelisks, flowers and other decorations to dress up Union Station. Makeup was provided for 20 staff members at a cost of $500 per person. For the dinner at the auditorium, table menus, table numbers and place cards, including an on-site calligrapher to correct last-minute mistakes, amounted to $91 per guest. Mr. Monn did not respond to repeated requests for comment on Monday.The handling of expenses for contractors like WIS Media Partners was also unusual. Mr. Kerrigan, who also served as chief executive of Mr. Obama’s second inaugural committee, said officials negotiated fixed-price contracts that limited how much vendors could charge for expenses.If a vendor’s staff member ran up a big room service bill, “that was on them,” said David Cusack, who was the executive director of the second committee. “They had a per diem, and they were supposed to eat on that.”For Mr. Bush’s second inaugural, too, vendors were required to build their expenses into their contracts, Mr. Jenkins said. He said his committee did not even hire vendors from outside the Washington area because “there was no need to.”The Trump inaugural committee covered not only a fixed per diem for the people brought in by WIS Media, but picked up expenses including room service, cab rides for assistants who dropped off laundry and an order of McDonald’s. All told, those expenses came to $227,511.In less than two months, WIS billed $31,000 for hotel rooms described as Mr. Reynaga’s, including nearly $18,000 for rooms at the Trump International Hotel, according to detailed expense documents reviewed by The Times. He also billed thousands of dollars for meals, room service and travel. On one day, he charged a $560 Amtrak train ticket from New York to Washington, plus a $251 first-class upgrade to meet with Mr. Barrack. That was followed by a $100 Uber ride the next day to “get to Tom’s plane,” the records show.The spokesman for WIS said WIS expenses were paid through business cards tied to a few senior officials of the firm, including Mr. Reynaga, meaning that Mr. Reynaga could have been paying for other employees’ costs.He also said staff members stayed at the Trump International Hotel “at the explicit direction” of inaugural committee officials. A former official of the inaugural committee denied that the WIS employees were required to stay at the Trump hotel.Maggie Haberman and Sharon LaFraniere reported from Washington, and Ben Protess from New York.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Michael PaulsonWOODMERE, N.Y. — If there is a world in which theater kids rule, Andrew Barth Feldman seems to live there.He wanders through the halls of his high school — a lank, 5-foot-6, Disney-obsessed 16-year-old prone to bursting into song — like the mayor. Photos of him dot the hallways. Teachers stop mid-lesson when they spot him in the hallway, hoping he’ll come in and say hello to their classes. A basketball star in the cafeteria smiles and waves. The little kids in the library gawk as they hurtle by.He’s long been a standout in their world — the kid who was organizing flash mobs at fourth-grade assembly, who founded his own theater company at 12 (it’s still going), who has been acting in school plays and camp shows and community theater productions for as long as anyone can remember.And now he’s going to Broadway.Even in an industry that delights in discovery, this teenager’s right-place-right-time story is one for the books: Last June, he was competing in the National High School Musical Theater Awards (known as the Jimmys) — which he won — when the lead producer of “Dear Evan Hansen” happened to be in the audience.She knew immediately she wanted him for the show, and on Jan. 30, he assumes the title role, playing Broadway’s favorite socially anxious and ethically confused adolescent.“I’m so nervous all the time about it,” he said, cleareyed, candid, and strikingly courteous as we talked in an empty classroom. “If I were to make my Broadway debut in any role, it’s Evan,” he added, somehow managing to be confident and self-doubting at the same time. “This is my favorite show since I saw it, and everyone has always said I’m right for the role. I think I agree.”The role is wrenching, vocally and emotionally, and Andrew will be the first teenager to tackle it on Broadway. The character is 17, but adolescent boys are often thought to be too immature to play adolescent boys, and all of his predecessors have been in their 20s; Ben Platt, who won a Tony Award originating the role, was 23 when the show opened.“There’s the possibility of getting us something that’s authentic and original and vital and has never been seen,” said the show’s director, Michael Greif.Andrew is so young — and so new to the rigors of Broadway — that he’s going to begin his run doing just five performances a week, while taking vocal lessons to shore up his stamina. This will be his first professional production, and the creative team, determined to protect him as well as their smash-hit show, has decided the reduced schedule is their way of investing in his long-term success; the show’s alternate, Michael Lee Brown, will do the other three performances as Andrew builds comfort and strength.“It’s a little scary for all of us — for him, for me, for his mom — because we’re asking a lot of him,” said Stacey Mindich, the show’s lead producer. “But in every single moment he has grown with us already — at every passage he has shown us he is uber-capable.”This is not one of those stories about someone who happened into theater unwittingly. This is a story about an unabashed theater geek — a child who has adored Broadway since he saw “Beauty and the Beast” at age 3, who has been happily singing on stage since he landed the role of Mr. Bundles in a community theater production of “Annie” at age 8; who writes songs and plays the piano, guitar, drums, ukulele and bass; who has been to all four editions of BroadwayCon, including the one last year where he won a lip-syncing competition while performing as Angelica Schuyler from “Hamilton.”His passion for the imaginary goes way beyond musicals. He’s a huge fan of “Star Wars” — “We watched ‘A New Hope’ in English class to learn about archetypes, and I was like, ‘Oh my God, this is the coolest thing’” — and has dressed as General Grievous and Kylo Ren for Halloween. (It’s not that he’s drawn to the dark side; it’s just, he says, that those characters look cooler.)He’s an even huger fan of Disney (which now owns “Star Wars,” so maybe that’s redundant). He estimates that he’s been to Disney theme parks, including Disneyworld, Disneyland and Disneyland Paris, at least 20 times, starting when he was 6 months old. “Something draws me to the idea of being able to live in another world,” he said.And now he really, really loves “Dear Evan Hansen.” The first time he saw the musical, a couple of weeks after it opened on Broadway in 2016, he was so overcome he couldn’t find the words to talk about it when his mother came to pick him up.“It really, really hit hard,” he said. “I had never had such a visceral reaction to anything. Ever.”He started playing the cast album on repeat. He sent songs to friends. He saw it again. And again.He relates to Evan, and not just because he, like the character, lives with his single mom. “I mean, I’m a teenager,” he said. “I’ve been lucky to never personally struggle with a diagnosis of anxiety or anything, but I am a teenager. Of course I feel anxiety. Of course I feel nervous. Of course I feel alone.”He called Evan “a manifestation of what’s going on in our heads as teenagers — he just can’t control what’s going on the outside as much as most of us can.” And he asserted, with the confidence of a teenager who has been seeing as many Broadway shows as he could for as long as he can remember, “there has never been a character so thoroughly real and authentic to that experience.”I asked Andrew to show me around his high school — Lawrence Woodmere Academy, a small private school in the Five Towns section of Long Island — since he’ll be portraying a high school senior on Broadway while still a high school junior himself.Of course, as of a few weeks ago, he’s not actually showing up for class — Broadway is too time-consuming, so instead he’s being tutored for 15 hours a week.He grew up nearby, first in Hewlett Neck, and then in Woodmere. His mother is an alumna and administrator at the school; his father, a lawyer, lives in Manhattan, and he has an older sister. His tight-knit family also includes his mother’s sister, who lives down the street; the sisters raised their children together, and Andrew regards his cousins as his brothers.Andrew has been performing nonstop since “Annie.” He had tried a variety of sports, but didn’t like them; he was better at teaching his fellow 9- and 10-year-olds to sing Beatles tunes. And then his parents’ marriage was splitting up, and his ailing grandparents had moved into his house, so his mother, Barbra Feldman, was thrilled that he had found something he could do in a place that felt healthier than home at the time. She has spent the years since supporting his enthusiasm. “My plan was not for my son to be a Broadway star,” she said. “My plan was to have a happy, well-adjusted child.”He has played an amazing array of roles — the donkey in “Shrek,” Danny in “Grease,” Jack in “Into the Woods” — because over the last few years, he has often been doing five shows at a time, performing not only at school but also at Plaza Theatrical Productions in Lynbrook, the Rockaway Theater Company and St. Gregory’s Theater Group in Queens and Broadway Workshop in Manhattan. He has also built a large group of friends from the theater world; he met his girlfriend, who lives in Maryland, at Broadway Workshop.“He’s the nicest child I’ve ever worked with,” said Marc Tumminelli, the director of Broadway Workshop. “And by being in amazing shows, as well as shows that weren’t that great, he built his own process, so he’s ready.”The composer of “Be More Chill,” Joe Iconis, said he met Andrew in 2017, when the teenager was performing as Roger in a youth theater production of “Rent” that Mr. Iconis’s brother was directing. “It was truly insane watching that kid sing ‘One Song Glory’ as well as I’ve ever heard it sung ever,” he said. “He’s some sort of insane musical theater creature who has a preternatural ability to perform.”The theater company Andrew founded — called Zneefrock after the name Andrew made up for the aliens at the now-closed space-themed restaurant Mars 2112 — began as his bar mitzvah project. He wanted to hold a one-night cabaret to raise money for autism research, because one of his cousins is on the autism spectrum.That evening of “Les Misérables” and “Wicked” medleys held at the school theater was so successful, drawing theater kids, their families and fans that it became an annual event, with each one more ambitious, and raising more money for charity, than the one before. There was the “Star Wars” parody musical, which Andrew wrote with a friend; a minimalist reimagining of “Seussical”; and, last summer, a production of “Be More Chill” (yes, they managed to stage the show before it arrives on Broadway this winter).And then, most impressively, last fall Zneefrock staged Jason Robert Brown’s “The Last Five Years,” which is a beloved two-hander about the rise and fall of an unsuccessful marriage, with a different gender configuration at each performance — boy-girl, girl-boy, boy-boy and girl-girl — to see how the show’s complex romantic dynamic might shift.Now Andrew’s life is all Evan.He said his house suddenly looks as if it was decorated by Ms. Mindich because there is so much stuff bearing the show’s signature color. “It’s like, everything is blue now,” he said.He has vowed to stop eating dairy (hard when chocolate milk is still a dietary staple), and started drinking a lot of tea (plus water, water, and water). He’s rehearsing up to five hours a day, six days a week. And he’s thinking about Evan.“Who is this person, separated from the performances that I’ve seen?” he asks himself as he delves deeper and deeper into the role. “I learn a bunch of new things about him every day, every rehearsal, every time I sit down and look at the script. And I’m going to find him.”An earlier version of this article misstated Evan Hansen’s year in high school. The character is a senior, not a junior.Follow Michael Paulson on Twitter: @MichaelPaulson.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byPor Marina Franco¡Buen día!

En la última semana, nueve mujeres han denunciado por acoso o abuso sexual al exmandatario costarricense y su caso se ha vuelto el de más alto perfil del movimiento #MeToo en América Latina. Sin embargo, el temor de las mujeres de hacer públicas sus acusaciones y los retos para conseguir representación legal han entorpecido el camino contra uno de los hombres más poderosos del país centroamericano.

Juan Guaidó, quien se juramentó presidente encargado de Venezuela a finales de enero, dijo ayer que una primera tanda de medicinas y suplementos alimenticios fue repartida a niños y mujeres embarazadas, sin dar detalles de cómo se consiguieron los productos. Una de la promesas de la oposición mientras intenta que Nicolás Maduro deje el poder es empezar a paliar los efectos de la crisis económica. Guaidó convocó a marchar hoy para exigir que las fuerzas armadas permitan el paso de más ayuda humanitaria a través de la frontera con Colombia.Maduro, por su parte, presentó ayer en un acto público la marca país Venezuela y declaró que “no hay otro país en el mundo con mayores oportunidades, con mayores ventajas para la inversión”.

Clérigos en Argentina han dicho que informaron de las acusaciones a los oficiales vaticanos desde antes de 2017, cuando Zanchetta fue transferido de la provicina de Salta a la Santa Sede.En Chile ayer avanzó el caso contra uno de los más de cien obispos investigados por esta situación, Francisco Cox, quien regresó al país para enfrentar los procesos penales en su contra.“Los periodistas asesinados en México ya no son noticia, ni a nivel local ni para la prensa internacional.

Skittishness in the stock and bond markets appeared at odds with signs of stability on the ground. But this week’s flow of distressing news, showing ever more evidence of slowing growth, suggests that the markets had cause for concern:• Apple reduced its revenue expectations for the first time in 16 years, citing weak iPhone sales in China.• Delta Air Lines said its fare revenue, although growing, would fall short of the company’s earlier forecast.• The American manufacturing sector slowed sharply last month, according to a closely watched index released yesterday.And things could get worse, especially amid trade tensions with China, as companies line up to report fourth-quarter results in the next few weeks. Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told CNN on yesterday:“There are a heck of a lot of U.S. companies that have a lot of sales in China that are basically going to be watching their earnings be downgraded next year until we get a deal with China.”More on markets: Forty-six percent of American companies issuing estimates for the fourth-quarter have revised their outlook lower, the most since President Trump’s inauguration. Traders are placing bets on whether the Fed will be forced to change course by a slowing economy and swooning stock market. Investors have piled into money market funds as a shelter from market turmoil. China will keep trying to attract bond investors, and a fresh campaign to promote its currency is expected. If all this news makes you want to flee, that’s understandable. It’s also a bad idea.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________The Labor Department will release its official hiring and unemployment figures for December at 8:30 a.m.What to expect: Economists anticipate a gain of about 180,000 jobs, a rise from 155,000 reported in November. Average hourly earnings are expected to tick up 0.3 percent in December from November and 3 percent from a year earlier. The unemployment rate is forecast to fall to 3.6 percent from 3.7 percent.What that means for the economy: Economists believe that fears of an imminent recession are overblown. The unemployment rate is near a 50-year low. Job openings have hit record highs, and a growing number of workers are quitting, a sign of confidence in the hiring outlook.The Fed’s outlook: An indication of the Fed’s views on rates could come this morning at 10:30, when the central bank chairman, Jerome H. Powell, is scheduled to answer questions at a panel discussion in Atlanta with his two immediate predecessors, Janet Yellen and Ben S. Bernanke.The world economy has relied for years on the shopping stamina of Chinese consumers. But that spending engine seems to be sputtering.Apple’s surprise announcement this week was just one indicator that Chinese shoppers are pulling back. Amid a tense trade war with the United States, a shaky job market and efforts by Beijing to rein in what one analyst called a decade-long “debt-fueled binge,” Chinese consumers are feeling less than confident. Property sales are down, as are auto and retail sales.The NYT’s Alexandra Stevenson, Li Yuan and Raymond Zhong write:“A significant pullback could have a big impact on a world looking for engines of growth, on companies that counted on China’s continuing expansion and on global investors who have long viewed Chinese consumers as a steady source of profits.”The Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, met today with the three largest commercial banks in the country and pushed for policies to help bolster the economy, including lower taxes and fees and more financing for small and private companies. Today, China’s central bank said that, by Jan. 25, it will scale back the amount of cash it requires lenders to hold in reserve by one percentage point.The tech giant’s problems are not limited to nervous Chinese consumers, according to the WSJ. Competitors in China, such as Huawei, are moving in on Apple’s smartphone market share. In India, a growth market, Apple is a minor player. Customers in the U.S. are keeping their phones longer.Tom Warren at The Verge had this take:“People are upgrading less, carrier subsidies aren’t enough, and $1,000 phones are making consumers pause and consider. Mix that in with fears of a recession, and 2019 could be challenging for Apple and many others.”The company may pull iPhones from its German stores after Qualcomm took steps yesterday to enforce a court order last month banning the sale of certain versions of the device. The order stems from a ruling that Apple infringed on the chip-maker’s patents involving power-saving technology.Apple’s woes were keenly felt yesterday by its third-largest shareholder, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. Tumbling prices for Apple and airline stocks caused more than $4 billion in value to evaporate from Mr. Buffett’s stakes in the companies, according to the FT.The companies, both top sellers of cancer drugs with Bristol-Myers’s Opdivo and Celgene’s Revlimid, agreed to a cash-and-stock deal valued at roughly $74 billion. It was one of the largest takeovers in the industry’s history.• The deal values Celgene shares at $102.43 apiece, or a nearly 54 percent premium on the stock’s closing price on Wednesday.• The combined entity will produce nine drugs with annual sales of more than $1 billion each.• The WSJ points out some concerns with the acquisition: Bristol-Myers could take on more than $50 billion in debt. It will have to help Celgene, whose stock slumped nearly 40 percent last year, diversify its pipeline beyond Revlimid.A number of fund managers say that traders who use quantitative strategies to exploit market signals have made markets more chaotic and unpredictable. But Clifford Asness, the founder of AQR, one of the world’s biggest hedge fund groups, told the FT that investors who blame the recent market turmoil on quant strategies are “insane.”AQR suffered some of the worst losses in its 20-year history in 2018, and Mr. Asness said that critics were only trying to find excuses for their own poor performance. He pointed out that markets had always suffered bouts of turbulence even before quant strategies were introduced, and said there was little hard evidence that they were feeding volatility.Square hired Amrita Ahuja from Blizzard Entertainment to be its new CFO, replacing Sarah Friar.

Want this by email? Sign up here.Last year, the U.S. economy seemed solid. Skittishness in the stock and bond markets appeared at odds with signs of stability on the ground. But this week’s flow of distressing news, showing ever more evidence of slowing growth, suggests that the markets had cause for concern:• Apple reduced its revenue expectations for the first time in 16 years, citing weak iPhone sales in China.• Delta Air Lines said its fare revenue, although growing, would fall short of the company’s earlier forecast.• The American manufacturing sector slowed sharply last month, according to a closely watched index released yesterday.And things could get worse, especially amid trade tensions with China, as companies line up to report fourth-quarter results in the next few weeks. Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told CNN on yesterday:“There are a heck of a lot of U.S. companies that have a lot of sales in China that are basically going to be watching their earnings be downgraded next year until we get a deal with China.”More on markets: Forty-six percent of American companies issuing estimates for the fourth-quarter have revised their outlook lower, the most since President Trump’s inauguration. Traders are placing bets on whether the Fed will be forced to change course by a slowing economy and swooning stock market. Investors have piled into money market funds as a shelter from market turmoil. China will keep trying to attract bond investors, and a fresh campaign to promote its currency is expected. If all this news makes you want to flee, that’s understandable. It’s also a bad idea.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________The Labor Department will release its official hiring and unemployment figures for December at 8:30 a.m.What to expect: Economists anticipate a gain of about 180,000 jobs, a rise from 155,000 reported in November. Average hourly earnings are expected to tick up 0.3 percent in December from November and 3 percent from a year earlier. The unemployment rate is forecast to fall to 3.6 percent from 3.7 percent.What that means for the economy: Economists believe that fears of an imminent recession are overblown. The unemployment rate is near a 50-year low. Job openings have hit record highs, and a growing number of workers are quitting, a sign of confidence in the hiring outlook.The Fed’s outlook: An indication of the Fed’s views on rates could come this morning at 10:30, when the central bank chairman, Jerome H. Powell, is scheduled to answer questions at a panel discussion in Atlanta with his two immediate predecessors, Janet Yellen and Ben S. Bernanke.The world economy has relied for years on the shopping stamina of Chinese consumers. But that spending engine seems to be sputtering.Apple’s surprise announcement this week was just one indicator that Chinese shoppers are pulling back. Amid a tense trade war with the United States, a shaky job market and efforts by Beijing to rein in what one analyst called a decade-long “debt-fueled binge,” Chinese consumers are feeling less than confident. Property sales are down, as are auto and retail sales.The NYT’s Alexandra Stevenson, Li Yuan and Raymond Zhong write:“A significant pullback could have a big impact on a world looking for engines of growth, on companies that counted on China’s continuing expansion and on global investors who have long viewed Chinese consumers as a steady source of profits.”The Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, met today with the three largest commercial banks in the country and pushed for policies to help bolster the economy, including lower taxes and fees and more financing for small and private companies. Today, China’s central bank said that, by Jan. 25, it will scale back the amount of cash it requires lenders to hold in reserve by one percentage point.The tech giant’s problems are not limited to nervous Chinese consumers, according to the WSJ. Competitors in China, such as Huawei, are moving in on Apple’s smartphone market share. In India, a growth market, Apple is a minor player. Customers in the U.S. are keeping their phones longer.Tom Warren at The Verge had this take:“People are upgrading less, carrier subsidies aren’t enough, and $1,000 phones are making consumers pause and consider. Mix that in with fears of a recession, and 2019 could be challenging for Apple and many others.”The company may pull iPhones from its German stores after Qualcomm took steps yesterday to enforce a court order last month banning the sale of certain versions of the device. The order stems from a ruling that Apple infringed on the chip-maker’s patents involving power-saving technology.Apple’s woes were keenly felt yesterday by its third-largest shareholder, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway. Tumbling prices for Apple and airline stocks caused more than $4 billion in value to evaporate from Mr. Buffett’s stakes in the companies, according to the FT.The companies, both top sellers of cancer drugs with Bristol-Myers’s Opdivo and Celgene’s Revlimid, agreed to a cash-and-stock deal valued at roughly $74 billion. It was one of the largest takeovers in the industry’s history.• The deal values Celgene shares at $102.43 apiece, or a nearly 54 percent premium on the stock’s closing price on Wednesday.• The combined entity will produce nine drugs with annual sales of more than $1 billion each.• The WSJ points out some concerns with the acquisition: Bristol-Myers could take on more than $50 billion in debt. It will have to help Celgene, whose stock slumped nearly 40 percent last year, diversify its pipeline beyond Revlimid.A number of fund managers say that traders who use quantitative strategies to exploit market signals have made markets more chaotic and unpredictable. But Clifford Asness, the founder of AQR, one of the world’s biggest hedge fund groups, told the FT that investors who blame the recent market turmoil on quant strategies are “insane.”AQR suffered some of the worst losses in its 20-year history in 2018, and Mr. Asness said that critics were only trying to find excuses for their own poor performance. He pointed out that markets had always suffered bouts of turbulence even before quant strategies were introduced, and said there was little hard evidence that they were feeding volatility.Square hired Amrita Ahuja from Blizzard Entertainment to be its new CFO, replacing Sarah Friar.

By Kim SeversonWASHINGTON’S BIRTHPLACE, Va. — It was cold crouching down in this homemade goose blind on the edge of a frozen cornfield near the Potomac River.The early-morning January sun gave off considerably less heat than a light bulb. All we had to eat was a communal bag of venison jerky, a satsuma and, eventually, the hunk of dark chocolate I had kept hidden in my pocket until I felt too guilty.I had a million questions, but you’re not supposed to talk much when you’re waiting for geese. I had a shotgun, but I had never killed an animal. It didn’t matter because there were no geese, anyway.After about five hours, a small flock started to land in front of us. Someone yelled. “Take them!” Everyone except me stood and fired. Two Canada geese fell.A dog named Tug brought them to us, and we packed up and headed to the kitchen to cook what Wade Truong, the chef who invited me here to hunt, calls the rib-eye of the sky.Mr. Truong, 33, grew up working in his parents’ Vietnamese restaurant in Harrisonburg Va., He never thought about hunting until he dropped out of the University of Mary Washington and started cooking professionally. Like many young chefs, Mr. Truong decided that he wanted to get as close to his food as possible. So nine years ago, he picked up his first hunting rifle. He took a hunter’s safety class, studied an old Army sniper’s manual and headed into the woods, he said, “overgeared and underprepared.”After several tries, he managed to shoot his first deer. He was determined to field dress it himself. He studied images he pulled from Google, and pried a few tips out of some hunters. None of it prepared him for what the process was really like, especially how shockingly hot the inside of a deer can be.“It was a lot for a kid who grew up on meat that was on sale,” he said.His girlfriend, Rachel Owen, 29, didn’t grow up hunting, either. But like him, she loved fishing. The two, who got together when they worked at the same restaurant, talked about hunting on their first date.Now, eight years later, they have 30 guns between them. They keep an empty caviar jar in a drawer near their dining room table to collect any stray shot left in a duck breast. They blog.It’s the kind of modern love story you don’t hear about much. “I can’t imagine us as a couple without hunting,” she said. “It’s foundational.”They spend as much free time as they can fishing and hunting, with the express goal of trying to eat only protein that they kill. They haven’t bought meat in over a year, except pork fat and chicken wings. Sausage needs pork fat, Mr. Truong said, and “there really isn’t a substitute for chicken wings.”They are the face — or at least two faces — of a new generation of hunters.“If the hunting world wants to grow in America, it’s going to be up to the millennials,” Mr. Truong said. “It’s not just the blue blood upland hunters or rednecks with mudders and dogs. It’s us.”The number of hunters in the United States has been in a slow fall since 1982, when 16.7 million people had paid hunting licenses. By 2010, that had dropped to 14.4 million, according to United States Fish & Wildlife Service records. In the past few years, the figure has begun to climb, to 15.6 million in 2018. Still, only about 5 percent of Americans 16 or older hunt, half of the number who did 50 years ago. Supporters of the sport worry about what might happen if their beloved culture fades away.Hope, they say, might lie with a health-conscious, outdoors-loving slice of the millennial generation who were raised on grass-fed beef and nose-to-tail eating, but didn't grow up in hunting families, where taking game is about both tradition and filling the freezer.“Hipsters want to hunt. But they don’t want to hunt the way a rural farm boy from Illinois wants to hunt,” said Matt Dunfee, director of special programs at the Wildlife Management Institute, in an article last year about hunting’s decline in Outdoor Life. “They don’t want to dress the same way, they don’t like focusing on antlers, they don’t like taking pictures of their animals,” he told the magazine. “But they want local, sustainable, ecologically conscious meat. And within our efforts, there are few places to realize those values.”Steven Rinella, the outdoor writer and star of the Netflix series “MeatEater,” said interest in wild game is rising among people in their 20s and 30s.The show, his popular podcast and his books, including his newest — “The MeatEater Fish and Game Cookbook” — are aimed in part at young hunters who want to field dress their own game and move beyond dishes like venison chili and duck-breast poppers stuffed with jalapeño and cream cheese.“For a long time, there just hasn’t been an intermediate between what a chef knows and what a deer hunter in Wisconsin knows,” he said.Mr. Rinella’s books, along with titles like “Duck, Duck Goose” and “Buck, Buck Moose” from Hank Shaw, the former restaurant cook and writer who champions wild food in modern cooking, are prominent on the bookshelves in the home that Mr. Truong and Ms. Owen rent.“One of the big drives for me is trying to make everything we pursue exceptional,” Mr. Truong said. “It shouldn’t be, ‘I ground this up to make a burger with Cajun seasoning all over it.’ ”Becoming a hunter had never been on Mr. Truong’s radar. His parents grew up in the city then called Saigon. They met in a refugee camp in Indonesia. With the help of a Mennonite family who sponsored them, they settled in Virginia and opened the Saigon Café in Harrisonburg. It was the only Vietnamese restaurant in town.“I basically grew up there,” Mr. Truong said. “You go to an Asian restaurant, and there’s a kid in the back doing his homework. That was me.” (His parents, who have since divorced, sold the restaurant about six years ago.)As a teenager more interested in partying than school, he didn’t always get along with his father. But their fishing trips together were a bright spot, and cemented Mr. Truong’s love of the outdoors. Unlike many fathers in this part of Virginia, Mr. Truong’s never taught him to hunt. He had fought alongside Green Berets during the Vietnam War and had no interest in picking up another gun. But to the son, hunting seemed like the next logical step — especially as his cooking career took off.He started with deer. Waterfowl came a few years later, after Mr. Truong became the executive chef at Kybecca, in Fredericksburg, a city of about 28,000 that serves both as a tourist town for history buffs and a commuter town for people working in Quantico or Arlington.It was a French-fries-and-bison-sliders kind of place, but Mr. Truong slowly started to change the menu, adding Chesapeake Bay oysters and sophisticated entrees that used vegetables from local farms. One of his suppliers was Blenheim Organic Gardens, run by Rebecca and Lawrence Latané, who is a descendant of George Washington’s family. They live on about 200 acres of farmland that has been in the Washington family for centuries.Geese migrating to and from the Ungava Peninsula in far northern Quebec  like to winter over in the Latanés’ grain fields. That makes for good hunting. One day, the couple’s son, Cameron Latané, invited Mr. Truong and Ms. Owen to join him and his father on a goose hunt. They have been close friends and hunting partners ever since.Although Mr. Truong says he prefers cooking duck, he has come to see Canada geese as the workhorse of his kitchen. Some goose hunters contend that other, more tender game birds, like the specklebelly goose or the sandhill crane, are the true rib-eyes of the sky. But the dark, rich meat from a migrating Canada goose is reliable and delicious, Mr. Truong said. He can thaw frozen breasts as fast as chicken and sauté them for an easy weeknight supper.Mr. Truong braises goose legs barbacoa-style for tacos, and simmers carcasses into stock for pho styled after his mother’s, though he tops his with lightly charred goose breast, venison braised in hoisin sauce or thin slices of goose heart.He has botched some dishes, too. He roasted the ribs from his first deer, and they were terrible. Now he braises venison ribs for hours to get rid of the chalky, sticky taste.Then there was the time he tried to prepare mergansers. These ducks eat fish, and their flesh can take on a funky, marine flavor. He tried to make a wild-game version of the Vietnamese dish ca kho in which the breasts were braised in a caramelized sauce.“It tasted like I burned a can of anchovies and added fish sauce,” Mr. Truong said.He has since become a much better game cook. He is close to perfecting beaver-tail lardo, which he set out in thin slices on a charcuterie board alongside venison pastrami and a few types of sausages when we got to the Latanés’ farmhouse kitchen after our hunt.A Peking goose was roasting in the oven. Three days earlier, Mr. Truong had inflated the skin with an air compressor, stuffed it with paste made from five-spice powder, ginger, garlic and chiles bound with some hoisin sauce, and then glazed it before leaving it to dry in the refrigerator.On the stove, a pair of goosenecks stuffed with maple-scented venison breakfast sausage fried softly in a cast-iron pan, the heads still attached. “That’s pretty metal,” he said.As we sat down to eat, Ms. Owen talked about the negative response they sometimes get from other millennials who either don’t like hunting or won’t eat game. “Why is it weird that we eat wild meat?” said Ms. Owen, who doesn’t have hunters on either side of her family. “It’s the most human thing to do. I feel like if you’re going to eat meat at all, you have to be comfortable with hunting.”They also have to deal with reactions from hunters who are older or more conservative than they are. “People make a lot of assumptions about our politics and our value system,” she said.They drew more than a few odd looks when they went elk hunting in Kentucky last year. Ms. Owen had the permit, and Mr. Truong went along as a guide.“We’re an unmarried, interracial couple where the woman had the tag,” she said. “They didn’t know what to make of us.”As we made our way through the meal, Mr. Truong turned philosophical. “Taking an animal you intend to eat has so much more meaning than buying a steak on a plastic tray,” he said. “It should never be a small thing.”He pointed to his plate. Everything, from the slices of goose to the wild oyster mushrooms — even the cornbread made from a Native American variety called bloody butcher that the Latanés grow — spoke of wildness and a rhythm of life that the couple is only beginning to understand.“You make a conscious decision to end a life with the intention of eating it,” Mr. Truong said. “That’s actually participating in the food chain. It’s emotional. It’s about as far from Uber Eats as you can get.”Recipes: Goose Pho | Goose BarbacoaFollow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.

By Tina RosenbergMs. Rosenberg is a co-founder of the Solutions Journalism Network, which supports rigorous reporting about responses to social problems.First of two articles.The recent partial government shutdown could have been a disaster for the 38 million Americans who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps.But the United States Department of Agriculture, which runs SNAP, saved the day. Along with their usual January benefits, SNAP’s users received an extra payment on Jan. 20 — the one they were supposed to get in February.This outcome was a product of heroic bureaucratic wrangling on the part of the Agriculture Department and the states, which administer SNAP. It saved millions of people from a month of severe hunger.But the early money has a downside. “If I’ve got five bucks extra, my pocket wants to burn it,” said Katie Stoneman, a 31-year-old divorced mother who lives in the countryside near Elsie, Mich. “It’s human nature to see a large number and be more inclined to spend that,” said Jeff Kaiser, the chief operating officer of Propel, which makes an app called Fresh EBT to help people manage their SNAP benefits.Ms. Stoneman has children ages 5 and 9, and for the last three years has received SNAP even while working in a pontoon boat factory. “It didn’t pay enough to get me off of SNAP,” she said. “Not even close.”SNAP pays $192 a month for her family (about $2 per person per day), and she usually makes it last three weeks, she said — longer than many people. A study by Duke University’s Common Cents Lab, which applies behavioral science to the problems of low-income people, found that 80 percent of benefits get spent in the first nine days. “When you give people $10 and they really need $15, there’s only so much coping and budgeting they can do,” said Ellen Vollinger, legal director of the Food Research & Action Center, a nonprofit that addresses poverty-related hunger.Bad things happen when SNAP money runs out. Families eat less in the fourth week of the SNAP cycle. The food they eat is not as healthy. Children’s test scores suffer. Emergency room admissions for high blood pressure increase.Worse, 13 million people who are eligible for SNAP benefits don’t get them. Half of all applications started aren’t finished. It could be that the forms — 30 pages or more — can overwhelm candidates. Or people simply forget to submit documents or schedule an interview.Goods and services aimed at low-income people, who have very little clout when they complain, are known for indifferent customer service (a long-distance bus, for example). Dealing with the government can be even worse, because it is a monopoly provider with little incentive to do better.The problem may be more than government indifference, said Josh Wright, executive director of Ideas42, which uses behavioral science to study and design public policies. “Some states — let’s be realistic: They don’t want it to be easier,” he said.Signing up for SNAP, getting a shelter bed, going to housing court or getting out of jail after an arrest can involve considerable amounts of frustration, confusion and disrespect. And it’s often said that being poor is expensive. Late fees, money-transfer fees, check-cashing fees, exorbitant interest, reconnection fees and overdraft fees all add up to poor people spending proportionally more on financial services than wealthier people.Technology can provide solutions to obstacles:Systems don’t take human nature into account.The early SNAP payment did, in fact, set off a flood of early spending. Communications about the early payment weren’t very good; many beneficiaries might have thought that the money was extra, or that their benefits card wouldn’t work in February. Mr. Kaiser gave an example from Vermont, which normally deposits benefits on the first of the month: The average balance on Feb. 3 was $88, compared with $145 on Jan. 3.But not for Ms. Stoneman. She was relieved when she learned February benefits were coming, despite the shutdown. But she knew she had to be careful. “I might go too far on buying groceries and not be able to be prepared for next month,” she said. “My kids have birthdays next month, and I want to be able to make a cake.”Then Ms. Stoneman got a message on her Fresh EBT app: “Want help budgeting your February benefits? Hide some of your benefits from your balance to help you budget. You can still spend your full amount any time.”She eagerly signed up. “I knew I needed to set this aside and not spend it,” she said.Others didn’t manage it. Mr. Kaiser said that a third of Fresh EBT users’ benefits had already been spent by Feb 1. (He said the company doesn't know yet whether the "hide my benefits" tool helped.) In mid-January, he said, Propel went to Full Cart, which ships free meal kits as a part of the organization Feeding Children Everywhere, offering to raise the money to pay for at least half a million meals for the end of February. They have so far raised a quarter of the needed funds, he said.In normal months, most people with Fresh EBT use it to check their balance. Before the app, they had to buy something, creating what Mr. Kaiser calls the “balance banana.” Or they had to call an 800 number. “That took 10 or 15 minutes,” Ms. Stoneman said. “The app is better. I’m on it every day.”As it did with hiding benefits, Fresh EBT uses behavioral science in other ways. The Common Cents Lab compared two ways Fresh EBT shows people their balances. Half saw only their normal whole-month balance, while the other half also saw a “recommended weekly budget” equal to a quarter of the monthly sum. That worked. People made their monthly benefits last for six extra meals.We are stressed and forget things.Here’s an absurdly cost-effective way that technology can keep people out of jail. In New York City, 41 percent of people given a ticket for a violation like littering or public drinking fail to appear at their court hearing.They’re not skipping town. They fail to appear because they can’t take off work, or they just forget. So Ideas42 and the University of Chicago Crime Lab studied two simple solutions. First, they redesigned a summons form that had been truly incomprehensible. Now “Show up in court” with the date, and “To avoid a warrant for your arrest, you must show up to court” are in bold letters near the top. (Duh!) That simple change reduced no-shows to 36 percent.Then they tried various text message reminders. The most effective was: “Helpful reminder: go to court Mon Jun 03 9:30AM. We’ll text to help you remember. Show up to avoid an arrest warrant.” That reduced no-shows to 26 percent — at less than a penny per text.Common Cents Lab, along with the Benefits Data Trust and Robin Hood, New York City’s largest antipoverty organization, tried a similar experiment with SNAP recertification. They texted people reminders about deadlines, necessary documents and where to get help. That improved recertification rates by 5.5 percentage points.There are many such email or text reminder programs. Mr. Wright said these are relatively easy to test and many have rigorous evidence of success. And these organizing nudges matter. “If you’re high income, you’re likely to have one paycheck,” said Mariel Beasley, a co-director of Common Cents Lab. “Low- and moderate-income households are often balancing benefits, multiple part-time jobs, child support and money from friends and family, all coming in at different times.”In addition, new research shows that living with scarcity imposes a tax on our attention span equivalent to going a night without sleep. “If you didn’t sleep, how do you remember all the things you need to do?” said Ms. Beasley. “Tech is a way that allows low-cost organization in our lives.”Complexity tilts the playing field.Faced with a 30-page form in bureaucratese, many people would never even get started. But software can ask people questions in plain language and fill in the forms automatically. This is the idea behind online legal forms: Ordinary people can create forms so they can represent themselves, even if they don’t understand the law.We don’t even sign up.In 2016, Code for America introduced an app called Clear My Record, which makes it much easier for people to expunge criminal convictions, which can be a lifelong burden. But people with convictions still had to learn about the service, fill out forms, talk to lawyers and wait. About 8,000 people have used it in the California counties where it works.But why even make people apply? Last year, Code for America began a trial of an automatic version: Governments link the app with their criminal records data. It checks for eligible convictions, fills out forms and sends them to the court for expungement. San Francisco is now trying it to clear marijuana convictions.The financial system exploits us.Millions of Americans take out payday loans. The average user takes eight loans of $375 each year, paying $520 in interest.Payday loans often get people through unexpected crises when their car breaks down or someone is sick. But at that average frequency, many people must also be covering rent and groceries, and using some of the loans to cover other loans.As abusive as they are, payday loans exist because people need them. Part of the problem is the very concept of payday, which is essentially a short-term loan from worker to employer. If you work today, what you earn should be yours today.Technology can help overcome some of these obstacles. Now employees can borrow from themselves — instantly, in many cases. Apps like Even, PayActiv and DailyPay allow workers to get access to pay they’ve earned, but haven’t received yet. Some apps charge a few dollars per month or per transaction. At least one app, Earnin, asks you to pay whatever you think is right.Many apps help with budgeting in other ways. Earnin will automatically send money to your bank account when you’re in danger of an overdraft. The Even app identifies recurring bills and sets aside money from your paycheck to cover them. The “Okay to Spend” feature then tells you how much you have left over. Even can also automatically put money into savings.Employees can use some of these apps on their own, but employers also offer them; Uber, Lyft and Walmart, for example, offer instant pay. These apps reduce employee turnover. And when employees aren’t stressing about bills, they can focus on their jobs.Of course, employers could also accomplish these things by raising wages. “Technology is not a substitute for good public policy,” said Ms. Vollinger, of the food research group.Still, technology aimed at low-income people can make their lives much easier. It’s a shame, then, that there’s so little of it. Next week, I’ll look at the numerous obstacles to creating tech that focuses on social impact, and how those difficulties can be overcome.

Want this by email? Sign up here.It went viral. Wilbur Ross, the commerce secretary, told Andrew on CNBC that he didn’t quite understand why unpaid workers, some of them now turning to Uber and Lyft for income after missing their second paycheck, were visiting food banks. They should just borrow some money, he said:There really is not a good excuse why there should be a liquidity crisis. Now, true, the people might have to pay a little bit of interest. But the idea that it’s paycheck or zero is not a really valid idea.The comments reflect a “ ‘let them eat cake’ kind of attitude,” said Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has emerged as a powerful opponent to President Trump.Federal workers, many of them wary of taking on more debt, might also struggle to access credit. The credit union affiliated with Mr. Ross’s department advertises a shutdown loan with a rate higher than some other commercially available loans.As the shutdown drags on, lawmakers are scrambling to find a compromise after two proposals to reopen the government fell flat in the Republican-controlled Senate. Mr. Trump’s plan, which included funding for a border wall, garnered less support than the Democrats’ recommendation, which omitted the wall.The strain intensifies: • Low- and middle-income home buyers in rural areas are left in the lurch without an affordable mortgage option offered by the Agriculture Department.• Tyson Foods donated 685,000 meals to federal workers.• The shutdown threatens to taint the appeal of public service, which “will make it harder to recruit and hold onto the experienced and talented,” Campbell Robertson writes.• Patent handling may have to cease in mid-February.• James Gorman, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley, said a prolonged shutdown would “have an extremely damaging effect.” Economists from J.P. Morgan said that, already, the stalemate had taken a toll on the U.S. economy.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in Davos, Switzerland; Stephen Grocer in New York; and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________The mood at the World Economic Forum in the Swiss resort is “subdued, cautious and apprehensive,” a reflection of the broader outlook, Fareed Zakaria writes in the Washington Post:There is no great global political crisis, yet people speak in worried tones about the state of democracy, open societies and the international order.The reason: Mr. Zakaria points to a noticeable absence of leadership from defenders of democracy. President Trump scrapped plans to attend to focus on domestic problems, as did Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain and President Emmanuel Macron of France.The worry: The leaders of smaller countries described the world as lacking a collective purpose, he writes. Many yearn for a greater U.S. presence on the global stage, but with nobody shoring up the international system, will it weaken and eventually crumble?The warnings: Michael Sabia, who runs the $270 billion Canadian pension fund Caisse de Dépôt et Placement du Québec, complained that capitalists had forgotten their purpose as backers of corporate investment. “Too many equity investors are tourists; they’re not interested in building a business,” he said. And in a provocative speech, the billionaire philanthropist George Soros criticized President Xi Jinping, saying that China’s technological advancements made Mr. Xi a “dangerous opponent of open societies.”Complacency toward the trade tensions between the U.S. and China are misplaced, according to the Economist, because the rift is compounding a gradual shift in the world economy. Globalization, so the argument goes, has given way to a new era of sluggishness, or “slowbalization.”The back story: In the golden age of globalization, from about 1990 to 2010, commerce soared as the cost of transporting goods fell, tariffs were cut and the financial system became liberalized.The shift: Trade is suffering, and companies are changing their long-term investment plans. “Slowbalization” is expected to lead to stronger ties to regional blocs as supply chains seek sources closer to home.Why it matters: Emerging countries will struggle to trade their way to riches. Climate change, migration and tax-dodging will be even harder to solve without global cooperation.The effect is being felt around the world:• Germany’s industrial slump worsened at the start of 2019, casting a cloud over the eurozone economy.• Norway’s central bank said it was prepared to raise interest rates as soon as March, but warned of “considerable uncertainty” as it moves to wind down its stimulus plan.• Starbucks put its recent sales slump behind it, beating analyst estimates in crucial regions, but the company’s growth in China is at a crawl.The utility was cleared of responsibility in the 2017 blaze that chewed through a wide swath of Northern California, leading some to question whether the company should move ahead with its plans to file for bankruptcy by the end of the month.The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said that private electrical equipment in a home caused the Tubbs Fire in Sonoma County, which killed 22 people and destroyed more than 5,600 buildings. PG&E’s stock, which has plunged dramatically in recent months, surged 75 percent after the news on Thursday.But the company is still facing billions of dollars of potential liabilities. State officials blame PG&E equipment for at least 17 of 21 major wildfires in 2017.Bankruptcy, however, may not be the best course of action, according to many investors and analysts who say that PG&E has plenty of assets it could leverage against claims.From high above the Earth, a brigade of satellites can track the number of cars parked outside Sears stores, identify illegal logging operations, sense activity from cellular towers and snap infrared images of factories in Guangdong, China.Nowadays, it’s not only superpower governments that can gain access to the trove of information. Start-ups working with human rights groups and businesses looking for a competitive edge are moving rapidly into high-altitude surveillance, Cade Metz writes.Satellites have become cheaper to build, launch and operate, with 2,220 Earth observation units expected to head into orbit over the next decade, compared with about 730 satellites launched in the past decade.Though some say that spying from the sky is a “narrow niche,” Mark Johnson, the chief executive of the start-up Descartes Labs, said the development could have major ramifications.“Businesses will not be able to hide from competitors or regulators or watchdogs,” he said. “They need to realize that their traditional competitive advantage — information — will be available to everyone.”David Giordano will become BlackRock’s global head of renewable power, replacing Jim Barry, who will remain global head of real assets.

(Want this by email?

Prosecutors say that Mr. Singer advised the financier to claim that his son had learning disabilities, and that Mr. McGlashan paid $50,000 to Mr. Singer’s charity.TPG said it fired him for cause yesterday. “We believe the behavior described to be inexcusable and antithetical to the values of our entire organization,” the firm said in a statement.TPG told employees and partners that it learned about the accusations against Mr. McGlashan only after prosecutors unsealed their case, according to an internal note reviewed by DealBook.But Mr. McGlashan said that he had already resigned. “I am deeply sorry this very difficult situation may interfere with the work to which I have devoted my life,” he wrote in a note.Emails between Mr. McGlashan and top TPG executives, provided by his spokesman, appear to confirm that. Mr. McGlashan emailed his resignation at 1:02 p.m. yesterday, according to the correspondence. At 2:03 p.m., Jon Winkelried, one of TPG’s co-C.E.O.s, replied, acknowledging receipt of the resignation — but he also included a notice of termination.At 2:20 p.m., Mr. McGlashan responded, “I am perplexed by your attempt to terminate me because, as you acknowledged in your email, you had already received my resignation.”It’s unclear what is at stake financially for Mr. McGlashan in terms of his TPG severance. In his email, Mr. Winkelried wrote to Mr. McGlashan, “We will be in touch to advise you of the economic consequences of the termination of your employment.”A spokesman for TPG declined to comment on the emails.More: The man who tipped off authorities to the college admissions scandal was reportedly a financier who was being investigated in a securities fraud case. And here’s a reminder why paying bribes to get your child into college is a federal crime.Last week, Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would pivot toward privacy. With two of the company’s top executives leaving just days later, it appears the change has had an immediate impact.The two executives — Chris Cox, Facebook’s chief product officer, who is widely regarded as the company’s No. 3, and Chris Daniels, the head of WhatsApp — announced yesterday that they were to leave the company. Their departure comes “after disagreements with Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, over the social network’s future direction,” according to Mike Isaac of the NYT.“The differences stemmed from Mr. Zuckerberg’s asserting control over his company and its apps — Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger — by rolling out a plan to integrate the services into a single privacy-focused platform, according to six people involved in the situation,” he adds.Several executives at Facebook feared that knitting together the apps could take a toll on the popularity and growth of their individual products, according to Mr. Isaac. They were also reportedly worried that they could lose autonomy and power. Traces of those sentiments could be seen in a public statement issued by Mr. Cox.“Facebook has become Zuckerberg’s company now more than ever,” Shira Ovide of Bloomberg Opinion writes. “Whether that’s good for the company or for the company’s billions of users — we’ll see.”In the wake of two fatal crashes within five months that involved its 737 Max airplanes, the company is reeling.Boeing will suspend delivery of its 737 Max jets, it announced yesterday, but continue to produce them. It currently builds 52 aircraft a month, many of which are Max models, and entirely shutting down production would prove costly.But the policy may only last so long. Boeing’s production facility in Renton, Wash., has only limited capacity for storing the airplanes, according to the WSJ. Boeing may, however, be able to apply for special permits to fly the planes to other storage sites, according to Reuters.Meanwhile, big questions hang over the Max’s software. Pilots from Southwest Airlines and American Airlines requested software updates for some of the 737 Max’s automated systems last year, reports the NYT. They were promised updates within six weeks, one pilot said, but they have still not arrived. Similarities between the two recent crashes point to potential problems with the automated system that requires the update.And the U.S. Air Force has also lost trust in Boeing. In a case unrelated to the Max debacle, Air Force officials said that quality control issues with a new aerial refueling tanker caused it to suspend deliveries in February.British lawmakers yesterday voted to postpone the country’s departure from the E.U., but narrowly failed to wrest control of the Brexit process from Prime Minister Theresa May’s government, write Ellen Barry and Stephen Castle of the NYT.“Mrs. May fended off — by just two votes — a remarkable power grab by lawmakers frustrated at months of political deadlock that has left the country in limbo with just 15 days to go before its scheduled departure from the bloc. They later voted by 412 to 202 for a motion that means that Britain will almost certainly not leave the E.U. as scheduled on March 29.”“What remains unclear now is how long the delay will be. Mrs. May plans to hold a third vote on her unpopular plan for withdrawal, despite have suffered two staggering defeats on it already. If the prime minister should succeed in a third attempt, she would then request a short delay — no more than three months — from E.U. leaders.”“But the motion noted that should her plan go down to defeat once again, Mrs. May might have to ask European leaders for a much longer delay, with unknown consequences.”More: Brexit’s importance to the global economy may have been overstated.Tulane’s Corporate Law Institute, a conference held every spring in New Orleans, is where the mergers-and-acquisitions world gathers to talk shop. Usually, it’s about how good business is — but a sense of unease has intruded this year’s festivities, Michael de la Merced of DealBook reports.Bankers and lawyers should be celebrating. Last year’s $4.2 trillion in global announced deals was the third-best year ever, according to Citigroup. Nearly every industry enjoyed a rise in deal-making.And M. & A. should keep rolling on. Mark Shafir, the co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Citigroup, and others at the conference noted that takeover financing remains cheap, shareholders seem to support sensible deals and shareholder activists are continuing to push companies into transactions.But “there is no doubt that we are in a much less bullish environment for M. & A. than a year ago,” Mr. Shafir said. Among the pressures on deal-making:• There are fears about a potential recession, the ongoing trade wars and the persistent worry that the stock market will suffer like it did late last year.• Regulators are a big issue too, especially the concern that they could be used as political cudgels. One of the big topics at the conference was the growing importance of overseers like Cfius, the American government panel that reviews cross-border deals for national security concerns.• And then there’s the natural cycle of deal-making. Booms tend to be followed by big drops in volumes, and this cycle has gone on longer than most, Mr. Shafir said.The Connecticut Supreme Court cleared the way for a lawsuit against the companies that manufactured and sold the semiautomatic rifle used in the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, Rick Rojas and Kristin Hussey of the NYT report.The ruling allows a case, brought by victims’ families, to go around the immunity that Congress granted gun companies to shield them from litigation when their weapons are used in a crime. That leaves open the potential for Remington, which made the rifle used in the attack, to be held liable.Lawyers for the families argued that advertising campaigns for guns appeared to be “courting” troubled young men, like Adam Lanza, who carried out the Sandy Hook shooting. In a 4-3 ruling, justices “found that the sweeping federal protections did not prevent the families from bringing a lawsuit based on wrongful marketing claims,” Mr. Rojas and Ms. Hussey write.“The decision represents a significant development in the long-running battle between gun control advocates and the gun lobby,” Mr. Rojas and Ms. Hussey add. And it could chart a “possible legal road map for victims’ relatives and survivors from other mass shootings.”President Trump appears to have reeled in his claim on Wednesday of being “not in a rush whatsoever” to reach a trade deal with China.“We’ll have news on China. Probably one way or the other, we’re going to know over the next three to four weeks,” Mr. Trump told reporters yesterday, according to CNBC. He added that China had been “very responsible and very reasonable.”Such optimism may have been helped along by the news that China made “last-minute changes to a proposed foreign-investment law,” in an attempt to “address U.S. complaints about forced technology transfer,” according to the WSJ. Intellectual property concerns have been a major part of the trade dispute between America and China.But a final agreement is still some way off.  Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said yesterday that a proposed meeting between Mr. Trump and President Xi Jinping of China won’t happen this month because there is still more work to do. Sources tell Bloomberg it could happen in April.Elon Musk last night unveiled a new seven-seat compact sport-utility vehicle called the Model Y, Neal E. Boudette and Raymond Zhong of the NYT write:• “The Model Y will be available beginning next year, the company said, at prices ranging from $39,000 to $60,000, depending on the model, with a $2,500 deposit.”• “A long-range version will be able to drive 300 miles on a single charge, it said, while the $60,000 Performance model will have a top speed of 150 miles per hour.”• “‘It has the functionality of an S.U.V., but it will ride like a sports car,’ Mr. Musk said. ‘This thing will be really tight in corners.’”The unveiling “comes as Tesla confronts sales challenges,” Mr. Boudette and Mr. Zhong write. Sales of the Model S and Model X have been flattening, and its push to sell the Model 3 for $35,000 remains shrouded in uncertainty as the company works out how to cut costs to make that pricing possible.Andrew Weissmann, one of Robert Mueller’s top deputies, is said to be leaving the special counsel’s office.Lee Fixel, a partner at Tiger Global Management, is leaving the hedge fund in June.The meat-substitute start-up Impossible Foods hired Dennis Woodside, who was Dropbox’s C.O.O., as its president.Tesla named Vaibhav Taneja as its new chief accounting officer.Goldman Sachs plans to cut 65 jobs because of “economic” factors.Deals• Uber reportedly plans to publicly disclose its I.P.O. prospectus in April.

Tras la juramentación simbólica de Juan Guaidó como presidente encargado y su intento de conseguir el apoyo de las fuerzas armadas, el ministro de Defensa, Vladimir Padrino, declaró ayer su lealtad a Maduro y calificó de golpe de Estado el plan de la oposición.Rusia, uno de los principales inversores y aliados internacionales de Venezuela, lanzó una advertencia a Estados Unidos para que no interviniera en el país y Vladimir Putin se comunicó por teléfono con Nicolás Maduro para expresarle su apoyo.Un diplomático estadounidense aseguró que la Embajada de su país había empezado a evacuar a parte del personal diplomático y a sus familiares. Estados Unidos, principal comprador de las exploraciones de crudo de Venezuela —importa medio millón de barriles al día—, pidió al Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU una reunión para discutir la crisis en ese país y ha anunciado un plan de ayuda de 20 millones de dólares para el proyecto de Guaidó.• Juicio al Chapo: historias de escapes y de violencia. Las espectaculares fugas de prisión de Joaquín Guzmán Loera son conocidas, pero un detalle recién revelado durante el juicio es que, según un testigo, Emma Coronel, la esposa del narco, tuvo un papel protagónico en la planeación de cada uno de los escapes. Coronel, de 29 años, ha acudido a la corte con frecuencia y, un día de esta semana, vistió una chaqueta de terciopelo idéntica a la que llevaba su esposo “en lo que parecía ser un desaire simbólico hacia la amante del capo, quien, vestida en traje de prisión, ocupaba el estrado de los testigos que declaraban en su contra”, escribió Alan Feuer, reportero de The New York Times.Ayer, otro testigo —un exmilitar que fue guardaespaldas de Guzmán Loera— narró con detalle durante más de tres horas distintos episodios de tortura y asesinatos en los que el capo habría participado. Fue la primera vez que el juez admitió que se narraran hechos de violencia explícitos. Los testimonios terminarán la próxima semana y se anticipa que el Chapo declare en su defensa.• Alberto Fujimori volvió a prisión. El exdictador del Perú estuvo internado cuatro meses en una clínica a la que ingresó poco después de que el Poder Judicial anulara un indulto humanitario que le había concedido el expresidente Pedro Pablo Kuczynski en diciembre de 2017. Fujimori, de 80 años, ha cumplido hasta ahora diez años de una condena de veinticinco por casos de violación a los derechos humanos durante su mandato. Su hija, Keiko, lideresa del partido Fuerza Popular, también se encuentra en prisión desde octubre.“Los flujos humanos continuarán mientras las democracias en los países del Istmo Centroamericano sigan desprestigiándose, ya sea por la corrupción, el autoritarismo y la falta de escrúpulos de sus líderes o por la ilegitimidad y la ingobernabilidad cada vez mayores de los sistemas políticos que resultan de elecciones fraudulentas”.El expresidente de Costa Rica Luis Guillermo Solís Rivera sostiene en un artículo de opinión que Centroamérica necesita nuevos liderazgos, prosperidad y tiempo para salir del laberinto en que parece encontrarse.Adiós al señor de los gatitos. Ha muerto Walter Chandoha, un fotógrafo a quien podríamos considerar el precursor de los virales de mininos. Después de fotografiar a un gatito que rescató de la nieve un día de invierno y lograr que un diario publicara las imágenes, Chandoha abandonó su trabajo en una agencia publicitaria y se dedicó durante más de setenta años a retratar gatos.Chandoha recomendaba fotografiar animales colocándose a la altura de la vista de ellos y pedir ayuda a otra persona para detenerlos. Lo ayudaba su esposa, Maria, que los sujetaba mientras él se dedicaba a maullar, ladrar, resoplar y hacer todo tipo de ruidos. Cuando ella sentía que los gatos se estaban relajando y él le daba la señal, los soltaba y él tomaba la foto. Chandoha decía que le gustaba hacer fotos de mascotas porque “su atractivo es universal”.Al momento de su muerte había tomado alrededor de 90.000 fotos de felinos, “casi todas antes de que los gatos se convirtieran en los favoritos virales de las redes sociales”, decía su obituario; en este video puedes verlo dando algunos consejos [en inglés].• Macedonia se cambia de nombre y en Grecia protestan. Se espera que el parlamento griego reconozca el nuevo nombre oficial de su país vecino (República de Macedonia del Norte) y con ello ponga fin a una disputa de veintisiete años que había mantenido a la antigua república yugoslava de Macedonia fuera de la OTAN. Algunos sectores en Grecia se oponen al reconocimiento porque dicen que atenta contra el legado histórico de la región griega de Macedonia y allana el camino para un reclamo territorial [en inglés].• Taxistas españoles en huelga. Los conductores en Madrid y Barcelona llevan toda la semana en paro. Protestan en parte por el auge de empresas de contratación de automóviles como Uber y Cabify pero, según observó Raphael Minder, los chalecos amarillos que algunos visten en las manifestaciones —como los que llevan en Francia los ciudadanos que exigen mejores salarios y menos impuestos— sugieren que el descontento de los taxistas en España es más profundo.• La justicia alcanza a más exmandatarios. En Escocia el ex primer ministro Alex Salmond fue arrestado y acusado de dos intentos de violación, nueve instancias de agresión sexual, dos de abuso sexual y de perturbar el orden público. Por otra parte, el expresidente ucraniano Víktor Yanukóvych —exiliado en Rusia desde 2014— fue juzgado ayer en ausencia y declarado culpable de traición a la patria [en inglés].• En Davos, un llamado a hablar sobre la salud mental. Durante las reuniones del Foro Económico Mundial, el príncipe Guillermo de Inglaterra, quien ya antes ha hablado sobre su sufrimiento emocional, hizo un llamado a quitarles el estigma a los trastornos de salud mental: “A todos nos avergüenzan las emociones. A los británicos en particular, nos avergüenza revelar nuestras emociones”.En 2017 Gran Bretaña lanzó un servicio gratuito de terapia psicológica que hoy corre el riesgo de perder financiamiento ante los recortes del gobierno. En 2018 Theresa May creó un ministerio para encargarse de la soledad, un problema que afecta a más de nueve millones de personas en Gran Bretaña. En este artículo analizamos los desafíos de la medicina para entender mejor los trastornos de salud mental.• Las relaciones amorosas son complicadas y caóticas por sí solas. Si agregamos un animal a la ecuación, el resultado es tan impredecible como nuestros compañeros de cuatro patas. A veces un perro ayuda a salvar una relación.Para Mark Mayer, tener que aprender a cuidar a la coneja de su novia —que le resultaba antipática— fue un modo de aprender algo sobre el amor y la resiliencia.Y a Hannah Louise Poston, adoptar un gato en contra de su voluntad le enseñó a sobrellevar la depresión de su pareja. Ella describe así el momento en que lo vio interactuar con el gato por primera vez: “Vi sus ojos verdes y traviesos que miraban los suyos, tristes y hermosos; parecía que había fuegos artificiales y unicornios que saltaban junto a la aurora boreal que aparecía entre los dos”.Tres razones peludas para darle una oportunidad al amor... o por lo menos a una mascota nueva.Aquí puedes leer más historias de Modern Love.Para el fin de semana te recomendamos:• Las imágenes del eclipse lunar del domingo pasado son sorprendentes.

So look beyond downtown, enjoy the diversity and don’t forget breakfast.By Kim SeversonATLANTA — In 2000, the last time this city hosted the Super Bowl, the St. Louis Rams beat the Tennessee Titans, and Watershed had been frying its famous fried chicken in lard and sweet butter flavored with country ham for only a year.The new Southern food movement that the restaurant in nearby Decatur helped define had not yet moved North. Brooklynites weren’t worshiping biscuits, and American barbecue had not met kimchi. Only a few cooks or writers outside the South were giving serious thought to the connection between Southern food and that of West Africa.Even here, in the booming cultural and commercial center of the American South, diners had only begun to embrace a style of cooking that emphasized seasonality and history over carbohydrates and caricature. Atlanta’s most popular restaurants were local chains dipped in the glitzy, corporate sheen of the Buckhead neighborhood, and high-end steakhouses like Ruth’s Chris and Morton’s were abundant.Now, as the city prepares to show off its new $1.5 billion Mercedes-Benz Stadium on Sunday, when the New England Patriots meet the Los Angeles Rams, Atlanta is a more evolved food town than it was then.Neighborhood beer bars and slick suburban dining rooms alike serve food that shows off Southern agriculture. Food from the region’s vast immigrant population is as celebrated as its local classics.Although diners remain loyal to local entrepreneurs like Fifth Group Restaurants, which started opening reliable spots like South City Kitchen in the 1990s, the city is less impressed by carpetbagging chains. And the ranks of talented young cooks tired of trying to compete in bigger cities continue to grow.Still, Atlanta has yet to find its footing among the nation’s great restaurant cities. Wyatt Williams, who recently quit reviewing restaurants for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, wrote in a parting column this month in Atlanta magazine that the dining scene was in a rut, riding an economic boom that has spawned cynical, money-grabbing restaurants “where the rooms are finely appointed, the menus are deeply predictable, and the cooking is barely passable.”Stephen Satterfield, a former sommelier in San Francisco who founded the food magazine Whetstone, grew up in Atlanta. During a recent trip home, he described Atlanta as an insecure food town, obsessed with how it measures up against cities with outsize culinary reputations.“It pains me to say it, but here everyone is well-intentioned and there is plenty of capital and resources, so I don’t understand why there aren’t more places that feel of the moment,” he said.Plenty of Atlanta chefs and diners would disagree, albeit politely. The trick, they advise visitors, is drilling down into the right parts of town.“You’ve got to get out of downtown,” said the chef Kevin Gillespie, a former Top Chef contestant who has three restaurants here. “Get in your Uber and go to a neighborhood. That’s where you’ll find the great stuff. You’re going to leave the city with a completely different idea of what Atlanta really is.”Of all the local chefs scrambling to be part of the Super Bowl, Mr. Gillespie is the M.V.P. He runs Gamechanger, a concession inside the Mercedes-Benz Stadium, where his “closed on Sunday” chicken sandwich — a homage to the faith-based policy that keeps Chick-fil-A restaurants shuttered on Sundays, even Super Bowl Sundays — has helped make it the highest-grossing food vendor in the arena.He is also one of three chefs whom Arthur Blank, a founder of Home Depot who bought the Atlanta Falcons in 2002, approved to cook on Thursday for the N.F.L. owners’ dinner, a traditional meal usually held at a fancy restaurant or a well-appointed home. Mr. Blank is staging the dinner at the National Center for Civil and Human Rights, not far from the stadium.“It talks to the history of the city and the great connection the N.F.L. has made with the players around issues surrounding social justice,” Mr. Blank said. “We’ve moved from protest to progress.”(Some critics have complained that all three chefs are white men, though Aaron Jefferson, a general manager from the restaurant Iberian Pig who is African-American, was later added to oversee cocktails and wine.)Mr. Gillespie cautions visitors to not expect a city as explicitly Southern as, say, Charleston, S.C. “It’s not ‘Gone With the Wind’ down here,” he said. “Atlanta is a city that has always been about business. It’s not as ‘Hee Haw’-y as people think it might be.”Rather, Atlanta is a metropolis filled with a lot of people from other places. The city’s population is less than 500,000, but the region, which includes the sprawling suburbs, is home to about 5.9 million. People from small Southern towns have moved here for better jobs, and others from big American cities have come seeking less stress and a lower cost of living. The region’s mix includes immigrants from Mexico, India, South Korea and Vietnam.That influx feeds a mix of cuisines, many of them represented in hundreds of restaurants and markets on Buford Highway, the biggest concentration of which starts at the city’s northeastern edge and continues for about 10 miles. Taking measure of the highway’s offerings is a heroic task, but good resources to consult are We Love BuHi, a website and Instagram feed dedicated to the strip, and the local food writer Christiane Lauterbach’s dispatches on Twitter and in Atlanta magazine. Two favorites are the homey Korean grandma food at Yet Tuh and the terrific sambal-sauced okra and noodle and rice dishes at Food Terminal, a modern Malaysian restaurant that shares a parking lot with an expansive multicultural supermarket, a Chinese barbecue spot, a Viet-Cajun seafood restaurant and a tofu house.Atlanta has rarely met a restaurant trend it didn’t like, and right now that translates to food halls. Some of the best restaurants in town have been carved out of restored industrial spaces. Among them is Watchman’s, in the Krog Street Market, a cheery, Cuban-influenced restaurant that turns sustainably harvested Southern seafood into dishes like grilled fish collars bathed in Alabama white barbecue sauce and dappled with salsa verde. Its perfect daiquiris have developed a loyal following.Next door is the Ticonderoga Club, a cozy restaurant whose menu ranges from 48 ounces of grilled, sous-vide chuck roast to a coconut-braised eggplant dish that the chef David Bies picked up in Bali. Students of the Southern cocktail scene make regular pilgrimages to its tiny bar.The grandest food hall of them all is inside the sprawling brick Ponce City Market, a former Sears distribution center developed into a mixed-use complex by the team that created Chelsea Market in New York.Many of Atlanta’s biggest names in food have a presence here. Hugh Acheson pumps out coffee and fat squares of toast slathered with fresh local cow’s milk cheese and jam at Spiller Park, and Hector Santiago sells a fine medianoche sandwich at El Super Pan. Linton Hopkins (one in the trio of chefs cooking for the N.F.L. owners) offers a stacked cheeseburger at H&F Burger, and fried chicken and biscuits next door at a little stand called Hop’s Chicken.Anne Quatrano, the chef who began Atlanta’s farm-to-table era at her flagship restaurant Bacchanalia 25 years ago, sells fresh Gulf shrimp and oysters at W.H. Stiles Fish Camp.Ms. Quatrano, chairwoman of the James Beard Foundation’s awards committee, remains a levelheaded fan of the city’s food. Like Mr. Gillespie, she says some of the best food is found in modest, neighborhood restaurants.“There’s a lot of young talent here,” she said. “Some of it’s raw, but it’s still good. That makes for really good dining at lot of the smaller places.”One is Banshee, a boisterous restaurant inside a former lesbian bar in the charmingly scruffy East Atlanta neighborhood. Tables are packed with diners who swipe fry bread through smears of pepperoni butter, and debate whether the Sichuan-spiced pork osso buco is better than the braised onion caramelle with braised beef cheeks.At Tiny Lou’s, inside the newly refurbished Hotel Clermont, not far from Ponce City Market, Jeb Aldrich delivers a smart take on French classics, and the pastry chef Claudia Martinez makes a crêpes suzette cake that customers can’t seem to stop talking about.Atlanta also is a big breakfast town, which is why in a few weeks Ms. Quatrano will open Pancake Social, a 120-seat, all-day breakfast place in Ponce City Market. Until then, Java Jive, Highland Bakery and Home Grown, whose pancakes and chili cheese grits are worth enduring the inevitable line, all make for a fine breakfast field trip.And don’t forget Waffle House. The original restaurant in nearby Avondale Estates has been turned into the company’s museum, but there are plenty of others in full operation. (Pro tip: Order your hash browns scattered, smothered and covered, with country ham and a pecan waffle cooked dark on the side.)A hungry visitor also would do well to stroll the Atlanta BeltLine, a 22-mile loop of railroad bed that is slowly being transformed into an urban promenade not unlike the High Line in New York, except with a lot more craft breweries.Along the well-developed section that winds through the Old Fourth Ward, you’ll find Nina & Rafi, a new restaurant that serves a chicken parm that has passed the test of more than one New Yorker, old-fashioned square pizzas topped with sizzling pepperoni cups, and crunchy-crusted Detroit-style pies. Expense-account diners can still get a taste of that Buckhead swank at Atlas, in the St. Regis Atlanta hotel. The chef, Christopher Grossman, has a French Laundry pedigree and the quiet, luxe dining room is hung with masterworks, many of them from the art collection of Joe Lewis, the billionaire behind the Tavistock Group, a private investment company that owns the hotel. Next door is Umi, whose modern take on Japanese food would be at home in New York or Los Angeles.Many visitors will be on the hunt for the kind of Southern food best eaten with your hands. Barbecue is not hard to find here, but Bryan Furman of B’s Cracklin’ Barbecue is the only pit master turning out whole-hog barbecue from heirloom-breed hogs. The Busy Bee Café, a half-mile from the stadium, has been around since the 1940s, and remains a reliable practitioner of the Southern staple known as the meat and three. Go for the oxtails or the fried chicken, and take whichever vegetable sides dishes the server recommends. The new Southern food movement has been nurtured for 10 years at Miller Union, which serves hyper-seasonal dishes alongside the most interesting wine list in town. Or head to Decatur, a small city that abuts Atlanta proper, and try Mr. Gillespie’s Revival, which serves the kind of food your Southern grandmother might make if she shopped only at the farmers’ market.One last piece of advice: Don’t sleep on the wings.“Wings have become a real part of Atlanta culture,” said Deborah VanTrece, the chef and owner of Twisted Soul Cookhouse & Pours. Ms. VanTrece, who will set up a grits bar and make deviled eggs for 3,000 as part of an N.F.L.-sponsored game-day tailgate party, is a former American Airlines flight attendant who used to eat chicken wings that were delivered to the cockpit when flights took the crew to Buffalo.“We thought that was everything, but now wings in Atlanta have taken on a life of their own,” she said. Her daughter, who is 26, has long debates with her friends over which of the dozens of places to get wings is the best.Wings are now so important to the city that the classic Atlanta beer-and-wing spot, J. R. Crickets, was invited to sell them in the State Farm Arena, the home of the Atlanta Hawks, which recently had a $200 million renovation. (Mr. Furman sells his barbecue there, too.)Insiders order lemon pepper wet, a style of wings that got a star turn on the FX series “Atlanta.”“Atlanta is an easy city to underestimate,” Ms. VanTrece said. “Sometimes I think it’s because the South in general gets a bad rap, but compared to 20 years ago, it’s night and day. You just have to make a little effort.”Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.

Sharr White’s original screenplay “South Platte,” written for T’s Culture issue.

            A screenplay
          By Sharr White  APRIL 10, 2019SHAWNA KALLIO: 32, resting her head against a dirt-streaked van window. We take her in: a mixture of fear, relief, worry; hair, cut badly, platinum at the tips, brown roots four inches long. On her collarbone, a tattoo in cursive script we can’t quite see.SHAWNA’s in the back of an empty 15-seater. The large woman behind the wheel guides them out of Interstate 25 traffic and down the ramp toward downtown. She hits the blinker, looks for a spot at the curb.DRIVER     All right sweetheart, this is you.SHAWNA lifts her head, looks down. She clutches a white plastic garbage bag with a small lump of belongings inside and a cash card. The DRIVER steps out, comes around, opens the van door.DRIVER     Come on.Bewildered, SHAWNA rises, steps out and down, straining to avoid winter slush.SHAWNA shrugs into an ugly purple down coat, knee length — a donation — which will barely shield her from a Colorado winter; she’s wearing only old Juicy Couture sweat bottoms, a sleeveless tee that says Elitch Gardens Amusement Park and ancient Uggs. A flurry of snow appears and just as quickly halts. The DRIVER shuts the side door of the van and we see, in faded block letters: Colorado Department of Corrections.DRIVER     Good luck.SHAWNA heads for a pay phone, then stops: Stripped wires sprout from a hole in the wall.SHAWNA     (To an employee.) Excuse me? Is there a working phone?SHAWNA at what must certainly be the last working pay phone in Denver, presses the receiver to her ear.SHAWNA     Randy. Randy. Just accept charges. Randy, it took me an hour to find a working pay phone, just accept. (Click.) RANDY!A passing man stares.SHAWNA     What’re you looking at?The DELI OWNER behind the counter — mid-60s, Korean, fatherly — rings her up: quesadilla, Diet Dr Pepper, pack of gum.DELI OWNER     $7.95.SHAWNA sets her white garbage bag down and fishes out her cash card. Hopes to God this works.DELI OWNER     Go ahead and swipe.SHAWNA does. The machine pauses, pauses … approves. SHAWNA takes a breath. And another. She holds back tears.DELI OWNER     Miss? Are you O.K.?SHAWNA grabs her food from the counter, bolts out the door.SHAWNA squats against a wall and devours her quesadilla.SHAWNA     Mm.She cracks the lid on the Diet Dr Pepper, chugs.SHAWNA sits in front of a young female PAROLE OFFICER who shuffles papers.PAROLE OFFICER     (At papers.) You did know you were required to come directly here?SHAWNA     I took two wrong buses.PAROLE OFFICER     Uh-huh.SHAWNA     What, uh-huh?PAROLE OFFICER     It’s four o’clock.SHAWNA     Hey, you all put me out on a corner in downtown, then require me to somehow come all the way to Westminster. You give me a garbage bag for a suitcase, a hundred-dollar cash card, and after lunch and bus fare I got $85.05. That’s it. That’s all I got. I was supposed to buy a phone then take an Uber?PAROLE OFFICER     You were supposed to come directly here.SHAWNA     I did.Beat. The PAROLE OFFICER resets.PAROLE OFFICER     So the address you filled out, this will be your residence of record?SHAWNA     (Quiet.) I think it … yeah. Yes.PAROLE OFFICER     And the sponsor at the residence, is he or she aware of your criminal history?SHAWNA     I mean … she’s … yeah. My mother.PAROLE OFFICER     O.K., as a paroled violent offender …SHAWNA     — I’m not violent.PAROLE OFFICER     Let me finish? As a paroled violent offender whose conviction involved drugs and alcohol, you’re required to go to an RMOMS facility …SHAWNA     — What’s RMOMS?PAROLE OFFICER     — I’m talking. They’re going to give you a mobile breathalyzer; anytime it beeps, day or night, you have 10 minutes to blow and transmit the results. On any random morning, the RMOMS will transmit a green light. You will need to visit the nearest facility within the hour and give a urine test. Failure of any test, or to respond to a test, even once, is a parole violation, do you understand?SHAWNA pauses. Nods.PAROLE OFFICER     O.K., I’m going to let you register at the facility near your sponsor residence, which will not be open until tomorrow morning …SHAWNA looks out the window, the mix of worry and fear washing over her again.We’re above the bus as it motors along Highway 85, following the bend of the shallow South Platte River, winding past high plains industrial wasteland: gravel mines with their acres of rusted equipment, farm supply lots with stacked and warehoused machinery, a gun shop advertising AR-15s, a half-collapsed barn embraced by a clutch of ancient cottonwoods.A hand on SHAWNA’s shoulder. She was fast asleep.DRIVER     Ma’am?SHAWNA sits, shivering, on the steps of a neatly maintained double-wide. A beat-up Chevy Citation pulls in. A figure steps out. SHAWNA rises, brushing off her sweats.LAURIE     Oh my God — Oh my God!SHAWNA’s mother, LAURIE, 49, envelops her. We’re tight on LAURIE’s neck and waitress uniform, her lingering work smell of eggs and potatoes, the warmth under her coat as she embraces SHAWNA.LAURIE     My baby. Oh, my baby. Oh, oh, my poor sweet baby.SHAWNA washes the shampoo from her hair. We finally see the tattoo on her collarbone: “AMBER." The letter “B” forms angel wings.SHAWNA sits at the tiny table in a ratty robe; hair wet, combed back. LAURIE bustles, putting a late toaster-oven dinner together: tater tots, leftover chicken, carrots with dip. She’s youthful, if worn: rail-thin, skinny jeans, Led Zeppelin tee, pink streaks in her dark hair. Her movements are sharp, edgy, excited — one could think because of SHAWNA’s arrival, but her almost constant sniffing says otherwise.LAURIE     … Anyhow, he bid on a roofing contract on all those ugly houses out by the airport, and you know what? The guy wanted a kickback from him. I’m like … He what? And Carlos is like, Yeah, a kickback. And so I’m like, Well kick it back, Carlos, that’s like a, whatever, multi, thousands of dollars …SHAWNA     Mom? Are you using?Beat. LAURIE stares at SHAWNA.LAURIE     So what? I work my ass off, I’m a good person, I can’t have a little fun?SHAWNA     Just don’t let me see it, O.K.?LAURIE     Let me pour you a little Jack on the rocks, baby, that won’t show in the piss test tomorrow …SHAWNA     I don’t know what’s going to show.LAURIE     You can’t even celebrate with me? Just a little bit?SHAWNA     Mom. Stop.LAURIE     And anyway, it’s stupid you can’t even have pot — pot’s legal!SHAWNA     So’s alcohol! They don’t care! I can’t even be near secondhand smoke, it’ll trigger something!Music plays. We’re tight on SHAWNA, huddled in a corner with LAURIE’s cellphone. LAURIE’s in the background, high, dancing lewdly with CARLOS (mid-30s, muscular). Empty beer bottles litter the tables and counters. Several other couples hang out in the kitchen and tiny living room.SHAWNA     (On phone.) Just let me see him, Randy? Please? (Beat.) I could even come over right now and see him while he’s sleeping. He wouldn’t even have to know. (Beat.) I’m not partying.SHAWNA drives. She rummages through LAURIE’s glove box, finds a cigarette, lights it.A skinny guy, heavily tattooed, stands in the open door (RANDY, 30). SHAWNA stands on the stoop. RANDY looks pained. Silence.SHAWNA     All you have to do is let me in. I’ll just walk in, I’ll look at him. I won’t even turn on a light.We hear a woman's voice, shouting from the living room.CRYSTAL     (Offscreen.) Tell her to get outta here, Randy, or we’ll call the cops.RANDY     Shawna, you gotta go.SHAWNA     Yeah, but just listen. If nobody knows, then nobody knows. What harm’s it gonna do? I just … I just wanna smell his little neck.RANDY     He’s older now.SHAWNA     WELL HOW WOULD I KNOW THAT? HOW WOULD I EVEN KNOW WHAT HE LOOKS LIKE?CRYSTAL appears — late 20s, good-looking, dilated eyes, swaying on her feet.CRYSTAL     Shawna, you gotta get outta here. We tell the court you been here, they’ll put you back in.SHAWNA     Are you high? (To Randy.) Is she high?RANDY     She’s got the flu.SHAWNA     (Scoffs.) Right. Let me tell you something. You judge me? Everybody judges me? You were there, too, Randy! Doing everything I was doing! We were on the same bed — you on one side, me on the other.RANDY     Get outta here, Shawna.SHAWNA     We both wake up 18 hours later, the baby’s not breathing, hell on earth comes down on me. Me.RANDY     And you were her mama. You were her mama! If you come back, we’ll call the cops.SHAWNA     AND TO TOP IT OFF, YOU'RE STILL USING, RANDY! WITH SOME SKANK IN MY HOUSE! SEEING MY SON GROW UP!CRYSTAL     O.K., Shawna! I’m callin’!SHAWNA     (Fierce, quiet.) Go ahead and call, skank. Cops’ll come right in there, take all your Oxy while they’re draggin’ me off.CRYSTAL, high as a kite, raises her skinny middle finger.The roar of the bald wheels spitting up dirt and rocks as SHAWNA backs fiercely out of the drive. Another roar of spinning wheels as she guns it onto the dark county road.SHAWNA cleans up. Beer bottles and cans are everywhere. LAURIE comes out, hung over as all hell.LAURIE     Morning, baby. (Kisses her cheek.) I’ll get some coffee on. I’m on the midmorning shift. Come on in with me, I’ll get you a breakfast burrito.SHAWNA     And then can I borrow your car? I gotta get my breathalyzer thing before noon or they send me back.SHAWNA sits alone in a booth. LAURIE buzzes past, sniffling, jerky, slides a plate in front of SHAWNA, heaping with home fries, toast and a smothered breakfast burrito. TWO WOMEN sitting to SHAWNA’s left whisper to each other, then look over at her.SHAWNA (To the women.) Can I help you?They look away.SHAWNA     Yeah, I thought not.Behind SHAWNA, a thin man in a Carhartt jacket, jeans and a blaze-orange hat pushes back his chair. We track him as he stalks through the diner to a booth where TWO INDIAN MEN (60s and 30s) talk quietly in Hindi. The CARHARTT MAN stops at their table. He leans over.CARHARTT MAN     America.A pause. The MEN look at each other.OLDER INDIAN MAN     O.K. America. We don’t want any trouble.CARHARTT MAN     Love it or leave it.OLDER INDIAN MAN     O.K. We love it. O.K.?CARHARTT MAN     America!LAURIE     (Busing a table.) Bill, Jesus, leave them alone.CARHARTT MAN     Love it or leave it!The TWO INDIAN MEN start gathering their things. The CARHARTT MAN reels back, glances around the diner. He starts pumping his fist.CARHARTT MAN     U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! (Continues.)The YOUNGER INDIAN MAN glances at his dining companion. We briefly wonder: Are they father and son? Co-workers? The YOUNGER INDIAN MAN halfheartedly joins in, as if this will deflate from the aggression of the CARHARTT MAN.YOUNGER INDIAN MAN     U.S.A. … U.S.A. … U.S.A. …CARHARTT MAN     U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!The TWO INDIAN MEN look again at each other uneasily. The YOUNGER INDIAN MAN closes his mouth grimly as others in the diner begin to join in — the chant a release, an expulsion of viciousness, an exhalation of caged cruelty tinged with the unsettling joy that comes from lashing out with unrestrained strength at a helpless other, the memory of which in the days to come will cause some in the crowd to pause while stirring their morning tea and digging their nails briefly into their closed palm or taking an involuntary inward breath as they let their old Irish setter out into the graying grass of their side yard.CARHARTT MAN/OTHERS     U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!LAURIE     You guys! Stop it! (To the men.) Lunch is on me. Sorry about this. Go on.SEVERAL OTHERS have risen from their seats to surround the INDIAN MEN’s booth as they carefully rise.CUSTOMERS     U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!SHAWNA watches the TWO INDIAN MEN step gingerly through the customers, all of whom are now chanting at them, most of whom begin following the men outside. SHAWNA pushes her plate away.SHAWNA leans against the wall, smoking in the sunlight. She watches as, in the distance, the TWO INDIAN MEN accelerate onto the highway. Just behind them, a pickup flying a giant American flag from its cab squeals onto the blacktop, giving chase. We can see the CARHARTT MAN behind the wheel in his blaze-orange hat, window rolled down, shouting something indecipherable into the winter air.Sharr White lives in Cold Spring, N.Y.

Sign up here.)Silicon Valley is captivated by a new concept that could eliminate student debt, Andrew writes in his column.Students were saddled with $1.5 trillion in debt last year, a record high. An idea called Income Share Agreements has been talked about for years as a way to alleviate that burden. Under this system, tuition is free, but students agree to pay back a percentage of their income for several years if they get good jobs after graduation.Lambda School, an online learning start-up founded in 2017 with the backing of Y Combinator, has $30 million in funding today from venture capitalists to make the concept a reality.Andrew writes:The investments will be used to turn Lambda, which has focused on subjects like coding and data science, into a multidisciplinary school offering half-year programs in professions where there is significant hiring demand, like nursing and cybersecurity. It’s an expansion that could be a precursor to Lambda becoming a full-scale university.The Lambda model is being closely watched. It’s meant to treat students as investments rather than cash cows — and potentially lift their crippling debt load.But it also comes with risks.Programs seeking safe investments might reverse the strides made in expanding educational opportunities for higher-risk students; and institutions might move away from degrees that lead to noble, but lower compensated, professions.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin and Stephen Grocer in New York, and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________Senior Chinese officials offered to bail out the troubled Malaysian government fund known as 1MDB in exchange for deals, a WSJ investigation found. Documents and interviews with current and former Malaysian officials show some of the political forces at work behind China’s One Belt, One Road infrastructure initiative and the country’s efforts to strengthen its position overseas.Five takeaways from the investigation:• In secret meetings, Chinese officials told Malaysian officials that China would try to fend off investigations by the U.S. and other countries into multibillion-dollar fraud accusations at the fund.• The Chinese also offered to bug the homes and offices of WSJ reporters in Hong Kong.• Malaysian officials suggested that some of the infrastructure projects be financed at above-market rates to generate cash for other needs.• In return, Malaysia offered lucrative stakes in railway and pipeline projects.• The infrastructure deals made Malaysia the second-biggest recipient of One Belt, One Road funding after Pakistan.SoftBank is increasing its stake in WeWork, a bet on continued growth in co-working. But the investment is smaller than the one originally considered.The news: SoftBank is planning to invest $2 billion in WeWork, the leading co-working company, the NYT’s David Gelles reports. The money comes from the conglomerate itself, not from its nearly $100 billion Vision Fund. It values WeWork at $47 billion, and brings SoftBank’s total investment in the company to about $10.5 billion.What could have been: Under one possibility, SoftBank would have spent $10 billion to buy out all of WeWork’s other investors and injected $6 billion more in the company. Several factors led to a smaller deal, including market volatility and the reluctance of investors to sell shares to SoftBank.The back story: SoftBank, one of WeWork’s biggest boosters, has made multiple investments in the company. Much of its capital in WeWork is from the Vision Fund, which is largely backed by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia. But the relationship between SoftBank and WeWork is under growing scrutiny.Carlos Ghosn, in his first public appearance since being arrested in November, declared today that he was innocent of the allegations of financial wrongdoing that led to his ouster from the vast Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi automaking alliance.Handcuffed, with a rope around his waist and plastic slippers on his feet, Mr. Ghosn told a packed courtroom in Tokyo that he had “always acted with integrity.” He added:“I have been wrongly accused and unfairly detained based on meritless and unsubstantiated accusations.”Mr. Ghosn, 64, a celebrity in Japan since pulling Nissan back from the brink nearly two decades ago, was arrested on Nov. 19 after arriving in Tokyo on a corporate jet. In jail, he has not spoken to his family, who believe he is the victim of a corporate coup, and he can be visited only by diplomats or his Japanese lawyer.He is accused of underreporting millions in compensation and improperly transferring personal losses to Nissan’s books. Nissan and Mitsubishi removed him as chairman; he remains chairman and chief executive of Renault. Today, he said:“I never received any compensation from Nissan that was not disclosed, nor did I ever enter into any binding contract with Nissan to be paid a fixed amount that was not disclosed.”In 2016, a report from two respected Ivy League economists found that on-call, freelance or contract-to-contract work was reshaping the U.S. job market — a change driven forward in part by platforms like Uber and Task Rabbit.Alan Krueger of Princeton and Lawrence Katz of Harvard said then that the gig economy accounted for nearly 16 percent of American workers in 2015, up from 10.7 percent a decade earlier.But yesterday, Mr. Krueger and Mr. Katz walked back their estimate, saying that the nontraditional slice of the labor market probably went up only one or two percentage points. And such work still takes a back seat to the standard single-employer job, according to more recent evidence, including a study from the Labor Department released last year.Why the disparity?

Please email thoughts and suggestions to business@nytimes.com.AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byGood Sunday morning. (Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up here.)The week of the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum is a fire hose of news. Headlines, predictions, sightings and tidbits that months and years later are recognized as the flash point for much larger shifts and trends can often get overlooked.To help you sort through it all, we’ve put together this crib sheet of everything that we think was important that happened here in Davos. (Yes, I’m writing this from Davos on my way home.)Before we get into the substance, a couple of observations.The World Economic Forum has traditionally brought together the world’s top political and business leaders. But this year, the political leaders were largely absent — remaining in their home countries to handle crises largely of their own making (President Trump with the shutdown and Prime Minister Theresa May with Brexit).The surprise guest this year was Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive, making his first appearance; it may be an indication of Apple’s increasing dependence on foreign markets for growth.The topic du jour (besides the shutdown) was a debate over where the global economy was headed. Chief executives professed confidence that their earnings would continue apace, while economists and investors talked about the prospect of a recession in 2020. And others, like Ray Dalio — and Seth Klarman, who did not attend, but whose annual letter was a constant talking point — worried about social unrest. Interestingly, Dr. Doom — Nouriel Roubini — was actually upbeat.A Chinese chief executive described his country’s economy as “ugly” — he used that world repeatedly — suggesting that the underlying foundation there was more fragile than most economists acknowledge. That could lead to weakness in China spreading to the rest of the world. And the general sense is that while the U.S. and China may reach a trade détente, we might be headed for a decades-long economic cold war.Larry Fink’s letter and the concept of E.S.G., shorthand for “environmental, social and governance,” got a lot of discussion this year — it felt like it might be a tipping point in the dialogue. European companies are still more interested in E.S.G. than U.S. companies, but it feels like a trend that isn’t going away. TPG’s Rise Fund started a new company, Y Analytics, to measure E.S.G. Bono, a board member of Rise, was on hand to talk about impact investing and to support his Red brand, which he started a decade ago in Davos (DealBook broke that story at the time) as well as his One franchise. Matt Damon was in town to raise money for his water.org, which is turning into a quite successful story (side note: Mr. Damon had to borrow a suit because his bag got lost by Swiss Air). Jane Goodall was also in Davos — and let me say that she is as nice as she is important. Even the Vatican sent a delegation to talk about conscious and inclusive capitalism.And Rebecca Blumenstein, the deputy managing editor of The New York Times, interviewed Bill Gates on Twitter about his work around the globe.____________________________Today’s DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in Davos, Switzerland; Stephen Grocer in New York; and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in Paris.____________________________The soap opera of tariff negotiations has riveted economists and executives: Will Beijing keep its promises? Will Washington cooperate?But the real drama is not about trade, but about technology, many in Davos have said. The brewing conflict could affect generations and disrupt the world order, according to Fred Kempe, the chief executive of the think tank Atlantic Council. He wrote:The growing danger is that the tech race could become the primary battleground in a struggle between democracy and autocracy — and between China and the U.S. The dangers of a technological Cold War, a zero-sum contest for global dominance that ultimately separates Chinese and U.S. tech sectors from each other and divides up the world, are increasing.What’s the worry? The billionaire George Soros said that artificial intelligence, when in the hands of authoritarian regimes, was a “mortal threat” to the world. He cited China, which is developing a social credit system that would use personal data to judge an individual’s trustworthiness, as an example. President Xi Jinping could eventually have “total control over the people,” making him “the most dangerous opponent of open societies,” Mr. Soros said.What do the Chinese think? The technology industry relies heavily on global interactions and is “probably suffering the most right now,” said Ken Hu, the deputy chairman of Huawei. The Chinese telecommunications company has been accused by multiple nations, including the U.S., of violating trade rules. Other players, such as the Chinese state-owned oil and gas company Sinopec, say they expect Chinese companies to scale back foreign investment — steps already taken by Alibaba and by GAC Motor. Last year, nearly 60 percent of Chinese C.E.O.s considered the U.S. to be the most important foreign market; this year, only 17 percent feel the same, according to one survey published this past week.Hope for resolution? Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said via video link that Washington was willing to play nice with Beijing if China pledged to protect intellectual property. At a dinner in Davos, a top Chinese regulator heard complaints from international business leaders about the ownership structure of state-owned enterprises and about the Made in China 2025 effort, which aims to take the lead in industries such as artificial intelligence and robotics.But China wants its space. Vice President Wang Qishan said in a speech that “it is imperative to respect national sovereignty and refrain from seeking technological hegemony.” He added:We need to respect the independent choices of model of technology management and of public policies made by countries, and their right to participating in the global technological governance system as equals.A recession may not be coming this year, but neither is a boom, Greg Ip of the WSJ writes.The International Monetary Fund downgraded its 2019 forecast for global growth to 3.5 percent. That’s a respectable number, he writes, but the world is struggling to sustain even that muted pace.The reason: The world cannot tolerate interest rates as high as it once did. The “neutral” interest rate — one that is high enough to contain inflation, yet low enough to avoid recession — is much lower than before.The underlying cause: As aging workers retire and birthrates drop, the labor force has grown more slowly. Productivity has also eked out smaller gains than in the past.The upshot: Central banks need to proceed carefully, because a little fiscal tightening goes a long way.More on the global economy: Ray Dalio, founder and chairman of the hedge fund Bridgewater, said he foresaw slower growth rates in the U.S. and Europe. France is sticking to a 1.7 percent economic growth forecast for 2019, the French finance minister, Bruno Le Maire, said. Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the I.M.F., warned against an overreliance on central banks, urging countries to strengthen their economies through fiscal and structural changes. In the absence of world leaders, the atmosphere was downbeat.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wasn’t in Davos this week. It just felt like she was.The New York representative’s proposal to impose a 70 percent tax rate on income above $10 million came up frequently among the uber-wealthy in attendance.In those elite circles, filled with people whose fortunes have soared in recent years, the idea was not popular.Michael Dell, the billionaire founder of Dell Technologies, is not a fan, for one. Scott Minerd, the chief investment officer of Guggenheim Partners, said the concept was “scary.” Glenn Hutchins, the chairman of North Island and a co-founder of Silver Lake Partners, suggested that it was an attempt to “score political points” and that it would probably be unsuccessful. Ken Moelis, the chief executive of the investment bank Moelis & Company, said it would be “disastrous for the economy.”Stephen Schwarzman, the billionaire chief executive of Blackstone, said he was “wildly enthusiastic” about Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s pitch. (He was being sarcastic.)But as the economy slows and 2020 election talk surges, taxing the rich is a topic that will most likely continue to surface. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a Democratic candidate for president, proposed a so-called ultramillionaire tax this week on the 75,000 wealthiest families in the country, including President Trump’s.Still, top earners would probably figure out how to sidestep such rules, Mr. Minerd said.The political pendulum is swinging. The conservatives found out they’re being held hostage by the extreme right. Now the Democrats are going to find out they’re being held hostage by the extreme left.Globalization had some powerful defenders in Davos, with world leaders imploring delegates not to abandon postwar principles of international integration.Several took jabs at the absent President Trump without mentioning him by name, criticizing his “America First” foreign policy and his habit of provoking trade disputes. The vice president of China, Wang Qishan, whose own country has been accused of running roughshod over foreign competitors and global business rules, nonetheless condemned “practices of the strong bullying the weak and self-claimed supremacy.”Carrie Lam, the chief executive of Hong Kong, said that certain countries were drifting from the multilateral framework of the past few decades.“If that is no longer the mainstream, we could be in trouble,” she said.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who leads a country that is deeply reliant on international trade and increasingly surrounded by neighbors confronted by protectionist tendencies, urged Western powers to “act against the fragmentation of the international architecture.”She said that global organizations such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank should be reformed and that countries should embrace compromise. She added:I think we should understand our national interest in a way that we think about the interests of others, and from that create win-win situations that are the precondition for multilateralism.Shinzo Abe, the prime minister of Japan, pledged his country’s support for “the free, open, and rules-based international order.” He called on forum participants to “rebuild trust toward the system for international trade.”World leaders called for more regulation. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan said his country would push for a new international system for the oversight of data use.His proposal was echoed by others:• The South African president, Cyril Ramaphosa, said African Union leaders would discuss greater oversight of the tech sector at a meeting early next month.• Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany cited a need for the European Union to have a “common digital market.”• Vice President Wang Qishan of China also said that more international cooperation in regulating the market was required.Talk focused on global governance, data privacy and the impact of artificial intelligence, but there was no consensus on what approach to take. Some official sessions tried to put a positive spin on the effects of technological advances, but the optimism seemed out of step with public concern about the disruptive effect on privacy and politics.Tech leaders make the rounds: On his first trip to the forum, Tim Cook, the Apple chief executive, met with world leaders, including President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil and Dubai’s crown prince, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum. Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook, acknowledged that her company needed to earn back the trust of the public. Microsoft’s chief executive, Satya Nadella, said that as facial recognition technology grew, he would “welcome regulation that will help the marketplace not be a race to the bottom.”Environmental issues took center stage, with world leaders and celebrities weighing in and new partnerships being formed. One of the biggest initiatives announced at the forum was an alternative recycling platform called Loop, which seeks to change the way consumers buy brand-name products.The concept: The project revives the milkman concept, in which products are delivered in reusable containers that are returned to the manufacturer.The partners: Some of the largest consumer goods companies — including Danone, Mars Petcare, Mondelez International, Nestlé, PepsiCo, Procter & Gamble and Unilever — are working together on the project as a way to limit waste.The pitchman: Tom Szaky, founder and chief executive of the recycling company TerraCycle, headed to Davos two years ago to meet with the leaders of packaged goods companies and push his big idea.Climate concerns dominated much of the discussion elsewhere at the gathering:• In an interview with Prince William, the naturalist David Attenborough took world leaders to task for waiting too long to address climate change.• Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand joined the chorus, urging her global counterparts to think about the role they play in addressing climate change, while Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan called for action on the issue.• The singer Bono poked fun at sustainable development goals, saying, “The S.D.G.s, it does sound like a sexually transmitted disease, doesn’t it?”• An expected drop in private jet traffic to Davos this year could be a sign that participants are taking the environmental impact of their travel more seriously.• Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old climate activist from Sweden, gave a speech urging the global elite to protect the planet.• Forum participants seemed receptive to Saudi Arabia’s damage control campaign over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. (Reuters)•The World Economic Forum hosts 3,000 official participants, but the population of Davos swells to 30,000 during the week. Here are the unaffiliated events, sessions and parties that drew celebrities like Matt Damon and Wyclef Jean. (CNBC)• The Bank of England is ready for Brexit and is disillusioned with Bitcoin, said its governor, Mark Carney. (Bloomberg)• Hundreds of protesters, some waving signs that read “Let them eat money,” complained that the elite participants at Davos cared more about the bottom line than about the state of the world.

APRIL 13, 2019

The tech giant records people’s locations worldwide. Now, investigators are using it to find suspects and witnesses near crimes, running the risk of snaring the innocent.
Alex Welsh for The New York TimesThe tech giant records people’s locations worldwide. Now, investigators are using it to find suspects and witnesses near crimes, running the risk of snaring the innocent.By JENNIFER VALENTINO-DeVRIES APRIL 13, 2019When detectives in a Phoenix suburb arrested a warehouse worker in a murder investigation last December, they credited a new technique with breaking open the case after other leads went cold.The police told the suspect, Jorge Molina, they had data tracking his phone to the site where a man was shot nine months earlier. They had made the discovery after obtaining a search warrant that required Google to provide information on all devices it recorded near the killing, potentially capturing the whereabouts of anyone in the area.Investigators also had other circumstantial evidence, including security video of someone firing a gun from a white Honda Civic, the same model that Mr. Molina owned, though they could not see the license plate or attacker.But after he spent nearly a week in jail, the case against Mr. Molina fell apart as investigators learned new information and released him. Last month, the police arrested another man: his mother’s ex-boyfriend, who had sometimes used Mr. Molina’s car.The warrants, which draw on an enormous Google database employees call Sensorvault, turn the business of tracking cellphone users’ locations into a digital dragnet for law enforcement. In an era of ubiquitous data gathering by tech companies, it is just the latest example of how personal information — where you go, who your friends are, what you read, eat and watch, and when you do it — is being used for purposes many people never expected. As privacy concerns have mounted among consumers, policymakers and regulators, tech companies have come under intensifying scrutiny over their data collection practices.The Arizona case demonstrates the promise and perils of the new investigative technique, whose use has risen sharply in the past six months, according to Google employees familiar with the requests. It can help solve crimes. But it can also snare innocent people.Technology companies have for years responded to court orders for specific users’ information. The new warrants go further, suggesting possible suspects and witnesses in the absence of other clues. Often, Google employees said, the company responds to a single warrant with location information on dozens or hundreds of devices.Law enforcement officials described the method as exciting, but cautioned that it was just one tool.“It doesn’t pop out the answer like a ticker tape, saying this guy’s guilty,” said Gary Ernsdorff, a senior prosecutor in Washington State who has worked on several cases involving these warrants. Potential suspects must still be fully investigated, he added. “We’re not going to charge anybody just because Google said they were there.”It is unclear how often these search requests have led to arrests or convictions, because many of the investigations are still open and judges frequently seal the warrants. The practice was first used by federal agents in 2016, according to Google employees, and first publicly reported last year in North Carolina. It has since spread to local departments across the country, including in California, Florida, Minnesota and Washington. This year, one Google employee said, the company received as many as 180 requests in one week. Google declined to confirm precise numbers.The technique illustrates a phenomenon privacy advocates have long referred to as the “if you build it, they will come” principle — anytime a technology company creates a system that could be used in surveillance, law enforcement inevitably comes knocking. Sensorvault, according to Google employees, includes detailed location records involving at least hundreds of millions of devices worldwide and dating back nearly a decade.The new orders, sometimes called “geofence” warrants, specify an area and a time period, and Google gathers information from Sensorvault about the devices that were there. It labels them with anonymous ID numbers, and detectives look at locations and movement patterns to see if any appear relevant to the crime. Once they narrow the field to a few devices they think belong to suspects or witnesses, Google reveals the users’ names and other information.‘‘There are privacy concerns that we all have with our phones being tracked — and when those kinds of issues are relevant in a criminal case, that should give everybody serious pause,” said Catherine Turner, a Minnesota defense lawyer who is handling a case involving the technique.Investigators who spoke with The New York Times said they had not sent geofence warrants to companies other than Google, and Apple said it did not have the ability to perform those searches. Google would not provide details on Sensorvault, but Aaron Edens, an intelligence analyst with the sheriff’s office in San Mateo County, Calif., who has examined data from hundreds of phones, said most Android devices and some iPhones he had seen had this data available from Google.In a statement, Richard Salgado, Google’s director of law enforcement and information security, said that the company tried to “vigorously protect the privacy of our users while supporting the important work of law enforcement.” He added that it handed over identifying information only “where legally required.”Mr. Molina, 24, said he was shocked when the police told him they suspected him of murder, and he was surprised at their ability to arrest him based largely on data.“I just kept thinking, You’re innocent, so you’re going to get out,” he said, but he added that he worried that it could take months or years to be exonerated. “I was scared,” he said.Detectives have used the warrants for help with robberies, sexual assaults, arsons and murders. Last year, federal agents requested the data to investigate a string of bombings around Austin, Tex.The unknown suspect had left package bombs at three homes, killing two people, when investigators obtained a warrant.They were looking for phones Google had recorded around the bombing locations.The specific data resulting from the warrants in the Austin case remains sealed. This illustration is based on the warrant’s description of the process, but the dots do not represent actual phone locations.After receiving a warrant, Google gathers location information from its database, Sensorvault, and sends it to investigators, with each device identified by an anonymous ID code.Investigators review the data and look for patterns in the locations of devices that could suggest possible suspects. They also look for devices that appear in multiple areas targeted by the warrant.They can then get further location data on devices that appear relevant, allowing them to see device movement beyond the original area defined in the warrant.After detectives narrow the field to a few devices they think may belong to suspects or witnesses, Google reveals the name, email address and other data associated with the device.Rich Harris / The New York TimesAustin investigators obtained another warrant after a fourth bomb exploded. But the suspect killed himself three days after that bomb, as they were closing in. Officials at the time said surveillance video and receipts for suspicious purchases helped identify him.An F.B.I. spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the response from Google was helpful or timely, saying that any question about the technique “touches on areas we don’t discuss.”Officers who have used the warrants said they showed promise in finding suspects as well as witnesses who may have been near the crime without realizing it. The searches may also be valuable in cold cases. A warrant last year in Florida, for example, sought information on a murder from 2016. A Florida Department of Law Enforcement spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the data was helpful.The approach has yielded useful information even if it wasn’t what broke the case open, investigators said. In a home invasion in Minnesota, for example, Google data showed a phone taking the path of the likely intruder, according to a news report and police documents. But detectives also cited other leads, including a confidential informant, in developing suspects. Four people were charged in federal court.According to several current and former Google employees, the Sensorvault database was not designed for the needs of law enforcement, raising questions about its accuracy in some situations.Though Google’s data cache is enormous, it doesn’t sweep up every phone, said Mr. Edens, the California intelligence analyst. And even if a location is recorded every few minutes, that may not coincide with a shooting or an assault.Google often doesn’t provide information right away, investigators said. The Google unit handling the requests has struggled to keep up, so it can take weeks or months for a response. In the Arizona investigation, police received data six months after sending the warrant. In a different Minnesota case this fall, it came in four weeks.But despite the drawbacks, detectives noted how precise the data was and how it was collected even when people weren’t making calls or using apps — both improvements over tracking that relies on cell towers.“It shows the whole pattern of life,” said Mark Bruley, the deputy police chief in Brooklyn Park, Minn., where investigators have been using the technique since this fall. “That’s the game changer for law enforcement.”Location data is a lucrative business — and Google is by far the biggest player, propelled largely by its Android phones. It uses the data to power advertising tailored to a person’s location, part of a more than $20 billion market for location-based ads last year.In 2009, the company introduced Location History, a feature for users who wanted to see where they had been. Sensorvault stores information on anyone who has opted in, allowing regular collection of data from GPS signals, cellphone towers, nearby Wi-Fi devices and Bluetooth beacons.People who turn on the feature can see a timeline of their activity and get recommendations based on it. Google apps prompt users to enable Location History for things like traffic alerts. Information in the database is held indefinitely, unless the user deletes it.“We citizens are giving this stuff away,” said Mr. Ernsdorff, the Washington State prosecutor, adding that if companies were collecting data, law enforcement should be able to obtain a court order to use it.Current and former Google employees said they were surprised by the warrants. Brian McClendon, who led the development of Google Maps and related products until 2015, said he and other engineers had assumed the police would seek data only on specific people. The new technique, he said, “seems like a fishing expedition.”The practice raises novel legal issues, according to Orin Kerr, a law professor at the University of Southern California and an expert on criminal law in the digital age.One concern: the privacy of innocent people scooped up in these searches. Several law enforcement officials said the information remained sealed in their jurisdictions but not in every state.In Minnesota, for example, the name of an innocent man was released to a local journalist after it became part of the police record. Investigators had his information because he was within 170 feet of a burglary. Reached by a reporter, the man said he was surprised about the release of his data and thought he might have appeared because he was a cabdriver. “I drive everywhere,” he said.These searches also raise constitutional questions. The Fourth Amendment says a warrant must request a limited search and establish probable cause that evidence related to a crime will be found.Warrants reviewed by The Times frequently established probable cause by explaining that most Americans owned cellphones and that Google held location data on many of these phones. The areas they targeted ranged from single buildings to multiple blocks, and most sought data over a few hours. In the Austin case, warrants covered several dozen houses around each bombing location, for times ranging from 12 hours to a week. It wasn’t clear whether Google responded to all the requests, and multiple officials said they had seen the company push back on broad searches.Last year, the Supreme Court ruled that a warrant was required for historical data about a person’s cellphone location over weeks, but the court has not ruled on anything like geofence searches, including a technique that pulls information on all phones registered to a cell tower.Google’s legal staff decided even before the 2018 ruling that the company would require warrants for location inquiries, and it crafted the procedure that first reveals only anonymous data.“Normally we think of the judiciary as being the overseer, but as the technology has gotten more complex, courts have had a harder and harder time playing that role,” said Jennifer Granick, surveillance and cybersecurity counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union. “We’re depending on companies to be the intermediary between people and the government.”In several cases reviewed by The Times, a judge approved the entire procedure in a single warrant, relying on investigators’ assurances that they would seek data for only the most relevant devices. Google responds to those orders, but Mr. Kerr said it was unclear whether multistep warrants should pass legal muster.Some jurisdictions require investigators to return to a judge and obtain a second warrant before getting identifying information. With another warrant, investigators can obtain more extensive data, including months of location patterns and even emails.Investigators in Arizona have never publicly disclosed a likely motive in the killing of Joseph Knight, the crime for which Mr. Molina was arrested. In a court document, they described Mr. Knight, a 29-year-old aircraft repair company employee, as having no known history of drug use or gang activity.Detectives sent the geofence warrant to Google soon after the murder and received data from four devices months later. One device, a phone Google said was linked to Mr. Molina’s account, appeared to follow the path of the gunman’s car as seen on video. His carrier also said the phone was associated with a tower in roughly the same area, and his Google history showed a search about local shootings the day after the attack.After his arrest, Mr. Molina told officers that Marcos Gaeta, his mother’s ex-boyfriend, had sometimes taken his car. The Times found a traffic ticket showing that Mr. Gaeta, 38, had driven that car without a license. Mr. Gaeta also had a lengthy criminal record.While Mr. Molina was in jail, a friend told his public defender, Jack Litwak, that she was with him at his home about the time of the shooting, and she and others provided texts and Uber receipts to bolster his case. His home, where he lives with his mother and three siblings, is about two miles from the murder scene.Mr. Litwak said his investigation found that Mr. Molina had sometimes signed in to other people’s phones to check his Google account. That could lead someone to appear in two places at once, though it was not clear whether that happened in this case.Mr. Gaeta was arrested in California on an Arizona warrant. He was then charged in a separate California homicide from 2016. Officials said that case would probably delay his extradition to Arizona.A police spokesman said “new information came to light” after Mr. Molina’s arrest, but the department would not comment further.Months after his release, Mr. Molina was having trouble getting back on his feet. After being arrested at work, a Macy’s warehouse, he lost his job. His car was impounded for investigation and then repossessed.The investigators “had good intentions” in using the technique, Mr. Litwak said. But, he added, “they’re hyping it up to be this new DNA type of forensic evidence, and it’s just not.”April 13, 2019May 19, 2018May 10, 2018Michael LaForgia contributed reporting.

About 300 people are spilling out of a club onto Avenida Eduardo Conde in the Santurce district of San Juan. The space I’m in has limited seating, but the stools are empty anyway because everyone is standing. One window sells fluffy, fist-sized empanadillas and stacks of lightly salted tostones while another one hands over cans of Medalla beer at a furious pace. Everyone is here for bomba and plena, two distinct but closely linked Puerto Rican musical traditions that can trace their roots to the African slaves brought to the island starting in the 17th century.The first set is all plena: A dozen men fill the stage, their fingers ricocheting off circular pandereta drums, providing a bedrock for the call-and-response vocal lines. The lyrics are largely improvised and often lewd and full of thinly veiled social and political commentary. There are repeated mentions of the venue we’re in, La Terraza de Bonanza, and calls to dance “la plena” and love “la isla.” Judging by the expressions on the faces of the people around me, the lyrics hold several inside jokes that fly right over my head.After about an hour, there’s a 10-minute break and the set changes to bomba, an even older musical tradition (and a kind of cultural parent to plena) anchored by barrel-like drums. Women take center stage. A trio of vocalists face the drummers and a revolving cast of dancers leap, twirl, grin, shout and have me so transfixed that it’s a full 15 minutes before I realize I forgot to hit the record button on my camera.I came to Puerto Rico, my first stop as this year’s 52 Places Traveler, hoping to see an island well on its way to recovery, a year and a half after Hurricane Maria. I knew I would see progress, especially when compared to the fresh devastation that my predecessor Jada Yuan saw just five months after the hurricane when she visited the island. What I didn’t expect to see were the omnipresent smiles, the sense of optimism shared by so many people I met, from pig roasters to young entrepreneurs, and from the meticulously manicured cobblestoned streets of Old San Juan to the roller-coaster hills in the center of the island. [Born in the United States to a Colombian mother and an Indian father, Sebastian moved every few years during his childhood. Read more about our 52 Places Traveler.] Throughout my six days on the island, a single sentence spoken to me by a 13-year-old in the ocean-hugging neighborhood of La Perla, just below Old San Juan, was on repeat in my mind: “La vida continúa,” or “Life goes on.” The ensemble I saw at La Terraza, where it plays every Monday night, is more than a bar band. It’s a movement called Compartir de Plena, or Sharing Plena. Led by Alfredo Emerson and Axel Cotto, the group started five years ago in the northern coastal town of Cataño as a way to teach young people free of charge to play bomba and plena music. After Hurricane Maria hit, the group waited just two weeks before putting on a show in its hometown as a way to lift the spirits of a devastated population. One week after that, Compartir de Plena were back at La Terraza de Bonanza, where a generator kept the beers cold and the microphones on for months. These days, the group sometimes streams the Terraza performances live on Instagram and Facebook, Mr. Emerson told me when I connected with him days after the performance. “It’s to bring happiness to people to see and hear our native music not just here in Puerto Rico, but also in other countries around the world,” he said. La Terraza de Bonanza was the first stop in my mission to explore the island of Puerto Rico beyond the regular tourism routes. I didn’t make it to a beach until my last full day. I never made it El Yunque, the giant National Forest that attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors a year. I didn’t have time to hop over to Vieques, the speck of land that sits off the main island’s east coast like a sideways teardrop. That’s not to say these aren’t attractions for good reasons, but I came wanting to see other parts of the island to see if those places had rebounded in the same way as the cruise ship ports and tour bus destinations. So I put the little time I had on the island largely into the hands of some young, energetic Puerto Ricans I met — one introducing me to another.Loreana González Lazzarini, 34, is from Isabela, a town on the island’s northwestern coast. One day, she mapped out a trail of chinchorros (rural roadside restaurants) for me, stretching from the outskirts of San Juan to Orocovis, in the island’s center. The night before my road trip, speaking of the need for tourists to see the island beyond San Juan, Ms. González Lazzarini told me, “I want tourists to experience the people of Puerto Rico. Puerto Ricans’ main concern is always, ‘Are you having a good time?’”I spent the day alone, weaving through the winding, narrow roads that snake up and down jungle-covered hills into the interior. There were clear signs of the hurricane’s devastation. I saw the infamous blue tarps, still covering the tops of houses whose roofs had been blown off a year and a half ago. Rounding one corner I saw a pile of tree parts and, crossing right in front of it, a stray puppy dragging the beheaded carcass of an iguana: a poignant, if a little heavy-handed, symbol for the brutality of nature.San CristóbalAtlanticOceanCastillo SanFelipe del Morrooldsan juanC. loÍzaSanturceSan Juanisla verdeCatañoLa Terrazade Bonanza2Centro deBellas ArtesLuis A.

I had made the mistake of trying to go on a “chinchorreo” on a Wednesday — for Puerto Ricans, it quickly became clear, that’s more of an activity for weekends. But one after another, the chinchorro owners whose places were closed until the weekend, rattled off recommendations for spots further down the road that might be open. When I finally found a place for a late lunch — Roka Dura, an open-air restaurant at the top of a hill overlooking Orocovis — I ate a plate of country specialties: chicken chicharrón, fried till the skin cracked off the meat like an extra greasy potato chip; alcapurrias, fritters stuffed with mashed green plantains and ground meat; and longaniza, a Puerto Rican take on chorizo. After the meal, the server who had been making sure I liked everything, came over with a single sprig of fresh mint as a palate cleanser. “I know it’s organic, because my neighbor grows it,” she said.It took me a few days to realize it, but Ms. González Lazzarini’s own story is one that I heard, in some form or another, again and again during my time in Puerto Rico.“I can’t think of my life without thinking of Hurricane Maria — it changed me,” she said. “Instead of B.C. and A.D., here it’s Before Maria and After Maria. B.M. and A.M.”In Ms. González Lazzarini’s case, B.M. meant working at a major consulting firm in New York and then as a private consultant in Puerto Rico. A.M., her clients could not pay for consulting fees. Ms. González Lazzarini instead worked with a local nonprofit to distribute generators to businesses on Calle Loiza, a rapidly up-and-coming strip of bars and restaurants in Santurce. Then, she took a position with the recently established COR3, a local government agency working on reconstruction, recovery and resilience following the hurricane.“The hurricane took so much away from us, but it gave us something too,” Ms. González Lazzarini said. “It showed us how we can come together and organize as a people on our own.”Driving in the countryside is not as much of a white-knuckle experience as I had been led to believe. Still, you will find roads that are temporarily one lane, traffic lights that are out, and trucks in a rush. I found driving on the conservative side got me farther than trying to match the speed and daring of those who knew where they were going better than I did.Power outages can still happen — and they can be unpredictable. My Airbnb, along with the rest of the neighborhood in Isla Verde, lost power for about six hours on one of the days I was there. Luckily, both power banks I’m traveling with were fully charged, so I could venture out for the duration, with full juice on my phone.Uber is easy, affordable, and the best way to get around if you want to leave the rental car at the hotel. I often left mine behind when I was going into San Juan, or when I was going out at night to avoid parking headaches and driving at night. For Xavier Pacheco, 40, a globally recognized chef, A.M. was about finally making the leap to what he considers his life’s work: a farm-to-table operation he’s starting with two chef-partners that will be, in his words, “our farm, with our animals, and a menu that comes from what we harvest.” He feels a magnetic tug away from the more established centers of tourism, on which he has relied. (He estimates that in his previous venture, the wildly successful Jaquita Baya, 70 percent of his customers were tourists).“I’m refocusing on taking my product out of San Juan,” he told me, as I rode shotgun in his pickup truck past the Carraízo Dam, about 15 miles from Old San Juan. “The San Juan metro area is so saturated. There are a lot of places outside that area that are really cool — tourists should understand how much there is to see.” Put another way? “You have these people going to Señor Frogs and it’s like, ‘What’s the point?’ As a tourist, you could close your eyes in there and know your way to the bathroom.”On my first day with Mr. Pacheco, I had one of two lunches at one of the “really cool” places he mentioned. I was hungry for lechón, the whole slow-roasted pig that is famous in the island’s interior, so we stopped at Lechonera Angelito’s Place. It is part of a strip that Mr. Pacheco calls “a mini Guavate,” referring to the section of the town of Cayey that’s become famous for the density of its lechoneras. This place is better, Mr. Pacheco promised. I can’t say how it compares with every other pig roast on the island, but it is hard to imagine anything more decadent than those chunks of meat, slick with melted fat, and layers of thick pig skin roasted to the consistency of hard candy. After our meal, Mr. Pacheco introduced me to Junior Rivera, who has been running Angelito’s for 29 years. Mr. Rivera told me that he starts the roasting process at 1:30 a.m. every day and is in bed by 10 p.m. and that his recipe is basically a product of discovering what he likes. His A.M. story? “We were closed for two days. The day of the hurricane and the day after it, when the roads were closed,” he said.On my second day with Mr. Pacheco, my last on the island, he took me to the northern central town of Manatí. On the way, we stopped for a breakfast of — what else? — more lechón, this time at the famous Rancho de Apa in Guaynabo. In Manatí we met with Efrén Robles who, with his wife, Angelie Martinez, run Los Frutos del Guacabo, an organic farm that runs on an on-demand model in collaboration with local chefs. Need more arugula? The farm will up production. Looking for grass-fed goat? Mr. Robles is in the middle of an experimentation with cross-breeding to find the perfect balance between the longevity of the animal and the quality of meat. As we walked, Mr. Robles picked soon-to-be garnishes the color of lipstick that tasted like black pepper and bright yellow bulbs that left a tingling sensation on my tongue. After the hurricane flattened the farm, it took Mr. Robles 177 days to get back on his feet, with some help from José Andrés’s World Central Kitchen. Now, he’s hoping to expand, potentially even into hospitality. When asked if, after the hurricane, he had ever considered taking his business or his expertise elsewhere it’s a quick “No.” “I lived in Delaware for two years,” he told me as we took the five-minute drive from his farm to a pristine stretch of beach. “I’ll never forget the blizzard of ’96.”Even Ms. González Lazzarini and Mr. Pacheco admitted I needed to spend at least half a day in Old San Juan, home to sprawling colonial-era fortresses like San Felipe del Morro and San Cristóbal. Beyond its Instagram-friendly beauty, the area, packed with cruise ship tours the day I went, is itself a symbol of post-hurricane, mid-debt crisis resilience. Look at Old San Juan today and, apart from the political graffiti that speckles its outskirts, you would never imagine a hurricane that claimed the lives of almost 3,000 people had made landfall just a year and a half earlier. It’s in large part because of tourism: The brightly colored facades of Old San Juan were, somewhat controversially, a top priority in the rebuilding effort, given that they are the main source of tourist dollars on the island. Tourist numbers are slowly creeping back to their pre-hurricane levels in Puerto Rico, even if most of those people are sticking to the same spots. But there’s at least one place that’s received a flood of newcomers: El Centro de Bellas Artes Luis A. Ferré. That’s because for three weeks in January, the fine arts complex was playing host to “Hamilton,” with Lin-Manuel Miranda reprising his role as the title character for the first time in two and a half years. I went on a Thursday night during the last week of the show’s run. The crowd was electric even before the performance began, a steady din of excited whispers filling the space.When Mr. Miranda stepped into the spotlight to the words “Alexander Hamilton,” the ensemble had to pause for a full two minutes to allow the standing ovation to pass. Every major number ended with raucous cheering. But a different energy settled on the theater in the opening moments of “Hurricane,” in which Mr. Miranda sings, “In the eye of a hurricane, everything is quiet.” And it was. Even the applause at the end of the song seemed more subdued, more somber. By the end of the next number though, the crowd was smiling, whooping and loudly cheering once again.Advertisement

It was a dream job, visiting the globe’s most alluring destinations on assignment. Here’s what our 2018 Traveler learned in a year of almost nonstop travel.
It was a dream job, visiting the globe’s most alluring destinations on assignment. Here’s what our 2018 Traveler learned in a year of almost nonstop travel.

Illustrations by EDEN WEINGART JAN. 4, 2019The man on the train platform who spoke only Hindi looked at my ticket and chuckled. This had been one of those days when mistakes piled up faster than I could track them. I had tarried too long in Chandigarh, India, and the four-hour taxi ride back to New Delhi now promised to be a six-hour slog in traffic. No problem, I could take a train instead, I thought, only to run out of money on my cellphone SIM card just as I was booking a last-minute ticket. I hopped in a tuk tuk and raced to the station, and got there five minutes after the last fast train had left for the night.When I started this harebrained experiment in January, to visit and report on the Times’s entire 52 Places to Go in 2018 list, I thought that by stop 48, for sure, I’d be the Wonder Woman of travel: blocking mishaps with a flick of my wrist. Instead I was staring down a 2 a.m. arrival in New Delhi before having to force myself awake for a morning plane to Bhutan.But there was the man on the platform — a waiter for the railway, whose job it is to pass out dinners — flashing a gesture that seemed to mean, “Don’t worry, I’ve got you.” I had bought an “unreserved” ticket, which I thought was for people who’d had trouble purchasing online, but which really meant I’d likely have to stand for five hours. But when the train pulled in, the man talked to the conductor and ushered me into a sleeper car. English-speakers all around jumped in to interpret. Seven dollars in fines and upgrade fees later, I was sitting in a cluster of bunks with four boisterous 20-something women from New Delhi. The words “dream job” come up whenever I tell people about the 52 Places project. Like the thousands of others who answered that fateful job listing — travel the world for The New York Times! — I had a vision of winning a journalism lottery, of getting to leave behind my routine to swim in waterfalls in Australia, paraglide off mountaintops in Switzerland and eat at Michelin-starred restaurants in France. And I got to do all of those things, for which I am incredibly grateful. From New Orleans to Laos, we offer a starter kit for exploring the world.I’ve also had to face reality: that constant travel — alone — on an illogical route no sane human would plan, might take a toll on my physical and mental well-being. That The Times, quite reasonably, expected me to do work and file stories, which meant spending a lot of time in beautiful destinations in front of a computer. That I’d make gaffes along the way and have to weather the sting of valid criticism. That I’d meet new friends only to have to say goodbye a few days later. And that I’d be mostly celibate, miss the births of four close friends’ babies, forget to call my parents. That I’d reach the end, and all I’d want is to do it over again.I started out, arms laden with recommendations and highlights, determined to do every one of them: Eat all the food in New Orleans, hike to the sea cave everyone goes to in Tasmania, visit every mountain temple in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Yet what I remember most are the small wins and human connections. The kind people and delicious salchipapas (deconstructed hot dogs with French fries) at a Peruvian food truck on the highway outside Disney Springs, Fla. The man in Lucerne, Switzerland, who returned my laptop when I left it on a bridge in the rain. That army of concerned citizens in Chandigarh.Trust has been the through-line that has emerged from it all. Trust in myself, trust in the fundamental goodness of people, trust that as a solo female traveler, I could watch my back without walling myself off from experiences.You see, it was a dream job. It’s just that my idea of what made this dream job dreamy has changed so much.I was going on 40, feeling sad about being single, and contemplating a sabbatical from New York Magazine, where I’d worked for 17 years, when I clicked on The New York Times home page and saw something curious: A job listing in the most-read articles list. Did I want to travel around the world and document it? it asked. Sure I did! So did pretty much everyone. By the time I saw the listing, 3,500 people had already applied. The final number, they tell me, was 13,000.The odds were so impossible and the selection process so mysterious that I couldn’t allow myself to get too excited. And then I got the incredible phone call telling me I had three weeks to pack up my apartment, say goodbye to everyone I knew, quit a workplace that felt like family and set out for a year on the road. All through my 20s and 30s, I had watched friends move to London or West Africa, or quit their jobs and travel, and wondered how they possibly had the confidence to do it. I had made the huge, scary leap from New Mexico to New York City after college because it was the one big city I knew, and I had family there. And then I stayed at the same workplace, building a career I loved while living in a series of closet-size walk-ups and earning barely enough money to go home for the holidays.“Why do you think they picked you?” interviewers often asked me, and I didn’t know the answer. I suspected it was because I hadn’t done anything like this before. I’d never been brave enough. And maybe I could be a representative for those who didn’t think they were brave enough, either.Getting on that first plane to New Orleans, I felt as though I were stepping into an unknowable void from which there was no return. The first few months were tough. Five stops in, and behind on my writing, I wound up in Bogotá, Colombia, still needing to file my articles on Montgomery, Ala. (stop No. 3) and Disney Springs, Fla. (stop No. 4). I spent three straight days in my Bogotá hotel, losing precious time to report on and photograph the city. The one day I got outside, I took a taxi 30 minutes to the museum I wanted to see and realized I’d left my wallet back at the hotel.And I just lost it. I called a dear friend of mine who works for The Wall Street Journal and has made many a global move, and sobbed.“I know this feels daunting right now,” she said, “but you have to remember that a year is short.”I argued that this was the longest year of my life, and it was only February, and she didn’t know what she was talking about. But the saying stuck in my head and acquired new meaning whenever I’d hear myself complain about this wondrous opportunity.Freezing down to your bones and sleeping in a by-the-hour motel where you shower while sitting on the toilet? Suck it up! You’re about to see the rainbow hills of Zhangye, China! A year is short.Freezing again and dinner is bar nuts because you waited past 8 p.m., when all the restaurants close? You just rode a horse in Iceland! A year is short.Car got towed in Auckland, New Zealand, while on your third trip to the Chinese consulate trying to get a visa? But you’re in New Zealand! And you’re going to China! A year is short.A year is short and a year is not enough.A year is short, and I was strong, and the risk had always been worth it.My 27-hour travel day from Kanazawa, Japan, to India, was one of the trickiest of the year and I had gamed it out to the minute: A 4 a.m. taxi to the Kanazawa station, where I’d pick up luggage I’d left in a locker; a six-hour train ride with two transfers, arriving at the Osaka airport with a generous two and a half hours to check in for my flight. I’d filled out the longest form in the world to get my India eVisa and paid to get it expedited. And I had a ticket for onward travel to Bhutan, having anticipating that India would require me to show I’d booked travel to exit the country before I could get on the plane in Japan.Then the AirAsia ticket counter woman asked if I had a paper copy of my eVisa. I hadn’t thought to print it out. Nowhere else in the world, in 47 stops, had I needed to show anything but my phone at a check-in counter.She couldn’t let me on the flight without it, she said. Check-in was closing in 20 minutes. After a mad scramble, I ended up in line at a Family Mart convenience store behind a woman printing out what looked like a 40-page dissertation, watching as the clock ticked down. The complicated printer setup required downloading an app to my phone, and by the time I had printed it out, I’d missed the deadline by 15 minutes. I raced up two flights of escalators and down several long corridors, carrying the bags I hadn’t been allowed to check, prepared to beg the ticket agent for leniency. By some miracle the line was still open. I handed everything over, smiling with relief, and then looked up to see my plane was on a 2-hour delay.So like any reasonable person, I went back to the Family Mart and bought a basket full of sushi snacks and tea-flavored Kit Kats, plus a beer to take the edge off. I’d estimate that at least 60 percent of this job was dealing with logistics. And I even had a helper back in New York, who would research hotels and flights for me.Every country is different, with different currencies and different languages, a different pace and different cultural customs. An unreserved train ticket means one thing in India and another in Spain. Had I done cursory research on the dual-island African nation of São Tomé and Príncipe, I would have known to show up with a wad of euros, because the society is completely cash-based and there are no ATMs foreigners can use. At first, I tried following travel conventions that had worked for me on one-off trips: booking planes and hotels in advance, picking the absolute cheapest fares, guarding against delays by taking 6 a.m. flights, which are the least likely to be canceled. Then four 6 a.m. flights in a row, with the necessary 3 a.m. wake-up calls, turned me into a zombie.I started listening to my rhythms. I am a night owl, for one, happy to wake up for sunrises but usually not for planes. Inflexible travel plans give me anxiety, particularly when they were coupled with work deadlines.The trip had been planned to go from west to east, minimizing jet lag, but some time zone changes knocked me out. The 24-hour travel day from Zambia to Darwin, Australia, knocked me out for days.I’ve become far calmer from having to deal with mishap after mishap, and realizing that nothing dire usually happens. There would be another plane, and more trains if I missed that one, too. Maybe I’d lose a day, but when you’re on the road this long, time becomes malleable, too.“So what countries are you going to?” asked Tina Phillips, a nurse at Passport Health in Orlando, Fla., which issues vaccinations and prescriptions for travelers who might encounter infectious diseases like malaria, rabies or Japanese encephalitis.I started listing off my 52 Places destinations. Ms. Phillips typed the country names into the computer, her eyes widening as she laughed at the absurdity. She sent me home with several needle sticks in my arm, $1,100 in preventive medicine, a video message telling my mother not to worry, and a spiral-bound printout of all my health vulnerabilities. One of my biggest fears going into this project was getting sick, or injured, and having to come home early — or worse, having something happen while I was in a remote location without access to adequate medical care. Getting sick is painful, and often gross, but what worried me more was the potential time suck on a trip so tightly scheduled that it would go off the rails if I spent days groaning on a hotel bathroom floor.My waistline has expanded and diminished throughout this trip, but the medical kits I built so meticulously before I left the U.S. have remained largely untouched in my suitcase. It’s a stash so extensive that a customs officer at the ferry entrance to Tangier, Morocco, spent an hour threatening, in Arabic, to confiscate it and accusing me of being a drug dealer.Instead, I discovered I have a superpower, which may be the sole reason I’ve stayed relatively healthy: the ability to sleep anywhere, under any conditions. Give me a window seat on an airplane and I’ll be lights out before takeoff, no earplugs, eye mask or neck pillow. I’d fall asleep in hotels on noisy streets as dogs barked all night, and in 20-minute chunks, regulated by an alarm, between writing paragraphs of articles on an all-nighter. In Tangier, two friends who joined me started looking like death because of hourlong prayer calls outside our windows every morning at 4 a.m. I didn’t even notice them.But the only times I’ve gotten really sick were the colds I caught in Seville, Spain, and Chandigarh after extensive sleep deprivation. I warded them off with a lot of naps.The rain in Chilean Patagonia never really seemed to stop. Every article of clothing I owned was soaked. Soppy socks, soppy shoes. The weather matched my mood. Earlier that week, I’d called my friend crying yet again, and told her I wanted to quit — I was so far behind in writing it felt like I was drowning in obligations I couldn’t meet. What do people do when it rains like this? I asked the hotel manager in the national park, Parque Pumalín. “We do what we always do,” he said. “If we stopped for rain, nothing would ever get done.”So, in a small break in the rain, I went out to do what I always do: take pictures, talk to people, get to know the place.I was in the tiny town of Chaitén, which had been leveled by a volcanic eruption 10 years earlier. Residents had come back, but the buildings closest to the slope were still abandoned. I went to examine the ghost town. A few friendly construction workers were rebuilding a house, a school. I wandered further, to an industrial building that had been overtaken by jungle growth straight out of “Jurassic Park.”The rain started up again while I was inside, exploring the concrete corridors and coming to the realization that I was inside an abandoned prison.And now I was trapped by torrential rain.For two hours I watched the rain flood the dirt streets before me, and the inside of this prison. I tweeted out my location, just in case. Then my phone’s battery died, and it was just me and the torrent, alone in the wilds of Patagonia, with the sun going down.I had to make a decision, and the decision was to run, through the rain. And in that rain, soaked and running, I looked around, at the blue-tinged mountains around me, and the jungle shrubs on all sides, and the kind people laughing at this silly foreigner who’d gotten caught in an abandoned prison in the rain, and realized that all the rest was superfluous. This was why I was here.Something crystallized for me in that moment, of how singular this trip was. I started trying things: I jumped off a 30-foot cliff into freezing river water while “canyoning” in Megève, France; scuba dived and surfed for the first time in Fiji; and maybe scariest of all, tried a taco with a crispy-fried ant at Gustu in La Paz, Bolivia.Two days ago, my friend Ben saw a dish on the menu of a barbecue joint in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, he thought I should try to commemorate making it to my 52nd place.“Come on,” he said. “After this you can tell everyone you tried Fried Spicy Cow Penis.”The whole table agreed to join me. We ordered it and the kitchen brought out Fried Spicy Beef instead. “We changed it for you!” they said, cheerily.“Awesome,” said Ben. “We also want this one.”The dish came out. It looked exactly as you would imagine. Ben ate a piece. Then it was my turn. We have video evidence. I know I said, “try it,” but you don’t need to try that one. I did it for you. You’re welcome.Eurydice Dixon, 22, Melbourne, Australia; June 13.Mollie Tibbetts, 20, Brooklyn, Iowa; July 18.Wendy Karina Martinez, 35, Washington, D.C.; Sept. 18.Carla Stefaniak, 36, San Jose, Costa Rica; Nov. 28.Grace Millane, 22, Auckland, New Zealand; Dec 1. Maren Ueland, 28, and Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, Imlil, Morocco; Dec. 21.Those are the names, ages, places and dates of death of seven women who were violently murdered while walking home, jogging, hiking or taking a birthday trip this year.Of all the news that has filtered across my phone screen while I’ve been bouncing around the world, none had the potential to throw me into a paralytic spiral more than reading about a woman killed simply because she was alone.“Was there ever a time you felt unsafe?” a friend asked me recently. The answer was no, not like I have been in the past, when I escaped attackers in my Williamsburg, Brooklyn, neighborhood or on a trip to France; and also, “Always.”Caution as a solo female traveler is healthy; blind fear is not. I find that for me the best system is to always remember that I am a tourist. It’s good to know what people who live in a place have to say about safety, but also realize that the rules that apply to them, who know where they are going, and can blend in, don’t apply to me.I’ve had to sacrifice areas of coverage I might otherwise enjoy, like night life, because I didn’t feel safe going out alone. For the one destination that was all about going out, in Belgrade, Serbia, I hired a translator-guide to keep me company, who became a fast friend. In Bogotá, I met a young female professor through Instagram who took me out with her friends for a night.There’s a literal extra cost to being a woman traveling on your own. In cities where safety seemed like it might be an issue, I took cabs and Ubers rather than cheaper public transport. Climbing up certain mountains or going around certain cities, I opted for a guide, and often paid extra because most private tours have a two-person minimum.At one point, I got delayed arriving at an Airbnb I’d booked in Glasgow, and had to retrieve the key, after midnight, from a lockbox attached to a fence on a dark side street. A man, clearly on something, swayed back and forth about 20 feet away, as I fumbled with the combination while also trying to keep an eye on my bags. When I got inside, the apartment was lovely, but the building looked like it had been through a bombing and never recovered. Certain landings, including mine, had no lights, and glass covered the floor from broken windows. I was hanging out with a local travel writer who usually walked me home at night, but if he hadn’t been there, no one would have known my whereabouts.After that I vowed to stay only in hotels with 24-hour front desks rather than rental apartments. The idea of dating in a strange land quickly went out the window — I didn’t have time and it didn’t seem safe. But I didn’t swear off romantic leanings entirely. All told I had four make-out sessions all year, all in public or under what felt like very safe circumstances. Those seem like little miracles.Oh, the stories of strangers that I could tell.In Montgomery,  there was Marcus, an Uber driver who’d grown up in what he described as “abject poverty,” who gave me an inspired lecture on his city’s complicated racial history. We picked up his neighbor, a nurse, from work, as he does every night, and finished with a feast at Applebee’s.In Puerto Rico, there was Blandine, a travel agent who’d greeted me dancing and singing by the baggage carousel, a few months after Hurricane Maria, when much of the island was without power. A farmer, Elmer Sánchez, mentioned a party to me and my friend, and we showed up to find at least 400 people dancing to the best musicians in the country playing by the light of a generator.In Ypres, Belgium, there were the countless people attending the Last Post Ceremony, to honor the missing fallen Commonwealth soldiers of World War I, who told me the stories of their valiant, dead relatives, and ripped my heart in two.In Matera, Italy, there were Cosimo, Angelica, Mariangela, Alessandro and Marcello, who introduced me to possibly the world’s most delicious food, panzerotto (fried dough with cheese and tomato sauce), and made me feel like I was family, even with my rusty Italian.In Kigali, Rwanda, there was M.A., now a surrogate sister, and her entire family, who hosted me at a birthday gathering two days after I met them, while also sharing their stories of surviving genocide.What’s the biggest lesson you’ve learned? is a question I often get. I always answer, “That people are fundamentally good around the world.”Solo travel is an experience I’d urge every human, and particularly every woman, to try at least once. You’ll find that while you might physically be without people you know, you’re rarely alone. I had a device in my pocket that allowed me to call home, and to post a picture on an app that opened up conversations with strangers who just seemed to want to wish me well.While in Patagonia, I spent four hours climbing a volcano in the rain by myself, to reach a desolate summit with nothing but burned trees and ashen pebbles. Out of the freezing cold mist came a hooded figure. “Hablas esapañol o ingles?” I asked. English, he told me. He was a vegan punk-rock drummer from Berlin who liked to laugh a lot and pet stray dogs, and we ended up traveling together for the next five days.My parents were my rocks through the ups and the downs. Weekly phone calls with my therapist were among the best work I did. Certain friends became lifelines. There was Heidi Vogt, with her endless logistical know-how; Jean Lee, an expert on Korea and also on how to pack for any eventuality; Chiwan Choi, a poet friend who kept me clearheaded on writing; Marie Ternes, who talked me through story ideas even two days before having her first child.For the past week, I’ve stayed put in my 52nd place, the small town of Kep on the Cambodian Coast. The plan was to spend the holidays alone in this tranquil, piece of heaven on the beach, banging out my final articles.Then I got an Instagram DM from an acquaintance from Los Angeles. She had seen a photo I’d posted from Kep, and it was a strange coincidence, but she and a girlfriend would be there the next day. Then I got another message from Ben, who lives in Bangkok. He and his girlfriend, Zoe, were trying to figure out one last vacation to take before they moved to New York. Would I recommend Kep? Within 10 minutes he sent me his hotel booking and flight information.The next morning, I befriended a British family at my hotel and we got along so well we went on a sunset cruise together. The posse grew with each new arrival. We’d feast on crabs and then head to a bar to play cards until the owner kicked us out. It was a magical holiday, and in it I could see glimpses of the future, of being surrounded by found family, content in each other’s company, of traveling solo but never being, or desiring to be, truly alone.What’s next? I don’t know. I might be physically going back to the apartment I left behind in Brooklyn 12 months ago, but the center of my life isn’t there for me anymore. It’s with me and it’s mobile.Follow NY Times Travel on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

CreditCreditBrad Dickson for The New York TimesSupported byBy Stefanos ChenMore than 20,000 new apartments in New York, both for sale and for rent, will open their doors this year — and likely just a fraction will find residents by year end.The affordable ones, of course, will attract thousands of applicants, but the bulk of the new units — in gleaming towers, many of them conceived at the height of the last housing boom — will enter a saturated market, where buyers and renters have ample choice and little incentive to rush.At the current rate of sales, it will take more than six years to sell all of the new development in Manhattan alone, which totals almost 8,000 units, said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel Real Estate Appraisers and Consultants.The pace of sales has already slowed coming into the new year, with homes seeking $4 million or more taking an average of 447 days to go into contract in 2018, according to Olshan Realty. In the halcyon days of 2013, similar homes spent only 172 days on the market.Suffice it to say that newcomers will have much to prove in 2019. In Manhattan, where developers bet big on Far West Side and downtown sites, in areas unaccustomed to hulking towers, proof of concept will rest on the pace of sales — and most everyone is being tight-lipped about numbers. In Brooklyn, the impending partial L train closure could damage recent momentum in the rental market. And in Queens, awash with ambitious towers even before the announcement of Amazon’s campus, the new year will begin to untangle hype from reality. That’s good news for buyers and renters who can afford the expensive new offerings, and if the market slumps further, perhaps a boon for those seeking lower prices still. The Times asked Localize.city, a data company that focuses on New York housing, to search city building records for residential projects that have been under construction for more than two years. Some may drag into 2020, but the majority are expecting move-ins this year, and many of the condos have been quietly selling units based on floor plans for months or even years.Out of 28,513 anticipated units, roughly 20,000 will be ready by the end of the year, said Israel Schwartz, a data analyst with the company. That’s about the same as last year, and down from the peak of 25,000 units in 2017, but still higher than in the bullish years of 2012 to 2015, when demand outpaced supply and 14,000 units on average were completed every year.Brooklyn will have the most openings overall, with 13,272 apartments across 421 buildings, many of them concentrated in Williamsburg. Manhattan will come in second, with 6,342 units in 79 buildings, followed by Queens, with 6,302 units in 154 buildings. The Bronx, in the early stages of a building boom, and Staten Island will lag behind, with 2,471 and 126 units respectively.These projects will have to compete with historically high inventory already crowding the market, said Grant Long, the senior economist for the real estate website StreetEasy. As of November, there were 9,425 homes for sale in Manhattan, up 18 percent from a year earlier; Brooklyn had 5,365 units, up 21 percent; and Queens had 3,267 units, a 35 percent jump.There are outliers, like 220 Central Park South, which began closings last quarter and is hoping to sell a record-breaking $250 million four-level penthouse, but its success doesn’t have much bearing on the rest of the market. Weakness in the sales market has helped shore up rental demand in recent months, but landlords’ reliance on concessions has continued to grow in all three boroughs, suggesting tight competition and overzealous pricing, according to a recent Douglas Elliman report.The following projects, a sampling of the largest in the city, will lead the way or darken the path ahead for the next wave of builders.If Billionaires’ Row in Manhattan, a canyon of uber-luxury condos in the heart of the borough, represents the last building boom, the next cycle may be defined by projects that hug the fringes of the island.Four of the top five new Manhattan projects with the most units are near the waterfront, in areas long ignored by luxury developers.One Manhattan Square, an 800-foot tower with 815 units, looms over the small neighborhood of Two Bridges, south of Chinatown. Developed by Extell, a company that helped set off the luxury buying frenzy in the last cycle, this project could spur a similar push on the Lower East Side.Prices at the tower start at $1.2 million for one-bedrooms and just over $3.5 million for three-bedrooms. The unit mix leans toward one- and two-bedrooms — a safer bet than the behemoth apartments that characterized the last cycle, many of which are struggling to find buyers.There will be more than 100,000 square feet of perks, including a two-lane bowling alley, a hammam-style spa, an adult tree house and an outdoor tea pavilion. The priciest unit currently listed, a $13.18 million duplex penthouse, is under contract, said Raizy Haas, a senior vice president at Extell. Beyond some marquee sales, however, the developer is quiet on progress.Top 10 NeighborhoodsUnder construction for more than two yearsUnitsBuildings123456789  10Long Island City, QueensWilliamsburg, BrooklynBedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn Flatbush, BrooklynGreenpoint, BrooklynAstoria, QueensBushwick, BrooklynLower East Side, ManhattanHudson Yards, ManhattanFlushing, Queens235278 2718303044272,2191,9041,585 1,4731,4541,3221,1921,088 1,003928Top 10 NeighborhoodsUnder construction for more than two yearsUnitsBuildings1  2  3    4  5  6  7  8   9   10Long Island City, Queens Williamsburg, Brooklyn Bedford-Stuyvesant,Brooklyn Flatbush,Brooklyn Greenpoint,Brooklyn Astoria, Queens Bushwick, Brooklyn Lower East Side, Manhattan Hudson Yards, Manhattan Flushing, Queens2,219  1,904  1,585   1,473  1,454  1,322  1,192  1,088   1,003   92823  52  78    27  18  30  30  4   4   27Source: Localize.cityBy The New York Times“We’re not doing updates,” said Gary Barnett, the president and founder of the company, but added that he was pleased with sales. Marketing for the tower began in 2015, and according to a 2017 filing with the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, 100 of the 815 units had sold at the time.To drum up interest, Extell offered to cover three to five years of common charges in its new buildings, which could amount to tens of thousands of dollars a year on larger units. The promotion was set to end in 2018, but Mr. Barnett said the company may extend the deal. Extell is also paying buyers’ brokers half of their commissions at contract signing, sometimes a year or more ahead of closing — a rare and somewhat risky incentive, as early buyers could seek to back out of their purchases.Perhaps the project’s biggest perk is a version of tax abatement, no longer available to builders, that covers most of a buyer’s property taxes for 20 years. (In exchange, the developer built about 200 below-market-rate rentals in a building adjacent to the tower, for applicants who make roughly between $34,000 and $57,000.)The building’s success could influence three luxury rental projects planned nearby. In December, the City Council filed a lawsuit to force a public review of the proposed towers, which range from about 700 feet to more than 1,000 feet, to reconsider the height and unit mix of the towers. (Extell’s project was exempt because it was built as-of-right.)The developers have promised infrastructure upgrades, including funding for a nearby public housing complex and neighborhood parks, local subway improvements and about 700 new units to be leased below market rate.But the towers could also bring about 2,100 luxury rentals to the largely lower-income neighborhood, and that would hasten the displacement of longtime residents, said Chris Walters, a rezoning specialist with the nonprofit Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development. And the range of “affordable” units will stretch the meaning of the word, he said, with some reserved for families making more than $100,000 a year.How the Extell project performs will determine whether other developers take a risk on the neighborhood, said Mr. Long, the StreetEasy economist: “It will seal the fate of what happens with the rest of those buildings.”The 15 Hudson Yards building, in a part of the Far West Side of Midtown that has been in the spotlight since its 2005 rezoning, will open its 392 units to the first residents this quarter.“Hudson Yards seems to be an anomaly, because our traffic is still good,” said Sherry Tobak, a senior vice president of Related Companies, one of the developers. But she declined to offer sales figures. Units in the tower, which has 285 luxury condos and 107 below-market rentals, now range in price from less than $4 million for two-bedrooms to $32 million for the choicest penthouse. Ms. Tobak admitted to “some degree of concession,” including coverage of the so-called mansion tax, which amounts to 1 percent of the sale price of anything above $1 million. The first listings were offered in 2016, based on plans and renderings.“I still haven’t seen it,” said Ann Cutbill Lenane, an agent with Douglas Elliman, of the two-bedroom she bought for herself after closing on a similar unit for a client. Ms. Lenane, who went into contract about 18 months ago, said she was impressed by the amenities, including a resident dining room where she will be able to entertain up to 65 people. The project also has a 20-year tax abatement for buyers.“Did I buy it a little high? Maybe,” she said. But given how many attractions have been built around the tower, including the futuristic Shed cultural center and the nearby High Line, she is confident of its value.Due north, near the water’s edge of the Upper West Side, three vitreous towers collectively known as Waterline Square are also expecting residents this year. In total, they will add 263 condos and 868 rental units to the site of former rail yards, largely ignored for decades. Developed by GID Development Group, each tower was designed by a different architect, with condos beginning around the 20th floor. Prices range from $1.925 million for one-bedrooms to $17.25 million for penthouses, but the bulk of the units are two-bedrooms starting at around $3 million. Here, too, buyers will receive lengthy tax abatements.“It’s been difficult to get deals done this year,” said Melissa Ziweslin, a senior managing director at Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, which is marketing the towers. Starting last spring, agents who brought buyers were given a 4 percent commission, higher than the standard 3 percent, she said, as an added incentive.Even with the slowdown in 2018, Ms. Ziweslin said, the units were selling at an average of $2,549 a square foot, or about 25 percent higher than those in nearby buildings.The luxury rental project at 420 Kent, part of an 857-unit complex on the South Williamsburg waterfront, will be the largest to open its doors in Brooklyn this year. About half of the completed units are spoken for, said David J. Maundrell, who is leading the marketing with Citi Habitats New Developments, but would not say how many units that represents. Prices range from $2,350 a month for studios to more than $10,000 a month for the largest apartments.The blocky three-tower complex, developed by a company owned by Eliot Spitzer, the former governor of New York, will have two rooftop swimming pools, a landscaped garden and a waterfront park on the East River. A subsidized ferry service to Wall Street and Midtown departs nearby.“We had people wanting to give us sight-unseen deposits,” Mr. Maundrell said, adding that weakness in the sales market has attracted some would-be buyers who could have decided to rent instead. But in April, the L train, a major artery for the fast-gentrifying neighborhoods along its route, will partly shut down for 15 months of repairs. That could hurt a number of projects opening in 2019, including 420 Kent, which relies on the only viable alternative for many Williamsburg commuters, the JMZ subway lines.“All of those lines will be a lot more congested,” said Mr. Miller, the real estate appraiser. With the added headaches, he said, “people may just look elsewhere,” as renters have a wealth of new options hitting the market.In November, 46.5 percent of rentals offered concessions in the form of free rent or discounted broker fees, up from 18.6 percent a year earlier, Mr. Miller said. And of the new units that were leased in November, nearly 80 percent offered sweeteners. The median rent, after concessions, was $2,736 a month, down 0.7 percent from the previous year.The impending arrival of Amazon’s New York campus in the Queens neighborhood of Long Island City has agents and developers hoping the buzz will translate to deals. But even before the announcement, the area was primed to have the most new units of any market in the city: almost 2,220, across 23 buildings, to open by year end.After 2019, Long Island City will continue to lead residential building citywide, with 5,125 more units expected in the years to come; the only market to approach that number is Williamsburg, with 3,437 units.“It’s like Williamsburg was five or six years ago,” said Jerry Wolkoff, the developer behind 5Pointz, the beloved street-art haven being converted to luxury rentals. (A group of artists won a $6.7 million judgment last year after Mr. Wolkoff whitewashed their murals without notice in 2013; Mr. Wolkoff, who had allowed the artists to paint there for years, is appealing the decision.)The rental tower, which will retain the 5Pointz name, will have about 1,115 units, with 500 to 700 ready for occupancy this summer, he said. Pricing hasn’t been established, but 20 percent of the units will be below market rate.Is Mr. Wolkoff worried about overbuilding or some residents’ distaste for how the tower was erected? “It will rent itself, because of the amenities and what I’ve done with the building,” he said, adding that new commissioned graffiti will be displayed throughout the project.The building frenzy has also spilled over into neighboring areas of western Queens, like Astoria, where the Durst Organization is building a seven-tower complex, near the banks of the East River, called Halletts Point. The first tower, a 22-story, 404-unit brick building, in which 20 percent of units will be below market rate, will open around March.The building, with unobstructed views on all four sides, will have mostly studio and one-bedroom apartments, with a smattering of two- and-three bedrooms, said Jordan Barowitz, the company’s vice president of public affairs.The Amazon news “is definitely a shot in the arm for Halletts,” he said, but added that the company isn’t counting on that in the short term, as only several hundred Amazon employees will report to Long Island City in 2019.Still, the move is a tantalizing, if mainly symbolic, prospect for builders coming to market this year.“It’s a quick commute to Astoria from Anable Basin,” he said, referring to Amazon’s proposed base in Long Island City, still years away.For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

By Katherine RosmanOn a recent Thursday evening, Jordan Roth, a Broadway producer of “Angels in America” and “Kinky Boots,” was serving as the M.C. of a party hosted by Town & Country magazine on the top floor of the Standard Hotel in downtown Manhattan. Wearing sequined pants and a jeweled hairpin, he kvelled with Kelly Ripa, dressed in blue velvet. Ms. Ripa presented an award to Lizzie Tisch, a supporter of jewelry designers, whom the event was honoring. Adam Rippon, the effervescent skating star, was there too, as was Lady Kitty Spencer, an English fashion model who perched on a chair, dripping in Bulgari, which pays her to do just that.The celebrities were all being tended to by Nicole Vecchiarelli and Andrea Oliveri, the founders of a company called (with insidery resonance for anyone in the magazine business) Special Projects. That has long been a euphemistic term for editors who wrangle celebrities and are cozy with publicists. Ms. Oliveri and Ms. Vecchiarelli, both 43, are former special projects and entertainment editors, at publications including Details, W, Teen Vogue and InStyle, and now work with people like Stellene Volandes, the editor in chief of Town & Country, founded more than a century ago.In an era when glossy print publications are floundering and relying on revenue and publicity from conferences and the like, Special Projects is helping take the page to the stage. They are what the Business of Fashion events, a New York magazine/The Cut “How I Get It Done Day,” speaking opportunities at the women’s club the Wing, a Kate Spade advertising campaign, a Kanye West listening party in Wyoming and a WSJ. Magazine dinner hosted by Julia Roberts all have in common.This week, the company was hired by Glossier, the cosmetics brand that grew out of the Into the Gloss blog, to broker talent for a forthcoming marketing campaign.A big part of Ms. Vecchiarelli and Ms. Oliveri’s business is predicting who tomorrow’s stars will be. At the Town & Country soiree, they were shepherding Melanie Liburd, cast this season as a regular on “This Is Us.”“I’m the new girl on a hit show, and it is so wonderful that I get to meet all these new people,” Ms. Liburd said, wearing a bright Kelly-green suit. She huddled with Ms. Oliveri and Ms. Vecchiarelli, all chatting like they were old friends.“Amazing!” Ms. Oliveri said in response to a remark from the actress.Ms Vecchiarelli said, “Facts!” Special Projects’ offices (one in New York, where Ms. Vecchiarelli lives; one in Los Angeles, where Ms. Oliveri does) are now an essential stop on the press tours of young and rising celebrities. There, the women meet and chat with the young artists, to get a sense of their personal stories, charm, intelligence and ambitions. They take Polaroids and put them up on a wall, a mural of before-they-were-famous and who’s-that? that already includes Naomi Scott of “Power Rangers,” the “Sharp Objects” actress Eliza Scanlen, Letitia Wright of “Black Panther” and the actor Harvey Guillen.The partners think Mr. Guillen, who has a role on the coming FX show “What We Do in the Shadows,” is going to break through. “I really wanted him to be a presenter at the Jewelry Awards,” Ms. Vecchiarelli said. But she didn’t think the logistics would work.She booked Mr. Roth after meeting with him last fall at his publicist’s request. During a three-hour coffee date, they discussed his goals and the ways that he might expand his public profile. “A love explosion,” Ms. Vecchiarelli said. As a champion of fashion and culture, he seemed the perfect host for a magazine event. “There is something about the DNA of Jordan’s career and persona that overlaps completely with the DNA of Town & Country,” she said.Mr. Roth was indeed a hit. “Raise your hand if you spent your childhood trying on your mother’s or grandmother’s jewelry,” he instructed the crowd. “And that is why we are all here tonight! Also why some of us are gay.” Everyone ate it up.“This is the most genius business model,” Mr. Roth said of Special Projects, before the ceremony began. “It’s the type of thing where everyone is going to be asking why they didn’t think of it before.”Ms. Oliveri and Ms. Vecchiarelli started to work in the magazine industry just as celebrities were replacing models as the preferred cover subjects.Ms. Oliveri, called Dre by those who know her, started her career in 1997 at W magazine as the assistant to the creative director and later became a photo and bookings editor, scheduling photographers, models, makeup artists and stylists. She then moved to Details, where she remained for a decade, choosing talent for the cover.This was a more challenging job. Details had been brought back to life in 2000 after having been closed and was seen as a less important stepbrother to GQ. “We weren’t first on the list for hot male actors,” Ms. Oliveri said. Also, to get any attention on the newsstand — newsstands were still a factor then — she and her colleagues knew they needed to poke fun at the celebrities they were highlighting. For an Owen Wilson cover that Ms. Oliveri had booked, the magazine cover line read: “Who Picked This Nose to Rescue Hollywood?” Another issue’s cover line: “Adrien Brody Loves Being Famous.”“There was a lot to learn here,” she said. “How do you connect with your reader and stand out from the homogenized magazine pack without alienating the Hollywood community you need?”Ms. Vecchiarelli has hopped from magazine to magazine through her career, familiarizing herself with different audiences’ tastes. She started as an intern at Elle in 1998, before becoming an assistant at Mirabella, whose audience was older and culturally sophisticated.She next joined Us Weekly in 2000, the year the magazine went from a monthly to a weekly publication. She often needed to book four celebrity photo shoots and interviews per week. “Boot camp,” Ms. Vecchiarelli called it. She focused on looking for emerging stars to feed the beast. Then she went to Premiere (R.I.P.), then in 2002 to Teen Vogue.In its print heyday, Teen Vogue was edited by Amy Astley, an exacting protégée of Anna Wintour. For any given entertainment feature, Ms. Vecchiarelli had to learn how to please many masters: Ms. Astley, Ms. Wintour, the publicist, the celebrity, the fashion photographer, the stylist. The goal was to make “the opportunity work for everyone involved, all of whom thought they were the star of the show,” she said.Thanks to Ms. Wintour, Ms. Vecchiarelli was able to establish Teen Vogue as a tryout for young stars hoping to one day receive coverage in Vogue. She booked an early Jake Gyllenhaal’s first cover and one of Emily Blunt’s first big glossy magazine shoots. She worked with Nicole Richie, Bradley Cooper, Channing Tatum, Zac Efron, all of them then young and not the big names they are today.After five years, she landed at Details, where she and Ms. Oliveri quickly became “work wives,” sharing an affinity for both high and low culture. They believed in the importance of landing the right cover star at the right time and also highlighting young actors and actresses before they became household names.Ms. Vecchiarelli hopscotched to InStyle in 2008, and in 2012 she became the founding editor of DuJour, a lifestyle magazine. The same year, Ms. Oliveri left Details to go freelance. She began to work with Kristina O’Neill, who had been named editor in chief of WSJ. Magazine. Ms. O’Neill asked Ms. Oliveri to help her think about cover subjects; these did not have to be solely ones that would “pop” at the newsstand, since the magazine, published 12 times a year, is included with the weekend edition of The Wall Street Journal.For the November 2013 issue, devoted to innovators (and for an accompanying awards ceremony), Ms. Oliveri booked the helmet-wearing electronic music duo Daft Punk, who were enjoying peak fame thanks to “Get Lucky,” the chart-topping collaboration with Pharrell. This was a big “get” because the men under the helmets hide their faces and don’t do a lot of press.Ms. Oliveri and Ms. O’Neill decided to book Gisele Bündchen to pose for the cover shoot with Daft Punk and then to escort them to and from the stage to receive their award, presented by Pharrell, also secured by Ms. Oliveri. “This is so beyond a ‘Get me Gwyneth!’ relationship,” Ms. O’Neill said. “I speak to Dre more than I speak to people who sit 10 feet from me. We are in lock step on everything.” (However, Ms. Oliveri did get Ms. O’Neill Gwyneth, for a cover article and live interview at a tech conference, as well as Kevin Systrom, a founder of Instagram, and the comedian and actor Kevin Hart.)Ms. Oliveri started to get more and more booking business. “Big, big, big celebs were seeing the importance of digital media,” she said. “Then ad campaigns started coming in asking for my help. I was thinking, ‘There is something here.’”Ms. Vecchiarelli was editing DuJour and would join business executives as they met with prospective advertisers. “They would say, ‘I don’t want to advertise with you, but I like your ideas and your connections to talent, and what if instead of buying an ad, we could bring you on as our partner and you could book the talent for this branded content or for an event?’” she said. “People were so hungry for ideas.”During this time, Ms. Oliveri and Ms. Vecchiarelli kept discussing the shifts they were seeing in the magazine industry. “Dre was like, ‘We’re almost 40, we have a long time left in our careers. We can’t just stay on the Titanic till the Titanic goes down,’” Ms. Vecchiarelli said.In 2016 Ms. Vecchiarelli quit her job, and she and Ms. Oliveri opened for business. Town & Country was an early client. Ms. Volandes had just been named editor of the magazine and was charged with bringing contemporary energy while keeping its core coverage of high society and the charity scene.Ms. Vecchiarelli works closely with Ms. Volandes to choose subjects for the cover and does much of the work to book them.They also spend months planning the magazine’s Philanthropy Summit, a daylong event that took place for the first time in 2014. “She understands how to bring the magazine to life in ways that are completely true to what Town & Country readers care about, but also to who they should care about,” Ms. Volandes said.For last year’s summit and a philanthropy issue, Ms. Vecchiarelli booked Lin-Manuel Miranda for a cover; then he and his family appeared on stage to discuss giving as a family tradition. Karlie Kloss appeared on another version of the cover and was interviewed at the summit about her coding-for-girls program, Kode With Klossy, by one its graduates. A third cover and onstage discussion featured March for Our Lives student activists, including Emma Gonzalez and others who survived the Parkland, Fla., school shooting. “Nicole went to Florida and created a bond of trust with those students and their parents,” Ms. Volandes said. “It was Nicole who made it happen.”Lectures, live interviews and panel discussions have become important for companies outside of the media business too. The Wing, the women’s membership club with five spaces in different cities, has hired Special Projects to book celebrities, including Jennifer Lopez, Laura Dern, Aly Raisman and Regina Hall.Amanda Silverman, a founder of the new publicity firm the Lede Company, and a representative for Pharrell, Charlize Theron, John Legend and others, has known the women since they all were coming up in the celebrity-media industrial complex. For an “Incredible Women” event hosted by Porter, Net-a-Porter’s magazine, and promoted by the Lede, Special Projects booked Ms. Theron and chose for her to read a passage by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie on the importance of raising boys right. Storm Reid and Mahershala Ali did a reading of correspondence between Barack Obama and a young girl.“They’re real strategists,” Ms. Silverman said. “There is zero drama with them. They are never not calm, and they are dealing with high-energy, high- intensity situations with demanding people like me.”Gabe Tesoriero, the executive vice president of media and artists relations for Def Jam Recordings, knew Ms. Vecchiarelli when she was at Teen Vogue and had worked with Ms. Oliveri on a Kanye West cover for Details. More recently, he learned from Ms. Silverman that the two women had started casting/celebrity wrangling company. Last May, when he needed to find a slew of celebrities quickly, he turned to them.Mr. West had contacted Mr. Tesoriero with “the spark of the idea,” Mr. Tesoriero said. “He was in Wyoming and said, ‘I need to bring the world to me, to hear the music where it was created.’”Mr. West’s team and the Def Jam staff sprang into action. When discussions turned to the listening party’s guest list, Mr. Tesoriero instantly thought of Special Projects. “I said, ‘I know exactly who should handle this.’”Within 48 hours, Special Projects had 2Chainz, Nas and Big Sean on private planes headed to Jackson Hole, Wyo.The Special Projects women also sent Jonah Hill there. Mr. Hill has known Ms. Vecchiarelli for years, and she booked him for his first real photo shoot, for Teen Vogue. When she reached out while he was in a meeting with Scott Rudin, he left mid-meeting to get clothes at home and immediately left for the trip.“The millennials go crazy for experiences,” said Mr. Hill in a phone interview he gave while in an Uber on his way to therapy.The hip-hop junket got him thinking. In a few months, his own project would be released: “Mid90s,” the first film he directed, which explores friendship, skateboarding and hip-hop culture.“I was like, ‘Why isn’t Nicole throwing all these, curating screenings and amazing events, things that would be experiential?’” he said. He and his producer Eli Bush then hired Special Projects to invite the right people. “They have incredible ideas,” Mr. Hill said of Ms. Oliveri and Ms. Vecchiarelli. His favorite has been one to hire Prince Paul to D.J. the party after the hip-hop tastemaker screening. Mr. Paul is a recording artist who was prolific in the 1990s.Well, that got Mr. Bush thinking. He was starting to plan opening night for a Broadway play that Mr. Bush was producing with Mr. Rudin and Barry Diller: Aaron Sorkin’s adaptation of “To Kill a Mockingbird.” Mr. Bush brought on Special Projects to help fill the theater and party afterward with whomever they thought should be there, he said. Among those on the Special Projects list: Oprah Winfrey, Spike Lee and Hasan Minhaj (formerly of “The Daily Show”) But the women also invited activists and intellects like Brittany Packnett, who is a police reform activist and a “Pod Save the People” host, and Darnell Moore, the author of “No Ashes in the Fire.”These are people who would not otherwise have been on Mr. Bush’s radar. Of Special Projects, he said, “We would hire them for anything and everything, and plan to.” Katherine Rosman is a features reporter.

Now that’s a ball change!Me and my shadow: the actor photographed at the Whitby Hotel in Manhattan.CreditCreditDaniel Dorsa for The New York TimesSupported byBy Maureen DowdNo one playing Bob Fosse could feel like a good dancer.Not even Sam Rockwell, who can shimmy so well that many of his movie characters cannot make it to the end of a film without busting a move. He improvised slinky malefactor slides for his villains in “Charlie’s Angels” and “Iron Man 2.” The way he grooved through a diner in a Flight Facilities music video was reminiscent of Christopher Walken’s cool dance number for Fatboy Slim’s “Weapon of Choice.” Mr. Rockwell danced his “Saturday Night Live” monologue with top hat and cane and did a split in a fitted suit on “The Tonight Show.” And at the Vanity Fair Oscar party in February, he and his girlfriend, the actress Leslie Bibb, kicked off a dance circle that led to Glenn Close tearing up the floor in a glittering jumpsuit.“Leslie’s a pretty good hoofer,” Mr. Rockwell said about his tall, lithe girlfriend, who played Will Ferrell’s wife in “Talladega Nights” and has a coming series on Netflix as a superhero mom. “She’s got that kind of Ann Reinking frame, and she can actually krump a little.”The actor, 50, looked beat when I met him one recent Saturday afternoon at the Bowery Hotel to talk about his latest project, “Fosse/Verdon,” an eight-part series on FX. It also stars Michelle Williams, as Gwen Verdon, and was conjured by Lin-Manuel Miranda and Thomas Kail, who directed “Hamilton” and “In the Heights,” and the producer Steven Levenson. Nicole Fosse, the daughter of the two dancers who embodied Broadway razzle-dazzle, is also a producer. It is based on Sam Wasson’s biography “Fosse.”The redheaded Verdon, Mr. Wasson told me, was “the greatest musical comedy star of all time, arguably,” winning four Tonys in six years in the 1950s. Fosse was the only person to win an Oscar (“Cabaret”), Tonys (“Pippin”) and Emmys (“Liza With a Z”) in the same year.Mr. Rockwell had gone to SoulCycle that morning to stay lean while playing the sinuous Fosse, who had an addiction to work, women, Camels, Dexedrine and Seconal, not to mention his lifelong satyriasis. And then Mr. Rockwell had gone to a four-hour rehearsal.He ambled in with his “old lady,” Sadie, a German shepherd. He was wearing a beanie he kept from his movie with Hilary Swank, “Conviction,” a brown print Prada shirt, black dance pants and dance shoes, and a kneepad like Fosse used to wear. Sadie, wearing a vest labeled with the word “service,” is an emotional support dog.Mr. Rockwell ordered two different Amaros, one sweet and one bitter, and asked me if I wanted a sip of Fernet. “It settles your tummy,” he said, his hazel eyes earnest.Like Fosse and Verdon, Mr. Rockwell was exposed to show business early. Both parents were aspiring actors. He picked up some moves in middle school in San Francisco. He wanted to get away from “a white supremacist group,” and started hanging out with “a crowd that wanted to dance. We went to high school dances and it was when ‘Footloose’ and Michael Jackson’s ‘Thriller’ album was out. And break dancing. It was a way to meet girls, and I just kind of got into it, got into James Brown.”When they began making the series, Mr. Rockwell recalled, “I was cocky and I said, ‘I can dance,’ so I went into this room and I tried to keep up, and it became apparent pretty fast that I am not a real dancer. And even though I have rhythm and I can move, picking up choreography like that is a different thing. Doing ballet, jazz, tap since you were 6 is different than what I do.”He went for intensive lessons in fundamental tap dancing and Fosse 101. “Tap is hard,” he said.And he had to shave his head to accommodate the hairpiece of Fosse’s stringy comb-over.Fosse changed movies and Broadway forever, inventing an original American dance idiom: syncopated, tiny, isolated movements with shades of burlesque and showbiz with a capital S.“He added a dark sparkle, which is a hard thing to do in dance, to add negative feelings to something exuberant and vital,” Mr. Wasson told me. Just as Fosse was influenced by Charlie Chaplin (the bowler hat and “Sweet Charity” moves), Groucho Marx (the walk in “Steam Heat” in “Pajama Game”) and Fred Astaire (“Dancin’ Man”), he influenced many others; homages easy to discern in videos by Beyoncé, Usher, Justin Timberlake, Madonna, Lady Gaga and Michael Jackson, who tried to get Fosse to direct the “Thriller” video. (See Fosse play the Snake in “The Little Prince” to see what Jackson adapted.)The FX show’s creators know that the thrice-married, always unfaithful Fosse, who was constantly seducing his own dancers, is a dicey character to build a show around in the #MeToo era. That’s why they’ve elevated Verdon to the title and focused on her collaboration.Fosse manipulated but also wore his heart on his sleeve, telling women exactly who he was. Plagued by death, failure, self-contempt and his memories of being sexually abused in his early teens by hard-bitten burlesque dancers, he depicted an increasingly nihilistic view of humanity.“I learned about dancing from his demons because in his material, he was therapeutically raking himself over the coals,’’ said Andy Blankenbuehler, the choreographer of “Fosse/Verdon” and “Hamilton.” “As he got deeper into his own style, drawn to stories about broken people, heartbreak and abusive situations, his style was like a crushed Coke can. Shoulders more and more slumped forward, elbows pinched in, stillness on the outside but a dark engine rotating fast inside.”I read Mr. Rockwell something written in The New York Times about Fosse’s brutally truthful autobiographical masterwork, “All That Jazz”: It’s about “a man furiously driving his failing body like a worn-out sports car, throwing pills into it like a high-octane fuel, packing it with more and more girls, until he smashes it into the wall at the end of the world.”Mr. Rockwell agreed. “Because he was essentially, you could say, molested when he was 13, he had a complicated relationship with women. He revered them. His style certainly shows that. He’s not so much sexual as he is sensual. He celebrates women’s sensuality. He doesn’t demean it in his dance style. But at the same time, he had a lot of anger towards women.”He said that his acting coach referenced “Dead Ringers,” the movie in which Jeremy Irons plays creepy twins, as a good model for Fosse and Verdon.“It’s a complex romance,” Mr. Rockwell said. “It’s almost like they’re twins. There’s a symbiotic thing with them that transcends, not just a romantic relationship, it’s almost like they’re joined at the hip.”Just as Verdon left her baby son with her parents to return to dancing, Mr. Rockwell’s mother moved back to New York to pursue her performing career after her divorce, leaving 5-year-old Sam to be raised by his father, except in summer, when Sam joined her in New York. He would go along when she did singing telegrams. (Once, she sang to Jack Lemmon.)Mr. Kail noted the irony that the great success of Verdon and Fosse in “Damn Yankees” provided the template for the couple’s Faustian bargain. Fosse helped create Verdon as a leading lady when he choreographed her “Whatever Lola Wants, Lola Gets” dance as the devil’s temptress seducing an older baseball player in Washington to sell his soul to regain his youth. That’s when the dancers fell in love and he left his second wife, Joan McCracken, also a musical comedy star on Broadway. He hurt Verdon with his other women, but she kept working with him and she was with him when he died in D.C. at 60 from a heart attack just before the opening night of a “Sweet Charity” revival.Mr. Rockwell, who has now transcended his reputation as the quirky sidekick, is drawn toward gray. He was surprised by the backlash at the idea that his racist cop in “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri” seemed to be redeemed at the end of the movie (the role won him a Golden Globe and an Oscar for best supporting actor), but “I can’t worry about that.”“I grew up on the movies, the American films in the ’70s," he said. “They were all antiheroes. ‘Midnight Cowboy,’ ‘Taxi Driver,’ ‘Five Easy Pieces,’ ‘Badlands,’ ‘Silkwood,’ ‘Sophie’s Choice,’ ‘Raging Bull,’ ‘Mean Streets.’ These are all movies about antiheroes. You don’t see a lot of that now. You see a lot of superheroes, archetypes. I think antiheroes are really fun to play. They’re just more interesting characters. Like the guy in ‘Five Easy Pieces’ is kind of an ass. You know?”He padded himself up again for “Best of Enemies,” out in theaters next week, playing another porky racist who tangles with a strong woman and comes out a better person. There is unlikely to be the same blowback because Mr. Rockwell is playing a real person, an exalted grand cyclops of a Ku Klux Klan group in Durham, N.C., who becomes a convert to civil rights activism thanks to an African-American woman played by Taraji P. Henson.“Taraji is supercool,” he said. “We graduated high school the same year. We know the same songs.” They bonded over a shared appreciation of music, especially Doug E. Fresh’s ‘La Di Da Di.’”He said they were moved by the scalding spectacle of Charlottesville, Va., to make the movie. “Obviously, racism is still very much alive, you know?” he said. “And you have to continue to tell these stories. I know that ‘Do the Right Thing’ and ‘Mississippi Burning’ had a big effect on me when I grew up. So if I can contribute in that manner, then that’s a good thing.”As Mr. Rockwell likes to say, you don’t have to be an ass to play an ass. Maybe because he played a 10-year-old Rick once in an East Village improv comedy skit to his mother’s Ilsa, the actor is a great proselytizer for therapy. He even asks his shrink for advice on how to think of his characters.His partner in crime in “Charlie’s Angels,” Kelly Lynch, said Mr. Rockwell is “a doll” whose strength is his combination of “super-chill” and vulnerable.“He can slide into dark characters because he doesn’t judge them,” she said. “A lot of actors would say, ‘Ick, I don’t like this guy.’”Mr. Rockwell said he doesn’t believe that his character in “Three Billboards” is truly redeemed. “I think he’s on his way to something. But it’s like the end of ‘Good Will Hunting,’ when Matt Damon cries in Robin Williams’s arms, and then he drives off to find Minnie Driver. It’s like he’s done working on himself. Like, ‘Oh, no more therapy.’ You know? You don’t just cry and then not go to therapy anymore. So it’s the same thing with Dixon. He’s on his way to trying to be a better person. But he’s not done working on himself, and certainly Frances’s character has a lot of work to do on herself. They’re both screwed up.”[RELATED: Sam Rockwell shares a bit more about himself.]I asked him what he thinks happened to the characters played by him and Frances McDormand on that road trip to track down a rapist.“My theory is, maybe they went to a bar to get a little liquid courage to kill the guy, then they ended up getting drunk and making out," he said. “I don’t think they killed the guy.”I asked Martin McDonagh, the director and writer of the movie, what he thinks about that coda. Mr. McDonagh recoiled. “I don’t want to picture them fooling around,” he said. “That would be a dangerous little romance.”Mr. Rockwell has said he would let himself be eaten alive by rats to work with Mr. McDonagh. The Irishman said that he admires Mr. Rockwell because, while he is “the loveliest, nicest guy I’ve worked with, so smart and generous and a joy to be around,” he brings a “frisson of danger” to his performances.George Clooney seconded this sentiment. He gave Mr. Rockwell his breakthrough role, in “Confessions of a Dangerous Mind,” in which Chuck Barris, the creator of “The Gong Show,” claimed to be a C.I.A. assassin.“Sam is easily one of the best actors I’ve ever seen,” Mr. Clooney told me. “His ability to make you root for characters that ordinarily would be despised is uncanny.” Mr. Clooney concluded: “He makes it all seem so effortless. Come to think of it, I hate him.”Thomas Kail compared Mr. Rockwell to a jazz musician, who only makes surprising riffs after “he takes every scene and examines it and scrutinizes it and marinates in it.”That explains his pitch-perfect portrayal of George W. Bush in “Vice," for which he was also nominated for a best supporting actor Oscar.“I became obsessed,” he said. “I watched a lot of interviews. I listened to him on countless interviews. There’s an autobiography that he narrates. Then I had my dialect coach break it down.” He even talked to his shrink about it.“I began to find him really charming,” Mr. Rockwell said, adding that the key to impersonating W. was adding “a little Elvis, a thing in the lip. It actually gave me a little bit of a muscle twitch in my chin.”Ms. Bibb joked on the red carpet for the Golden Globes about how disturbing she found it, when he was playing that role, to be sexually attracted to Bush.Mr. Rockwell said that the thing he loves about Ms. Bibb, who sold her place in Los Angeles to move into his East Village apartment, is that she makes him laugh.When he first saw her act in a short film, he said, it seemed as though “Jessica Lange and a young Mary Tyler Moore and Carol Burnett all had a baby.” He added: “She’s a pistol. She definitely gives me a run for my money, challenges me. It’s never boring.”When they met more than a decade ago, in the lobby of Chateau Marmont, they flirted and he left his number with the maitre d’ to give to her.“I was like, oh boy, I’m in for it now. She better be a good actress. You can’t date a bad actor. Not long term, anyway.”They agreed to go on a date, but when Ms. Bibb suggested a day at the Getty Museum, Mr. Rockwell rolled his eyes and reluctantly agreed. They had such a good time, Ms. Bibb said, “Let’s get a drink. Let’s go to El Compadre and get a margarita.”But, Mr. Rockwell said, he had a “backup plan,” because he was “very single at the time” and he figured, “first date, nothing’s really going to happen on a museum date. And I was, you know, trying to be a man about town, but I was not succeeding at doing that. She knew I had a backup plan, so I said, ‘I just got to get my cigarettes and my coat, call my friend and tell him I can’t’ and she knew. She still makes fun of me about it. And then we went and got a drink.“I was never really good at being single. You have to stay up late. You have to drink when you don’t want to drink. You have to, you know, dating is horrible. You have to go through all these dates to get with somebody you want to talk to.”I wondered if he ever tried online dating.“I never had that swipe thing,” he said. “It’s dangerous.” In fact, the only stuff he does on his phone is texting and getting Ubers.He said that with two actors, it’s tricky. “You have to take turns being Elvis and Cher. You know what I mean. Like today, I’m on doggy duty.”I asked if he still doesn’t want kids.“Yeah, me and Leslie, we’re not doing the kid thing,” he said. “It’s not my jam. It’s not my thing. I’m more of an uncle type.”I wondered if it has to do with his childhood, when his parents broke up and he stayed with his father in San Francisco, while his bohemian mother moved to New York to pursue her acting career. (New York magazine once wrote that Mr. Rockwell had the air of having been raised by wolves “but very considerate wolves who write thank-you notes after they’ve eaten all your sheep.”)“It could be, but these days everybody comes from a broken home,” he replied. “My mom, she really is a good mother and she did the best she could. I think I’m too selfish to be a father. I think I know what it takes. You know? I just don’t want to put a kid through — my lifestyle is a little crazy, and I think Leslie feels a similar way — and frankly I’m too selfish. I want to have my life and wake up when I want to wake up. I’d rather take care of the dog and take care of Leslie and take care of myself.”What if he was with someone who wanted kids? I wondered.“It probably wouldn’t have worked out,” he said with a shrug.I noted that not much seems to have changed since his Oscar. He’s still in the same East Village pad.“I play jazz in the morning," he said. “This guy, Ahmad Jamal I like. You know, Stan Getz. I have a little vinyl. It’s nice to play in the nighttime. Put on some Bill Evans, Fleetwood Mac. Chet Baker, I love. Miles and Coltrane. With vinyl, sometimes you got to put a penny on the needle.”And with that, Sam and Sadie shimmied off. Leslie Bibb has dinner ready.Maureen Dowd, winner of the 1999 Pulitzer Prize for distinguished commentary and author of three New York Times best sellers, became an Op-Ed columnist in 1995.  @MaureenDowd • Facebook AdvertisementOnlyFans has put X-rated entertainment in the hands of its entertainers. Call it the paywall of porn.Dannii Harwood CreditCreditMolly Matalon for The New York TimesSupported byBy Jacob BernsteinEvery day, hundreds of men pay Dannii Harwood to enact their sexual fantasies and boost their self-esteem. Sometimes her clothes come off. Sometimes she dresses up as a nurse or a dominatrix. If a guy is a regular customer, she likely knows his birthday, the names of his children and his pets — even when to call after a surgical procedure.He may pay her to help him achieve an orgasm, though she is not a prostitute. He may purchase erotic videos from her, though she is not a porn star.Ms. Harwood is one of the top earners on OnlyFans, where subscribers — mostly male; straight, gay and beyond — pay models and social media influencers a fee, generally $5 to $20 a month, to view a feed of imagery too racy for Instagram. With that access, subscribers can also direct message and “tip” to get pictures or videos created on demand, according to their sexual tastes.Models who join the site often presume that their subscribers will increase in number if they post more often and make the content more explicit. The “more often” part is true. The “more explicit” part is not.At a time when anyone with a smartphone or small studio can become his or her own pornographer, and content is often free, the hottest site in the adult entertainment industry is dominated by providers who show fewer sex acts and charge increasing fees depending on how creative the requests get. That’s the first paradox at the center of the OnlyFans phenomenon.The most popular OnlyFans personality is Jem Wolfie, of Perth, Australia.She can’t help but laugh when people call her a “fitness model.” As she noted in an interview, “70 percent of my fans are men.” So the bulk of them aren’t looking for exercise tips, although she may provide them, for an added fee (along with healthy recipes — she used to be a chef).According to OnlyFans, she has 10,000 subscribers who pay $10 a month for access to a feed in which she shows off her Kardashianesque proportions, squatting in really tight leggings and squeezing her breasts together, strategically covering her nipples. “I’m a thick girl,” she said matter-of-factly.It doesn’t go much further than that.“Basically, OnlyFans is online go-go dancing,” said Matthew Camp, a 34-year-old model on the men’s side who broke into the business a decade ago writhing on platforms around downtown Manhattan for the party promoter Susanne Bartsch.If the four main quadrants of the gay approval matrix were daddy, twink, bear and boy next door, he seemed to sit smack in the center, not falling neatly into any of those categories but appealing to the potential audiences for each.With a G-string and a strobe light, he could make as much as $1,000 on a good night. Porn studios like Lucas Entertainment began calling.Mr. Camp was intrigued. “Having sex for money is appealing,” he said. But $1,000 seemed low for something that would sit on the internet and brand him for life as a porn star.So he turned them down and instead used a PG-13 feed on Instagram to build a following of more than half a million. About a year ago, as the club scene continued its slow death, he moved to Hudson, N.Y., and signed up for OnlyFans.Weeks often went by without him posting a single picture or video. He didn’t show a full penetrative sex clip for the first nine months, yet he still regularly took home more than $10,000 a month.“Tumblr was filled with the most extreme sexual experiences you could see,” he said. “And I think a lot of people were turned off by that. It’s not what they’re looking for. They want more intimate experiences. They want a boyfriend experience. They want to fantasize about someone that they want to have sex with and not feel disgusted by it.”From the late 1990s to the early 2000s, dreamers in the porn industry, centered in the San Fernando Valley of California, openly described their multi-million-dollar futures in the business. There was actually a history of this happening, at least for a small number of models signed to lucrative long-term contracts with studios like Vivid and Wicked.They could make north of $5,000 a scene and shoot a couple of those each week, according to Brian Gross, a well-known industry publicist. That income could be supplemented with five-figure sums doing nightclub appearances around the country on the weekends, he said.Jenna Jameson — the Julia Roberts of straight porn — even parlayed her notoriety into a memoir released by HarperCollins, “How to Make Love Like a Porn Star: A Cautionary Tale,” which was a New York Times best seller. The title turned out to be eerily prescient. As its publisher, Judith Regan, pointed out: “Porn went the way of all media.” It turns out, everyone could do it. Except that because porn was an industry of people already living on the margins of society, the effects for the performers were in many ways worse.The primary culprits were so-called tube sites: YouTube-like platforms that aggregated stolen pornographic content, disseminated it for free and sucked up revenue from banner and video ads. Since porn studios did not have the capital or political connections to sue their most threatening adversaries out of business (as the record industry did), rates for scene work dropped. Fewer scenes were shot overall. Eventually, the studios began selling themselves to the tube sites at fire-sale prices.It was as if the entire music business had been subsumed by Napster.By 2015, a handful of companies were able to exert monopolistic control over the industry. MindGeek is the biggest player of all. The crown jewel of its empire is Pornhub (perhaps the most popular tube site in the world), which is supplied with content from numerous in-house production companies of the straight (Brazzers.com, Reality Kings) and gay varieties (SeanCody, Men.com).MindGeek knows all about porn habits by doing comprehensive data analysis. It has shown less of an affinity for the product or the people who appear in it.The MindGeek website makes no reference to the fact that the overwhelming majority of its customers are consumers of hard-core pornography. The technocrats who built the company got rich. Many of the performers who helped enable their success became prostitutes, offering their services on websites like RentMen.com and The Erotic Review when scene work ceased to be a viable way to make a living. It’s a fitting but unfortunate parable in an era of rampant economic inequality.“If you have a known name, it’s much easier to market your services,” said Dirk Caber, a porn star who has filmed close to 40 scenes for MindGeek’s most popular gay site, Men.com, since 2013. Most of his income comes from his work as an escort, because this scene work pays so little.“The whole industry did a 180,” Mr. Gross said. “When I started, there were actually websites that would out famous porn stars if they escorted, because it was shocking, for lack of a better word. Now, all talent is looked at as if they are escorts, and those who aren’t have to come out and say so.”One alternative to escorting is webcamming. In England, there are even TV stations, like Playboy and Babestation, on which models talk live with thousands of customers and earn several hundred dollars a day. That’s what Ms. Harwood did before OnlyFans came along.She grew up in Wales, with a mother who stocked supermarket shelves and a father who was a factory worker. It was a “typical working-class” household, she said recently, while on a vacation in New York that included a trip to the 9/11 memorial and the taking of many hotel room selfies. As a little girl, Ms. Harwood was a relentless attention seeker, the sort who appeared in school plays, competed in beauty pageants and studied dance. She also had reservoirs of empathy that would serve her well later in life.She could spot pain in others and find ways to make them feel better. She also was capable of identifying her limitations and finding ways to chart new paths for herself. “I was raised well,” she said. She studied dance at Laine Theatre Arts, a prestigious drama and dance college near London. Then, “I went to audition after audition,” she said. “Eventually, I realized I wasn’t good enough. And it was quite hard to accept at first.”Around 2005, Ms. Harwood posed topless on Page 3 of The Daily Sport, a second-tier British newspaper that she said “was popular with day laborers and construction workers.”This apparently included the guys her father worked with. One morning, he went into work and saw the picture of his daughter plastered to his locker. On her face, his colleagues had drawn his mustache and glasses. That’s how he found out she was modeling nude. That’s why he warned her about being disowned.Ms. Harwood felt terrible. Although she likes taking off her clothes for other people, she seems driven less by the desire to transgress than the desire to please. If she were reincarnated as a Disney character, she’d be Jessica Rabbit, not Miss Piggy. But it wasn’t like her father had the money to support her. His warning was sort of an empty threat. So she kept going, with appearances in Playboy and British so-called laddie magazines. In 2011, Ms. Harwood worked for a soft-core site called GlamGirls and became friendly with its owner, Tim Stokely, an earnest technocrat who looks like Mark Zuckerberg by way of Savile Row. Soon after, Mr. Stokely founded a site called Customs4U, which Ms. Harwood said, lightheartedly, may have been her idea and was like OnlyFans in beta. The pitch was to offer horny guys the ability to become their own directors, ordering specially made videos from their favorite models.It sputtered along while Instagram — which is free and doesn’t allow full nudity — took off. Then Mr. Stokely had his light bulb moment: Why not find a way for influencers to directly monetize their content. The platform — OnlyFans — would be similar to Instagram or Twitter except fans would have to pay a monthly subscription to view influencers’ content and interact with them.It would therefore be a natural bolt-on to the influencer’s existing social media. A free feed on Instagram or Twitter could promote and drive traffic to the subscription-only feed on OnlyFans.Eighty percent of the fees collected for each feed would go to the provider. Twenty percent would go to OnlyFans (although after merchant and processing fees, Mr. Stokely says its take is around 12 percent). This is roughly the same arrangement Uber has with its drivers, except that OnlyFans didn’t push performers toward poverty by dictating the prices they could charge.When OnlyFans started, in 2016, Ms. Harwood was one of just 10 models who sought subscribers. She didn’t think much would come of it initially. Her earnings for the first month were $257. Then, the site added features enabling models to create custom content. Ms. Harwood got inventive.She introduced themed days like Mistress Mondays and Dare Dannii Tuesdays, when men bid to watch her drive around town in her underwear and order a pizza to her home, whereupon she would answer the door naked. She also chatted with fans daily, learning their habits, their sexual predilections and their insecurities.“You can get porn for free,” she said. “Guys don’t want to pay for that. They want the opportunity to get to know somebody they’ve seen in a magazine or on social media. I’m like their online girlfriend.”Ms. Harwood took out her phone and showed evidence of her theory.She brought home $29,420.47 in August, $34,303.24 in September, $52,693.29 in October and $52,760.49 in November. Although OnlyFans has brilliantly capitalized off the life’s work of exhibitionists, it is run by people whose most apparent trait is opacity.That’s the second paradox at the center of its existence. There is no website for Fenix International Limited, which is the parent company of OnlyFans. It does have a publicist, Daniel Blythe, who largely helps the men behind it avoid interviews.When I first contacted Mr. Blythe, in November, informing him of my intention to write about OnlyFans, he was affable as could be for a man with no intention of disclosing the names of his clients, much less submitting them to an interview.When I did discover Mr. Stokely’s name and portions of his back story, with a little help from someone on Reddit, Mr. Blythe offered the warmest of congratulations. “Refreshing to know that investigative journalism isn’t dead,” he said.Still, the best he could offer were written responses to questions for Mr. Stokely, the company’s chief executive. The answers were maddeningly vague, but Mr. Stokely did say that he works at Fenix with his father, Guy Stokely, who, before becoming its chairman, was an investment banker with Barclays, the storied British bank. Mr. Stokely also confirmed that one of Fenix’s directors is Leo Radvinsky, a 2003 Northwestern University graduate who went on to start MyFreeCams (one of the industry’s largest chat sites) and who has been a defendant in three lawsuits related to phishing attempts and patent infringement. (Mr. Blythe said he could not comment on the status of those lawsuits because they “do not pertain to OnlyFans.”)Mr. Stokely is eager to take OnlyFans out of the pornography niche and make it a platform for all sorts of influencers and audiences. One hurdle is that there is no iPhone app. The platform as it exists now likely runs afoul of Apple’s restrictions on “overtly sexual or pornographic material.” And even if Apple did allow an OnlyFans app, the fees — 30 percent — would certainly be a problem, Mr. Stokely said. He would have to pass along those expenses to performers. Technical problems on OnlyFans also threaten its longevity and help explain why synonymous sites, such as JustFor.Fans, have managed to siphon off considerable numbers of performers and revenue.Still, Chanel Santini, a 21-year-old performer who has been with OnlyFans for more than a year and earns at least $8,000 a month in subscription revenue, can’t muster serious complaints. Not when she experienced the alternative. She grew up in Albuquerque with a single mother who was a hairdresser. Ms. Santini came out as transgender when she was a teenager. That got her thrown out of the house. She never finished high school. In 2015, Ms. Santini moved to Las Vegas and took a job as a clerk at Hollister, the clothing chain. Even in a city with a fairly low cost of living, it wasn’t enough. So she started doing porn, filming scenes that paid as little as $400, which then led to escorting. She worked for a madam who stole her money, she said, and threatened her with violence. With popular feeds on Instagram and Twitter, Ms. Santini’s name got bigger. OnlyFans started and she signed up. A couple of weeks ago, she burst into tears over the phone while recalling her first pornographic shoot. There, a director had told her that the only way to make a living in porn was to also be a prostitute.“He said that straight to my face,” she said. “Now, I just want to run into him again, so I can say, ‘Well, here I am. I’m pulling in tens of thousands of dollars every month just posting content online. I don’t have to escort anymore. I don’t have to do that. Guess you were wrong!’”Jacob Bernstein is a reporter for the Styles desk.

It had a security guard. It was in a safe neighborhood. And she made sure to get home before dark.The night before she was to fly to Florida, she contacted her best friend, Laura Jaime, on the FaceTime app. She showed off the crocheted earrings she had bought in a local market and gave a video tour of her villa. The friends planned to see each other the next day, when Ms. Jaime was to pick her up at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.But Ms. Stefaniak never boarded her flight home on Nov. 28.During their phone call, Ms. Stefaniak had made a strange remark. She said the situation felt “sketchy,” but didn’t elaborate.“Carla knew at 8:20 that night that something was wrong,” Ms. Jaime said in an interview. “Sometimes we justify our intuition. But when something is triggered and our body says something is wrong, you have to listen to it.”A week later, Ms. Stefaniak’s brutalized body was found wrapped in plastic and half-buried in a sloping patch of forest near her Airbnb rental. The Costa Rican police arrested the property’s security guard in connection with the killing.Recent headlines about the deadly violence inflicted on women traveling alone have raised questions about how the world is greeting the documented rise in female solo travelers and about the role of social media in promoting the idea that far-off lands are easily accessible and safe.They have also shined a light on the enduring nature of gender violence worldwide and laid bare how a lone foreign traveler’s cultural and social expectations do not always comport with local views about a woman’s place in the world — and whether she should travel at all.Thousands of women go abroad every year without incident. Many women experience catcalls and myriad other forms of harassment while traveling; women of color have written about being dismissed or ignored abroad because of their race. And while violence against male tourists is just as devastating, the harrowing experiences of female solo travelers can still shock the senses. In December, the bodies of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen, 24, of Denmark and Maren Ueland, 28, of Norway, were found with knife wounds in their necks in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco. Danish officials called the murders an act of terror. That same month, the Briton Grace Millane disappeared in Auckland, New Zealand, on the night before her 22nd birthday; she was found slain days later. In 2015, a 19-year-old British backpacker was gang-raped by bikers in Thailand. In March, an Australian man was convicted of kidnapping and raping a Belgian traveler seeking work after keeping her locked up in his pig shed for two days.There’s no question that women face unique risks when traveling solo, experts say.“We have evidence that shows that women face risks that men don’t face in public spaces, at home, wherever they may be,” said Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, executive director of UN Women, an organization that promotes female equality. Increasingly, “wherever they may be” includes alone in foreign countries. But she said that violence against female tourists was a thread in the broader fabric of violence against women around the world. And violent episodes are just as likely to occur, experts note, in rich Western nations such as France, Italy and Germany as in the developing world. “The root cause of this kind of violence against women in communities and in public and private spaces has a lot of do with the underlying gender stereotypes, social norms, entitlement and patriarchy,” Ms. Mlambo-Ngcuka said.Solo travel by women has grown in popularity year after year, according to travel industry studies.Hostelworld, an online hostel-booking platform, found in a 2018 study that bookings by solo female travelers increased by 45 percent from 2015 to 2017, compared with a 40 percent increase for men.“Solo travel was once seen as brave and risky for female travelers, but a shift of attitude has meant that it is now an adventurous, exciting experience that allows them to feel free with no one else to worry about or please,” the company said.The online travel company 101 Singles Holidays found in a study of more than 60,000 British travelers that the number of people booking solo holidays rose by 14 percent in 2017 from 2016, and that tour operators were predicting a further rise of 11 percent in 2018. Solo female travelers also outnumbered their male counterparts by almost two to one, the study showed.A 2018 global survey by British Airways of 9,000 women found that more than 50 percent had taken a solo vacation, with 75 percent of the women surveyed planning solo trips in the next few years. Another ad hoc sign of women’s growing interest in hitting the road alone: Web searches for “solo female travel” have also risen drastically in the past five years, according to Google Trends.But even as more women explore the world, there is no clear global picture of the scale of violence against female solo travelers, making it hard to pin down whether attacks are on the rise or people have wider access to the grim news. The reason: Most countries do not comprehensively track violence against female travelers. Global agencies like the United Nations have traditionally collected data on gender violence as a whole. The State Department offers tips for women but does not break down data on violence against travelers by gender, a spokesman said. A British Foreign Office spokesman said the agency no longer compiled the Helping Britons Abroad report, making 2015 the last year for which figures were available, when they showed a 4 percent increase in sexual assaults against Britons abroad from 2010. But the statistics are not gender-specific. Experts find the lack of such figures troubling.Ms. Mlambo-Ngcuka, of UN Women, said that countries had little incentive to collect and publicize information that could be detrimental to their image. “This would not be seen by many countries as important data to collect,” she said, “so you are unable to track the prevalence or patterns.”Women have always been explorers on a scale both grand and personal — long before the British trailblazer Freya Stark visited inhospitable areas in Turkey and the Middle East and before the Irish travel writer Dervla Murphy saw the world on a bicycle. Today, women’s increased spending power has given them the means to travel more for leisure and adventure. Shifting attitudes in the West about who can travel alone have also added to a growing industry. Social media plays a big part, offering intimate glimpses of far-off lands. A scroll through Instagram hashtags like #LadiesGoneGlobal, #WeAreTravelGirls and #TheTravelWomen offer millions of photos of women posing on glistening beaches, trekking up mountains and exploring cobblestone streets — a collective and aspirational lure.But some women, like Hannah Gavios, 26, of Queens, discover horror away from home.Ms. Gavios found her passion for traveling solo while studying abroad in college. “I feel like it gives me the luxury of seeing the culture in the way I want to and being able to paint my own experience,” she said.After college, she traveled to Southeast Asia on her own, visiting Thailand in 2016 on a break from teaching English in Vietnam. One evening, she was walking alone after dinner in Krabi, known for its beaches and as a popular hangout for young tourists, when a local man offered to guide her back to her hotel.She said she was afraid of getting lost, so she followed him. But just as she grew increasingly uneasy, he attacked.Fleeing for her life, Ms. Gavios tumbled from a cliff and fractured her spine. The man sexually assaulted her while she lay helpless for 11 hours. In the morning light, he left — but, surprisingly, returned with help.Ms. Gavios was hospitalized for months, first in Thailand and then New York, and had to learn to walk again using crutches and custom leg braces. Her attacker was eventually arrested and sentenced to five years in prison.The week Ms. Stefaniak vanished, her friends and family scrambled to alert Costa Rican authorities. They organized a campaign through a Facebook page,  “Finding Carla.” The State Department quickly became involved, and the F.B.I. pressed local officials.When her body was discovered near her villa, her relatives were shattered.  Ms. Jaime, her best friend, said the local authorities should have done more to publicize the risks to women in the country. “They have a responsibility to tell tourists of all the risks, and they are not doing it,” she said.Ms. Stefaniak was the third foreign woman killed in Costa Rica in three months. But the country was also grappling with a deeper, more systemic problem of brutality against local women, ones who did not have the power of an American passport to help galvanize agencies like the State Department or the F.B.I. on their behalf. At least 14 women were killed in gender-based violence in the country from January to August 2018. In September, the government declared violence against women a national problem.The National Institute for Women, a government ministry, pointed to the murders of foreigners last summer in a statement to illustrate the issue: “We are faced with the fact that, beyond the damage it may cause to the image of the country, they are clear examples of the serious situation of violence against women, which has its most brutal expression in femicide.”Still, Costa Rica is considered one of the safest countries in Central America, particularly for tourists, with a lower homicide rate than many neighboring nations. Officials say they have made strides to combat gender-based violence.Ms. Jaime said she believed that her friend might have been targeted because she was a Spanish speaker who blended right in and her killer might have thought the police would be lax. “Maybe because she spoke Spanish, he might have felt no one would have looked for her,” Ms. Jaime said. But she said the attacker had underestimated the determination of Ms. Stefaniak’s family. Not only are her relatives fighting for justice in Costa Rica’s courts, they also filed a lawsuit accusing Airbnb of negligence. Their lawyer in Costa Rica, Joseph Alfonso Rivera Cheves, appeared to suggest a callous disregard in the aftermath, noting that the same day Ms. Stefaniak vanished, her Airbnb room was being cleaned and new renters checked in.The family also says that the local host evaded negative reviews by changing the name of the listing, and no background check of the security guard was conducted even though he had access to all the rooms on site.Airbnb, in a statement, said it had removed the villa where Ms. Stefaniak had stayed from its platform, and had been in contact with the authorities. The company also said it had made strides to address women’s safety concerns, partnering with rights organizations and violence-prevention groups in local communities, and creating policies that emphasize women’s needs. That includes removing any host or guest accused of sexual assault from the platform and including a clause in its nondiscrimination policy that allows female hosts to accept only female guests.Seasoned solo travelers say that preparation can be the key to minimizing risk.For Cassie DePecol, 29, who holds the Guinness World Record for “the fastest time to visit all sovereign countries,” traveling alone means having a long list of precautions. The Connecticut-born activist practices Krav Maga, an Israeli self-defense technique. She carries a GPS tracker. She makes sure someone knows where she is at all times.“Some of these might sound extreme,” she said. “But I attribute having safely traveled to 196 countries alone to these specific procedures.”Ms. DePecol says that gender-based violence is an unfortunate reality for women who travel.“The awareness of needing to always watch our backs when we’re both alone and in public places is something that men don’t necessarily need to be aware of,” she said.Jessica Nabongo, 34, is on a mission to become the first black woman to visit every country in the world. Born in Detroit, she has been to 158 so far — 54 of them alone — and hopes to complete her journey in October.Her road map for safety includes trying to stay in hotels with 24-hour security. If she stays in an Airbnb, the host has to have received consistently excellent reviews and achieved “superhost” status. She takes Ubers so that her location is tracked.Ms. Nabongo acknowledged that “we tell women what not to do to avoid being attacked instead of telling men not to attack women.” But she says she dresses conservatively until she can assess whether what she wears matters in the place she is visiting.She would prefer a world where women can just pack up and travel without having to do the extra legwork that solo male travelers don’t have to, but says that’s idealistic. Ms. Nabongo, however, like many women’s advocates, believes that any focus on the way women dress — or the fact that they travel alone at all — provides a convenient scapegoat and does not address the true causes of gender-based violence and rape culture.Most headlines tend to highlight the experiences of young, white or Western victims — partly because of a dearth of public data on any violent experiences of women of color who travel alone. But Ms. Nabongo noted that as a black woman traveling solo, she has to deal with a whole other level of safety concerns, anxiety and fear.“In many European cities that I’ve been in — like Barcelona, Madrid, Rome, Milano — women of color are in more danger because a lot of people think we are prostitutes,” she said. “My fear is always that if something happens to me in a European city, no one will care. I could be running down the street screaming in Italy and onlookers won’t care because I’m black.”To help one another traverse the world safely, women have formed their own online communities.Dianelle Rivers-Mitchell founded Black Girls Travel Too, which coordinates group travel, to serve a growing market. On her company’s Facebook site, thousands of women share tips on where to stay, eat and visit, and hash out safety concerns.“We are each other’s keeper, especially when it comes to travel,” said Ms. Rivers-Mitchell. Apps provide another level of support for women traveling alone. Free ones like Chirpey, RedZone, MayDay, Tripwhistle and Noonlight let women flag incidents and areas of danger, and contact local law enforcement.Even with the best preparation, trips can go wrong.Born and raised in Moscow, Vasilisa Komarova grew up in the 1980s behind the Soviet Iron Curtain. She studied law, moved to London, learned English and became a British citizen. But she dreamed of traveling the wider world.In 2016, at 35, she embarked on a solo motorcycle journey through the Americas. She visited Cuba and spent time in the Atacama Desert and Chilean Patagonia. She linked up with motorcyclists and got odd jobs in a bike shop and in fitness training. She was living a dream, chronicling it all with photos on Instagram and posts on Facebook.Then, everything changed.“At some point, maybe because everyone I was meeting was so kind, I think I put down my guard a little,” she said. While she was camping in northern Bolivia on June 4, 2017, in an area people had told her was safe, three men with machetes dragged her out of her tent. They beat her, dislocating her arm in three places. While two held her down, one raped her. Then they broke her motorcycle, stole her belongings, urinated on her tent and left her for dead.Afraid that they might come back, Ms. Komarova lay still all night. When the sun rose, she used her laptop, which her attackers had missed, to summon help. But what she experienced was a climate of impunity, she said. The authorities didn’t want to take her to a doctor; the doctor didn’t want to see her because she could not pay.“Only after the Russian Embassy was involved did the police listen,” Ms. Komarova said.But the embassy retreated after connecting her with the local authorities, saying she was not in immediate danger. She felt she was on her own.Experts say such a response isn’t unusual. “Some of these law enforcers are themselves part of the problem, and they do not take these crimes as seriously as they need to,” Ms. Mlambo-Ngcuka, of UN Women, said.Bolivian and Russian authorities did not respond to several requests for comment.With the help of the British Embassy, Ms. Komarova, made contact with an advocate who helped her file a criminal complaint and begin the legal fight against her attackers.Ms. Komarova said she knew she had to be her own biggest advocate; she couldn’t move forward in her journey or return home without getting some form of justice. But between the local bureaucracy and the corruption, she said, it was an arduous fight.“The attack, the process, it broke me down,” Ms. Komarova said. “But I had to find strength inside myself.”A year later, she watched as her attackers were sentenced to a combined 42 years in prison.In November, Ms. Komarova rode out of Bolivia on her motorcycle. The first night she put her tent up after leaving, she was afraid, she admitted. She is still on the road, and wants other women to travel, but to be on alert — always.“My guard is really high,” Ms. Komarova said by Skype from Ecuador. “People don’t always deserve my skepticism, but that is how it is. That’s how it has to be.”As for Ms. Gavios, she is still partly paralyzed, but since the attack, she has become a yoga instructor and has learned Krav Maga. Last fall, she completed the New York City Marathon — on crutches. “It hasn’t prevented me from moving forward or traveling by myself,” she said. “I don’t feel defeated.”She says she doesn’t want her experience to scare other women away from having the rich, eye-opening experience of traveling solo.“The more we tell women not to travel alone and the more we send the message that the world is very dangerous, in a way, we are also supporting that belief,” Ms. Gavios said. “Rather than horrifying people, I want people to go into it with a little more bravery and a little more knowledge.”From her perspective, there are no dangerous countries, just dangerous people.“It sucks, but you can’t control the world,” she said, adding, “But you also have to go out and live your life and not let these terrible stories stop you.“Because otherwise, you let them win.”Follow NY Times Travel on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

As they see it, global warming stands to make corporate security as high-stakes in the 21st century as it was in the 19th.
As they see it, global warming stands to make corporate security as high-stakes in the 21st century as it was in the 19th.

The Pinkertons wanted me to picture myself in a scene of absolute devastation. “A hurricane just wipes out everything, and you need to feed your children,” Andres Paz Larach said. The power grid is down, shipments of food are cut off, the water is no longer potable — how do you get what you need to survive? What risks do you take? It was a hot early morning in March, and we were driving through a pine forest high in the mountains surrounding Santa Ana Jilotzingo, 25 miles northwest of Mexico City. Our Suburban, equipped with bulletproof windows and reinforced doors, labored slowly over the dirt road, which appeared to have been washed out by a recent thunderstorm.For much of the previous hour, Paz Larach and two other executives from Pinkerton, Carlos Manuel López Portillo Maltos and Paul Rakov, had been explaining the company’s philosophy of risk management. Now over 150 years old, having long outlived its reputation as Andrew Carnegie’s personal militia, the agency has evolved into a modern security firm. Over the last decade or so, Pinkerton began noticing a growing set of anxieties among its corporate clients about distinctly contemporary plagues — active shooters, political unrest, climate disasters — and in response began offering data-driven risk analysis, in addition to what they’re more traditionally known for. Dressed in an untucked powder blue oxford and round, rimless sunglasses, Paz Larach, the firm’s senior vice president in charge of the Americas, paused before affecting a look of brutal candor. “You’re going to turn to desperate measures,” he said. Everybody will. The other Pinkertons nodded.I was seated in the rear row next to Rakov, a marketing officer who, at 51, had recently shifted his career from more traditional P.R. to Pinkerton. He was now fully fluent in the language of tactical response. He chimed in to observe that preparing for a disaster can carry its own risks. He gave the example of a drought. “If a client has food and water and all the other stuff,” he said, “then they become a target.” López Portillo and Paz Larach uttered small words of consensus in Spanish, while scanning through email on their phones. “And if and when desperate people discovered that cache of water and food,” he continued, it was the Pinkertons’ job to protect it at whatever cost.[Read about how Wall Street is hedging against the apocalypse.]Our destination that morning was a shooting range called Club de Tiro Jaribú, which Pinkerton sometimes uses for agent and client trainings. The idea had been to demonstrate what Pinkerton agents go through before they are deployed to disaster zones. López Portillo had also lately fielded several inquiries from corporate clients, asking for lessons in tactical skills like evasive driving and extraction from disaster zones, both for themselves and sometimes hundreds or more of their employees. “Someone who works in corporate — say, as an attorney or salesperson,” he said, “they find it something completely new and useful.”At the range, which was made up of seven terraced target areas bulldozed into a steep ridge, we were greeted by our instructor, Reynold Castro Róman. A former Mexican military officer, he wore black fatigues with the Pinkerton all-seeing-eye logo emblazoned on either shoulder. A kaffiyeh hid a long scar along his neck. During an intel mission 16 years ago, Castro Róman was flying over marijuana fields when the plane went down — from what Castro Róman suspected was narco fire — killing the three others on board. Since then, he has dedicated himself almost exclusively to private-sector urban-combat training, often for Pinkerton.Over the next three hours, Castro Róman worked us steadily through various readiness drills, including quick-draw methods, accuracy competitions and timed reloading under pressure. We shot nine-millimeter pistols and Israeli assault rifles. Considering all the firearms, the atmosphere was relaxed and sporting. Nearby, a man grilled chorizo and carne asada. A cooler and makeshift bar was stocked with beer, wine and mezcal.The scene was a stark contrast to the big-data wonkery I was pitched in the car ride over. But Paz Larach explained that their statistical and tactical approaches were fundamentally connected. All businesses exposed themselves to risk, which had to be mitigated, insured or, more relevantly, defended against. Even if the Pinkertons couldn’t predict the specific risks of the future, they had a general sense of what it might look like — and what opportunities they might avail themselves of as it materialized. According to the World Bank, by 2050 some 140 million people may be displaced by sea-level rise and extreme weather, driving escalations in crime, political unrest and resource conflict. Even if the most conservative predictions about our climate future prove overstated, a 1.5-degree Celsius rise in temperature during the next century will almost certainly provoke chaos, in what experts call climate change’s “threat multiplier”: Displacement begets desperation begets disorder. Reading these projections from the relative comforts of the C-suite, it wasn’t difficult to see why a company might consider enhancing its security protocols.For Pinkerton, the bet is twofold: first, that there’s no real material difference between climate change and any other conflict — as the world grows more predictably dangerous, tactical know-how will simply be more in demand than ever. And second, that by adding data analytics, Pinkerton stands to compete more directly with traditional consulting firms like Deloitte, which offer pre- and postdisaster services (supply-chain monitoring, damage documentation, etc.), but which cannot, say, dispatch a helicopter full of armed guards to Guatemala in an afternoon. In theory, Pinkerton can do both — a fully militarized managerial class at corporate disposal.Later, after Paz Larach took his turn on the range — during which he emptied a Galil ACE assault rifle into a human-shaped cardboard cutout, then quickly drew his nine-millimeter, grouping four shots in the chest-cavity bull’s-eye — he offered the example of Hurricane Maria. On the day the Category 4 hurricane made landfall in Puerto Rico in 2017, he received more than 30 calls from American businesses and multinationals. He wouldn’t go into detail but explained that many chief executives felt blind to the situation and effectively tendered a blank check if Pinkerton could provide security. Over the next few days, as the company deployed hundreds of agents to the island, some of them, Paz Larach claimed, reported seeing firearms brandished at gas stations. “We had to escort the cargo with real agents, have cars chase the main truck,” he said. “Those who did not have protection were having their cargo hijacked.”Aware that he might end up sounding vampiric, Paz Larach hesitated, then eventually confessed what he’d wanted to say in the first place: The future looked pretty good for Pinkerton.You could be forgiven for assuming that the Pinkertons were relics of the past. Like the stage coaches the company once protected, the name Pinkerton summons up sepia-tinted images of the American West — black-hatted detectives pursuing train robbers, or rooting out labor agitators from coal mines. And indeed, Allan Pinkerton organized his agency in response to the lawlessness of the frontier. When he first began offering his services in the early 1850s, a majority of the territories west of the Mississippi remained ungoverned; few towns offered policing, and fewer still had the means to investigate crimes after the fact. Overnight, Pinkerton’s novel methods of “crime detection,” which included infiltrating gangs and developing networks of informants, became the standards of investigation, and his company became a sort of de facto national police force. According to some historians, by the late 19th century, the Pinkerton National Detective Agency numbered more men than the United States Army.In the intervening years, the Pinkertons have survived in no small part because of their ability to adapt to the changing landscapes of crime. To differentiate his agency from common bounty hunters, Pinkerton worked to professionalize his ranks with formal attire, pay and badges and created what probably was the first national criminal database. In the following years, as railroads opened up the frontier and settlement brought with it the rule of law, Pinkerton turned to what he saw as the “riotous element” growing in company towns. Between 1877 and 1892, Pinkertons were dispatched to break up some 70 labor strikes — either by going undercover to provide intel, or through brute force.[Read David Leonhardt on the economics of climate change.]It was only after a particularly lethal clash during a strike in Homestead, Pa., in 1892 that the public began to wonder if the threat of the Pinkertons eclipsed those they supposedly protected against. In the years since the frontier closed, antitrust sentiment had grown, and demand for the Pinkertons lessened — in part because the government was more able to enforce its laws. In the aftermath of Homestead, Congress and 23 states passed “anti-Pinkerton” acts, banning government bodies from hiring mercenaries as strikebreakers.In the decades since, the Pinkertons have undertaken several rebrandings, each aimed at lowering their public profile, though through it all they never gave up the lucrative specter of their name: the Pinkerton Agency, Pinkerton’s Inc., Pinkerton. During the first half of the 20th century, the company protected wartime factories and later began to seek out new markets in parts of the world, like India and China, where authority could still be outsourced. In 1999, the Swedish security giant Securitas AB absorbed the agency, buying it for a reported $384 million, and the company underwent rebranding once again, this time as a boutique risk-management firm. It began diversifying into intellectual-property services and cybersecurity. Among their most popular new services is the Pinkerton Dedicated Professional, in which agents join a client’s company like any other new hire, allowing them to provide intel on employees. By 2018, the agency said it could count among its clients about 80 percent of Fortune 1,000 companies.The best outcome for these new data-driven Pinkertons is that this century lapses into the kind of lawlessness and disorder that makes it look more like the 19th — which many scientists and economists think it could. Since 1980, a period that includes all 20 of the warmest years in recorded history and 18 of the 20 most intense hurricane seasons in the satellite era, losses in the United States from storms, wildfires and droughts topped $1.6 trillion — nearly a third of which occurred in just the last five years. And this exponential destruction is just the beginning of what David Wallace-Wells, in his book “The Uninhabitable Earth,” calls the Great Dying: a worldwide economic decline, sharply deteriorated living conditions, disruption to basic government functions and widespread hunger. Looking deeper still into the future, the predictions are even more dire. Over the next century, 3.7 degrees of warming could contribute to an additional 22,000 murders and 1.3 million burglaries in the United States.Whatever the exact costs of climate change, it is Pinkerton’s job to read between the numbers looking for the potential for violence. If you’re suffering only one hurricane every 20 years or so, shelling out $1 million to Pinkerton isn’t such a big deal, Paz Larach explained; you bake it into your risk. “But if there’s a disaster every year, which is happening more and more, it makes more sense to have dedicated staff on standby.” A Pinkerton on standby doesn’t mean protection for just your insurable risks but also for the uninsurable risks — business interruptions, theft of trade secrets, pandemics. And with the environment increasingly weaponized against the poor, to borrow Wallace-Wells’s phrase, the sectors that rely on cheap labor will face more unrest among workers; the state will struggle to keep up with crime; and in the aftermath of storms, with landslides blocking first responders, regional offices will be cut off.And this, of course, is exactly the sort of environment in which the Pinkertons thrive.The morning after weapons training, I found myself once again in the back of an armored Suburban. Paz Larach was talking on the phone beside me as we made our way to the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez, a racetrack where we were scheduled to learn evasive driving. Throughout my visit, the Pinkertons had insisted on providing me a full security detail, which included the armored car and two escorting agents, as a way of simulating executive protection. The two agents were clad in black suits and earpieces and shadowed me to dinner, interviews and an outing to the Templo Mayor Museum; rarely during the three days could I get either to chat with me. They treated the job, however farcical it seemed, gravely.Like people, companies could become habituated to modernity’s relative safety, Paz Larach said. But it was his job to shock them out of such thinking, whether through exercises or data. For much of the last century, the traditional form of defense for businesses has been insurance compensation — pay a premium up front, recover later. But one of the many byproducts of this model of subsidized recovery, according to economists, has been unfettered growth along floodplains, hurricane-impact zones and other high-risk areas. After Hurricane Harvey, Pinkerton found clients were frustrated and open to alternatives. “Most clients were not prepared enough,” Paz Larach said. “An insurance policy is just a piece of paper.”[Read about new legal strategies to make the world’s biggest polluters pay for climate change.]Paz Larach rattled off a suite of services that were not, strictly speaking, covered by that piece of paper: armed warehouse defense, executive extraction, 24-hour surveillance, chartered helicopters and planes, escorted cargo shipments. “If you abandon your property, you’re kind of just blindfolding yourself,” he said — checking news, hoping for the best. “We’re your eyes and ears on the ground.” During the 2017 hurricane season, the Pinkertons chartered half a dozen planes across the Caribbean, each of them full of food and under armed escort, to the tune of around $100,000 each. Ordinarily, Pinkerton bills on a relatively cheap hourly basis, but during a state of emergency, the rate soars, something Paz Larach compared to Uber’s surge pricing. By the end of the season, after Maria, Harvey and Irma, Paz Larach told me the company billed tens of millions of dollars.However bankable and flashy, tactical work is by its nature highly reactive, which has left Pinkerton vulnerable to steep fluctuations in revenue. At the same time, Paz Larach found himself increasingly frustrated by how few businesses took even the simplest of precautions — generators, stores of water, cameras to prove damage to adjusters. But as he brought these ideas to businesses, he discovered an unexpected drawback to the Pinkerton name: Companies didn’t tend to call for advice; they called because they needed “a guy for a job,” as Paz Larach put it. So over the last five years, as the company watched the demand for incident response skyrocket, it began to pour resources into building three data-and-information-gathering centers: one each in Seattle and The Hague, which focus mainly on crunching big data to predict crime trends worldwide, and a “Global Intelligence Center” in Mexico City, which is geared more toward the operational response to those trends.The Mexico City Global Intelligence Center occupies a large wing on the fourth floor of an angular glass building in the neighborhood of Jardines del Pedregal. At the entrance, through double glass doors, I was greeted by an enormous black rendering of the Pinkerton logo and slogan — “We never sleep” — along with framed prints of documents and photographs from the agency’s early days, among them one of Allan Pinkerton standing with President Lincoln, another the rap sheet for Butch Cassidy. The center of the space was dominated by a long white desk, at which several employees, all in black Pinkerton jackets, sat at computers. Behind a biometric scanner lay the operational nerve center of the office, which appeared surprisingly empty. From our conversations, I’d expected a hive of analysts hunched over intricate software displays. But nearly every surface was eerily immaculate, free of any visible sign of stress; at their computers, a handful of analysts browsed Associated Press stories and pecked numbers into Excel. CNN was on. The whole office felt somehow incomplete, as if the company had staged the place in haste.Paz Larach and I were met there by David Valenzuela, a former Mexican police officer who looked to still be adjusting to corporate life: He sported a deep blue fatigue shirt, which he’d tucked into his slacks. Valenzuela was in charge of overseeing the analysts who worked there. After scanning into the nerve center, he stood by a screen on the wall, which flashed up a GPS readout of our location. Several separate, smaller frames within the larger one then displayed ticking feeds: Twitter, a news wire, Doppler radar, quick links to police and fire. This was the Pinkerton “threat monitor” — quite literally, a monitor.Many of the Pinkertons’ tools, including the threat monitor, were originally developed only for internal use — for an agent tracking a C.E.O. through disputed cartel territory, or keeping an eye on a tanker in waters known for piracy. But over the last few hurricane and wildfire seasons, when storms and blazes began to overtake industrial corridors throughout the Eastern Seaboard and California, the company found that C.E.O.s wanted access to these tools. To sweeten the deal, Pinkerton built out packaged services, including storehouses of food, a threat dashboard for C-suite computers and daily intelligence briefings. Excited by the implications, the company began rolling out an entire conceptual framework around what it called “applied risk science.”Listening to Paz Larach pitch the agency’s future — all of it rendered in the gauzy language of consulting — I was struck by its relative simplicity, which belied, in part, just how far most companies and governments are from accepting the reality of climate change. Even if Pinkerton’s core competency still lies in tactical response, the means of preparation are not exactly the province of big data: Put food in a warehouse, aggregate news, consult the latest open-source modeling. Pinkerton doesn’t even see this strategy as climate-related, per se. The company doesn’t have a dedicated climate division, nor climate experts; from its perspective, that would be redundant. Pinkerton sells safety, or its pretense, in the face of catastrophe, and the only real differences between the catastrophes of this century and the 19th, on some level, will be rate and severity. As Jack Zahran, the president of Pinkerton, put it to me, Pinkerton is a 150-year-old start-up, still pitching the same basic vision: You aren’t prepared enough, and the government is too clumsy to save you.Later, at the racetrack, we watched three young men suit up in ski masks to shoot paintballs at our S.U.V. Even among my Pinkerton handlers, the theater of exercise seemed to strain the reasonable connections between tactical response and climate change. Throughout my visit, I wondered whether I had caught Pinkerton in the midst of an awkward organizational transition, or if the company stood merely to capitalize on the world’s growing panic — and if the difference really mattered. They had, after all, taken me to fire automatic weapons, ostensibly as a training exercise against desperate, disaster-ravaged people. It was impossible to experience that and not project it into a future in which, in the absence of true climate policy or mitigation, capital felt free to protect itself from outside risks — whatever form they may take.During one of the long meals that Paz Larach, Rakov, López Portillo and I shared, the novelty of my being there had faded just enough for them to reflect personally on climate change. The relentless pragmatism of trying to respond to disasters and analyze their occurrence had seemed to leave the men with little space for the existential dread that marks so much of the modern condition. But for whatever reason, on this night, as we picked at a plate of escamoles — a central-Mexican delicacy of ant larvae — they spoke about their anxieties.López Portillo, who until then had been jovial if diplomatic in answering my questions, turned solemn, his eyes glancing around the vaulted ceiling. He said he worried about his children, and what sort of world he might be leaving them. But his fear, he clarified, wasn’t exactly that they wouldn’t learn to adapt; it was that he, their father, didn’t know what adaptation would look like. He said that he feared variables he didn’t know how to calculate, variables he couldn’t conceive of yet.When López Portillo finished, Paz Larach admitted that thinking that far out was still difficult for him. He was 33 and just married. What the most immediate future held for him was a new home in Miami, where he and his wife had just bought an apartment on the water. It had always been their dream. When I asked him about sea-level rise — something with which Miami is practically synonymous — he paused for a moment, then said, “We know it’s a risk, but we looked at it and decided it was worth it.” And anyway, the apartment wouldn’t be ready until 2021. They’d deal with it then.Noah Gallagher Shannon is a writer from northern Colorado who now lives in New York. His last feature for the magazine was about a water war in a small Arizona town.By ANDREA FRAZZETTABy JESSE BARRONBy NATHANIEL RICHBy DAVID LEONHARDTBy BROOKE JARVISAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byAll of the weddings right here on one handy page for you.Ms. Boser and Mr. Choate met in April 2016 at Harbor Cove Beach in Ventura when the old work truck Ms. Boser was driving got stuck. She had driven to the beach to collect sand for a restoration project on Santa Cruz Island, where invasive Argentine ants were swarming baby birds in their nests, interfering with native plant pollination and crowding out native ants. To rid the island of these pests without harming other species, she designed specialized bait, and wanted to do a trial run of the distribution equipment, using sand as a stand-in for the bait.All was going as planned, until the truck got stuck. Mr. Choate and a friend were also at the beach watching ships pass along the shore when they heard the sound of tires spinning.Mr. Choate rode his bike over to help. He used a piece of wood as a wedge and was able to steer the truck back onto compacted sand. He rode away, but returned to suggest that he and Ms. Boser exchange numbers, in case, he said, she should ever need his help in the future. Ms. Boser agreed before it dawned on her that this was a flirtation. She had not seen it coming.“That’s not how my brain works,” Ms. Boser said. “I’m sure I was completely flushed and blushing.”The next day Mr. Choate called to invite Ms. Boser to go hiking at Arroyo Verde park in Ventura. She in turn asked him to join her and some friends for oysters at the beach.Ms. Boser’s friends greeted Mr. Choate with intense curiosity. “I don’t date a lot,” Ms. Boser said, “so he got interrogated by everybody.”Mr. Choate, impressed with her travel, said, “That’s when I found out she’d been all over the damn world.” Afterward, strolling along the Ventura pier, they kissed.But Mr. Choate left town the following week. As the captain of a ship that supplied oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, he was often gone for a month at a time, and home for only a few weeks before shipping out again. This schedule did not allow him much opportunity for a relationship. “I’d been single for quite awhile,” he said.But they texted each other, and he continued to reach out to Ms. Boser whenever he was home on leave. “I was excited about it,” he said, “and very interested in her and getting to know her better.”The time apart allowed Ms. Boser the chance to gradually adjust to being with someone, but she wondered if it would work long-term.“One, he’s gone for a long portion of the year, and two, he’s younger,” she said. But when they were together, she was happy. “He listens to me, he is kind, and he is kind to other people.”A scientist even in matters of the heart, Ms. Boser populated a spreadsheet with data about a hypothetical wedding.“I’m looking at these things and deciding if this is the life I want,” she said. “I decided yes, because I could see a future.”Still, they did not move in together as Ms. Boser had a sickly cat. Two years into the relationship, the cat died and she packed her things. At the time, Mr. Choate was working a new job, piloting tugboats off the coast of Maine. “I called him and I said, ‘O.K., I’m moving into your house now.’ ”That same week, a heavy rope crushed Mr. Choate’s hand and he had to have portions of two fingers amputated. Ms. Boser booked a flight for later that day.Read more. Ms. Patel and Mr. Burbank met on Coffee Meets Bagel in Nashville in May 2017. Ms. Patel, still reeling from the breakup of a one-year “terrible relationship,” as she called it, was in the midst of an eight-month solo trip around the country in search of herself.“I was determined to finally pay attention to my own needs,” she said. “I was scared of a lot of things, so I decided to face those fears. I quit my job and sublet my Brooklyn apartment. I wanted to see what else was out there, so I hit the road.”Ms. Patel’s trip began in February 2017 with stops in Chicago, Miami and Orlando, Fla., before she arrived in Nashville, where she met Mr. Burbank online, initially dismissing his profile. “He was a white, Christian man from Texas,” she said. “He was also two years younger than me, the opposite of everything I wanted, but he was so handsome.”That left the door slightly ajar for Mr. Burbank, a native of Dallas who had lived and worked in New Orleans for the better part of a decade. They agreed to meet and go for a hike at Shelby Bottoms, a nature preserve in East Nashville.He offered to pick her up, but she politely declined, choosing instead to get there by taxicab.“When she got out of the cab, she was clutching her purse,” Mr. Burbank said, laughing. “I thought to myself, ‘Now that’s a real New Yorker.’”Mr. Burbank tried to impress Ms. Patel with his familiarity of the trails at Shelby Bottoms, but they got lost in the woods for four hours. Ms. Patel became frustrated, but rather than tell Mr. Burbank to take another hike, she decided to stay the course, and they went to Rosepepper, a Mexican cantina in East Nashville, where they drank margaritas and shared a meal during what turned out to be a very successful nine-hour first date.They dated for the duration of May before Ms. Patel continued on her journey to Chicago, Utah, Arizona, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Vancouver, British Columbia. She briefly returned to Nashville to visit Mr. Burbank, and then went off to complete her trip, visiting Chicago again and then North Carolina and New Jersey before returning in October 2017 to Nashville, and Mr. Burbank, for good.“There was something very natural about my relationship with Trevor,” Ms. Patel said. “There were never any games between us.”In April 2018, the couple bought a farm in Nashville, which they share with five chickens, a Border-Collie mix and visiting wild turkeys, coyotes, raccoons, vultures and hawks.“My life is the opposite of what it was two years ago,” Ms. Patel said. “I went from living with two roommates in a basement apartment in Brooklyn to sharing 20 acres with my partner, and I get to write and draw and travel for a living.”Mr. Burbank said he admired Ms. Patel’s “work ethic and discipline.”Read more.Elizabeth Connelly McKnight and David Benjamin Quinn were married April 13 at Indian Creek Country Club in Miami Beach.

His next film will air on Netflix. What ties his work together? Plumbing the depths of black beauty and grief.CreditCreditJohn Edmonds for The New York TimesSupported byBy Carvell WallaceI was impressed by how long Tarell Alvin McCraney was willing to sit in silence until I asked him something. When I first met him, on the campus of Yale University, where he is chairman of the playwriting program — one of the most exclusive in the country, admitting only three students each year — it struck me that he was, if not distant, then at the very least aloof. Small talk was made and pleasantries exchanged, but I couldn’t help noticing that there was not much eye contact. At first I attributed this to normal self-consciousness, but as the day progressed it occurred to me that it might be a kind of honesty: He wouldn’t do me or himself the disrespect of offering a charm performance. He simply said it was nice to meet me and suggested we get a bite at a nearby Cuban restaurant. Once there, he looked over the menu for not long at all before ordering the eggplant steak and then, as if on impulse, an empanada de guayaba and a cafe con leche. He would drink the coffee but would have the empanada boxed up to share, he said, with his students.Then came the silence. It seemed that he might have sat there all day had I let him, quietly content, thinking about various plays, or current events, or music, or film. Instead, I started to explain how much the film “Moonlight” — based on a script McCraney wrote in his early 20s, for which he would ultimately win an Oscar — meant to me. I told him that I grew up in circumstances that allowed me to relate to its central character. And it was here that McCraney began asking the questions, leaning slightly forward over the table, regarding me with patient but curious eyes: Where were my people from, what was their world like, how did my father fit in if at all, which plays did I perform in during high school, what did my mother think of my performances? He was a near balance of observer and observed, 60 percent admirer, 40 percent work of art.There were details he would recall and bring up long after this meeting. Three weeks later, he would make a joke that showed he remembered my birthday. This is normally the stuff of politicians — a parlor trick of remembering details, of making others feel as if they have your care and attention. But with McCraney it does not feel performative. He has a way of understanding and respecting the stories of anyone he chooses: my story, the stories of the characters in his scripts and plays, the stories of the graduate students he spends his days teaching. He asks questions that draw you into relief against your background and show you not only your own beauty but also his. This, it seems, is one of the ways he has learned to navigate a treacherous world and stay intact, or as intact as a queer black man can be in America.The McCraney Literary Universe is a large one: He is 38 and has seen eight plays produced, written two screenplays, won a MacArthur genius grant and adapted Shakespeare for the Royal Shakespeare Company in London. (When I asked what made him like theater when he first encountered it, he replied: “I don’t necessarily know if I like it now” — but “the drive to do it is innate.”) If you want to write about this universe, you must be comfortable using the word “beautiful.” In McCraney’s work, the beauty of blackness is a praxis unto itself, the method by which larger theories about life are made manifest. The full, original title of the screenplay that became “Moonlight” was “In the Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue.” The film, which won the Best Picture Oscar in 2017, wasn’t just about the beauty of its characters but about the way they fight a losing battle against that beauty — how they try to beat it out of themselves and one another. The central conflict is that of a character trying to find harmony between who he is and who he is expected to be, a struggle that is, for many black men, not a theoretical matter but a violent, corporeal one.The same ideas recur in “Choir Boy,” the queer coming-of-age tale that marked McCraney’s Broadway debut when it opened at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater in early January. This story, too, sits amid one of the primary contradictions of black American maleness: To be black and fully realized is to be beautiful. But to be beautiful is to be wanted, which, in America, is to be unsafe.McCraney was raised in a working-class family in Liberty City, a five-square-mile section of northwest Miami that is home to one of the largest black populations in Florida. His mother struggled with drug addiction for the entirety of his upbringing, ultimately succumbing to AIDS-related conditions when McCraney was 22. His future collaborator Barry Jenkins, who directed “Moonlight,” was just a year older, raised just a few miles away, also by a mother struggling with addiction.[Read Angela Flournoy’s profile of Barry Jenkins, the director of “Moonlight.”]From the beginning, McCraney says, he was obsessed with telling stories. He credits his grandfather, who was a Baptist minister, for deepening his understanding of the spiritual power of narrative. Growing up alongside immigrants from Haiti and Cuba also meant McCraney was exposed to the Orishas, the pantheon of gods in the Yoruba religion, a West African theology that has found expression in the Caribbean and across the African diaspora. The stories of the Orishas, like those of the Greek gods, comprise a veritable soap opera of betrayals, heartbreaks, love affairs and tragic flaws. Their influence on McCraney was meaningful enough that he would one day write a trilogy of dramas, “The Brother/Sister Plays,” based on Orisha stories.McCraney’s academic potential was recognized early. In middle school, he found himself tracked into a magnet program that let him focus on literature and performing arts. Thus began a long stretch of working in spaces where McCraney was either the only black person present or one of very few — an experience that strikes him as something of a doubtful advantage. “You’re told, ‘You’ve got this special gift, this thing that will cure you of your blackness,’ ” he says. “But then they use that same information to castigate and diminish your people. So now you’re alone and can’t relate to nobody. So what do you actually win?”As a teenager, he became politically active through street theater, working on community plays designed to raise awareness of H.I.V. testing and education. He carried this political view of theater to DePaul University in Chicago. It was in Chicago, in the early 2000s, that he auditioned for a show by the director and playwright Tina Landau, of Steppenwolf Theater, who would become his most frequent collaborator: By her count, they’ve done 12 productions together since they first met. “He was just this beautiful, startling young man with lots of depth and mystery,” she says. Years later, when he approached her to direct one of his plays, she was struck by the power of his writing. His stories, she says, “on the one hand, have not been told — because the details, the specifics, are so of his real life and the lives of his characters — and at the same time they operate on this very fundamental — what’s the word I’m looking for — on an ur level.”After DePaul, McCraney took a year off, during which he traveled to Georgia to bury his mother and worked briefly in Miami theater. Then he took his talents to Yale, as a student in the same graduate playwriting program he now oversees. Part of his application was an early version of the script for “Moonlight,” a largely autobiographical story written around the time of his mother’s death. It was the overwhelming intensity of his emotions at the time, he thinks, that created the heightened poetry of the film. He was unlikely, he told me, to write anything quite like that in the future. “I was 23 when I wrote that. I don’t want to be 23 again. I don’t want to be in that much pain ever again.”If beauty is the pillar at one end of his work, pain is at the other. McCraney digs unflinchingly into the suffering that pulses at the center of his character’s lives. I asked him about the concern some black artists and storytellers have — that our work may simply boil down to trading in black pain for rent money. “If the question, for you, about peddling black pain is appropriate,” he replied, “you also have to think to yourself, well, why am I in so much pain?” It doesn’t make sense, he suggested, to demand that an artist produce joy when his or her inner life is still processing grief. He then talked about the rapper Lil Wayne, who famously suffered a gunshot wound at age 12. For years, he said the gun had gone off by accident; only last year did he reveal that the childhood wound was from a suicide attempt. “He talks about the time that he shot himself because it still haunts him,” McCraney said. “He woke up in a pool of blood. He’s, like, engaged in that, and going through it. Why is it important for us to be like, ‘Hey, get over that. Where are the dandelions?’ ”It was not long after McCraney’s graduation from Yale that he mounted his first production at Steppenwolf, became the group’s 43rd member and wrote and directed work for the Public Theater, Center Theater Group and the Royal Shakespeare Company, where he directed interpretations of “Hamlet” and “Antony and Cleopatra.” “The only thing that kept me going,” he told me of that time, thinking of the second play, “was: I’ve got to bring this play back to the little Haitian girls who live across the street from me, who have never seen themselves as royalty.” Around this time, Barry Jenkins came across “Moonlight” and asked McCraney for permission to rework it into a shooting script, prompting McCraney’s first foray into feature film. Steven Soderbergh’s film of McCraney’s second feature, a basketball drama titled “High Flying Bird,” is scheduled for Netflix release in February — and in addition to the Broadway run of “Choir Boy,” the Oprah-led OWN network has ordered a season of McCraney’s first television project, the semi-autobiographical “David Makes Man,” currently filming in Orlando.Allison Davis, a writer on “David Makes Man,” remembers walking into the writers’ room with some nervousness. “He could have thrown his ego around that room, and it would have been justified,” she told me by phone from Los Angeles. Instead, she was disarmed when McCraney suggested the staff begin by taking an online quiz to determine which Harry Potter house each person would belong to. “Then we started talking about what all the houses represented, and then we started talking about what in our backgrounds made us answer the way we did, and it became this very deep discussion about language and trauma and influences, and we were talking about this for like three hours.”This ability to merge the mundane with the profound, to draw complex emotions out of many different people and sources, is a hallmark of McCraney’s work. “ ‘David Makes Man’ pulls from so many references,” Davis said. “The Bible is up in there, Yoruba is up in there, Miami street culture is up in there, ball culture is up in there. He weaves it into this wonderful tapestry, and he treats them all with equal reverence.”“I have never — and I mean this — never encountered a script for television with this depth of value,” says Phylicia Rashad, one of the show’s stars. “Because he is bringing cultural influence that, to my knowledge, has not been seen, but exists.”There are not many people from Liberty City, Miami, directing for the Royal Shakespeare Company, winning Oscars and administering programs at Yale. McCraney is consistently in rarefied air. This goes beyond W.E.B. Du Bois’s notion of “double consciousness.” To be a black queer man from poverty and enjoy accolades in some of the most exclusory spaces in Western theater doesn’t just call for the maintenance of multiple consciousnesses; it requires a strategy for keeping them working smoothly together. “When people say, ‘I’m tired,’ ” McCraney told me, “it’s not necessarily like, ‘I’ve been working in a cotton field all day.’ There’s tired, like — you just don’t know how much pre-thinking, post-thinking, anxiousness, anxiety, that one has to toggle in order to deal with the United States. Not just white people, but the way that the United States is set up.”His characters frequently find themselves wrestling with their identities, trying desperately to keep their bearings in a world that offers them little reliable support. “Moonlight” tracked a young boy in Liberty City who’s abused for being gay before he even knows what gay means; he finds temporary solace in a local drug dealer, the first person who cares more about taking care of him than about responding to his still-developing orientation. In a second chapter, the boy, now a teenager, experiences his first love with another boy, after which he meets with even more bullying and violence. He is forced to defend himself, which means closing parts of himself forever. In the third chapter, he is a man — isolated, reticent, guarding his vulnerability with a tool kit composed largely of push-ups, gold teeth and firearms — when a reunion with his teenage love forces him to make a decision about whether he will live and love as a queer man. Part of what makes the film work so exquisitely is the consistent sense of a character’s trying to find alignment with his deepest self while surrounded by limitless opportunities to lie.In McCraney’s 2016 family drama, “Head of Passes,” Phylicia Rashad starred as the matriarch of a New Orleans family who faces a crisis of faith when a terrible secret is revealed. As rains pour down, causing destruction in the family home, she must make peace with a God who would accept such suffering, while her three children rant and rage toward their own horrifying ends. Comparisons with Shakespeare’s “King Lear” are easy to make, but for McCraney the plot similarities are not the point; the characters are. “That’s an underutilized population of actors,” he says of black women entering late middle age. “There are women her age who don’t get to Lear.” To “Lear,” as a verb, means to take over a stage in your later years and expound upon life’s quandaries. It is assumed of esteemed white male actors that they will age gracefully into such roles, roaring and speechifying and showing their gravity. But where is that space for actors like Phylicia Rashad? “It’s annoying,” McCraney says, “because who better to Lear than these women?”Perhaps by way of reparations, McCraney gives the play over to Rashad’s character in the second act, granting her 20 full minutes alone onstage to rail against an unforgiving God while the heavens swirl. It is thrilling to see, in part because Rashad is a master of her craft, matching the force of the nature she confronts with the force of the nature within — and in part because, as in “Moonlight,” we are watching a character do everything she can to hold onto a sliver of self amid a sea of violent forces.These plays are, quite possibly, McCraney’s own sliver of self. While “Moonlight,” “Choir Boy” and “David Makes Man” are more strictly autobiographical, nearly every work he creates contains elements of his experience. His home and neighborhood were destroyed by Hurricane Andrew when he was in middle school, and a frequent aspect of his scripts is use of the pathetic fallacy: The mood of the heavens insists itself into the plot, manifesting the inner lives of his characters. His narratives often feel like stories of mortals adrift against a pantheon of gods who are, if not capricious, deeply flawed and untrustworthy.In Yoruba lore, one supreme god is Obatala, who typically dresses in white, can appear as either male or female and is the default owner of all souls until those souls are claimed by another Orisha. Obatala is all-powerful, the creator of humankind. But in one instance the god was drunk on wine and made some mistakes in creation. As a result, the experiences of people on earth are sometimes difficult, painful and unfair. For this reason, Obatala looks upon our suffering with extra care and favor. Unlike the Christian God, whose absolution serves as evidence of his faultlessness, Obatala does not grant us charity because we are imperfect. Obatala grants us charity because Obatala is imperfect.If the playwright is a creator of worlds, he is every bit as forgiving and loving of his subjects as Obatala is. There is a kindness in his treatment of character, a clear love. A major factor in the creation of “Head of Passes,” McCraney told me, his voice raising a couple of pitches, a smile opening up across his face, was that he just loves “seeing black women looking at and talking to black women onstage. There is nothing better.”On a Saturday morning in December, I arrived at a Manhattan Theater Club studio in a building on West 43rd Street to watch rehearsals for “Choir Boy.” The play tells the story of an openly gay teenage boy, Pharus, who is the head of the prestigious choir at a stalwart all-black boarding academy called the Charles R. Drew Prep School for Boys. His sexuality, as well as his general boldness and impulsivity, puts his relationships — and sometimes his body — at risk, and forces his peers to confront their own loves and insecurities. The music consists entirely of interpolations of Negro spirituals and folk songs like “Rockin’ Jerusalem” and “Keep Your Eyes on the Prize,” delivered in multipart harmony by the nine actors playing students. In the scene I watched the cast work on, the character of David, played by Caleb Eberhardt, decides to open his heart to another character, which he does by starting off a song, “Motherless Child.” The lyrics — “sometimes I feel like a motherless child/a long way from home” — date back to slavery, and like the words of most spirituals, they have a clear and heavy range of meanings. You can interpret them as personal, spiritual and political, all at once.All those meanings are at play in the scene. The boys of Drew are, literally, a long way from home. They share showers, sleep in dorm rooms and can call home only once a week. They are left to build themselves out of whatever is in the air: tough but fair headmasters, a dignified but burdensome “black excellence” tradition, a sky full of forceful and conflicting expectations of black masculinity. It is too much and boils over.Tensions are high among the boys in the locker room, who are still buzzing over a recent near-fight. David, on the way to the shower, stops to sing the first stanza of the song alone, then to a classmate. Then the entire group joins in, sending their voices echoing off unforgiving tile. It is meant to be heart-rending.The problem, this morning, was that it wasn’t working. The director, Trip Cullman — he most recently directed Kenneth Lonergan’s “Lobby Hero,” last year — was gamely trying different ways of transitioning into this fraught moment. What if Eberhardt did it from upstage? What if he went halfway off and came back? What if he started quietly and then built?The playwright was present, wearing a cream-colored cardigan, crisp jeans and gleaming, off-white, all-leather Chuck Taylors, seated at a folding table crowded with script binders and room-temperature coffees. So far, I had heard him say little. But now he asked for the floor. The actors took seats. I noticed I was nervous for him. When the actors are struggling and the director can’t seem to find a solution, you’re forced to ask: Could the problem be the script?But when McCraney talked, he didn’t talk about the play or the dialogue. Instead, he talked about grief. Casually, as though it were something that just came to his mind. He explained what it felt like to lose his mother at 22. He did not talk about how she died, and he hinted only a little at the complexity of their relationship; this address was not autobiographical. It was to do with emotions. McCraney described how grief lives in a person’s body, how it settles there. He explained its half-life, the unreliable nature of its decay. He talked about the phenomenon, when grieving a loved one, in which you begin to have memories of times after their death that you think they must have been present for. Remember when I won an Academy Award for my movie, and you were so proud? And then he talked about how things like that make you grieve their absence all over again, and how that grief catches you unawares, taking over your body when you least expect it. It sits in a small reservoir beneath your heart. It whispers to you at odd hours and yells at you in quiet ones.I teared up just a little bit hearing it. My own mother died in my arms almost exactly 10 years earlier. My relationship with her was also complicated. My grief also weaves in and out of being with little explanation or predictability. McCraney was calling something into the room, I might even say invoking it. All that was happening was that he was explaining something about grief — something that he, at age 38, knew, and that the cast, talented black Broadway-level actors/dancers/singers ranging in age from maybe 20 to 25, may not yet have known but were capable of understanding.When he was done explaining, Eberhadt spoke up. “I have an idea,” he said. “Is it O.K. if I try something?” To which McCraney replied: “It’s your show, man. Absolutely.”Back to places. The boys were at their fake lockers wearing fake towels; Eberhadt stood upstage, fake shower caddy in hand. Action. He turned downstage, thought about singing to one boy, decided against it. Caught his breath. Blinked. Called out the first word of the song with a force that seemed centuries old. Sometimes. It echoed and landed. There was silence. We felt it in our chests. He continued. Sometimes I don’t know where to go. My mother, my father won’t own me. So I try to make heaven my home.Now the chorus joined in. It was a youthful mourning, a boyish mourning. A male and adolescent mourning. A black one. A harmonious one. The song grew, the room was filled with it, it cascaded outward, upward from their bodies in clouds of spirit that, if you closed your eyes, you could almost see. When they finished, there was a moment of quiet in the room before the director said, simply: “Yeah. That’s it.”The moment McCraney lit up the most, smiled the widest, was when we began to talk about Spike Lee. “This man can shoot a film,” he said. “Nobody captures us in a cinematic, moving experience like Spike Lee.” One of his favorites, he told me, was Lee’s sophomore feature, “School Daze,” released in 1988. It’s fair to say I was, as a youth, obsessed with this film: I had entire scenes memorized. I bought a copy of the script and read it late at night by flashlight.McCraney’s excitement caused me to revisit it. It is just as I remembered it: wild, unclean, slapdash, hyperstylized. It’s a comedy about an uber-woke student at a historically black college — played by a very young Laurence Fishburne — and his battles with a black-and-bougie frat-boy nemesis (Giancarlo Esposito) and his girlfriend (Tisha Campbell). “It’s just extraordinary,” McCraney told me. “If you ever wanted to talk about Spike Lee having a black queer aspect, it’s in ‘School Daze.’ Because even in his endeavor to talk about the binary of colorism, he ends up just exploring everything that’s in the middle.”The scene McCraney told me he most loved was the jazz and R&B legend Phyllis Hyman’s performance at the school’s homecoming dance. Hyman is an undiluted marvel in all black, crowned by a regal headpiece with a shimmering gemstone in the center. Lee stops time in the film to admire her, matching the camera’s movements to her lithe alto and the warm, velvet delivery of her lyrics. It is a meditation, a reminder of all that we as black people possess, our history, our musicality, the art of it and the refinement of it. Hyman, who was 38 when “School Daze” was released, was an extraordinary talent who never experienced the fame reached by contemporaries like Anita Baker or Whitney Houston, despite being, perhaps, the better singer. When she committed suicide with a cocktail of sleeping pills in her Midtown apartment seven years later, she left a note. “I’m tired,” it said. “I’m tired.” Not working-in-a-cotton-field tired, but pre-thinking, post-thinking, anxiety and suffering and grief tired. Rewatching “School Daze” made me want to hug and protect every single black person on the screen; it made me want to keep Phyllis Hyman alive. It made me want to sing along with the choir in the rehearsal studio. It reminded me that I am not alone in feeling, sometimes, like a motherless child, a long, long way from home.The emotional stakes for black artists are often so very high. It can be overwhelming to be deeply sensitive, to love your people so much and still watch daily what is done to them. The centuries of pain, the unanswered calls for humanity, the depth of grief sometimes threaten to become too much, too heavy. It is no wonder that there are those among us who take into their mouths entire bottles of sleeping pills or put pistols to their 12-year-old chests until there is no more left to feel.To love black people immensely, to celebrate our very being as poetry, to lose yourself in our stories, to search them desperately and perpetually for our beauty — at the rehearsal for “Choir Boy,” what I witnessed was a man who has made himself a connoisseur of grief sharing that expertise with a roomful of younger black artists. His power, sure, is that he’s a playwright and that he has, through decades of study and training, built, from the ground up, a container for his mastery of feeling. Understanding and creating stories has been one survival method. But another has been the development of a keen, patient and nearly pansophical emotional intelligence. He has, in a sense, cracked the code on how to remain safe as a beautiful black man, at least for himself. It is, of course, to focus almost entirely on understanding and showing the beauty of others like you.Carvell Wallace is a contributing writer for the magazine and a podcaster based in Oakland, Calif.

The co-working giant’s real product isn’t office space — it’s a new kind of “corporate culture.“
The co-working giant’s real product isn’t office space — it’s a new kind of “corporate culture.“By GIDEON LEWIS-KRAUSImagine you trained an artificial intelligence on a comprehensive stock-photo set of every boutique-hotel lobby from Palm Springs to Stockholm to Milan, then connected it to a five-story 3-D printer fully furnished with pendant-dome lamps, waxy leaves and old-school hip-hop lyrics. The output would be a WeWork. So much serene, lavish and mechanical attention is allocated to every detail: the neon and the daybeds and the fiddle-leaf figs, the wallpaper and the playlists and the typefaces. The newest iteration of its ever-emergent design concept may be indebted to Luis Barragán and Carlo Scarpa, but the degree of thought and investment that goes into its terrarium construction is something its busy occupants are expected to register only as background noise. WeWorks feel voguish but never threatening; comfortable but never shabby; rousing but never intemperate; detailed but never ostentatious.There’s also free top-shelf coffee, the sort of minor frill most office workers might take for granted in a way the self-employed never would. One premise of the company’s existence is that it’s good business to provide such minor luxuries to the otherwise unfrilled. The coffee — and the draft kombucha, which has come to supplement beer as WeWork distances itself from the frattier aspects of entrepreneurship — is, at any rate, only part of an environment engineered for felicitous exchange. This strategy is supported by narrow hallways, boxy plate-glass enclosures, distant bathrooms and centralized fruit-water dispensers, but the company’s architects never indulged the belief that if they built it, people would come. The spaces themselves are the staging ground for yoga classes, wine tastings, make-your-own-trail-mix bars and vendor workshops about how to cut cloud costs. For what remains of life outside the workplace, there are cross-promotional discounts on 1-800-Flowers.com and Crunch gym memberships.Most of us have serious reasons to worry about the future of work, and it’s easy to object to WeWork’s thin consolations on the basis of aesthetic or moral principle. Once you get accustomed to the basic product, however, it’s hard not to find it ... pretty nice. Over the course of about a year, I stopped into locations in six or seven cities, and in each of them I sat in front of my computer alongside other people in front of their computers and felt at once marginally more productive and slightly less unmoored.[Housecleaners, nannies, health aides and domestic workers are organizing to secure job security. Read about the new labor movement in our Future of Work issue.] My “home” location — on North Fourth Street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, next to the Whole Foods across from the Apple store — was proposed to me, by WeWork’s unusually thoughtful and candid public-relations representatives, as a particularly strong example of the company’s “community layer” at work. The “community manager,” Natalie, is a luminous young woman with flaming scarlet hair and a rockabilly swagger. She started as the location’s first front-desk associate and rose quickly to her current role as operational czar, personal concierge and on-call therapist; she has also been recruited, in her capacity as a “theatrical jazz pop” singer, to perform at companywide events. She has first-name-basis relationships with everybody. She knows when the printer by the sunglasses and accessories manufacturer is going to run out, and when Ulrik, the chief executive of the Danish software-platform company that is the location’s largest tenant, is arriving on a red-eye and will require early-hours access. She was quick to put together canned-food and used-clothing drives on the occasions of disasters, and encouraged everyone to sign up for a marrow-donor registry. Community managers remember people’s birthdays and their preferences in candy or whiskey and their dogs’ preferences in treats.WeWorks feel voguish but never threatening; comfortable but never shabby; rousing but never intemperate; detailed but never ostentatious.If Natalie was everyone’s favorite quasi comptroller, it was clear that everyone’s favorite quasi co-worker was a young accountant named Mabel Luna. When she was 18, Mabel moved from the Dominican Republic to the Bronx. She put herself through school and worked for three of the Big Four accounting firms until she decided her heart was not in capital markets but in small companies. It was the idea of her own office, which she selected before the space had a floor, that gave her the confidence to start a business — a common sentiment at WeWork and one I heard particularly often from women and people of color — and on move-in day, she hung up her shingle as a private C.P.A. Though she never advertised, she quickly outgrew herself; she told me that 90 percent of her customers have come through WeWork, either via hallway run-ins or through the social-networking features of its mobile app. She had several clients in the building — including a brewer of natural alcoholic kombucha, a sole-proprietor attorney and the German sunglasses manufacturer by the printer — and saw herself as much more than an arm’s-length contractor. The only real glitch was that her friend-client-colleagues were constantly stopping by to rap on her window with a quick question about cash flow or depreciation, or to ask if she could spare an hour for a kombucha-tasting panel or some volunteer hand-modeling. During tax season, she felt as though she had to leave WeWork to get any work done.The relentless sociability inspired by WeWork was always one of the founders’ aims, even as the composition of its membership has changed. When the company first opened in 2010, its spaces catered to entrepreneurs. The founders soon understood that the increasingly fluid and anxious labor market — its conditions exacerbated by the downturn but likely to exist in perpetuity — presented them with a much larger potential customer base. Uber and TaskRabbit and other labor-platform intermediaries positioned themselves to match those who needed something done with those who needed something to do, but they based their recruitment drives on a cynical reading of the economic mood. The subway I took to WeWork was plastered with tough-love ads from services like Fiverr, which made naked appeals to stoic virtues. (“Actually, it hasn’t all been done before”; “In doers we trust”; “Reading about starting your own business is like reading about having sex.”)That sort of campaign felt manipulative: The platforms’ emphasis on self-reliance for the economically precarious merely disguised their rent-seeking. WeWork, by contrast, just charged rent. The company was perceptive enough to realize that disaggregated workers (or at least those of a certain class) did not want to hear that they should just kill it on their own, bro. They wanted to hear that nobody ever can. What WeWork offered was not just rhetoric — a more sympathetic description of the restless, fretful life of the deinstitutionalized worker — but true shelter from a pervasive sense of alienation. Where Fiverr issued an invitation to gladiatorial combat, WeWork promised a work environment remodeled for solace and dignity.Thus is the business model of WeWork, recently valued at $47 billion, now only facially about commercial subletting. All its accessories serve to buttress its real product: “office culture” as a service. When people at the company try to explain that culture, they invariably resort to talk of positive energy sources and the obligation to heal the social fabric — a vocabulary traditionally associated with utopian architecture, 1980s academic communitarianism or ayahuasca experimentation. They affirm that all the ostensibly small incremental niceties add up to more than the sum of their parts, and on some level I couldn’t help agreeing. The market certainly seems to. As of this January, WeWork has 400,000 members in 425 locations in 27 countries, at least 30 percent of whom are employees of large existing businesses. This latter category has helped double that membership in only a year. Some of these enterprise customers are merely outsourcing their facilities management the way they outsource manufacturing or payroll; others anticipate the revitalization — or even wholesale procurement — of their corporate culture. The conviction behind the rapid growth of WeWork is that the office culture of the future is likely to be the culture of the future, full stop, and that it is WeWork’s special vocation to bring it to market.The idea of “corporate culture,” long before it was identified and cultivated as such, emerged as a solution to the problems of the large, distributed mass-industrial firm. Ransom Olds is credited with inventing the concept of the assembly line in 1901, and it was over the following decades that businesses began to feel an imperative to address the question of what work was supposed to “mean.” This was both an internal bottom-line matter — employees who toiled in exchange for only a paycheck were difficult to retain and unlikely to prioritize efficiency or innovation — and a social one. By midcentury, large companies like the car manufacturers had come to represent the predominant institutional affiliation for legions of American men. Even if these firms had no explicit philanthropic interest in civic cohesion, they certainly had a stake in the preservation of the social order. If they could invest piecemeal labor with something like dignity, they could neutralize the political and economic threats posed by union solidarity.What they arrived at was a generic set of strategies, applicable at any industrial organization, designed to help workers recognize the value of their personal contributions to the final product. The classic formulation of this approach was Peter Drucker’s “Concept of the Corporation”; though it’s now seen — if not much read — as a foundational text in the study of management, it reads like a sober contribution to midcentury sociology. The simplest form of recognition is advancement. Workers, Drucker believed, ought to be viewed not as exploitable resources but as human capital to be fostered, and thus provided with the training necessary to secure a path upward. Programs like project rotations — which exposed otherwise specialized employees to the breadth of company operations — should be put in place even if they seemed, in the short term, economically irrational; in the long term, they represented an investment in worker potential. Employees unlikely to advance might more gladly accept their place in the corporate scheme when given a holistic perspective on production: The maker of a car’s door hinge, for example, might be shown where his discrete, repetitive effort fits into the fully realized car.The anthropologist Clifford Geertz defined culture as a collective act of interpretation, the stories we tell one another about ourselves in an attempt to make ongoing sense of why we do what we do. A car manufacturer could just point to a sensible Oldsmobile, something the world self-evidently needed. Because cars were public goods, corporate culture could easily borrow its energy from civic culture.It could also borrow civic culture’s prevailing norms — and, in turn, reinforce them. The management classic “Built to Last” describes how Walt Disney, for example, did not manage a corporation so much as lord over an extended brood of subordinates, each of them expected not only to abide by the letter of company decorum but also to embody its founder’s spirit. Hourly theme-park workers were held to an imperious standard of personal upkeep: for men, no facial hair; for women, no dangly earrings or excessive makeup. As one biographer described it, “When someone did, on occasion, slip in Walt’s presence and use a four-letter word in mixed company, the result was always immediate dismissal, no matter what type of professional inconvenience the firing caused.” The people making the country’s cars could be forgiven a coarse exclamation; the people making the country’s cartoons were held to a loftier code.As the economy shifted from industrial manufacturing to the service and knowledge sectors, it became increasingly necessary for businesses to articulate their “core purpose” as an organizational and motivational principle — and a way to differentiate “their” ethereal knowledge work from whatever it was other companies’ employees did. The separation of corporate culture in particular from general civic culture was also encouraged by the ascendancy of free-market economics; Milton Friedman told executives that their sole remit was to tend to their own shareholder garden. Shared goals, while important, ought to be strictly values-agnostic.An intrinsic and well-elaborated corporate mission was seen as a crucial competitive advantage. “Built to Last” examined, as a comparative case study, cultural differences in the tobacco sector. As the authors put it, “we saw in Philip Morris an esprit de corps and sense of common purpose that we simply did not see over the last 30 years at R.J. Reynolds. Philip Morris executives have appeared far more passionate about their cigarettes than the executives at R.J. Reynolds. Philip Morris executives express much more defiance in their prosmoking ideology, whereas the R.J.R. folks after about 1960 did not seem to care much about the products except as a way to make money. ... The Philip Morris executives, in contrast, framed the fight over cigarettes in almost self-righteous moral overtones: We have a right to smoke; it’s a matter of freedom of choice. Don’t take away our cigarettes. Don’t tread on me!” One former employee told them that “the company forced upon her and her co-workers boxes of cigarettes to take home with their paychecks.”Implicit in all this was the acknowledgment that corporate work was not a clear-cut transaction but a complicated relationship. The difference between a contractor and an employee was that the employee accepted the benefits of security and attention along with the costs of unspecified professional obligations — the sum of which could be called culture. This paternalistic ethos in mainstream corporate America has long seemed aesthetically dour, economically inefficient and morally retrograde. “Corporate culture” today, when it means anything at all, no longer encodes a set of values as a miscellany of obligations but instead represents an elevated way to package a miscellany of amenities. Given the structure of our current economy, most companies understand that it’s in the best interests of the shareholders to call it even: They’ve withdrawn the Disney-like benefits as well as the Disney-like expectations and set their employees “free.”WeWork has stepped into this breach, purporting to offer the best of both worlds. On the one hand, it speaks the language of autonomy: You can choose to sit at a table or a booth or a couch, you can come and go as you please, and if you rent an actual office, you can decorate it like a tiki bar or a nuclear submarine if you fancy it. On the other, however, it speaks the language of belonging, awarding freelancers like me the chance to go to office holiday parties, to feel as if our lives have been enlivened by the scuttlebutt around the ambiently professional boathouse. With a stable corporate culture, especially in a unionized shop, these two wants aren’t contradictory: Solidarity among colleagues can give strength and definition to any individual employee’s sense of independence. But in the floating economy that WeWork equips, there’s something uneasy about the company’s à la carte promises.'Corporate culture' today, when it means anything at all, no longer encodes a set of values as a miscellany of obligations but instead represents an elevated way to package a miscellany of amenities.The primary evidence for WeWork’s faith in its own corporate calling — to be the universal purveyor of energy and community — is internal. The two big collective imprinting events on the company calendar each year are Summer Camp, a tent revival, and a wintertime Summit, a three-day carnival for thousands of employees. In January last year, the event took place in a cavernous theater underneath Madison Square Garden. The ratio of M.S.G. employees to WeWork attendees seemed to be approximately one to one, and the two groups faced off with a kind of looking-glass symmetry: on the one side, union sweatshirts and jackets for the electricians and security guards, and on the other, young people in “Women of WeWork” or “We of Color” or “East Region” or “Created in China” team T-shirts and sturdy outerwear over the standard-issue gray-heather CREATOR undershirts. The assembled WeWorkforce — which is, for a tech company, exceptionally diverse, gender-balanced and bizarrely attractive — had a relaxed cool that clashed with the atmosphere of corporate sentimentality. In the background, an inspirational video invited attendees to imagine “something that’s greater than any one of us.” Everyone present was “part of a new generation — the ‘We’ generation.”On the first full day of internal talks, Miguel McKelvey, a founder of the company and its chief culture officer, took the stage in a purple-heather “We of Color” T-shirt. A keystone of company lore is that he grew up in a matriarchal collective in Oregon. (The other founder, Adam Neumann, grew up in part on a kibbutz; today, according to recent reports, he collects millions of dollars from WeWork as one of its landlords.) McKelvey explained that thus far the company had been associated with “entrepreneurs, start-ups, freelancers, and that’s who we typically think of as the innovative people in our world.” This was a characteristic WeWork sleight of hand, insofar as he was referring both to the employees present and to the current well of members; the company has a classic “I’m not just the president — I’m also a member” mentality. Over the last few years, he went on, “larger companies thought: WeWork seems cool. We should put our teams into WeWork locations.”This was all prelude to McKelvey’s announcement that the company was radically expanding its courtship of enterprise customers — offering a suite of “space as a service” options under the new rubric Powered by We. WeWork had contrived its turnkey member culture to make freelancers and entrepreneurs feel as though they worked at Google; now WeWork would turn around and help employees at legacy businesses feel as though they worked at WeWork. Some companies, like Liberty Mutual (Boston) and Nasdaq (New York), have simply taken a floor or two in a WeWork location. Others, like IBM (New York), have moved into entire buildings. WeWork’s most enthusiastic customers — UBS (Weehawken, N.J.) and Sprint (Kansas City) are two of the biggest examples — have engaged the company’s bespoke services from planning through build-out to management.Veresh Sita, an executive in charge of this novel product line, appeared onstage and asked us to close our eyes and “imagine a workplace — imagine a workplace where you can create a life; imagine a workplace that’s so much more than an office, desks and infrastructure; imagine a workplace built on your needs — physically and digitally.” When we opened our eyes, he reminded us that most people did not have that privilege. “Eighty-five percent of employees at enterprise businesses do not feel engaged today.”The screen behind him flashed a beige sea of barren cubicles. “Fifty-one percent of employees at enterprise companies are currently looking for a job.” What these companies needed was a better “workplace experience.” Sita showed before-and-after slides of one firm’s transformation. The first showed a collection of yellowing chairs scattered desolately around white laminate cafeteria tables; the second showed what we were to understand as the same space reborn as an open loft, with gales of natural light reflecting off the herringbone parquet and the emerald shoots of their ubiquitous succulents. “I don’t know what you even call the first one,” he said. “Death row?”From an investor’s perspective, WeWork’s pivot to culture has been a business necessity. The company takes out large commercial leases — initially entire floors, later buildings — and subdivides the floor plans into “storefront” units with the size and flexibility designed to suit start-ups. As plenty of discriminating observers have pointed out, this business model is vulnerable to some huge macroeconomic risks: On the “supply” side of commercial leases, the company has little control over costs, while on the “demand” side, its (highly elastic) product risks feeling like an easily duplicated commodity. And so, from the perspective of both investors and customers, it’s paramount that WeWork not be seen as purely a real estate arbitrageur. The focus on “culture” affords it a kind of magical penumbra of workplace retrofuturism.If the company’s “CultureOS” excuses it from the harsh realities of commercial real estate, it also affords it an opportunity to differentiate its product from the “surveillance capitalism” of the pure technology companies. It has collected an enormous amount of workplace data and has developed experimental desks that will feature personalized height and temperature settings, all of which could easily be exploited by productivity-hawk employers, but much of its CultureOS is oriented to “work-life balance.” This could be flexibly interpreted. The Summit events included a panel with two community managers at enterprise locations. One was told by a client company never to plan events on Fridays, because people just didn’t come in that day. But the community manager and her team went ahead and scheduled the sort of social calendar they were used to, and, she said, “last Friday at 6:30 p.m., there were people playing Jenga and drinking beer.” People who would usually leave at 3 or 4 were staying later than they ever had. Remote employees were now coming in every day; one was suddenly around so much that he was asked if he’d relocated from the suburbs to the city, but the answer was no. “Even if I have to commute every day for five hours,” he apparently continued, “I want to be here.”The community manager was confident that something as casual as weekly happy hours had been revolutionary to their new clients. “Executives who would otherwise be hiding out in private offices are now being peer-pressured to come out and hang with their direct reports. We are destroying hierarchy.”When I met McKelvey a few weeks later at WeWork’s Manhattan headquarters, he made it clear that the long-term plan was not just to make IBM a bit more like Google but something much more grandiose. The company’s CultureOS was about being “supportive to openness and conversation” and the “obligation we create to each other to be good humans to each other — to share a smile and some warmth.” We’ve learned the hard way from social media, he said, that “alignment along ideological lines is a shallow way of creating a human environment.” This, McKelvey said, is what he tells his team: “You’re not building work space. You’re here building a new infrastructure to rebuild social fabric and rebuild up the potential for human connection.” It was, he conceded, a “big leap.” But the company existed to give it a shot. “Who am I going to need in a disaster? The person I took a yoga class with versus the person I’m in the same Facebook group with?” The enterprise product could scale up that social infrastructure to unite millions and millions of people. On a hard-hat tour of WeWork’s new West Coast headquarters, in San Francisco’s Salesforce Tower, Adam Neumann told me: “Assuming we keep up our personal growth as a company, as individuals and as a company, there is no limit. Businesses, neighborhoods, cities — there are new cities being built around the world, and we want the call from those cities.”WeWork is not so naïve as to think that narrow hallways, happy hours, Taco Tuesdays and yoga are going to revive the workplace as a locus of societal coherence. But it thinks that thousands of Natalies remembering the birthdays of thousands of Mabel Lunas might, and it’s to its sincere credit that — unlike most other technology companies, but like most religions — it recognizes that meaning at scale is a high-touch business, and it seems prepared to invest in labor costs that, even if they’re drawn from the low-wage hospitality sector, will grow linearly with expansion. When I spoke to representatives of Powered by We customers, they were highly appreciative of a partnership that gave their employees at the very least better access to informal common spaces.And WeWork is right to perceive that it provides its members with a heightened sense of social organization. To join WeWork is to feel gently buoyed along in a strange kind of substrate, neither fully adrift nor fully anchored, loosely bound to others by novel waveforms. These ties alternately resemble deals between independent contractors, collaborations between colleagues, flirtations between strangers and intimacy between friends — and insofar as they muddy the boundaries between these things, they ultimately feel like none of them. There is a near-imaginable WeWorld in which all human endeavor outsources itself to associations of WeNodes that in an eternal churn arise as spontaneously as they disperse. If a very clever combination of architecture, technology and hospitality serves as an analgesic for the disaggregated, it can just as easily function as a solvent for the institutions that remain.This might not be such a bad thing, especially for certain types of “creatives” and “innovators,” but it’s hard to see where community will take root and culture will flower. WeWork’s executives might believe that people are lonely and atomized because our social infrastructure has been degraded, but the problem is not that we lack opportunities to brush up against one another. They confuse the possibility of interaction with the incentive and desire to interact; they confuse their own set decoration for the provision of a common script. You cannot put a bunch of random actors on a stage and expect them to fumble their way toward a play. When a spirit of community does unfold ex nihilo in one of their spaces, the simplest explanation is selection bias: When they open locations based on proximity to a Whole Foods or an Apple store, they are masking the sorting mechanism they’ve used to build their brand.WeWork had contrived its turnkey member culture to make freelancers and entrepreneurs feel as though they worked at Google; now WeWork would turn around and help employees at legacy businesses feel as though they worked at WeWork. As for me, I never went to any of those free yoga classes; I suppose I can’t really speak for Williamsburg’s other members, but perhaps that’s the point. I was an extracurricular truant in part because I liked my own yoga classes just fine and in part because the WeWork events I did attend were so networky. Also, I always had too much work. It’s tempting to underline the paradox that, in my case, a WeWork yoga class could very plausibly have counted as work, but then again the very same could be said for any of North Fourth Street’s accountants or kombucha marketers — not to make allies in anticipation of disaster but to trawl for more clients and contractors.And I didn’t really care to go to the holiday party either. The anarchic thrill of a masquerade is electrifying only insofar as it feels genuinely remissive: A harvest ritual only makes sense as a reprieve from the collective sacrifices of the season. One thing that executives at Philip Morris and Disney understood was that cultures succeed in the attempt to organize and structure human behavior only when they address both what you are permitted to do and what you are obligated to do. “Do what you love” is only half a culture; what’s missing is the idea that there might be some deep reward, beyond the gratification of self-discipline, for doing what you have to do even when you don’t love it — in other words, for doing work. An authority that can’t compel is not an authority that can protect or inspire.WeWork’s own precedent puts its employees in an excellent position to understand this dynamic. A recent executive mandate declared the company a “meat-free” organization. When I interviewed McKelvey not long after the Summit, he had a very fuzzy time trying to explain the meaning of the “eight pillars” of its CultureOS and the relationships among them. But when he noticed that the P.R. representative happened to be carrying a single-use plastic water bottle, he admonished her to be mindful of her own consumption. For all the company’s vaulting ambition to build the workplace of the future, this was much closer to Walt Disney than Milton Friedman.Over the past year, as WeWork has been folded into what is now called the We Company — which encompasses WeGrow, its school, and WeLive, its communal housing projects — its Powered by We product has been refined and formalized. Recently, I met with Lakshmi Rengarajan, its director of workplace connection and a recent recruit from Match.com, and Craig Robinson, a veteran of commercial real estate who now served as global head of Powered by We Services, along with two P.R. representatives; the company’s data show that people prefer small conference rooms to medium-size ones, and the five of us were pressed into intimacy by the vitrine they’d reserved.Rengarajan and Robinson were careful to italicize the idea that they’re not trying to foist their own strong, participatory, idiosyncratic culture on anybody else’s shop. Their services, while inspired by and grounded in the company’s internal environment, begin with WeWork’s tailored attempts to understand the client’s own organizational structure and needs. They did, of course, have a repertoire of connective practices that seemed to them universally valuable. Rengarajan told me that “the first step toward someone being seen as a full human” was to begin with something as simple as a round of stories about where people’s first names came from; she explained that a former boss, unable for some reason to pronounce the name Lakshmi, had simply called her Sue. Robinson, who had personally experienced Rengarajan’s exercise twice, said that the activity made it easy to remember Rengarajan because her name meant she was born on a Monday. “Or maybe it wasn’t Monday?”“Friday,” she said, and laughed.But they were not so presumptuous as to expect that Sprint or UBS would have a cafeteria that served no meat. I wondered how far they would extend themselves to help a firm help its employees to do what they loved. Would they be willing to work with, say, Philip Morris? Everyone tried to sustain simultaneous eye contact with me while they all paused to give it some thought.“That,” each repeated in turn with total, collective sincerity, “is a great question.” They were going to have to talk about it.Gideon Lewis-Kraus is a writer at large for the magazine.
