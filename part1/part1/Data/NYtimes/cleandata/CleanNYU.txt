the ridehailing giants numerous legal issuesPart of Tony Wests mandate in his job as chief legal officer is to help reduce Ubers various legal entanglementsCreditCreditCarlos Chavarra for The New York TimesSupported byBy Kate CongerSAN FRANCISCO  Not long after Tony West joined Uber as chief legal officer in November  he began a delicate task crafting a transparency report to quantify how many people had been sexually assaulted during Uber ridesThe effort was part of Mr Wests mandate to help clean up Uber which had been grappling with legal entanglements safety issues and a problematic workplace cultureSo Mr West directed Uber employees to work with the National Sexual Violence Resource Center a nonprofit to review  instances of sexual misconduct that occurred during rides in  He listened to customer service calls including one in which an Uber driver said he had raped a passenger And the company began auditing past complaints to determine whether it had evidence of old assaultsNearly  months later the work is far from over This is a hugely underreported set of situations Mr West  said Those numbers as we continue to count them they actually might go upSince Dara Khosrowshahi Ubers chief executive brought in Mr West to help turn around the ridehailing company and professionalize it the attorney has swept aside many of its highestprofile legal woes While Uber is still dealing with hundreds of legal cases Mr West settled a tabloidworthy trade secrets lawsuit last year by Alphabets selfdriving car business Waymo and negotiated a multistate settlement over a vast  data breachBut the sexual assault transparency report which Mr West plans to release this year underlines just how much more work Uber needs to do  and how thorny the challenge can be to navigateHe is very upfront about the fact that its not going to be pretty Tammy Albarran Ubers deputy general counsel said of Mr West and the transparency reportThe work is especially important as Uber gears up for a highly anticipated initial public offering Lyft Ubers main rival in the United States made its offering prospectus public on Friday and is likely to begin trading on the stock market next monthUber which may go public at a  billion valuation would dwarf Lyft But to pull off a successful offering the company must reduce its legal exposure and show that it has revamped its culture and cares about the safety of passengersMr West a former Justice Department official and the brotherinlaw of Senator Kamala Harris the California Democrat who is running for president said he was hitching his reputation to Uber and its changesI had a reputation that I was also putting on the table right he said in a recent interviewA native of the Bay Area Mr West graduated from Harvard University and Stanford Law School He rose to prominence as an assistant attorney general in the Obama administration during which he urged the Justice Department to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act and worked to reduce the number of detainees in the military prison at Guantnamo BayIn  he became general counsel of PepsiCo where he said he learned how to operate in a Fortune  company Then in  Mr Khosrowshahi came callingAt the time Uber was reeling from the ouster of Travis Kalanick as chief executive and the aftermath of an investigation into its workplace amid other issues Mr Khosrowshahi was tapped to stabilize the company and eventually take it public Over several dinners in New York he pitched Mr West on the idea of turning Uber into a more selfcritical companyUber needed someone with a great amount of negotiation prowess and relationships Mr Khosrowshahi said Hes got bothMr West jumped ship There was nothing I was going to do that was going to fundamentally change the trajectory of PepsiCo he saidAt Uber Mr West began rebuilding the legal department with several former Justice Department colleagues He also confronted some urgent legal problems They included a trial in early  to defend the company against allegations that it had stolen trade secrets from Waymo in the race to build selfdriving carsThe weekend before the trial started that February Mr West met with Waymos lawyers to settle the case The conversation ended in an impasseAfter the trial opened embarrassing revelations about Uber quickly tumbled out Mr West said that he had texted Kevin Vosen Waymos general counsel from the courtroom and that the two had met during breaks to keep trying for a settlement Waymo declined to comment on Mr Vosens conversations with Mr WestFour days after the trial began the two sides struck a deal Uber agreed to provide Waymo which had sought  billion in damages with  percent of its stock valued then at  million as well as the right to inspect Ubers selfdriving technologyAt the same time Mr West worked to placate investigators who were digging into the  data breach which Uber had kept secret and which had prompted numerous state lawsuits for violation of data breach notification laws Mr West said he had kept in frequent contact with Lisa Madigan who was the Illinois attorney general to hash out a settlement The two had worked together while he was at the Justice DepartmentMs Madigan said that being friends with Mr West in some ways makes it easier to negotiate We both know the law we both know the problem and we both know there needs to be a resolution she saidIn September Mr West and Ms Madigan agreed that Uber would pay  million to all  states to settle the data breach investigationMr West also worked with Mr Khosrowshahi to change Ubers culture Last year Mr West helped Uber settle a  million pay discrimination lawsuit by three former female employees And he helped settle a lawsuit by nine women who had been raped kidnapped assaulted or harassed by drivers The company declined to disclose the terms of the dealEric H Holder Jr the former attorney general who led an inquiry into Ubers workplace in  and is friends with Mr West said of the company They still have work to do but made really significant progress in a short period of timeSome of the work today revolves around the sexual assault transparency report Uber is now training its customer service representatives to sort incidents into  categories The process is complex for instance Uber considers a touch between a persons thighs to be sexual while a touch on other areas of the thigh is notBecause the company operates in  countries the training must also be localized That is tricky because of varied cultural norms  a kiss on the cheek might be a common greeting in Europe but would be unexpected in the United States Mr West notedThere are these differing concepts and views about what can be considered intimate or sexual or appropriate or inappropriate he saidHow long Mr West will stay at Uber is unclear he has already faced questions internally about whether he will leave to join Ms Harriss presidential campaign Mr West is married to Maya Harris Senator Harriss sister and campaign chairwoman He also coled Ms Harriss transition team after she was elected to the Senate in Ms Harriss office did not respond to requests for commentWhen asked if he would return to government Mr West demurred and said a presidential victory for Ms Harris would most likely prevent him from working in the administration because he was a relativeIt would depend on a lot of things not the least of which is What would I be going back for he saidAn earlier version of this article misstated the number and nature of  incidents reviewed by Uber and the

SurveyMonkeyFor Uber the question as the ridehailing giant prepares for a public offering is even bigger than whether it can make money Thats because the company the most prominent tech startup of its generation will set the bar for other wellknown tech companies like Slack and Lyft as they also stampede toward the stock market this yearSo far Uber is not doing itself any favors on profitsThe company reported on Friday that it had narrowed its net loss in the fourth quarter of  from a year earlier But excluding certain onetime items including the sale of some of its businesses Ubers losses for the quarter rose  percent from the previous year to  millionThe losses were a result of Ubers increasing its spending as it tries to outmuscle competitors many of which have intensified their efforts to add riders and drivers Uber has responded by offering bigger incentives and more promotions to fend off rivals like DoorDash Lyft and other ridehailing and fooddelivery servicesUber made its financial disclosure as it hurtles toward what is set to be one of the biggestever public offerings by a tech company A transportation colossus Uber was privately valued at more than  billion last year and proposals from investment bankers suggest that it could be worth as much as  billion after going public The share sale will create enormous windfalls for Ubers many investors and for its founders and early employeesAs a private company Uber is not required to disclose financial results But it has regularly done so over the past two years to inform investors about its business and perhaps to keep the depth of its losses from coming as a surprise laterThe latest set of figures probably Ubers last as a private company will be closely scrutinized Many investors initially give young and fastgrowing tech startups a pass for losing money but questions about whether such companies can ultimately be profitable eventually catch up with them Investors criticized Twitter for racking up losses before it finally began to make money last year and they have pushed down Snaps share price since its public offering partly because the company is still deeply unprofitableIn a statement Ubers chief financial officer Nelson Chai did not address the companys losses He said Uber had maintained category leadership in its ridehailing business and he noted other bright spots including the companys freightmanagement business and nascent ebike and scooter programUber has a long history of spending large sums of money Ridehailing is inherently an expensive business that

declined as it cut prices to match competitors and spent money on expanding its fooddelivery business Uber Eats The margins are also smaller on Uber Eats orders because the company pays commissions to restaurants as well as delivery driversUbers selfdriving car program which will probably not yield revenue for years continues to burn cash The company returned its autonomous vehicles to public roads

of its autonomous cars hit and killed a pedestrian in Tempe a year agoOn March   a Volvo sport utility vehicle one of several selfdriving vehicles that Uber was testing was traveling about  miles per hour when it hit Elaine Herzberg  as she was walking her bicycle across the street at night the authorities saidWhile the car was in autonomous mode a safety driver was sitting in the drivers seatThe Yavapai County Attorneys Office which reviewed the case said in a letter dated Monday that there was no basis for criminal liability for the Uber corporationBut it added that investigators should look into what the safety driver would or should have seen that night given the vehicles speed lighting conditions and other relevant factorsThe Yavapai County Attorneys Office said an investigation into the case was continuingIn June the Tempe Police Department released a report that said the safety driver was streaming the television show The Voice on her phone in the minutes leading up to the crash The Arizona Republic reportedUber declined to comment Tuesday as did the Tempe police The Yavapai County Attorneys Office did not answer further questions about how it reached its decisionThe March  crash is believed to be the first pedestrian death resulting from selfdriving technology and many wondered how prosecutors would approach a criminal investigationThe crash raised questions about the safety of the technology as well as the comprehensiveness of the rules governing it Few such federal or state rules existIts not very well trod at all said Frank Douma a research scholar at the University of Minnesotas Center for Transportation Studies To my knowledge there is not any sort of real brightline statement about whos liable whenMr Douma said prosecutors announcement Tuesday tracked with how typically people and not car manufacturers are held responsible for crimes they commit behind the wheel But as autonomous vehicles become more sophisticated he said such cases raise questions about that way of thinkingIs this driver or was this driver behaving in any way different than what most drivers are going to be behaving like when the car is doing this much driving he said Its a very conventional way of thinking to say we can expect and we should expect people to sit and monitor technology that is otherwise doing all the decisionmakingThe Yavapai County Attorneys Office did its review at the request of the Maricopa County Attorneys Office which had a potential conflict of interest in the case because of an earlier partnership with Uber in a safety campaign The Maricopa County Attorneys Office did not respond to requests for comment on TuesdayThe New York Times reported last March that Ubers autonomous cars in Arizona struggled to meet the companys expectations and required drivers to intervene more frequently than those of the companys competitorsUber suspended testing of selfdriving vehicles after the crash In December the vehicles returned to public roads though at reduced speeds and in lesschallenging environmentsIn a preliminary report about the crash released in May the National Transportation Safety Board said the Uber cars computer system had spotted Ms Herzberg six seconds before impact but classified Ms Herzberg who was not in a crosswalk first as an unrecognized object then as another vehicle and finally as a bicycleThe Uber car equipped with Ubers sensing technology comes with an automatic emergency braking system from the manufacturerBut Uber had disabled that function as well as other safety features to reduce the potential for erratic vehicle behavior according to the report putting the onus on the safety driver to interveneThe agency said Ubers safety driver grabbed the steering wheel to swerve at the last second but did not start braking until after impactThe Republic reported last March that family members of Ms Herzberg had resolved a case against Uber The Republic said that the family was represented by the law firm Bellah Perez which said Tuesday that it could not comment on whether the firm had been involved in the caseAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Kate CongerSAN FRANCISCO  When Uber and Lyft go public this year their founders top executives and investors are set to reap billions of dollars in new wealthBut one group that helped build up the ridehailing companies will miss out on most of the rewards their driversThats because while Ubers and Lyfts fulltime employees and investors own company stock that they can convert into cash after the initial public offerings the millions of drivers who ferry passengers around for the services are independent contractors That has made them ineligible for stock grants  and bystanders to the coming IPO bonanzaNow Uber and Lyft facing the growing inequity between its stockholders and its drivers are pursuing measures to address the gap Both intend to set up programs to give cash to some drivers enabling them to buy company stock at the time of the IPO according to two people who have been briefed on the plans The drivers can also keep the cash as a bonus said the people who declined to be named because they were not authorized to speak publiclyThe programs will not give drivers a major share of Ubers and Lyfts stock Lyft plans to give  each to drivers who have completed  rides for the service those who have

awakening by Uber and Lyft Eric Ries author of the startup worlds bible The Lean Startup and chief executive of LTSE a new stock exchange said the move hinted at these companies prioritiesThe next generation of companies understand their obligation to share power and prosperity with the community that made them successful he said Its no longer optionalBut many Uber and Lyft drivers had a different view Don Creery an Uber and Lyft driver who previously worked on a campaign in Seattle to win collectivebargaining rights for ridehailing drivers called the programs a token gestureI think we would probably rather get what we wanted all along which is a fair rate of pay and make enough money to buy stock in companies that might actually be valuable Mr Creery said Still he gave the companies credit for certainly acknowledging usBhairavi Desai executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance an organization that represents taxi and ridehail drivers called the efforts by Lyft and Uber a slap in the face especially since the companies are going to go public on the sweat of the driversThe issue is galling to many drivers because the public offerings of Uber and Lyft are set to mint a new class of billionaires out of an elite group of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and investors Uber is estimated to go public at a valuation of as much as  billion and one of its founders Travis Kalanick has already become a billionaire by selling some of his company stock to private investors Lyft which is likely to unveil its initial public offering prospectus on Friday was last valued in the private market at just over  billionDrivers who have long been at the heart of the ridehailing business have made attempts to change their status with Uber and Lyft so that they can be

wants to extend the cap prompting Uber to sue the city last week to overturn the lawUber has fiercely opposed the cap arguing that it hurts New Yorkers who rely on the app especially outside Manhattan where there are fewer transit options The lawsuit called the citys regulatory approach unfortunate irresponsible and irrationalMr de Blasio a Democrat with presidential ambitions responded by saying the citys new rules  both the cap and a measure to raise wages for drivers  were neededNo legal challenge changes the fact that Uber made congestion on our roads worse and paid their drivers less than a living wage said Seth Stein a spokesman for the mayor The citys new laws aim to change thatLike many other cities across the world New York is struggling to respond to the explosive growth of the ridehailing industry The influx of vehicles has raised concerns about street congestion working conditions for drivers the decimation of the yellow cab industry and the siphoning of riders from public

New Yorkers from earning a living wage Josh Gold a spokesman for Uber said in a statementSome business leaders worry that Amazons decision to abandon its deal with New York could hurt the citys image as a tech hubBut Nicole Gelinas a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute said the struggle with Uber is not a tech issue  its about worsening street trafficWere not really afraid of being branded antitech Ms Gelinas said In the long term our problem is how do we deal with all of this growth  and not the risk that were going to drive away that growth with a little bit of rhetoric and a little regulationMr de Blasio has a bitter history with Uber When the mayor first proposed a cap in  Uber launched an aggressive attack introducing a de Blasio view in the companys app to blame him for long wait times Uber won the debate and became shorthand in his administration for an embarrassing defeatBut Uber was on the defensive last year when the cap idea was revived by Corey Johnson the City Council speaker Ubers reputation had been harmed by accusations of gender discrimination and other scandals It hired a new chief executive and a new leader for New York to try to improve its imageThe

incomes so low that they qualify for Medicaid and about  percent qualify for food stamps according to a study by prominent economists last yearThe cap was expected to last a year while the city

Blasio said in a radio interview that he wanted to put ongoing caps in place on the forhire vehicles Officials at City Hall confirmed that the mayor was considering extending the capUbers lawsuit argues that it was not legal for the city to delegate the power to cap vehicles to the taxi commission If Uber cannot meet growing rider demand the lawsuit says that could hurt the states efforts to

announced on Tuesday giving it a strong foothold in the region ahead of its expected public offeringThe deal valued at  billion will need regulatory approval and may not be completed until next yearUbers public offering expected next month could reach a valuation of up to  billion rivaling the  listing of Alibaba the Chinese ecommerce giant But Uber has remained unprofitable burning cash on subsidies for its riders and drivers in an effort to undercut its competition In the final quarter of  the company lost  million on revenue of  billionBy taking over its main competition in the Middle East Uber could cut its losses there The deal with Careem will also give it access to some countries like Iraq Palestine and Morocco where it does not operateUber will pay  billion in cash and  billion in convertible notes Careem will continue to operate under its own brand and remain somewhat independent of Uber Both companies will continue to offer rides but may test certain features on one platform before introducing them on the otherThe deal is a break from Ubers approach in some other regions Uber has sold majority stakes of its businesses in Russia China and Southeast Asia to local competitors after deciding to avoid price wars in those areas Those deals briefly put Uber in the black for the first time in the companys historyWith a proven ability to develop innovative local solutions Careem has played a key role in shaping the future of urban mobility across the Middle East becoming one of the most successful startups in the region Dara Khosrowshahi Ubers chief executive said in a statementCareem was founded in  as a corporate car service but eventually adopted a ridehailing model similar to Ubers The company is based in Dubai and operates in  countries including Egypt and Saudi Arabia It recently expanded into food delivery and payments seeking to establish itself as a onestop shop for consumers Private investors valued the company at about  billion last yearBut Ubers deal could raise privacy concerns As the company planned its expansion in Egypt in  government officials there asked it to provide realtime access to users location data Uber declined arguing that it had never provided realtime access to governments but Careem was more open to cooperating with the governmentIn  hackers stole personal data for  million users from Careem To address these concerns Careems security and legal teams will report directly to Uber according to a person familiar with the deal The person would speak only on the condition of anonymity ahead of Ubers public offeringMr Khosrowshahi said in an email to employees that both Uber and Careem would benefit from operating independentlyThis framework has the advantage of letting us build new products and try new ideas across not one but two strong brands with strong operators within each Mr Khosrowshahi wrote Over time Uber and Careem will integrate some elements of the others products he addedCareem will be guided by its own board with two members from Careem and three from UberThe mobility and broader internet opportunity in the region is massive and untapped and has the potential to

recent years The company based in San Francisco could hit a valuation of  billion when it reaches the stock marketBut Uber is under scrutiny for its losses  its net loss was  million in the fourth quarter  and selfdriving technologies are expensive A  billion infusion could ease worries about how costly it is to develop autonomous carsThe proposed investment was earlier reported by The Wall

formed in  loses between  million and  million each quarter Its fleet of vehicles was also grounded for nine months last year after one of the autonomous cars struck and killed a pedestrian in Arizona In the past Uber has considered spinning off the unit as a separate entityUber Freight the companys longhaul trucking business also has a separate valuation based on pools of equity specifically

Incs initial public offering IPO filing on Thursday will draw inevitable comparisons to its smaller ridehailing rival Lyft Inc which completed its initial public listing last monthFollowing Lyfts poor stock market performance of late investors will be scrutinizing Ubers financial results and projections closelyNot only is Uber much larger than Lyft but it is also more complex with operations that go beyond its core ridehailing business and extend into areas such as food delivery and freight transit The following are four key financial metrics which investors will be watching for REVENUEUber is a much larger company than Lyft with operations in markets ranging from the United States to Latin America to North Africa Lyft operates entirely in North AmericaUber also has a broader array of business lines including a food delivery service and a platform for commercial freight As a result Uber clocks much higher revenues than Lyft Uber reported net revenues of  billion in  That is in comparison to  billion for Lyft during the same year If one considers revenue growth however Uber may take a back seat to Lyft Lyft has been rapidly gaining market share relative to its larger rival meaning that its revenue growth has been outpacing Ubers Lyfts revenue more than doubled between  and  from just over  billion to more than  billion Ubers meanwhile grew  percent to  billion ADJUSTED EBITDAThis common measure of profitability will look similar to Lyfts in one major respect both Uber and Lyft are lossmaking companies Uber reported an adjusted earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization EBITDA loss of  billion in  compared to around  million for Lyft But expect Uber to argue to investors that its scale will give it a significant advantage in terms of profitability over the long run allowing it to more effectively hold down costs It will also likely point out that its yearoveryear losses are down from  billion in  Lyfts ticked up over the same timeframe CONTRIBUTION MARGINThis lesserknown financial metric will likely play a big role in Ubers pitch to investors It is designed to show whether Ubers operations in individual markets are profitable on a standalone basis by ignoring companywide costs like marketing or technology investment Expect Uber to make a case that positive contribution margins in many of its markets mean that fundamentally its business model works Uber has a different method of calculating contribution margin than Lyft so the two companies figures cannot be directly compared a person familiar with the

gambling She recalled asking the driver Are you waiting for Liz Yeah he responded Get inShe had done it countless times But that night in July  as the man veered off course toward a deserted parking lot as he cranked up the radio and ignored her questions as her real driver called her wondering where she was Ms Suarez said she realized with horror This was not an UberThats when he said Give me your wallet give me your phone give me everything you have Ms Suarez  saidOn busy streets outside bars or clubs people often hop into a car without a second thought But the killing of Samantha Josephson a yearold college student in South Carolina who was stabbed to death after getting into a car she mistook for her Uber last weekend has brought national attention to a rash of kidnappings sexual assaults and robberies carried out largely against young women by assailants posing as rideshare driversThere have been at least two dozen such attacks in the past few years according to a tally of publicly reported cases including instances where suspects have been charged with attacking multiple women In Connecticut a man was arraigned last week on charges that he kidnapped and raped two women who believed he was their rideshare driver In Chicago prosecutors said a man who posed as an Uber driver sexually assaulted five women climbing into the back seat and pinning them downThese attacks turn a simple mixup into a nightmare showing how easily bad actors can exploit the vulnerabilities of a ridesharing culture that so many people trust to get them home safeTips for staying safe when getting into a rideshare vehicleThe drivers troll nightclubs and bars late at night to find people scanning the dark for their ride according to law enforcement descriptions of the assaults They wave to passengers and say Im your driver Some even hang rideshare decals in their windowsThe attacks represent a tiny fraction of the millions of uneventful rides that Americans hail every day But Ms Josephsons murder has forced ridesharing companies to address renewed safety concerns led to legislative proposals and public efforts to reduce future attacks and prompted passengers across the country to weigh the risks of climbing into a strangers back seatIt could be any one of us said Kate Lewis a junior at the University of South Carolina where Ms Josephson had been a senior about to head to law schoolHave you had a scary experience with what you thought was a rideshare driver Please share your experiences in the commentsState lawmakers in South Carolina have proposed a law named for Ms Josephson that would require all rideshare drivers to display a lighted sign from their company Her father Seymour Josephson has become an outspoken advocate for stronger safety measures saying at a vigil this week I dont want anyone else to go through it as a parentAt the University of South Carolina students have started a new safety campaign that urges riders to ask Whats my name to ensure they are talking to their actual rideshare drivers before getting into a carStudents described the campaign as one constructive action they could take amid a week of stunned grief and candlelit vigils after the police announced on Saturday that they had found Ms Josephsons body in the woods  miles away She had last been seen at  am Friday in a busy downtown neighborhood in Columbia SC getting into a black Chevrolet ImpalaThe security footage of those moments is haunting As Ms Josephson gets into the back seat there are people everywhere tapping on their phones hugging one anothers shoulders enjoying the nightThe police charged Nathaniel David Rowland  with kidnapping and killing Ms Josephson They said they had found Ms Josephsons blood and her cellphone in Mr Rowlands car along with bleach and cleaning supplies The childsafety locks had been engagedMr Rowland has not entered a plea and his lawyer declined to comment He was not an Uber driver the company saidEveryone at Uber is devastated to hear about this unspeakable crime Grant Klinzman a company spokesman said in an email We spoke with the University of South Carolina president and will be partnering with the university to raise awareness on college campuses nationwide about this incredibly important issueUber sent a message to its users on Thursday advising them to match the license plate car make and model and to check the drivers photograph before taking a rideIn the wake of reports of Ms Josephsons death Carla Westlund  thought once again about the night in  when she was raped in Los Angeles by a man she mistakenly thought was her Uber driver She said she fell asleep in the back seat of the car and woke to him beating her head against the seatHe had an Uber sticker she said He was pretending to be an Uber driverAfter three hours in his car Ms Westlund said she was able to convince the man to let her go outside her boyfriends house and she immediately reported the attack and went to the hospital Ms Westlund said she felt revictimized by reporting the crime  a common complaint from sexualassault survivors She said that she had given additional details of the attack as she remembered more with each retelling but that the officers had characterized this as changing her storyI felt like I was definitely being treated like I did something wrong she said She now volunteers with PAVE a nonprofit that works to end sexual violenceIn February  Nicolas Morales was arrested and charged with raping her and six other women by posing as a rideshare driver He pleaded not guilty and has a preliminary hearing scheduled for April Uber and Lyft have been criticized in the past for not adequately vetting their drivers or doing enough to ensure passenger safety which has led to temporary bans or restrictions on the services in some cities A  CNN report found that  Uber drivers and  Lyft drivers had been accused of sexual assault or abuse The companies conduct background checks and say passenger safety is their top priorityUber said it has worked with law enforcement since  to teach riders how to avoid impostors Last year it added a panic button that lets riders tap their screens and dial  directly from the appUber and Lyft also distribute glowing dashboard lights in some markets called the Beacon and Amp that change color to match a hue on a passengers app The lights are in limited distribution and not available to all driversHarry Campbell a driver for Uber and Lyft who hosts a podcast called The Rideshare Guy said it was common for people to hop into the wrong car in the crush outside bars airports games or concerts where hundreds of people are jostling for their carsThese sorts of mistakes are happening all the time Mr Campbell said But there are some bad actors who realize this and take advantageIt is not hard to fake safety experts and law enforcement authorities saidKnockoff decals and lightup signs saying Uber and Lyft are easy to buy from major online retailers Impostors trawl night spots when people have often been drinking and are particularly vulnerable as they part with friends for the evening and search the dark for an unfamiliar carTheyre taking advantage of an individual whos intoxicated and doesnt have all their senses Theyre going to overlook little warning signs said Lt Harrison Daniel of the AthensClarke County Police in Georgia where a man was charged with posing as an Uber driver and raping a college student last yearIdentifying the attackers can also be difficult Unlike actual rideshare drivers they do not register their personal details in a ridehailing services database so police have to pull security footage look for witnesses and search the streets for cars matching a suspects vehicleThe driver who abducted and robbed Ms Suarez in an empty parking lot behind a grocery store early that morning in July  still has not been arrested though police said the investigation was activeMs Suarez escaped by jumping out of his moving car She cracked her skull and broke her wrist and ankle When she reported the attack she said the police had seemed leery of her story and asked her about how she was dressed and what she had been doing out at  amShe decided to speak out about the attack posting photos of her injuries on social media and talking to a local television station Some people responded by saying she was crying wolf and was to blame for getting into the wrong carMs Suarez said she believed that the man who attacked her was not there by coincidence that nightHe was waiting for the right person she said He knew exactly what time to be out there I think hed done it in the past and hell continue to do it Because hes still out thereAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressSAN MATEO

Thousands of taxi drivers snarled traffic in the center of Buenos Aires on Thursday to protest the threat to their business from Uber in the latest reminder of the headaches the ridehailing platform faces worldwide as it prepares to go publicWith blaring horns members of Argentinas powerful taxi unions drove their yellowandblack cabs or marched through the capital at the start of a planned two days of protestsUber plans to make its initial public offering registration public later on Thursday Reuters reported earlier this week People familiar with the matter said it will seek to sell around  billion worth of stock which would make it one of the largest tech IPOs of all timeThe Buenos Aires protest underscores frustration among the citys taxi drivers who charge that Uber undercuts them on price helping steal away consumers with competitive faresIn Latin America as in other regions Uber faces regulatory hurdles where it often operates in a legal grey area It also must contend with rivals including Chinese ridehailing giant Didi Chuxing and pressure to cut driver subsidies to bolster profitsI see the biggest threats outside of competition being from regulation and a potential backlash against Uber as payouts to drivers continue to fall said Nathan Lustig managing partner of Magma Partners a Latin Americabased venture capital fund Argentinas capital lacks a specific regulatory framework for Uber but the firm maintains it obeys the countrys laws and pays taxes and wants cities to pass ridehailing regulationsUber faces similar issues in neighboring ChileThe company says other Latin American markets including Mexico City in Mexico Rio de Janeiro and San Pablo in Brazil and La Paz in Bolivia have passed laws in its favor enabling the use of apps for transporting passengersUBER HUNTERSLawmakers in Buenos Aires have largely sided with domestic taxi drivers most of whom are unionized who say Uber has an unfair competitive advantage because of its lower pricesTo counter this the city government has levied fines and thrown up obstacles such as an injunction by a judge that disallowed the use of some Argentine credit cards in Uber transactions in Buenos Aires Still Argentina has been the fastestgrowing market in the world for Uber since it started operating there in  despite the countrys recession company data reviewed by Reuters showsThat success has angered the citys taxi unions who claim demand for taxis has been cut in half since Ubers arrival Taxi drivers protesting on Thursday carried signs calling Uber illegal and its customers corrupt Uber drivers have been the target of violent attacks by socalled caza Ubers or Uber hunters It is common in Buenos Aires for Uber drivers to ask passengers to sit in the front seat to avoid drawing attention from local taxi drivers Other protesters also blamed the authorities for not creating jobsThe big problem is that this government by leaving people unemployed continues to shrink the labor market and more people look to Uber as a job Enrique Gutierrez  a taxi driver for  years told Reuters as he protestedSo yes we say Uber is illegal do something about Uber But also do something about unemployment that is fueling UberUber said it supports regulations that expand the benefits of its technology The response and the choice of the people is clear the company said in a statement to

HepinstallAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Noam ScheiberIt was a potentially sweeping proposal from a Texas regulator Companies that use a digital network to dispatch workers the way Uber does could label them contractors rather than employeesThe proposal made in December was a turning point in a campaign that has played out in legislatures and courts in numerous states and even in Washington as Uber and other gigeconomy companies have risen to prominence in recent yearsLobbyists involved in this statebystate effort have worked behind the scenes to provide rule makers with a template Hanging in the balance could be billions of dollars in costs and even fundamental business models as more gig companies move toward public stock offeringsWhen such companies are able to classify workers as contractors they dont have to contribute to unemployment insurance or workers compensation or heed minimumwage and overtime laws Industry officials estimate that a work force of employees costs companies  to  percent more than a work force of contractors  a sum worth many hundreds of millions of dollars per year to UberWorker advocacy groups say the goal is to chip away at classification rules in enough places to create pressure for a broad exemption nationallyWhat is notable about the Texas initiative which would apply only to unemployment insurance is that it emerged not from a democratically elected body but from an opaque bureaucracy There were no hearings where outsiders were questioned no meaningful floor debates  just a few perfunctory statements at public meetings and a day comment period before the agency could issue a final proposalThis whole thing caught us by surprise said Jose Garza executive director of the Workers Defense Project a nonprofit group in Texas that helps workers fight wage theft and misclassificationFor weeks the impetus for the rule was unclear A spokeswoman for the agency the Texas Workforce Commission publicly denied that it relied on outside sources when drafting proposalsBut that narrative abruptly changed in early March when Mr Garzas group obtained a set of emails from the commission through a public records request The documents which The Texas Observer has also reported on suggest an ambitious new phase of the campaign by gigeconomy companies to solve their workerclassification problemEmails involving one commissioner and her staff show extensive communications with lobbyists working with Tusk Ventures a venturecapital and politicalstrategy firm Tusk in turn was retained by Handy a company that dispatches workers Uberstyle to perform household chores like cleaning and repairs The strategy firms founder Bradley Tusk was once a top political consultant for Uber and remains a large shareholder who could cash out millions in equity when Uber goes public this yearTusk Ventures appears to have been the primary author of the Texas proposal Large portions of the draft released by the Workforce Commission mirrored a proposal that the lobbyist forwarded to the agency one year earlier Lisa Givens the agency spokeswoman said she had been unaware of the correspondence when she previously commentedAnd Texas is not the only place where Tusk has appealed to regulatory agencies rather than legislatures to cement gig workers status as contractors According to the emails the firm has pursued similar efforts in other states like IllinoisAsked in an interview about the strategy of working through regulators Mr Tusk said If we believe this is the right policy our job is to get it through and that can be the most efficient venueHe foreshadowed the plan in a book he published in September Were working multiple angles to get this done federally he wrote And were working on legislation and rules in  more states tooDifferent state and federal laws define employment somewhat differently but most focus on factors like whether managers exert significant control over workers and whether the work is central to a companys businessUber Lyft and Handy argue that their workers should be considered contractors because the workers decide when where and how long they work The companies say they are experimenting with ideas like benefits to improve workers economic securityBut skeptics argue that the companies exert control through ratings that elicit certain behavior like treating passengers courteously and by barring drivers who cancel too many rides Uber and Lyft also determine pay rates for drivers something independent contractors typically decideIn recent years courts and state and federal agencies have disagreed on this question But theres little debate that if courts and regulators classified large numbers of gig workers as employees the move would be highly disruptive to companies that depend on them Lyft in its recent filing for an initial public offering told prospective investors that being forced to classify drivers as employees may require us to significantly alter our existing business model and warned of potential monetary exposureAbout five years ago the gig companies began to head off this prospect In the legislation that Uber and Lyft backed to legalize their business they often sought provisions indicating that ridehailing drivers are contractors About  states have enacted such provisions known as carveoutsIn other states Uber and Lyft worked with a broader group of companies to have most gig workers who are dispatched through digital platforms not just drivers classified as contractorsLet me be clear an Uber lobbyist announced in  before an Arizona Senate committee considering such a bill Companies like GrubHub Handy Lyft Postmates Thumbtack YourMechanic TaskRabbit she said were all involved with drafting this legislation and putting it forward in over  states The measure passed soon afterOne consequence of these industrywide measures is that they could affect far more than current gig workers According to Maya Pinto of the National Employment Law Project a nonprofit workeradvocacy group that has just published a report on the topic the broader measures encourage companies to reclassify employees as contractors Any business that dispatches employees  such as plumbers or electricians or nannies  could deem them contractors by using a digital interface to coordinate the work and meeting a few other criteria Ms Pinto saidMarla Kanemitsu of Tusk Ventures who has helped to write such measures said the motivation for the bills wasnt just to preserve the contractor status of Handys workers but also to allow companies to provide benefits like health care and retirementsavings vehicles that might otherwise suggest an employment relationshipProviding benefits was always the driving force for this Ms Kanemitsu saidIn the first six months of  six states passed bills broadly carving out gig workers from employment laws and effectively classifying them as contractors Mr Tusks book referred to these states as the lowhanging fruit of Kentucky Iowa Tennessee Indiana and Utah and mediumhanging fruit like FloridaBut in other states the fruit stood at a considerably higher altitude The efforts came up short in Colorado Georgia North Carolina and CaliforniaColorado with a large technology sector was perhaps the most instructive example The state was the first to pass legislation legalizing ridehailing companies like Uber and a local lobbying firm involved in that effort helped spearhead this one too It received more than  in  from Uber and Handy according to lobbying disclosures compiled by the National Employment Law Project The carveout bill glided through the Republicanled Senate on a bipartisan vote last March but it ran into resistance in the Democraticcontrolled HouseLegislatures it was becoming clear could be a political quagmire even in states that appeared welcoming And the urgency was increasing Handy would be acquired by a public company in the fall of  Uber planned to go public in  The status of its drivers remained unresolved in all four states where the broader legislation had failedAround the same time however Mr Tusks firm was fieldtesting an alternative approachIn December  Jerry Valdez an Austin lobbyist working for Handy contacted an assistant to one of the three commissioners on the Texas Workforce CommissionLike most lobbyists Mr Valdez and his colleagues assumed a posture of extreme solicitousness They provided detailed responses to questions from the commissioner Ruth Hughs and her staff  like how such proposals might comport with federal lawI am sure it will be informative regarding the matters discussed Ms Hughss senior legal counsel replied in one emailRarely were the lobbyists more helpful than in devising the rule itself which would effectively expand to all gig workers an exemption that the state had already passed for ridehailing driversMr Valdez forwarded Ms Hughss assistant a draft with the subject line Handy proposal one year before the commission released its own proposalOf the nine criteria that the Handy draft laid out for classifying gig workers as contractors the commission adopted seven almost verbatim then added two The commission also hewed closely to Handys definition of a marketplace platform and marketplace contractor terms of art for company and workerMr Tusk whose firm stopped working for Handy after Handy was acquired last year said there were many advantages to lobbying state agencies for a rule change Youre not tied to the legislative calendar If the head of a committee in the State Assembly doesnt like it because they have some business owner in their district you dont have as much of a problem anymoreA Handy spokesman said Our work in all states  including Texas  has always been conducted through appropriate channels and motivated by a desire for constructive solutionsThe process behind the Texas regulation the final version of which will be discussed at a public meeting before the commission can approve it appeared to stand in marked contrast to the very public debate in Colorado Advocates on all sides there continued discussing ways to address the employment status of gig workers long after the legislation failed last springLabor officials policy experts and even a representative from Uber attended a meeting hosted by a Denver think tank on how to protect gig workers from being exploitedTheres been a commitment to figure out a true stakeholder process said Dennis Dougherty executive director of the states labor federationBut not everybody appeared interested in an open debate In June when an aide to Commissioner Hughs asked the Tusk lobbyists if there were other states where regulators rather than elected legislators were addressing the contractor issue one state they listed was particularly intriguingWe are also in discussions a Tusk official wrote with ColoradoFollow Noam Scheiber on Twitter

set out in mid to raise a venture capital fund that would invest in a multitude of tech trendsBut he quickly realized that potential investors were not interested in that kind of fund Instead all they wanted to hear about were his former Airbnb colleagues and whether they might start their own companiesIt was Yeah all that stuff is fine but Airbnb right Mr Newman  said Airbnb was where we had a competitive edge on the marketSo Mr Newman and his partners at Wave Capital adjusted their pitch They said they were creating a fund to invest specifically in Airbnb employees who were planning to leave the company to become entrepreneurs It worked He and his partners quickly secured  million and now are preparing to make a flood of investments after the  billion home rental startup goes public sometime in the next year and employees cash out their sharesWe know they are planning to start companies Mr Newman said of Airbnb employees adding that in the last week alone he had heard from four who left to pursue their entrepreneurial dreamsEveryone else in Silicon Valley seems to know it too As Lyft Pinterest Postmates Slack and Uber  among some of this decades most prominent startups  get ready to list on the stock market investors are preparing to write checks to a new generation of companies created by their workersIts part of Silicon Valleys oftenincestuous circle of life The startup world projects a meritocratic image but in reality it is a small tightknit club where success typically hinges on whom you knowIn this model employees of tech startups frequently leave the companies once they have been enriched by their firms initial public offerings Then networks of alumni from these companies  called mafias  support their peers new businesses with hiring advice and moneyThe cycle goes back to at least the s when Fairchild Semiconductor one of Silicon Valleys earliest successes was started by a group of disgruntled Shockley Semiconductor employees called the Traitorous EightDecades later early employees of PayPal known as the PayPal Mafia are more famous for their successes after leaving the company  many of which they collaborated on with one another  than for their initial breakthrough in digital payments The group includes Elon Musk and Peter Thiel as well as the creators of YouTube Yelp and LinkedInSilicon Valley is now anticipating new mafias connected to Uber Airbnb and their brethren after the companies go publicIts going to trigger a massive explosion in entrepreneurship said Howard Lindzon an entrepreneur in Phoenix who invests in five to  venture capital funds a year He said he particularly wanted to put money into funds with connections to the Uber and Airbnb networksVenture capital firms are already hiring former employees from Uber and other IPOready companies to get a foothold in their networks Some of the fiercest recruiting has been of Uber executives with venture firms including Sequoia Capital GV Javelin Venture Partners and Redpoint Ventures all adding former employees from the ridehailing firm to their ranksOne recruit was Andrew Chen who worked at Uber as head of rider growth and left the company last year He has since joined the venture firm Andreessen Horowitz as a general partner and hosts quarterly dinners for Uber alumni turned foundersMr Chen  estimates that two dozen venturebacked startups have come out of Uber so far Andreessen Horowitz has recently invested in two which have not been announcedThose are the prime startup investing opportunities Mr Chen saidThe problem is that venture firms might create a brain drain from the likes of Airbnb and Uber if they keep luring the companies workers to start new companies Talent after all is a precious commodity in Silicon ValleyJonathan Golden who worked as a director of product at Airbnb and who joined the venture firm NEA last year said Airbnb was fine with his plans to invest in former employees He said he had discussed his intentions with Airbnbs chief executive Brian Chesky before he left the company in Im not actively trying to have people leave Airbnb Mr Golden said But if someone is going to leave I want to be supportive of them and Brian is supportive of them as wellNick Papas an Airbnb spokesman said Were always sad when talented people move on but its been great to watch so many of our former colleagues succeedUber declined to commentIn February Annie Kadavy a former Uber executive who is now a venture capitalist at Redpoint announced an investment in Ike a selfdriving truck company created by  who else  exUber employeesMs Kadavy  who left Uber last year said her network of former ridehailing colleagues would help her find and vet deals In addition it would help find talent to bring to other startups that Redpoint has invested inIf youre a person leaving a company who are you going to ask about what company to join next she said Your friend who works at a venture firm because their job is to have a point of view on a bunch of different businessesIn February  Dan Hill and Michelle Rittenhouse longtime Airbnb employees felt the entrepreneurial itch and quit They had a general idea to start a company that would make it easier for people to donate to charity but not much elseThe details didnt matter to Wave Capital which wanted to invest in them These are people we know can build great products said Mr Newman They know us they trust us We know them we trust themWithin a few weeks of leaving Airbnb Mr Hill and Ms Rittenhouse had secured  million  including from Wave Capital  for Alma their newly formed company focused on philanthropyEntrepreneurs typically make dozens of pitches over several months to raise financing But Mr Hill said the relatively quick fundraising for his startup was not a surpriseWe already had a strong relationship he said So when we pitched the idea for Alma and our initial plans it was an easier conversationIts a common story among former employees of hot startups Andrew Chapin who previously worked at Uber also said it wasnt hard to round up  million last October for Basis his new mental health startup thanks to his reputation among the Uber crowdWhen you look at VC there is a lot of pattern matching and trying to act on that so if you worked at Uber you must be OK Mr Chapin  said I didnt have to do a lot of pitchingIt helps that many of his former colleagues are now millionaires having cashed out their shares in private stock salesA syndicate of several hundred former Uber employees are even investing in startups together Josh Mohrer and William Barnes early Uber employees who left in  said they used a private email list to manage the syndicates deal selection adding a few new people to the list each week as they graduate from the company The group has backed around a dozen startups at a pace of around one a month they saidTo stay on top of all the new companies emerging from Uber Mr Mohrer and Mr Barnes said they have organized reunions of former employees in cities around the world using a Facebook group with more than  membersThe pair also plan to raise an investment fund dedicated to backing Uber alumni under the banner of Moving Capital according to three people familiar with the project who asked to remain anonymous because the details are privateHow will Silicon Valleys new mafias be different from those in the pastThe Uber and Airbnb networks are part of a generation that pioneered the ondemand gig economy and everything that came with it That means many fought realworld policy issues in cities as opposed to primarily dealing with the digital worldThere are just not that many places to find people who have seen that kind of scale said Ryan Graves Ubers former senior vice president of global operations and a member of the companys boardEach city that Uber Airbnb Lyft or Postmates expanded into created a new set of operational regulatory and business challenges Regulators balked Rival business operators resisted Neighbors protested And people abused the platforms over and overUber managers ran each city like a ministartup If you were the general manager of San Francisco or of Atlanta you were the CEO of your region Mr Chen said It led to a really entrepreneurial approach from everyoneThe thorniest challenge for Uber alumni may be showing that they have learned from the companys ugly  when its toxic culture of harassment discrimination and ethical lapses was exposedBlaine Light a former Uber employee said he had taken the importance of creating an inclusive culture to heart Half of the employees at Qwick a person startup in Phoenix that he joined as a cofounder in  are women and the staff includes a mix of races backgrounds and sexual orientations Mr Light said he emphasized a culture of humilityUber people in general are looking to take what weve learned and make something better this time he saidAn earlier version of a picture caption with this article

up to go public Raquel Urtasun who is chief scientist at Uber Advanced Technologies Group ATG and heads the groups unit in Toronto spoke about the challenges for selfdriving development at a Reuters Newsmaker httpswwwreuterscomnewsmakers event in New York Selfdriving cars are going to be in our lives The question of when is not clear yet Urtasun said To have it at scale is going to take a long timeThe more cautious tone marks a change from three years ago when Uber embraced aggressive tactics to turbocharge its autonomous vehicle development in a bid to get more robot taxis on the street driving more miles The company had been seen as an industry leader in the technology until one of its autonomous SUVs killed a pedestrian in Tempe Arizona in March last yearUrtasuns comments fall in line with the rest of the selfdriving industry which after much hype and bold promises has tempered expectations and pushed out timelines for deployment The extreme technical challenges of building cars that can predict human behavior and respond appropriately proved greater than even some of the industrys brightest minds had anticipatedThe progress of Ubers selfdriving car unit is in the spotlight as the company prepares to kick off its initial public offering this year Uber whose losses before taxes depreciation and other expenses were  billion last year has at times spent close to  million in a single quarter on its selfdriving unit sources told ReutersUber last valued at  billion in the private market is seeking a valuation as high as  billion in its IPO and may kick off its investor roadshow before the end of April Reuters has reportedIt is true that when you go to an IPO there is much more of a look into your finances said Urtasun That being said again because Uber understands that selfdriving cars at scale is not something thats going to happen tomorrow they understand the need for the science Urtasun declined to offer any guidance on what mix of humandriven cars and autonomous cars Uber will have in the next  years citing too many uncertainties in the industryWhat is clear is that in a year timeframe there will be a mix of both selfdriving and humancontrolled cars she said UBER SEEKING PARTNERSThe business of building selfdriving cars is extraordinarily expensive and the timeframe to payoff is increasingly uncertain However some consider Ubers ability to successfully navigate the transition to autonomous vehicles as crucial to the companys longterm financial prospects By removing drivers and adding automation Uber will be able to pocket the full fare that passengers pay and create more efficient routes to move around people and packagesUber opened ATG in Toronto in  and named Urtasun who is also an associate professor at the University of Toronto as head of the Toronto organization Uber said last year it would invest more than  million in Toronto to grow its selfdriving car operations open an engineering hub and expand its work in artificial intelligence After the fatal Arizona crash Uber removed its autonomous cars from the road laid off hundreds of test drivers and shuttered operations in Arizona its testing hub Uber resumed very limited testing on public roads in Pittsburgh in December Uber has recently taken a more collaborative approach inviting General Motor Cos selfdriving car unit Cruise and Alphabet Incs Waymo to put their cars on Ubers ridehailing network Urtasun said on Monday that Uber encouraged every selfdriving company to add their cars to the Uber network Weve been very very open that we would like every other company to be in our autonomous vehicle network said Urtasun A group of investors led by SoftBank Group Corp and Toyota Motor Corp are in talks to invest  billion or more into

saying it may take another four weeks or more to secure an epic trade agreementBefore the meeting Mr Trump said the US and China were headed toward an agreement that might be the biggest deal ever made There had also been hints that a summit meeting would be announced between Mr Trump and President Xi Jinping None wasThe talks are expected to continue for weeksPoints of contention Mr Trumps

powerful new antistall system on the  Max for months saying pilots could avoid problems by following a checklist Now preliminary findings in a new crash report from Ethiopian investigators cast doubt on whether Boeings guidance was enough Investigators found that pilots in the Ethiopian Airlines crash in March initially followed Boeings safety procedures but were unable to regain controlBoeings chief executive acknowledged the role of MCAS the antistall software in the crash Its our responsibility to eliminate this risk he said We own it and we know how to do it In the cockpit The steps that

started pulling their houses off the market The broader California housing market has softened and home sales are down but heres one fix for that Even if just half the IPOs happen theres going to be ten thousand millionaires overnight said Herman Chan a real estate agent with Sothebys People are like Im not going to sell till next year because there are going to be bajillionaires everywhere left and rightOne of those is his client Rick Rider a yearold CEO who decided not to publicly list his Bay Area house until some of the IPOs have happenedOur particular house is not a family home Its a Double Income No Kids sort of home Mr Rider said So it would potentially play well for a lot of the people that would be benefiting from the IPOsThe spending wars will likely stay close to work The millennial tech workers are really looking for convenience said Christine Kim the president of Climb Real Estate They seem to not want to own cars and food deliveries are really easy now and they want to be close to entertainment so theyll stay in the cityWhen Google in Mountain View and Facebook in Menlo Park went public their workers were spread across the Bay Area and so the impact on housing was diffuse Now many of the biggest startups are based in San Francisco in part thanks to the citys tax breaks Brokers say San Francisco is where the workers want to stayIn  there were  properties sold in San Francisco and only  of those were single family homes Software employees represent more than  percent of those buying according to Compass One real estate firm estimates an average onebedroom in the city now rents for  per month Another firm puts that average at Now youve got all these IPOs at the same time and well potentially have thousands of young people all now with money looking to buy homes said Shane Ray a real estate agent Youll be able to feel itThose in the market for a house are trying to buy them fast while the inventory shrinks but before the wave hitsI had this sense of existential dread that if we didnt buy before all the IPOs we would forever be priced out said Tom McLeod the founder of storage startup Omni who has been renting for nearly a decade We ended up pulling the triggerCompanies instill in their employees a belief that stock only goes up At this point a decade since their founding startups like Uber and Airbnb have been asking their employees to hold that faith for a long time Now wealth managers are hoping to rattle the religiousRyan S Cole a private wealth adviser at Citrine Capital said he has started getting an influx of new clients who are preparing for wealth He is worried This generation of the startup wealthy seem especially bullish on their companys successWeve been trying to get them to exercise a little more caution just because theyre so excited Mr Cole said I dont think a lot of them think there ever could be a downturnHe cautions that no one can be sure how well a stock will do A company like Uber is still dramatically unprofitable he tries to remind his clients So many IPOs turn out to be busts Groupon opened around  a share and now trades around  Snap opened around  and now trades at A lot of them are young  theyve just seen their valuations going up forever and they dont really understand that tech stocks are volatile Mr Cole said And they have their managers painting especially rosy pictures of where the company is headed to get them to work harderMostly he just urges his clients not to spend too much yetThey shouldnt be buying boats Mr Cole said We see a little bit of that

onto the scene he is worried about the regions inequalityTheres some whove talked about pitchforks Mr DeYoe said And I dont think well go there but theres a point when that makes senseIts very visible Mr DeYoe said This kind of wealth is very visibleIn cities like Oakland and Berkeley and San Francisco millennials obsess over Alexandria OcasioCortezs Twitter and attend Democratic Socialists of America meetings But the socialist passion doesnt seem to have impacted the citys zeal for IPO parties which the party planning community says are going to surpass past boomsJay Siegan a former live music club owner who now curates private entertainment and music is gearing up He has worked on events for many of the IPO hopefuls including Uber Airbnb Slack Postmates and LyftWe see multiple parties per IPO for the company that is IPOing as well as firms that are associated to them Mr Siegan said Budgets for startup parties he said can easily go above  million Theyre wanting to bring in Alist celebrities to perform at the dinner tables for the executives They want ballet performersA popular new feature hes noticing is clients hoping to curate their own theme concerts featuring fleets of bands Mr Siegan says he put on one for a s loving tech executive featuring the Bs Devo The Bangles Tears for Fears and Flock of SeagullsIn a warehouse in Concord Calif the IPO ice sculptor is getting ready to staff up for what he says will be a long yearIts going to be a lot of hour days said Robert Chislett founder of Chiselit who has around  ice sculptors currently employedTogether they have chiseled a fullsize ice car for a tech executives party in Atherton and a foot ice Taj Mahal for anothers swimming pool in San Jose But he says IPOing executives usually want predictable things

will eventually be paid out to the nonprofits employeesCharity water which provides developing countries with clean water has started a program to reward its employees in a potentially lucrative way modeled on startupsCreditCreditGabby Jones for The New York TimesSupported byBy David GellesLast year the founder of a charity that is focused on making sure everyone on earth has clean water and a cofounder of an ecommerce mattress company met for lunch at a SoHo restaurant As the two ate the talk inevitably turned to startupsHow come at a startup you can participate in the equity upside Neil Parikh the cofounder of the mattress company Casper said in recalling the conversation with Scott Harrison the founder of Charity water But at a charity youre helping all these people and you cant participate in the monetary upsideIt was a quandary that Mr Harrison who has forged close ties with the Silicon Valley elite over the years had been mulling for some time Now he is doing something about it Under a new program startup founders will be able to share their wealth not just with impoverished families in the developing world but also with a rather more comfortable demographic  Charity water employeesHeres how it works Entrepreneurs who own sizable stakes in private companies can donate some of their equity to Charity water When their company goes public or is sold some of the proceeds will be paid out as bonuses to Mr Harrisons staffAlready founders and paper billionaires from Uber WeWork and Casper have pledged at least  percent of their shares to the new program which Charity water is calling The Pool That all but guarantees that the organizations  employees will share in the spoils from some of the most hotly anticipated initial public offerings in the history of Wall StreetIn the past decade Silicon Valley titans like Jack Dorsey Sean Parker and Daniel Ek have donated millions of dollars to the New Yorkbased nonprofit organization which has drilled some  wells for villagers in Ethiopia Rwanda and other countries in subSaharan Africa and Asia But earmarking sizable donations to pay bonuses to a charitys employees is unconventional to say the least and could elicit backlash within the philanthropic communityIts very strategic to structure gifts in this way said Darren Walker president of the Ford Foundation But the issue of enriching employees of the charity is potentially problematicMr Harrison who is also Charity waters chief executive said the new program was a natural extension of his efforts to recruit employees who might otherwise take jobs at Facebook Google or AmazonWe want to attract the best possible talent he said in an interview at the organizations TriBeCa headquarters which WeWork helped design But how do we compete with massages and Michelin starsIf working for a good cause isnt enough now Charity water employees can enjoy the perks of some Uber stock tooTheyre making belowmarket salaries said Mr Parikh who has pledged  percent of his equity to the program In this tech boom where a lot of their friends are participating in these IPOs why should they get left behind Its a winwinNever mind that the point of philanthropy is to give to others not make for yourself It seemed unjust to Mr Harrison and his supporters that the techsavvy millennials working at Charity water should toil away on nonprofit salaries while their friends got richMr Harrisons total compensation was  in  according to public filings The organizations chief water officer made  The chief operating officer made The program also melded with the charitys broader mission to disrupt the nonprofit world Mr Harrison has already proved himself to be an innovator in marketing fundraising and community building Now he wants to make his organization less like a stuffy old foundation and more like one of the Silicon Valley startups he relies on for fundingWeve been trying to reinvent and reimagine charity Mr Harrison said The vision is to build a super transparent organization that looks more like Apple or Nike than my grandparents beige charityBefore Mr Harrison  set about disrupting charity he was a nightclub promoter After a decade of indulging his darkest vices his official biography reads Scott declared spiritual moral and emotional bankruptcyIn search of meaning Mr Harrison spent two years volunteering on a hospital ship off the African coast and saw firsthand how the lack of clean water hampered health and economic development He came back to New York and founded Charity water in  drawing on his robust social network for fundingFrom the outset the organization had a knack for messaging They know how to brand water better than anyone said Mr Walker of the Ford Foundation They understand the narrative about water and they are also really good at giving you a sense of the crisis that we are inAmong Mr Harrisons early innovations was encouraging people to donate their birthdays to his cause Instead of receiving presents people started asking friends and relatives to make gifts to Charity water The effort was a hit and is widely mimicked by other nonprofits todayMr Harrison also struck up partnerships with companies including Google and Amazon WeWork donated design expertise and furniture to the groups headquartersBut Mr Harrisons signature innovation concerned how he would fund the organization Instead of having just one pot of capital that covered everything from rent and salaries to equipment and work in the field Mr Harrison had twoA small group of wealthy donors known as The Well funds the overhead of the organization each giving between  and  million a year As a result Charity water boasts that  percent of donations received from the public go straight to programming costsIt was a savvy marketing move but it rubbed many in the philanthropic community the wrong wayCharity waters  percent model is largely smoke and mirrors said Joe Garecht who runs a fundraising consulting firm They have overhead They have program expenses They find donors to cover both just like every other nonprofit on earthBut by saying that all donations from the public go directly to program costs Charity water appears to be suggesting  intentionally or not  that other nonprofit organizations are less efficientIt makes it seem to many donors like they can and should expect organizations they support to put  percent of their donations to programs Mr Garecht said This is an unreasonable expectation for nonprofits Its not possible and not helpfulNonetheless the model has been a success Today there are  megadonors who give a total of  million a year Though many of them are tech entrepreneurs it is a diverse group that includes Education Secretary Betsy DeVos the venture capitalist Chris Sacca and the skateboarder Tony HawkIn addition to funding the overhead the top donors are granted access to Mr Harrisons inner circle They are celebrated at the groups lavish annual gala which was held in  in the Temple of Dendur at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and last year  in a nod to the groups deep ties to Silicon Valley  in San Francisco for the first time And many of them often travel with Mr Harrison to Africa enjoying madeforInstagram moments that are shared widely on social mediaRyan Graves a former chief executive of Uber whose stake in the company is estimated to be worth as much as  billion and who has pledged at least  percent of it to Charity water went on a trip to Ethiopia this yearIt gives you the chills and makes you feel great Mr Graves said of the experienceMiguel McKelvey a cofounder of WeWork whose stake in his company is worth an estimated  billion and who has also pledged at least  percent to Charitywater traveled to Ethiopia with the group in Theres nothing like seeing in real life what its like to bring water to a real community he said Without a Charity water well Mr McKelvey said literally a cow is peeing in the water and they are picking it up and going to cook with itWe all felt an obligation to help he saidFor those with the means to donate at scale the trips can also serve as networking events Mr McKelvey met another entrepreneur Dan Teran on his trip Recently WeWork acquired Mr Terans company Managed by QIt puts your life in so much perspective said Mr Parikh of Casper who went on a trip this year I can walk down to Union Square and get a smoothie anytime I want toAfter the ideasparking lunch with Mr Parikh and after working with HSBC to figure out how to accept private company stock Mr Harrison began approaching his friends with the askAlready startup equity currently worth more than  million has been pledged to Charity water Besides the men from Uber WeWork and Casper donors include Heather Hartnett of Human Ventures and Courtney Nichols Gould a founder of SmartyPants a vitamin companyIt really speaks to their success in setting themselves apart with the tech world said David Callahan author of The Givers a book about modern philanthropyWhen those shares are eventually sold  percent of the proceeds will go to overhead like salaries and rent and  percent will be paid out as bonuses to all employees except Mr HarrisonIt almost has the effect of turning Charity water into one of the tech companies Mr Parikh said Theyre participating in the capital pool of all their friends companiesIf all goes well Mr Harrison believes more perks could be on the way Maybe everyone gets a free mattress he said I havent asked Neil yet Or we might be able to get a free gym membership for everybodyCharity water may be doing things differently but it remains well regarded by many independent organizations that evaluate philanthropies getting high marks for effectiveness and transparency from groups including Charity Navigator Charity Watch and GuideStarTo date Charity water has raised more than  million and claims its wells have brought clean water to nearly  million peopleBut Mr Harrison who approaches his work with an entrepreneurial zeal now wants to scale up his operations and is aiming to reach an additional  million people by  He hopes to raise  billion over the next seven years  million of which would go to program costs and  million to backend support for field operations rent and payrollTo accomplish as much Mr Harrison believes he will need to think less like a plodding foundation and more like a startupWeve always fashioned the organization as a quickly scaling business thats trying to acquire customers he saidMr Harrison refers to donations as revenue and talks about key performance indicators He is fluent in business speak and even calls himself chief executive officer eschewing the traditional nonprofit leadership titles of executive director or president To many of the entrepreneurs who support Charity water this is a big part of the appeal He speaks their language Hes one of themScott runs it like a company said Mr Graves of Uber Its not a bloated cloudy notforprofitSo far it seems to be working Charity waters work in the developing world draws favorable reviews even from those who question its fundraising tacticsAnd while many young tech millionaires and billionaires are criticized for being insufficiently generous Mr Harrison is drawing them off the sidelines and putting their money to work sometimes in the field and soon in the form of employee bonusesScott and his team are trying to innovate said Mr McKelvey of WeWork Its an awesome exploration into the future of philanthropyDavid Gelles is the Corner Office columnist and a

states and cities including Chicago and Seattle that have adopted similar perride fees in recent years to pay for public transportation and other servicesIn New York the new ride fees had been temporarily blocked at the last minute by a lawsuit filed by a coalition of taxi owners and drivers who called it a suicide surcharge that would drive away customers and devastate an industry already

companies are facing increased pressure to ensure their users safety and to provide better identification for their drivers after the death of Samantha Josephson a University of South Carolina student who was killed last weekend after she got into a car she believed was her Uber The Timess Jack Healy reported Thursday about other incidents in which rideshare users mostly young women have been assaulted kidnapped or robbed by someone posing as a driver Uber sent an email to customers on Thursday imploring them to Check your ride every timeWe asked readers to share their stories of scary experiences with rideshare services We heard from passengers and legitimate drivers alike who offered advice for navigating these frightening situations In some cases drivers who dont work for rideshare companies said they have been startled by wouldbe passengers trying to get into their cars Here are some of those responses which have been lightly edited and condensed for clarityI was lucky A few years ago I was visiting New York and decided to use the Uber app I had read about to go to the Metropolitan Opera I stood on the curb outside my hotel looking at my phone as a Lincoln Town Car pulled up Are you my Uber I navely askedYes Yes Get in When we arrived at Lincoln Center the driver asked for  Doesnt this go on my account I handed him the money and stepped out of the car

it was my Lyft The guy had a box of doughnuts in the back and I told him I would move them and started small talk Before we got to the end of the block he stopped and said I am not your driver so I got out in shock I probably would have figured it out myself within the next couple of minutes but whoa was that a close call I am increasingly choosing to drive myself if I can chance the parking situation in the city which I increasingly do since it is a much better experience than rolling the dice with a LyftUber On that note this urban dweller will not be relinquishing her car anytime soon  Julia V  San FranciscoIm currently studying abroad in the Dominican Republic Its actually quite common here for the car to not match what the app says people borrow their friends cars or drivers have their original account suspended so they share a profile with a friend My tactic is to always check that they have my profile up on their phones There was a ride I took where the driver canceled the trip on the app as soon as we got in the car I dont have data service here so I didnt find this out until I got to WiFi and drove us around the city ignoring our directions He charged us three times the average toll and Uber cant do anything about this since the trip was technically canceled If I could do it over again Id get out of the car as soon as I suspected he was trying to scam us Its hard to know when youre doing the right thing in such an intimidating situation  Liz Roberts  Saratoga Springs NYRecently I decided to try a Lyft in Sunny Isles Beach Fla where I vacation When the car arrived there was already one female passenger I noted that the license plate did not match the plate indicated on the app and pointed this out to the driver who said Sometimes I drive a different car His face did match the app photo He pulled away and should have driven straight west However he left course and drove to a less populated industrial area I asked him where he was going He said To pick someone else up Four miles later I told him to let me out of the car The other female passenger did not speak English and she agreed this felt wrong in some way I didnt want to leave her alone The uncommunicative driver said he couldnt find his pickup and wanted me to calm down I said I do not like this I pretended to be on a phone call with a loved one a very protective and angry loved one describing the area giving the license plate the drivers name and street namesHe did not slow down but did turn around and head to the most direct route What should have been simple turned into something else Immediately following I contacted Lyft and asked them to respond to my concerns What I got was a standard email that dismissed my concerns The email said OOPS thats on us and sometimes our drivers are asked to pick up   Not what I expected The Lyft response was unacceptable and made me rethink this whole LyftUber thing  Rebecca Krueger  Bay Village Ohio After parking my car recently a young woman jumped in the back seat thinking I was her Uber ride She was so careless that she did not even notice I had no Uber decal After some confusion on both our parts she spotted her actual Uber ride apologized and jumped out Her Uber ride car was not even the same color as mine I hope this horrible story will get people to be a lot more careful but rideshare companies need to come up

FRANCISCO  Lyft pulled back the curtain on its business for the first time on Friday as it prepared to go public officially starting the countdown on a horde of technology offerings that are set to bring new wealth to Silicon Valley this yearBy publicly unveiling the prospectus for its initial public offering Lyft signaled its intention to meet investors in what is known as a roadshow in about two weeks after which it will most likely start trading on the stock market in April The ridesharing company leads a stampede of other highly valued private tech companies that plan to go public this year including its archrival Uber as well as Slack Pinterest and PostmatesBut Lyfts filing also raised questions about the financial health of the tech companies that are planning IPOs Its filing revealed that while it was growing quickly its losses were widening Last year the companys revenue totaled  billion while it lost  millionWe have a history of net losses and we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future Lyft said in the filing adding that it expects to spend more as it expands into new offerings and locationsThe prospectus is the first time that Lyft has made extensive details of its finances publicly available Its public offering is being led by JPMorgan Chase Credit Suisse and Jefferies Lyft did not disclose the market valuation it is seeking from public investors it was last valued at  billion by private investors during a financing round in JuneLyft and Uber said to offer drivers a chance to participate in IPOsLyft filed confidentially to go public in December the same day Uber did Both companies are dueling to hold their offerings ahead of the other in an attempt to be the first publicly traded ridehailing company But the onus has mostly been on Lyft to get out first because Uber  estimated to go public at a valuation of as much as  billion  would potentially steamroll its much smaller rivalBoth companies are set to face questions about when and how they will become profitable The ridehailing business is inherently expensive because companies typically pay incentives to recruit drivers and offer discounts to riders In addition the companies are spending heavily to grow in areas such as autonomous driving and bike sharingIn  Lyfts revenue more than doubled to  billion from  billion in  according to its filing But losses mounted rising to  million last year from  million in  though they declined as a percentage of revenue Total costs and expenses were  billion in  up  percent from  billion in Uber which has disclosed its finances for several years even though it is not public said in February that it lost  million in the final quarter of  on revenue of  billion The firm has been trying to turn its image around after a series of scandals involving its workplace culture and onetime hardball business tacticsLyft also said  million people took at least one ride in the last quarter of  up from  million in late  And based on estimates by the Japanese ecommerce company Rakuten which is an investor in Lyft the company said it had a  percent share of the ridesharing market in the United States up from  percent in Two years ago I definitely viewed Lyft as a secondtier player said Jay Ritter a professor of finance at the University of Florida and an IPO expert But Ubers problems with bad publicity a lot of selfinflicted stuff really benefited LyftMatt Kennedy a senior IPO market strategist at Renaissance Capital which provides institutional research on public offerings said that it was possible Uber would bite back and that Lyfts growth would declineThe number of IPOs that weve seen with  billion in revenue and growing at  percent are few and far between he saidFounded by Logan Green and John Zimmer in  Lyft was initially called Zimride and focused on pooling riders for longdistance trips By  the pair had renamed their company Lyft and shifted the business to providing brief local trips mimicking taxi ridesThe company presented itself as a genial alternative to Uber In its early days Lyft encouraged drivers to strap fuzzy pink mustaches to their front bumpers and to greet riders  who often sat in the front seat  with fist bumps Although Lyft has since lost the furry fender ornaments it has maintained its softer imageOn Friday in its prospectus Lyft continued to emphasize that image as giving it an edge In a founders letter Mr Green and Mr Zimmer wrote that their focus on doing the right thing provided them with a lasting competitive advantageUnlike Uber

and other ridehailing services clashed with the police in Madrid on Wednesday cutting off a highway that rings the capital and picketing the opening of an international tourism fairThe capitals taxi drivers are in the third day of an indefinite strike and intensified their protests in response to an apparent victory for their counterparts in Barcelona who began striking on Friday The regional government there said late Tuesday that it would ban ridehailing companies from carrying passengers who booked less than an hour in advance a proposal that has left Uber and others threatening to suspend servicesBy noon the authorities in Madrid said that  people had been injured in clashes in the capital on Wednesday including five police officersKing Felipe VI and Queen Letizia were ushered into the opening of Madrids annual tourism fair though a side entrance under heavy escort as police officers charged against drivers who burned tires and containers to block road accessOutside some protesters urged the queen a former television presenter to support them shouting Letizia your granddad was a taxi driverThe confrontations reflect not only labor tensions caused by the growth of ridehailing and other gig economy businesses but also a wider wave of popular anger in Europe Many of the striking drivers wore yellow vests echoing recent protests in France and elsewhereIn recent days some of the taxi protests have turned violent in Barcelona where a few drivers have attacked and damaged vehicles operated by Uber and its main Spanish rival Cabify In Madrid one taxi driver was hospitalized after a ridehailing vehicle drove into himAt Madrids airport on Wednesday morning some visitors were unpleasantly surprised to find the taxi stand filled with locked empty vehicles while striking drivers and airport workers instructed them to go back inside the terminal and join the lines at its subway ticket machinesI expected the flight to be tiring but not the trip from the airport to downtown said Jack Miller who was visiting from Los Angeles Its not the best start but it shouldnt be enough to ruin my stayThe course of the various strikes was complicated by conflicting official responses with regional and national politicians accusing each other of intensifying the problemTaxi drivers also paralyzed traffic in Madrid last summer and the incoming Socialist national government promised new legislation on ride hailing But the outcome was a government decree adopted in September that allowed Uber and others to continue operating within cities at least until  but asking regional politicians to set the exact rules under which they would cohabit with taxisIn Barcelona on Wednesday unions representing drivers were split on whether to accept the Catalan regional governments onehour delay proposal for ridehailing pickups  increased from an initial offer of  minutes  and call off their strikeIn Madrid the president of the regional government is a conservative ngel Garrido who on Wednesday accused the Catalan authorities of returning their region to the Middle Ages by making inappropriate concessionsWhat Catalonia is doing with this seems to me exactly the opposite of what should be done Mr Garrido told reporters Madrid will maintain its image of freedom and respect for competition because that is also how citizens want it to beHe also called on Madrids farleft mayor Manuela Carmena to step into the dispute while blaming the Socialist government for staying on the sidelines after handing over this hot potato last SeptemberJuan Galiardo the director of Uber in Spain told Spanish news media that about  of its drivers in Barcelona risked losing their jobs and that his company would instead focus on other cities more favorable to its offeringIf Barcelona implements the onehour booking rule we will have no other alternative than to suspend our services Mr Galiardo said It makes our product completely unviableFollow Raphael Minder on Twitter

seems very nice Its app is pink Its cars were once adorned with fuzzy bubblegumcolored mustaches Its drivers have a reputation for being friendly And while Lyft has racked up more than one billion rides and become a strong No  to Uber in the United States and Canada it has not shaken off its cuddly imageNow Mr Green  must show that Lyft can be as assertive as an Amazon or a Facebook He and Uber are locked in a race to take their companies public Both filed papers in December to list on the stock market in the coming months The offerings  the first for any ridehailing firm  are likely to create a bonanza of riches in Silicon Valley and set the stage for listings of other highly valued tech startups including Slack and PinterestThe pressure is on Mr Green to get the jump on Uber Both offerings have been stalled because the government shutdown which ended Friday prevented the Securities and Exchange Commission from reviewing their filings Lyft which was last privately valued at  billion is tiny compared with its rival and could be overshadowed if Uber debuts first Uber could go public at a  billion valuationFor Mr Green this means he may have to give up some up his reserve and step into a more public role While Lyfts more gregarious president John Zimmer his No  for the last  years has frequently handled the publicfacing side of the business Mr Green would rather speak at staff meetings than at tech conferences Colleagues describe him as reservedIn a  interview Mr Zimmer said Mr Green was often misunderstood because of his quiet demeanor He is like extremely competitive Mr Zimmer now  said He has been an activistLyft declined to make Mr Green or Mr Zimmer available for new interviews citing the quiet period before an initial public offering In a statement the chief operating officer Jon McNeill described them as cutthroat missionaries in service of creating positive changeOne of the tech leaders Mr Green cited as inspiration Mr Musk recommended against taking Lyft publicThe current system makes longterm value creation and product innovation difficult Mr Musk chief executive of Tesla wrote in an email last week It insists on quarterbyquarter results or punishes companies severely This is particularly bad for companies that are high growth and are valued on potential like Lyft or Tesla The SEC fined Mr Musk  last year for a tweet about taking

sustainability coordinator poring over alternatives to the gasguzzling onecarperowner model He was also on the board of the Santa Barbara Metropolitan Transit District a position that gave him insight into municipal transportationWhile visiting Zimbabwe on vacation during his s Mr Green said in the  interview he was inspired by Zimbabweans who had created makeshift services to fill every seat in car pools saving passengers money and taking cars off the roadSo in  Mr Green started Zimride in Santa Barbara Calif to provide longdistance carpool rides to college students by matching them with other students who were drivingMr Zimmer then working at Lehman Brothers noticed posts about the startup on Facebook from John Siegel whom he had met while studying abroad and who had attended middle school with Mr GreenJohn didnt have this technical or programming background but he was this really impressive guy Mr Siegel said I thought they could work together wellMr Green and Mr Zimmer who remained in New York embarked on what Mr Zimmer called a longdistance relationship working together over Skype In  they moved to a twobedroom apartment in Palo Alto Calif Neither drew a salary in the first three years of building Zimride and each contract they sold to a college was celebrated with a trip to Ikea for Swedish meatballs Mr Zimmer saidIn  Zimride raised  million But as a web service it was caught flatfooted by the rise of smartphones and mobile apps In  Mr Green decided to spin out of Zimride a mobile peertopeer ridehailing service calling it LyftInstead of just pairing students for longdistance rides Lyft would put drivers together with riders on public streets in real time Mr Zimmer came up with the idea to emblazon the cars with pink mustaches Mr Green encouraged passengers to greet their drivers with a fist bump to keep the community feeling of ZimrideAt the time ridehailing wasnt legal and only licensed drivers could pick up passengers on public streets Ann MiuraKo a partner at the venture capital firm Floodgate who had invested in Zimride and sits on Lyfts board recalled that some board members had been doubtful about the change  but that Mr Green had been confidentSomeone asked Will this really work And he wasnt just sure he was positive she saidBut Mr Green didnt reckon with one issue Uber At the time Uber run by Travis Kalanick had positioned itself as a luxury service for the wealthy that used only licensed drivers unlike Lyfts lowercost service In  Uber published a white paper outlining the risks of peertopeer ridehailing a way to elbow Lyft out of the marketThey were trying to get the whole category shut down behind the scenes Mr Green said They didnt want competitionUber officials met with California regulators about the matter As for Mr Green several current and former regulators and lawmakers who oversee ridesharing in California said they had never worked with him because Mr Zimmer was often the one who communicated with officialsTruth be told Ive never heard of him said Aaron Peskin a San Francisco supervisor who called for crackdowns on Uber and Lyft in their early years and negotiated a new perride tax with Uber

also mean that the companies fastest phases of growth are behind them As a result there is an increased risk that in this wave of tech IPOs an elite group of investors like sovereign wealth funds and

Research Partners a markets and economic analysis firm Theyre going to be the last investors in and thats the concernLyfts shares soared on Friday when it began trading on public marketsThe change reflects a largescale shift in the way that American entrepreneurs raise money to build their companies Instead of quickly turning to the public markets and the scrutiny that comes with that as Amazon

of more than  billion In public markets thats roughly the same size as corporate giants such as Goldman Sachs and CVS Health Matt Murphy a partner at Menlo Ventures a leading venture capital firm said the higher valuations and larger investments correlate with bigger opportunities created by smartphones and cloud computing The magnitude of the audiences that can be reached and the monetization per user has grown he said Their growth potential is much higher than was previously anticipatedSome industry groups and investors who urge fewer regulations say the emphasis on the private markets is an outgrowth of the SarbanesOxley Act the federal law passed in  that tightened accounting rules for public companies after the accounting scandals of the early s Besides raising disclosure requirements and other changes the law required top executives to attest to the accuracy of corporate financial statements Some say those higher costs to guarantee compliance can dissuade smaller companies from going public Private companies by comparison can operate with far less disclosure They are under no obligation to file quarterly earnings updates or audited annual financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission Nor are they required to broadly distribute updates on business developments to the public Others say the decline in public offerings began before SarbanesOxley passed They attribute the change to a wave of federal deregulation which made it easier to raise money and sell companies privately Lighter antitrust enforcement set off a boom in mergers and acquisitions allowing smaller firms to sell to bigger companies instead of going public At the same time new laws made it easier for private companies to sell securities to qualified investors around the country bolstering funding from private equity and venture capitalWhatever the driver the net result has been a clear downturn in the number of public companies in the United States The number of listed companies has declined by  percent since  to a bit more than  in  according to a working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research published last year This longterm shrinkage in publicly available shares is a reason that some analysts expect Uber Lyft and other prominent startups to receive a warm response from the institutional investors who typically buy freshly issued

have a feeling of I dont really want to miss outInvestors have some reason to be skeptical of paying top dollar for newly minted public companies however Over the last two years the value of companies

by raising more than  million a day from those who could afford to take taxis and Ubers in ManhattanBut before the  fees on rides could even go into effect as planned on Jan  they were sidelined by a lawsuit brought by a coalition of taxi owners and driversThe opponents warn that the fee will add up for passengers and will also deal a final blow to a taxi industry teetering on the brink They say the surcharge will drive away customers when they are already losing business to Uber and other appbased services and struggling with enormous debt and bleak prospectsThree taxi owners and five other professional drivers have committed suicide over the last yearIf they put the surcharge on thats it weve lost our whole life investment said Gloria Guerra  who with her husband William owns a taxi medallion the aluminum plate required to drive a yellow taxi in New York that once sold for more than  million The business will be bankrupt All the medallions will be bankruptOn Thursday the Guerras and other taxi owners and drivers took their fight against what they call a suicide surcharge to a state court hearing in Lower Manhattan capping off months of protests Their lawsuit contends that by imposing the new taxi fee state and city officials seek to drive the final nail in the proverbial coffin by making medallion taxicab rides so financially unattractive to consumers that the industry is sure to collapse in its entiretyLast month a state court judge temporarily blocked the fee until both sides could present arguments At Thursdays hearing a judge continued the suspension of the fee until the next hearing scheduled for Jan The  taxi fee was passed by state lawmakers last year along with a  fee on other forhire vehicles including Ubers and Lyfts and a cent fee on shared pool rides The fees are expected to raise more than  million annually according to budget projectionsEvery day those fees go uncollected means lost revenue for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority which runs the subways and buses As a result taxi drivers and owners have found themselves pitted against state officials business leaders and transit advocates who see the new fees as crucial to the citys transit systemTransit riders individual taxpayers and business are all contributing toward the cost of modernizing our transit system and it is only fair that the taxi industry and their customers do the same said Kathryn S Wylde president of the Partnership for New York City a group of influential business leaders that supports the feeThe  taxi fee has also divided city officials and transportation advocates and complicated a renewed effort by Gov Andrew M Cuomo and transit advocates to push for a comprehensive congestion pricing plan for Manhattan that would charge all drivers a fee for entering the busiest neighborhoods at peak times Mr Cuomo and others have called the fees on taxis and forhire vehicles the first phase of congestion pricingMayor Bill de Blasio has also backed the new fees on forhire vehiclesBut Meera Joshi the commissioner of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission has criticized the fee saying that it would be potentially devastating for the taxi industry Ms Joshi who is stepping down in March is named in the taxi lawsuit and declined last week to comment on the caseThe  fee will raise the minimum taxi fare to   which is still lower than an Uber ride The cost for Uber which has an  base fare in Manhattan will rise to a minimum of  including the new  feeUnlike the taxi industry Uber and two other rideapp services Lyft and Via have supported the fees as a step toward addressing congestion and transit challenges in the cityIn order to truly address these issues its imperative that all vehicles including personal and commercial are included in this effort said Campbell Matthews a spokeswoman for LyftDanny Pearlstein a spokesman for the Riders Alliance a grassroots group of transit riders said most taxi riders in Manhattan can afford to pay the fees They have access to more public transit options than in the other boroughs he said and should pay more if they choose to use a taxi or car serviceThere are a privileged number of people who take taxis and Ubers to get around the core of the city he said They can afford to support the transit system that makes New York what it isBut others said the new fees unfairly single out taxis and forhire vehicles without a larger plan in place to charge all cars on congested streets  and by itself will have little if any impact on reducing gridlockMarco Conner a deputy director of Transportation Alternatives an advocacy group said the taxi lawsuit  and the resulting courtordered delay in fees  shows the fallacy of taking baby steps to address a problem as tremendous as congestion and the MTA crisisIn the lawsuit taxi owners and drivers also claim that they should not be charged a socalled congestion tax because their numbers have been capped by city law at  to prevent an overabundance of cars and congestion even as Uber and other rideapp services had been allowed until recently to expand exponentially In August the city declared a oneyear moratorium on new vehicle licenses for Uber Lyft and other rideapp servicesBruce Schaller a former city transportation official said taxis and rideapp cars have contributed to Manhattan gridlock In a study last year he found equal numbers of taxis and black cars in the central business district during the weekday  together accounting for twothirds of all the vehicles there Making matters worse the forhire vehicles often drove around with empty back seatsYou dont just tax the last person in Mr Schaller said You tax everyone causing the problem Its not like moving around Manhattan was ladeeda before UberWhile Mr Schaller agreed that the taxi fee would do little to reduce congestion he said that it would raise badly needed money for the transit system Chicago Seattle and other cities and states have adopted similar perride fees to pay for public transportation and other services Its a misnomer to call this a congestion fee he said Its all about raising revenueBhairavi Desai the executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance said the new forhire fee would force more taxi owners into bankruptcy while taxi drivers would earn less and could have to cut back on food medical care and other necessitiesI dont know anybody who has savings left she said They will face foreclosures because payments simply wont get made I believe it will be this direAugustine Tang  a yellow taxi driver who planned to attend Thursdays hearing said he makes about  after  hours of driving That is about  less than he earned four years ago when he said he inherited a taxi medallion  and the remaining  loan

whats another month or two But a volatile stock market and signs of a possible recession have fostered a creeping sense of panicAs The Times reported in December Uber and Lyft already accelerated their IPO plans to try to get ahead of a potential market shift This week Dara Khosrowshahi chief executive of Uber tempered expectations telling The Wall Street Journal that market turbulence was not likely to affect the companys plans but if it doesnt happen it doesnt happenUber shareholders would most likely be disappointed if the company does not go public in the coming year he addedThe shutdown volatility and recession fears are happening at a crucial moment The startup worlds success hinges in part on its ability to use hype and trust me confidence to persuade people to believe in a vision of the future Its easy to get caught up in the narrative of innovation disruption and rising valuations and ignore the lack of profitsBut not everyone has and skeptics are getting louder Chamath Palihapitiya a prominent venture capital investor recently called the entire startup and venture capital system a charade and an enormous multivariate kind of Ponzi schemeHes right in one sense A Ponzi scheme relies on its creators ability to persuade everlarger crowds to buy into his or her vision Same goes for startups that havent proved theyre able to turn a profit A flash of doubt especially among publicmarket investors could spiral into a broader questioning of the entire startup ecosystemFor the largest most valuable startups in Silicon Valley many of which plan to prove themselves and their unprofitable business models to the world by going public there could not be a worse moment for that to happen If Uber cant go public what does it mean for all the Uber for X companies that followed its leadCracks are beginning to show This week two highflying startups experienced a reality check in their fundraising WeWork sought to raise  billion in new funding from SoftBank its main backer The company wound up raising just  billion  still an enormous pile of cash but a steep step down from its original planAnd Bird a twoyearold scooter company that was so soughtafter by investors last summer that they doubled the companys valuation in just a few weeks is now raising funding at a flat valuation according to AxiosSome venture capital investors say they welcome a downturn as I wrote this week Theyre hoarding cash and making downturn lists of companies to invest in once valuations become more reasonable And some companies have seen the venturefueled madness and decided its not for themElsewhere this week Economists and investors are clashing over the health of the American economy No one is debating the health of the Chinese economy with concerns spreading to nontech companies including Ford FedEx Starbucks and Tiffany Matt Phillips writes Apples biggest issue is not the Chinese economy its that people like the columnist Kevin Rooses mother dont feel the need to replace their phones every two years anymore That may explain the surprising news from CES that Apple struck deals with a number of hardware companies including Vizio Samsung Sony and LG to use its software The deals  something the company has resisted in the past  show Apples ambition to make more money from content and services as sales of its cash cow the iPhone slow

look at the weeks tech newsA lot of people are getting way more interested in putting fully autonomous cars on the roadWith Lyfts initial public offering on Friday and Ubers expected in the coming months investors are effectively placing bets on autonomous vehicles The development of driverless technology is central to both companies becoming profitable and making good on their valuations of tens of billions of dollarsUber and Lyft want robocars to navigate city streets alone so they can offer rides  without having human drivers share their takings Lyft admitted in its IPO prospectus that without autonomous vehicles our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affectedSo the companies need to test the technology in the real world aggressively And investors will want that to happen But the technology still lags behind the hypeWaymo broadly considered to be the market leader has pushed widespread testing of its vehicles for years It is testing an autonomous ridehailing service in Phoenix that is used by paying members of the publicBut according to a report by The Information things arent going smoothly Almost  percent of Waymos customers registered complaints in reviews seen by the publication from wrong turns to nearcrashes This buggy and concerning service should not be charging money yet one customer reportedly wroteAmbitions to push harder are also softening Currently the company doesnt believe it is close to being able to operate a fleet of selfdriving taxis without safety drivers The Information wroteInvestor pressure on Uber and Lyft will probably influence decisions about holding off on accelerated testing which raises questions about how strictly cities and states should regulate selfdriving vehicles Some jurisdictions are liberal even allowing some cars to be tested without safety drivers others are more strictMark Fagan a lecturer in public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School thinks city and state authorities should allow testing of vehicles only where safety improvements are unambiguous Maybe that means airport shuttles lowspeed taxi pods or some other uses that are safe even if they are  well

that records are not at all available online The country still demands that applications for most official documents take place via paper or fax Digital databases of information on individuals do not

FRANCISCO  Vini Letteri a managing director at KKR who invests in tech companies had a slow Mr Letteri a venture capitalist who manages a  million fund tried to put some of that money into  tech startups last year  but failed when they demanded too rich a price In some cases he said his offers to invest were outbid by as much as  percent The only investment he led in  was a  million deal in OutSystems a software company in AtlantaSo heres what Mr Letteri is notsosecretly hoping for in  a downturn in the private startup marketWhen the market turns were prepared to be more aggressive he said He added that he had sketched out a downturn list of  targets  including financial tech cybersecurity and consumer internet companies  in case they become cheaperMr Letteri is one of a growing number of venture capitalists rooting for a market dip to calm the overheated startup scene For the past few years Silicon Valley tech startups have been awash in a stream of cash that has allowed them to expand quickly and sell or go public at high valuations Yet that drove up the costs of deal making for venture capitalists who often prefer to invest in young companies at lower prices in the hopes of making a bigger return laterNow some of these investors may get their wish for a market decline Stocks tumbled late last year led by tech giants such as Facebook and Apple amid fears of slowing economic growth and a trade war with China And so far this year the stock market has swung wildly whipsawed by confusing signals including Apples disappointing iPhone sales in China and American employers adding more jobs than expected last monthWhile it takes time for choppiness in the stock market to ripple out into the startup market many venture investors are already preparing for a downturn Some are setting aside money to pounce on investments and are preparing to write bigger checks with the expectation that new investors who flooded in in recent years will flee And they are keeping closer tabs on companies that were too expensive to invest in last yearWe definitely want to take advantage of a market downturn said Sandy Miller a venture capitalist at IVP who projects that startup valuations will fall by  percent to  percent this year He said his Silicon Valley venture firm has set aside meaningful reserves to do more deals and to put more money into companies it has already invested in though he declined to specify an amountSilicon Valley investors have long complained that startup valuations have gotten too expensive given that the startup ecosystem has been on a bull run since at least  That has minted an unprecedented number of unicorn startups which are valued at more than  billion including nowgiant companies such as Uber and AirbnbBut the rising valuations have only continued to climb in the last year In  the median company valuation for one category of mature startups more than doubled to  million up from  million in  according to Carta a provider of valuation software and services And in a  National Bureau of Economic Research study of  unicorn startups researchers concluded the companies were overvalued by an average of  percentTheres too much heat around good not necessarily great companies that are older said Mamoon Hamid a partner at the venture firm Kleiner Perkins Even one good not great company he recently met with had  investment offers he said The upshot Kleiner did not investGreg Sands a managing partner at Costanoa Ventures said his venture firm walked away from three investments in  where the price was  percent higher than he was willing to pay an increase from past years He also screened out numerous companies that were asking for more money than seemed reasonable  yet some of those companies then went on to raise triple that amount from other investorsWhats happening right now isnt sustainable and it wont go on forever It cant he said Costanoa raised a  million opportunity fund which Mr Sands said would give it the ability to do more deals when the market cools downMany other venture capital firms are also in a position to become more aggressive in case of a market downturn Venture funds raised  billion in the first three quarters of last year on track to surpass s total of  billion according to PitchBook a data providerStartup founders also appear to be preparing for a potential shift in fortunes In a survey conducted late last year by First Round Capital a venture capital firm just under half of  entrepreneurs said they expected fundraising to become more difficult in  A third said they believed the tech bubble was close to popping a point increase over Some startups are raising more money to weather the uncertainty according to Kirsten Green a managing partner at Forerunner Ventures Others are creating backup plans to cut costs so their survival wont depend on new fundingNot all venture capitalists want a downturn especially if it will throw a wrench into the plans of some of the biggest unicorns  such as Uber Lyft Pinterest and Slack  to go public Many investors are eager to cash out of those companies when they stage an initial public offeringYou always want a better market said Micah Rosenbloom a managing partner at Founder Collective which was an early investor in Uber In a crisis everything gets hard Youd rather have your companies in good times for everything from hiring to salesStill Mr Rosenbloom said he also saw opportunity in a downturn His firms two most successful investments  Uber and the Trade Desk a digital advertising company  were created in the aftermath of the  financial crisisIn previous downturns the less serious entrepreneurs disappeared leaving the most committed ones said David Pakman a partner at venture firm Venrock

private messaging and away from the public broadcasting on which its business was built Think encrypted communications among smaller groups of people and ephemeral messages that can be deleted In theory that change could help the company overcome some of the problems it has facedBut Facebook has promised privacy features before that have never appeared  something skeptics were quick to point out after the plan was revealed on ThursdayI understand that many people dont think Facebook can or would even want to build this kind of privacyfocused platform Mark Zuckerberg the companys chief executive wrote in a word manifesto describing the shiftIf we are to assume he means it theres still a huge problem He lacks a business modelA shift to a private Facebook would crimp its current revenue streams Most of its profits come from targeted ads enabled by the open sharing of content In the encrypted future that Mr Zuckerberg imagines that will be hard The company would also effectively rule out expansion into big potential markets like Russia and China because it wont run servers in countries with authoritarian governmentsSo how can it make money Mr Zuckerberg mentions commerce and payments which fits with reports that Facebook is building a cryptocurrency But thats all he says reallyMr Zuckerberg seems OK with the lack of a plan The basic way that weve approached things is first to focus on building the consumer service that people really want he said to Wired That will be the foundation If we do that well the business will be fineOf course a trick for monetizing private messaging may be hidden in his back pocket If it isnt his critics skepticism may be proved rightEarlier in the week Representative David Cicilline the Rhode Island Democrat who leads the House antitrust subcommittee proposed an idea to curb Big Techs dominanceDuring the Great Depression the GlassSteagall Act forced banks to separate commercial and investment banking operations Mr Cicilline told the Financial Times that something similar could apply to techIts an interesting idea whether there would be a way to think about separating what platforms do versus people who are selling products and information he saidSadly this feels like a nonstarter Splitting the operations of banks was relatively straightforward the data sales and platform components of companies like Google and Facebook are whatever Mr Zuckerberg says deeply intertwinedStill its probably one of many options There arent easy answers to Big Tech antitrust questions Mr Cicilline said to Bloomberg Opinion in January Were not going to approach this like Heres my solutionHe has the wind at his back Congressional hearings with Facebook and others last year revealed that lawmakers in both parties have antitrust concerns about tech companies And the Federal Trade Commission recently announced a task force of  lawyers dedicated to monitoring competition in US technology markets The commissions director of competition Bruce Hoffman said some companies could be forced to spin off previous acquisitionsHow far these efforts will go  and how quickly  remains unclear It may be difficult to prove violation of federal antitrust law until the laws are updated to better apply to technology companies And splitting a company like Facebook or Google would require costly lengthy legal battles that the government may yet balk atArizona prosecutors said Tuesday that they wouldnt charge Uber with a crime after one of its autonomous cars hit and killed a pedestrian last year Instead they said investigators should look into what the safety driver would or should have seen that nightOne interesting point about the news was raised by Frank Douma a researcher at the University of Minnesotas Center for Transportation StudiesIts a very conventional way of thinking to say we can expect and we should expect people to sit and monitor technology that is otherwise doing all the decisionmakingThe handoff problem  that humans are too easily distracted to safely retake control of an autonomous vehicle in an emergency  is well documented The Uber accident provided a first glimpse of how the law would deal with that issue It suggests that for now the onus remains on the driverThe Chinese telecom giant Huawei sued the United States government on Wednesday over a ban that prevents government agencies from using the companys products because they may violate national security Days earlier Meng Wanzhou the companys chief financial officer sued the Canadian authorities for arresting herHuawei is aggrieved by the Trump administrations hardware ban and its lobbying of other governments to shun the companys products when building G wireless data networks The lawsuits are just one response A defensive advertising campaign and outspoken interviews were already in playThose more conventional lobbying approaches may have been working Countries like Britain and Germany which have considered the White Houses pleas have wavered and may ultimately use Huawei hardwareBut the lawsuits make Huawei look rash and aggressive Is that the kind of company a

contributing opinion writer I will die before I buy another carI dont say that because I am particularly old or sick but because I am at the front end of one of the next major secular trends in tech Owning a car will soon be like owning a horse  a quaint hobby an interesting rarity and a cool thing to take out for a spin on the weekendBefore you object let me be clear I will drive in cars until I die But the concept of actually purchasing maintaining insuring and garaging an automobile in the next few decadesFinished Kara Swisher answered your questions about this column on TwitterThis could be the most important shift since the Cambrian explosion of the smartphone Carsharing continues to increase Uber and Lyft are set to go public this year new innovations emerge all the time Scooters Verticaltakeoffandlanding vehicles and all manner of autonomous technologies are inevitable Elon Musk whatever you think of him or the prospects of Tesla is  percent directionally correct Private car ownership declined globally last year and it is a trend that I believe is going to accelerate faster than people thinkNot everyone agrees After an initial rush of hype and hope there was a backlash against the idea that autonomous and shared cars would soon take over But I am pretty good at this guessing game In  as one of the first Internetfocused reporters for The Wall Street Journal I wrote a piece titled I Cut the Cord about giving up my land line and going all mobile That was well before feature phones  as the first dumber versions of smartphones were called  and almost a decade before the iPhone There was not much out there for the general population Nonetheless I snipped my copper umbilical cord and predicted that everyone else would do the same and sooner than they thoughtI did not find it easy as I noted then My own allcellular journey is strewn with technical glitches and innumerable lost connections pricey millisecond charges that make using a cellphone seem like a bad addiction and vague worries that perhaps too much cellphone exposure actually does cause brain tumorsBut it was time Absent the brain tumors this was the thought that hit me recently when my clutch died on a hill in San Francisco After spending my life buying cars I will never buy another after I sell my last a manual Ford Fiesta Turbo named FrankSince I first started driving I have named my cars Cecil the Honda Civic Jeanette the mighty blue Volkswagen Bug Roger the Volkswagen Rabbit Jerry the Jeep Wrangler John the Jeep Cherokee Alice the Honda Minivan Sally the Subaru Outback Abner the Mazda  Cindy the Mazda  and Frank Why wouldnt I name them since they were an integral part of my life from my teens to my single days to motherhoodMany people feel this kind of bond with their cars They represent so many major life moments prom and individual tropes freedom that it is difficult to imagine giving them upBut it will be easier than youd think for a number of reasons that are increasing in speed and velocity if you will excuse the pun Consider how swiftly people moved from physical maps to map apps from snail mail to email from prime time TV to watching on demand What had been longheld practices were quickly replaced by digital tools that made things easier more convenient and simply better Some of the shifts have been slower to develop but then accelerated quickly like what is now occurring in retail with online shopping and quick delivery pioneered by AmazonSimply put everything that can be digitized will be digitizedThat is harder to envision with the heavy hunk of metal and fiberglass that is a car but it is not hard to see the steps You start using carsharing services you dont use your car as often you realize as these services proliferate that you actually dont need to own a car at allIts also a small step toward a more carbonfree life although my frequent crosscountry flights pretty much make me a carbon criminal for life My fingers are crossed for not only an electric car but an electric plane or even carbonfree jet fuelIts obviously an easier decision if you live near a major metropolitan area like I do where the alternatives  cars and then car pools and then bikes and now scooters  are myriad Why by the way this is a revolution led by private companies instead of public transportation is an important topic for another day In other countries often with denser populations there are even more ideas bubbling up from autorickshaws and motorbike taxis to new bus services Obviously the biggest change will be the advent of truly autonomous vehicles which are still years or even decades in the future But in the meantime I am going to lean into this future all I can and will chronicle the efforts over the next year its costs and its benefits and how I get there Or notWill I walk more Take more buses or trains How much will I use shortterm car rental services Will my kids freak out when I decline to be their constant

transportation than simply seeing his investment in Uber Technologies Inc turn into more than  billion when the company goes public next month The Japanese entrepreneur is placing a  billion bet in more than  companies in a bid to steer the  trillion global automotive industry now dominated by vehicles people own and drive to a spectrum of transportation services available at the touch of a smartphone app Those services range from ride hailing and car sharing to delivery robots and selfdriving vehiclesThe extent of those investments based on a Reuters analysis of publicly available data and interviews with a dozen sources familiar with SoftBanks investment strategy has not previously been reported They show how Son has emerged as one of the power players trying to influence how people and goods move about the world in the coming decades Graphic Softbanks future mobility investments click httpstmsnrtrsUQXnF Key partners in Sons quest are Uber the US ride services leader and Japans Toyota Motor Corp Ubers planned initial public stock offering in May is expected to value the company at  billion to  billion representing a potential windfall to SoftBank which put  billion into Uber for a  percent stake in January  The rising value of that investment will further supercharge Sons growing clout in the sector and eventually provide him with additional capital to invest in mobility Closer to home Toyota approached Son more than a year ago about a partnership and SoftBank in February  signed a memorandum of understanding with the automaker to consider how they might jointly develop mobility services according to sources familiar with the document The agreement was followed by the launch of a joint venture dubbed Monet Technologies designed to set up automated mobility servicesSoftBank and Toyota are also in talks to colead a  billion investment in Ubers selfdriving unit Reuters reported in March While the deal is close to being finalized discussions remain ongoing around issues such as how much of the unit SoftBank would control sources told ReutersToyota declined to comment for this story In an interview with Reuters SoftBank Group Chief Operating Officer Marcelo Claure said that the two Japanese companies have a lot sessions in which we think and we try to redefine the future of mobility Central to those sessions are discussions about how Toyota and SoftBank can collaborate to bring autonomous vehicles to Japan he saidSon has been working since  to weave together a tapestry of diverse transportation bets His deep portfolio of investments range literally from A to Z From Arm a British semiconductor maker that Son acquired in  for  billion to Zume Pizza a Silicon Valley startup that aims to automate pizza delivery and raised  million last year from SoftBank A FAMILY AFFAIRSoftBank has used at least five investment vehicles including the  billion Vision Fund from which to make its mobility investments public records show Its deep pockets aggressive investing tactics and sweeping vision of the future of transportation give SoftBank and its leader Son an outsized influence in shaping the entire industry The Vision Fund has more than  investment professionals who work to promote cooperation and integration among the portfolio companies which they refer to as a family We can create this web where companies talk to each other and they help each other because they are part of the same family and they do joint ventures and they do joint investments Claure saidSoftBank and its affiliates have focused some of their biggest investments on selfdriving firm Cruise a unit of GM and four global rideservices giants  Uber Didi Chuxing Ola and Grab SoftBank is the largest shareholder in the four rideservices companies and the largest outside shareholder in CruiseSon is the true emperor of future mobility said Tom De Vleesschauwer senior director of longterm planning and sustainability at IHS AutomotiveTo help implement his vision Son also allied with General Motors Co and Honda Motor Co each of which is investing heavily in selfdriving vehicles and ride services Son laid out his future of transportation vision in an October press conference alongside Toyota where he talked about building a cluster of leading mobility companies in different sectors which can collaborate with each otherToyota a year ago introduced ePalette an electric shuttle designed for selfdriving ride and delivery services and quickly signed up Uber and Didi as development partners The ePalette is also the centerpiece of Monet Technologies which added Honda as a minority partner in March All are tied back to SoftBank That collaboration is expected to enable some SoftBank companies to become superapps or applications where customers go for a range of services such as transportation shopping and payments Such companies can be much more lucrative than those that offer just one core business or service But the fact that many of SoftBanks companies are rivals can complicate the investors ambitions Uber and Ola the Indian ridehailing company remain fierce competitors and are never in the same room when SoftBank discusses ridehailing strategies Claure saidTraditionally in venture capital funds do not invest in direct competitorsThere are tremendous synergies but on the other hand there is significant risk of tremendous conflicts of interest said Paul Asel managing partner at NGP Capital and a longtime mobility investorThere are limits to the investors influence however For example SoftBank encouraged Cruise to acquire or take a stake in selfdriving startup Nuro but talks between the companies never led to a deal according to two sources with knowledge of the matterSo SoftBank made its own  million investment in NuroHUNTING BIG GAMEIn his fiveyear transportation push Sons stakes in ride services startups now look like bargains In late  SoftBank joined Alibaba Chinas internet giant in which SoftBank also has a stake in a  million funding round in Kuaidi Dache the forerunner of Chinas DidiThat investment has grown to more than  billion in Didi in which SoftBank now holds more than  percentSoftBanks partnerships with major automakers are also proving to be a boon to transportation startups Toyota invested in Uber in  then boosted its stake seven months after SoftBanks investment Honda followed SoftBank with an investment into Grab and last year committed  billion to Cruises selfdriving project aiding SoftBanks ambitionsBut the SoftBank portfolio is not without risks particularly for companies dependent on the Japanese firm to sustain them financially for years to come SoftBank faces financial pressures including an obligation to pay an annual  percent dividend on a portion of the invested capital and has burnt through the majority of the Vision FundAnd it is compelled by a new US law cracking down on foreign investment in technology to submit many of its mobility investments to a government regulatory agency for approval Should that regulatory group block a deal it could be catastrophic to a startupBut there is some safety for Son given the size of his portfolio Hes shooting for big game Roger Lanctot global automotive practice director at Strategy Analytics said of Son He only needs to bag one or two and he will do just fine Reporting by Paul

Condliffe Greetings from London Heres a look at the weeks tech newsMark Zuckerberg has a vision that hed like Congress to shareLawmakers seem to agree that there are too few tech companies with too much power and that Big Tech needs to be regulated What they cant agree on is how do it Break companies up tax them more apply privacy rules remove liability protections The list goes on There are lots of options none particularly well developed and little consensus on what might workMr Zuckerberg the chief executive of Facebook appeared to take advantage of this when he made his own proposal for regulation in a Washington Post oped According to Corynne McSherry the legal director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation a digital rights group Mr Zuckerbergs proposals were an effort to get ahead of the many suggestions already on the table and shape what happens down the pikeThe proposals were not earthshattering most had been suggested by policymakers already or even put into effect in other parts of the world But Mr Zuckerberg fleshed them out into one of the more actionable calls for tech regulation that weve yet seenThey may seem like an appealing first draft of the rules to some lawmakers An obvious question is Should they beLegislation is written by legislators and that is what theyre elected to do  no industry can replace that said Jason Oxman the chief executive of the Information Technology Industry Council a trade association He added that the tech industry will want to make its voice heard and that its certainly our hope that Congress will balance a need to encourage innovation with issues like maintaining privacyMs McSherry said she was very concerned about the idea that policymakers might look to the chief executives of Silicon Valley for guidance on what they should doIts sort of asking the foxes how best to guard the henhouse she saidMy colleague Mike Isaac read between the lines of what Mr Zuckerberg wrote And all of his proposals appear to suggest regulation that would strengthen Facebook  by allowing Facebook to squash competitors say or better enable it to meld its main platform with its other properties Instagram and WhatsAppIf regulation is to genuinely curb Big Techs power Congress may be better served by spending less time on theatrical tech CEO testimony and more time listening to the technologists who built the systems theyre trying to regulate and to the people who use themDont panic but some stickers could help run an autonomous car off the roadDriverless cars use artificial intelligence often based on socalled neural networks to interpret camera images Such software can identify a stop sign But small visual tweaks to an object barely observable to humans can fire connections in neural networks to convince them theyre looking at something else like a speedlimit signResearchers from the Keen Security Lab part of the technology company Tencent reported that a similar trick forced an autonomous car to switch lanes Teslas Autopilot software they showed uses only camera data to detect lanes and small visual tweaks to a road surface could cause its neural networks to think road markings were veering In tests stickers on a road caused a Tesla Model S in Autopilot mode to swerve into another laneTesla said in a statement that a driver can easily override Autopilot at any time by using the steering wheel or brakes and should always be prepared to do soBut it demonstrates the fragility of current AI You would expect the system to behave robustly said Marta Kwiatkowska a professor of computing systems at the University of Oxford If you change the input very slightly the output should change only very slightlySolving the problem isnt just about improving AI The entire system needs to be made more robust by creating additional checks using other sensors Ms Kwiatkowska said We need to engineer these systems better she saidTheres a lot of awful stuff online Not liking it is easy Actually overcoming it is hardSilicon Valley workers are aware of the problem On Tuesday Bloomberg published a report that said YouTube executives had ignored employee proposals to change recommendations and curb conspiracies Their suggestions were reportedly sacrificed for engagementExecutives like YouTubes chief product officer Neal Mohan insist that the algorithms may be designed to keep people watching but not to recommend things like extremist content even if thats what they end up doing After all it doesnt monetize he said because advertisers dont want to be associated with this sort of contentBut recommend they do so calls for rules that force content takedowns are unsurprising The most recent a law passed in Australia on Thursday which threatens big fines for companies if they fail to swiftly remove violent materialSadly it may not be that easy to solve the whole harmful content problem First defining harmful is a minefield As Ms McSherry of the Electronic Frontier Foundation put it to me one persons harmful content can be anothers political expression That feeds a second issue In the United States moves toward mandatory takedowns of specific kinds of content could quickly

voting power By Peter EavisThe initial public offerings of Lyft and Pinterest will give investors the chance to buy into young fastgrowing companies led by founders with ambitious visionsBut to get a piece of that action investors will have to give up something big an equal say in how the companies are runLyft a rideshare company and Pinterest a social media network will deprive their new shareholders of full voting rights when they go public in the coming days and weeks Both companies plan to issue shares to a small number of insiders that have far more voting power than the shares everyone else will ownThe use of two classes of shares has become increasingly popular among Silicon Valley startups going public But such share structures have also prompted a backlash Big investors corporategovernance experts and even some tech executives warn that the issuance of supervoting shares undermines the system of accountability that has long been a pillar of public stock marketsStill the Lyft and Pinterest offerings show that the desire to retain control after going public remains strongBoth Pinterest and Lyft are issuing two classes of stock one that gives its holders  votes each and another owned by outside investors that will have one vote eachIn Lyfts case the two founders Logan Green and John Zimmer will control  percent of the companys voting power while holding just under  percent of the overall shares Pinterest has not yet disclosed numbers needed to do a similar breakdown Google opted for a dualclass structure as it went public in  when it was fairly unusual for tech companies to do so Facebook issued shares that gave control to its founders in its  IPO Snap a social media company sold shares to the public in  with no voting rights which prompted an outcry But that hasnt slowed their adoption Last year nearly twothirds of technology companies going public had more than one class of shares compared with a quarter five years earlier according to data from DealogicAnd its not just technology companies that have embraced maintaining control Levi Strauss which went public last week has shares that put most of the voting power in the hands of its founders descendants And some media companies The New York Times Company included have special shares that give control to their holdersUber may buck this trend though The ridesharing company is preparing to make its public market debut this year and is expected to do so with one class of stockAs owners of a company shareholders expect to have some sway over management Full voting rights give them a greater voice in whos on the board and how much executives get paid and on big decisions like whether to sell the company Diminishing public holders voting rights can give insiders too much power and insulate executives who make poor decisions Strong boards as well as the looming threat of activist investors do a lot to assure top executives are responsive says Glenn Kelman chief executive of Redfin an online real estate brokerage The feeling that I serve at the pleasure of the board that it is a privilege to work at Redfin is fundamental to this company and the best of business culture he saidIts hard to say definitively whether companies with unequal voting rights perform better or worse over time Google has grown strongly over the years but so have Apple Amazon and Microsoft which dont give special control to insiders Viacoms stock has done poorly while CBSs has done quite well Sumner M Redstone with the help of his daughter Shari Redstone controls both companies through voting shares Much also depends on the type of control a company grants Robert J Jackson Jr a commissioner at the Securities and Exchange Commission has cited analysis showing that companies that give control to insiders in perpetuity ended up with lower valuations on the stock market than those that planned to get rid of unequal voting rights after a certain periodThe question of control may become crucial when a company gets into trouble Mark Zuckerberg Facebooks chief executive faltered in his response to abuse of the companys network and data Shareholder advisory groups last year pressed for changes that they said would improve governance including setting up a special risk committee on the board but they did not get the necessary votes  Mr Zuckerberg enjoys the protection of powerful voting shares Facebook did not respond to a request for commentPerhaps the biggest is that they can shield executives from pressures to bolster a companys performance in the near term and give them more freedom to make investments that take time to pay off Google has made that argumentOf course it is possible for companies that dont issue special controlling shares to shrug off the shorttermism of the stock market Amazon has plowed significant sums into new businesses for years and is among the most valuable companies in the world But companies at a vulnerable stage in their development may benefit from giving control to their leaders as they pursue their visions for their companies Lyft for instance is planning big investments in selfdriving vehicle technology and the companys stock may suffer if they dont immediately bear fruit And though Facebooks controlling shares may have helped set the stage for its stumbles the arrangement may also have helped the company respond Since the scandals Facebook has increased its spending to safeguard its network Wall Street analysts have at times questioned the need for such costs but Mr Zuckerberg can mostly ignore them because of the voting power in his handsSome efforts to address the use of highvoting shares have focused on how long these classes of shares exist Critics oppose arrangements that allow the holders to keep control until they die or those that allow the shares to be passed on to descendants These create what Mr Jackson the SEC commissioner has called corporate royaltyInstead of granting longterm or perpetual control a few companies have adopted structures that convert controlling shares into ordinary shares after a certain number of years But this approach has failed to gain traction In the three years through  only  percent of the IPOs with special controlling shares had a provision that allow their superior voting power to expire after a certain period according to a New York Times analysis of data provided by the Council of Institutional Investors a group that has criticized unequal voting rightsLyfts controlling shares wont lose any of their power over time but the company has attempted to bolster its corporate governance by having an independent chairman Other companies have taken this step including Snap but it hasnt been enough to satisfy critics of unequal share classes A lot of companies think an independent chair is a good idea but is that person going to last forever Mr Jackson said Is there anything to stop them from removing the independent chairPinterest has a sevenyear time limit but it only kicks in if the holders of the highvoting shares own less than half the shares they had just before IPO I would not count that as a true timebased sunset said Andrew Winden a fellow at Stanford Law School Rock Center for Corporate Governance referring to phaseout provisions Peter Eavis is a New York based reporter covering companies and markets

Monday that it sought to have the biggest technology initial public offering since  setting the stage for a bonanza of riches for young tech companies this yearThe ridehailing company said in a new regulatory filing that it hoped to be valued at up to  billion when it lists on the stock market as soon as next week the highest number for a tech company since Alibaba the Chinese ecommerce giant went public at a  billion valuation in  Lyfts target value is significantly greater than its  billion valuation in its last private funding round a sign that it expects a warm reception from investorsThat provides a benchmark for other tech companies that are preparing to go public this year including Lyfts chief rival Uber as well as Pinterest Postmates Slack and others All are seeking high valuations with their offerings likely to bring a wave of wealth to tech investors founders and early employees that will once again rev up the Silicon Valley startup ecosystem Lyfts IPO is expected to be quickly eclipsed by Uber which may go public at a valuation of up to  billionWere looking at Lyft as a bellwether for the summer IPO market said Matthew Kennedy a senior IPO market strategist at Renaissance Capital The others in the pipeline are all watching Lyft and looking to see whether investors are interested in companies that are highly unprofitable but highly valuableBut in a troubling trend for some investors Lyfts new filing also revealed how tech founders are continuing to assert control over their companies in a way that gives other shareholders very little say Because of a mechanism that gives Lyfts two founders  Logan Green the chief executive and John Zimmer the president  outsize voting rights the duo will own less than  percent of the companys outstanding stock once it is public but they will control nearly  percent of its voting sharesThe filing coincided with the start of Lyfts socalled road show a twoweek run of meetings during which company executives and advisers will try to persuade prospective investors to grab a piece of what will the first ridehailing firm to go publicLyfts offering will test how investors value the ridehailing business model Lyft and Uber have demonstrated rapid growth but neither company is profitable and each spends heavily on subsidies for riders and drivers in an effort to win market share from each other Lyft lost  million last year on revenue of  billion the company disclosed in an earlier filingIn its new filing Lyft proposed a highend share price of  to  a range that would generate about  billion and perhaps as much as  billion if demand for shares is great enough for the company to increase the number it makes availableMr Green and Mr Zimmer are set to reap hundreds of millions of dollars apiece as a result of the offering the updated prospectus showed Mr Greens stake would be worth about  million at the high end of the expected initial share price Mr Zimmers would be worth about  millionPerhaps more important the two men would retain control of Lyft thanks to their ownership of a special class of shares that gives them  times the voting power of regular shareholders despite each of them owning less than  percent of the companyThe arrangement is common in IPOs by founderled technology companies Facebook and Snap for example ensured that their creators would keep an iron grip on their businesses But the practice has been criticized by investor advocates who say that it creates a disadvantage for regular shareholdersThis arrangement imposes a significant gap between those who exercise control over the company and those who have economic exposure to the consequences of that control a coalition of institutional investors wrote in a letter last week to Lyfts board that asked them to reconsider the arrangementIn a video promoting the companys roadshow that was also released on Monday Mr Green and Mr Zimmer discussed their reasons for founding Lyft The video showed Mr Green  riding a public bus in San Francisco and recalling a visit to Zimbabwe where he drew inspiration from car pools he saw there Mr Zimmer  reflected on his time in hotel management while wandering through a hotel parking garageIn the video the pair then meet in the back seat of a car where they hinted at their advantages Their company is still led by its founders they said and is solely focused on consumer transportation without side bets in food delivery and freight shipments Their message was a dig at Uber whose founders are no longer in executive roles at the company and which has expanded into food delivery with Uber Eats and freight shipments with Uber FreightCar ownership in the US is failing people Mr Zimmer said in the video suggesting that the transportation industry will eventually flip from car ownership to ride services like LyftThe price for Lyfts shares is expected to be finalized on March  according to Ipreo setting the company up to begin trading

leave the state Truckers are putting together a lobbying strategy And taxi drivers have written a letter to Gov Andrew M Cuomo seeking a reprieveOne battle over congestion pricing is over But now that the plan is officially coming to New York City the next fight has begun Who will pay how much will it cost and who might get a breakThe outcry began almost immediately after Mr Cuomo and state lawmakers reached a deal last weekend to make New York the first city in the country to enact congestion pricing Starting in  drivers entering the heart of Manhattan could pay  to  money that will be used to pay for improvements to the citys troubled subwayState leaders were careful to avoid including too many details in the legislation in part over concerns that it would be harder to pass Instead they left many of the difficult decisions to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and a yettobeappointed sixmember traffic mobility review boardBut that has opened the way for various groups to try to influence the outcome in the months ahead and to make their case for exemptions and discountsWe will be having discussions with the panel to educate them on the trucking industry and the challenges they have when it comes to delivering in the zone said Kendra Hems the president of the Trucking Association of New York We feel very strongly that the industry should be exempt from payingBut state officials and transit advocates say allowing too many loopholes could prevent the city from achieving its two major goals reducing congestion and raising  billion for public transitThe intent is not to have a whole list of exemptions said Robert Mujica the state budget director Youre trying to discourage people from driving into the zone  thats the only way to reduce trafficBut that will not deter people from tryingEvery constituency in town is going to ask for a special exemption and carve out but part of what makes congestion pricing work is that its fair and applies broadly said John Raskin executive director of the Riders Alliance an advocacy groupThe stakes are high to get it right New York could serve as an example for other cities like Los Angeles and Philadelphia that are also considering the idea If it is a debacle other cities might abandon their plansIn London where congestion pricing began in  the toll has risen to about  per day from about  Residents who live in the zone get a discount as do owners of lowemission vehicles Taxis and other ridehailing cars are exemptThe New York legislation included only a broad framework The congestion zone is below th Street in Manhattan except for the West Side Highway and FDR Drive two busy roadways on each side of the island Emergency vehicles and those carrying disabled people are exempt People who live in the zone and earn less than  a year can receive a tax creditThe framework has left ample room for complaintsLeaders in New Jersey say its drivers could get gouged Gov Philip D Murphy asked Governor Cuomo for a discount for those who use the George Washington Bridge the worlds busiest bridgeSteven Fulop the mayor of Jersey City said on Twitter that New Jersey should seek revenge by tolling New York drivers to pay for upgrades for New Jersey Transit the states sputtering commuter rail and bus network If some bridges and tunnels are discounted and not others he said that could lead to major traffic jams at certain crossingsIf you selectively exempt people based on politics thats a big issue for us Mr Fulop saidThe backlash in the region has been swift About  percent of New York City voters oppose congestion pricing and more than half believe it would not reduce traffic according to a Quinnipiac University Poll released on TuesdayDrivers will likely pay  to  for cars and around  for trucks entering the city during peak business hours and less at night and on weekends said Samuel I Schwartz a traffic expert known as Gridlock Sam who was one of the architects of the congestion pricing plan But if the authority starts handing out exemptions that would likely push up tolls for everyone else to  or moreI think there should be just about no exemptions he said People using their cars contribute to congestion It doesnt matter what group they belong toBut even Mr Schwartz has not been able to escape the calls for exemptions from friends and neighbors in northern Manhattan People are calling me asking for their own personal exemptions  even neighbors of mine he said Im not terribly popular at the momentSean Hughes a spokesman for Coach USA which operates hundreds of buses in Manhattan daily said he has been calling emailing and meeting with state lawmakers to make a case for exempting buses Mr Hughes said buses reduce congestion by carrying people who would otherwise be drivingBusing is a form of mass transit that is a solution to congestion he said We should be exemptSeveral motorcycle clubs have also pressed state lawmakers for an exemption or discount with their members saying that they should not have to pay the same fees as drivers since their twowheelers contribute less to congestion than carsOne car can take the space of six bikes said Joseph Notovitz  a branding specialist from Long Island who regularly rides his motorcycle to and from Manhattan and weaves around cars trapped in gridlockThe transportation authority the sprawling agency that oversees the subway buses and commuter railroads will determine the tolls and exemptions based on recommendations by a traffic mobility review board The authoritys board which has representatives

served by the MetroNorth Railroad and another must live along the Long Island Rail Road Its findings are due around November Mr Mujica said the mobility board will review a traffic study analysis of bridges and tunnels and consider public input before deciding whether to credit drivers who already pay tolls The board which will likely have members with experience in public transportation and finance will also come up with a plan for taxis and ridehail vehicles including UberUber the popular ridehail app has been a key booster for congestion pricing The company says it has spent more than  million to support the proposal Uber has paid lobbyists more than  million in New York since  and spent nearly  on television ads and phone calls to support congestion pricing last year according to state recordsUber officials say congestion pricing is the best way to relieve traffic in the city instead of blaming Uber for congested streets and imposing a cap on new ridehail vehicles Josh Gold a spokesman for Uber declined to comment on whether Uber might seek an exemption from the congestion tollState Senator Todd Kaminsky a Democrat from Long Island said that he is pushing for a credit for Long Island commuters who use the Robert F Kennedy Bridge on the way into Manhattan These people should not get double tolled he saidThe authoritys bridges and tunnels division will technically oversee the tolling program Its acting president Daniel DeCrescenzo along with the new MTA chairman Patrick Foye will have considerable power over the plan So will Mr Cuomo who appointed Mr Foye and

Lyfts value at more than  billion as it prepares to begin trading on the Nasdaq stock market on Friday under the ticker symbol LYFTIn total the company raised about  billion having also increased the number of shares that were sold That amount could grow if Lyfts underwriters sell an additional block of shares to meet even strongerthanexpected investor demandThe offering marks the arrival of a new generation of Silicon Valley darlings on the public markets Many of the companies promised new business models upended established industries such as transportation and triggered a chain effect on how

their new publicmarket backers Some companies that went public while running big losses including Groupon and Snap now trade well below their IPO pricesIn its offering prospectus Lyft revealed that it lost close to  billion in  Lyft and Uber regularly lose money in their competition to win new markets where they spend amply on subsidies for riders and drivers The companies also burn cash on other transportation initiatives like bikes scooters and autonomous vehicles Last year Lyft bought the largest bikesharing company in the United States for around  millionWith Lyft obviously the market is saying Were willing to give you the benefit of the doubt on a lot of things given that there are huge uncertainties about its future Mr Ritter saidAt its IPO price Lyfts market value puts it within range of oldline auto companies like Ford Motor It is a significant increase from the  billion that Lyft earned in its last private fundraising round last yearOver the past week and a half Lyft executives and their bankers embarked on a roadshow that took them from New York to Kansas City to San Francisco pitching their business to institutional investors Lyft initially set a price range of  to  for its shares before raising that range on Wednesday to  to  The offering was led by JPMorgan Chase and Credit SuisseBetween  and  IPOs that were priced above their initial range averaged a return of  percent Mr Ritter saidBut Lyft must now prove that it is worth the eyepopping valuation bestowed upon it by its new publicmarket investors That challenge includes maintaining its enviable growth rate  it more than doubled its revenue in   while showing that its focus on transportation rather than branching out into evermore business lines as Uber has can be lucrativeThe offerings success will bring windfalls for Lyfts biggest existing investors Among them the companys founders Logan Green and John Zimmer who are poised to be worth hundreds of millions of dollars Rakuten the Japanese ecommerce giant and venture capital firms like Andreessen HorowitzThough Mr Green and Mr Zimmer are taking their company public they will still retain control following in a long tradition of founderled technology businesses The two own special holdings that give them nearly  percent of voting shares despite owning less than  percent of the overall stockLyft also plans to give cash bonuses to drivers who have completed a large number of rides for the company so that they can buy shares at the IPO price Drivers with  rides will receive  which at the  price would allow them to buy  shares before taxes Drivers who have finished  rides will receive Only fulltime drivers who have been with the platform for several years are likely to make the cut said Harry Campbell an Uber and Lyft driver who runs the driver blog and resource site The Rideshare GuyIt was the right thing to do he said of Lyfts cash bonuses for drivers If you gave  rides for Lyft you actually were a big part of helping build this company He added that the IPO was kind of exciting to be part of for driversUnlike Lyfts employees and early investors who are restricted by a lockup period from selling their shares drivers will be able to sell any Lyft stock purchased through the cash bonus program as soon as the company begins trading on the public market according to an email sent to qualifying drivers and reviewed by The New York TimesBut the cash bonuses ultimately did not satisfy many drivers who work as freelancers for Lyft and Uber and do not receive fulltime employee benefits This week hundreds of them protested in San Francisco and Los Angeles against lower pay ratesIf political will starts to shift against Uber and Lyft thats a scary proposition Mr Campbell saidFollow Michael J de

reality for millions on Friday when Lyft began trading on the public markets signaling the start of a stream of stock offerings expected from highprofile technology companies this yearLyfts shares rose  percent in its first day of trading after opening at  far above the public offering price of  By the end of the day the ridehailing firms market value stood at  billion making it one of the most valuable American companies to go public in the last decade At that level it was more than  times the valuation of the parent company of Hertz the rental car provider and bigger than the parent of United AirlinesLyfts public market debut formalized the rise of the sharing economy even though persistent questions remain about the effect of gigtype work on peoples quality of life and their wages When ridehailing companies like Lyft and Uber began growing this decade they hawked their kind of work  where drivers are freelancers who drive only when they want to  as providing flexibility But with drivers ineligible to receive employee benefits like health care the businesses have since prompted lawsuits and labor protestsGig economy companies also have not proved a business fundamental that they can make money While Lyft and Uber have been expanding rapidly they have lost close to or more than  billion a year And the companies are spending heavily on new initiatives like food delivery electric bikes and selfdriving vehicles making profits a distant prospectUnicorns are riding into the public markets and their elite early investors will be the biggest winnersEven so Lyfts offering means that people will now own shares of the company in their mutual funds and stock portfolios giving them more of a vested interest in the financial outcomes of gig economy firms That will be compounded when Uber the worlds biggest ridehailing operator goes public in the next few months in what is expected to be the largest initial public offering of the past five years Uber will almost certainly become part of index funds which underlie the retirement portfolios of millions of AmericansTheir business model is completely reliant on an unsettled issue which is the status of their drivers Veena Dubal an employment and labor law professor at the University of Californias Hastings College of the Law said of ridehailing companies Theyve been trying to shift risk onto workers and now they are shifting risk onto investors as wellThose risks sent jitters through some investors on Friday with Lyfts shares falling after opening up strongly The stock dipped to roughly  before

tech startups are preparing to go public and the IPOs promise to generate big paydays for employees and investorsInterest in buying Lyfts stock was so high that demand outstripped supply within the first two days of the companys road show to pitch prospective investors this month By the end the IPO was  times oversubscribed Lyft told investors on FridayLyfts high listing price and performance are a reflection of the appetite from investors said Tom White a senior vice president at D A Davidson a wealth and asset management firm Right now I think investors generally are focused on growthWith its initial offering Lyft leapt ahead of Uber to become the first publicly traded ridehailing firm Logan Green and John Zimmer Lyfts founders celebrated the event on Friday in Los Angeles where pink confetti rained down them as they marked the occasion The pair had founded Zimride a longdistance carpooling service for college students in  Zimride evolved into Lyft which initially used the gimmick of fuzzy bubblegumcolored mustaches to distinguish its serviceMr Green  who grew up in Santa Monica and has cited heavy traffic in the area as an inspiration for Lyft and Mr Zimmer  used the IPO to announce a program called Lyft City Works The program will donate  million to transportation initiatives in cities where it operatesMr Green said he planned to further expand Lyft into other modes of transportation including public transitWe want Lyft to be the first app that you open up he said The biggest investments were making today are broadening the portfolio of products that you can access within LyftThe offering increased Mr Greens and Mr Zimmers wealth while allowing them to maintain tight control over their company The pair hold a special class of shares that give them extra voting power a practice common among tech founders but criticized by investor advocatesDuring the nearly twoweek road show Lyft pitched itself to institutional investors as a missiondriven company focused on reshaping the transportation industry It emphasized its dogooder stance on encouraging carpooling and reducing the environmental impacts of individual car ownershipInvestors most frequent question during the road show was what the company would look like in five years Mr Zimmer said Investors realized that ridesharing is the tip of the iceberg he saidUsing independent contractors to provide services has indubitably become the keystone of a generation of tech companies from ridehailing apps to food delivery services like DoorDash to hair and makeup services like Glamsquad Some researchers said contingent work could account for  percent of the American work force by next year though the Department of Labor has reported that the number of workers in gig roles has remained mostly flat since I think its quite clear that this is part of a larger trend in the economy said Sean Aggarwal Lyfts chairman That makes it an exciting story for the longterm investor It gives them an opportunity to participate not just in this gig economy transformation but also in this larger trend of transportation as a serviceMr White of D A Davidson said the good will toward Lyft

on Twitter kateconger and mdelamercedKate Conger reported from San Francisco and Michael J de la Merced from LondonOpinionAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Noam ScheiberIts one of the most vexing challenges facing the labor movement how to wield influence in an era increasingly dominated by technology giants that are often resistant to unionsAre workers best served when unions take an adversarial stance toward such companies Or should labor groups seek cooperation with employers even if the resulting deals do little to advance labors broader goalsThe debate has flared up around labors efforts to make inroads with the likes of Uber and Airbnb businesses that allow drivers and homeowners to earn income as contractors And it was on vivid display in the political battle over Amazons plan to create a new headquarters in New York with  jobsThe plan fell apart in the face of a backlash over public subsidies resentment of the covert process in which the city and the state negotiated the deal and concern about its neighborhood impact But labor issues were also a factor giving rise to tensions even among unionsIn the more confrontational camp were labor groups led by the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union which called on the city and the state to withhold nearly  billion in subsidies unless Amazon established a fair process for its warehouse workers in the city to unionize The retail workers said they were open to negotiating what that meantI think we stood on principle said Stuart Appelbaum the retail workers president If youre aggressively antiunion we shouldnt be giving you subsidiesA company executive told the City Council last month that Amazon would not remain neutral in an organizing campaign at its local facilities though an Amazon spokesman said this week We respect the rights of our employees to choose to join or not join a unionIn the engagement camp was the local council of building trade unions whose members were likely to get work from the construction of Amazons headquarters in Queens They were joined by a Service Employees International Union local which had gained the right to represent janitors and other service workers at the Queens complexRead more How New York City became a tech town without leaning on big techTheir presence in New York  a progressive community a union town  was eventually going to lead to some potential change down the road said Hctor J Figueroa the president of the service employees local known as BJIn terms of economic political and cultural impact the finance industry dominates But tech is gaining fast and is where much of the growth isIn some respects these arguments go back decades Thomas Kochan a management professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology noted that the United Automobile Workers and General Motors negotiated a new arrangement when the company set up its Saturn division in the mids In exchange for a role in managerial duties the union agreed to forgo many of the work rules typical in other plants such as those governing which worker could do what job The arrangement stoked tensions within the union and the company for yearsBut in recent years the growing reach of tech conglomerates has created urgency within labor to court their workers Mr Kochan saidDespite their minimal presence in these companies unions have a variety of levers to pull They can exert influence through politicians when public subsidies are involved as in the Amazon case And they can pressure regulators to scrutinize businesses that upend traditional industries like transportation and hospitalityWhether to use these levers to force concessions or to take a less adversarial approach that would give labor a foothold in big tech has divided the labor movementIn  Uber reached a fiveyear agreement with a regional branch of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers to create a drivers guild which would advocate on behalf of drivers but not challenge their status as independent contractors The Machinists would also have to refrain from turning the guild into a formal union during that time In exchange Uber agreed to provide the organization with funding and a way to communicate directly with drivers The guild says a majority of its revenue comes from other sourcesA rival group representing professional drivers criticized the Machinists for creating a socalled company union  federal law prohibits unions that companies fund or control though the law applies only to workers who are employees Some union officials complained that the guild was antidemocratic since drivers hadnt elected Machinists officials to represent themBut Sharon Block a senior Labor Department official under President Barack Obama argued that the deal was defensible Ms Block pointed out that the guild had taken something of a hybrid approach between cooperation and antagonism lobbying for policies such as a minimum earnings standard for drivers and allowing passengers to tip both of which have been enacted in New YorkThere are situations in which taking the half loaf can be worthwhile Ms Block saidAround the same time the Service Employees International Union was completing a deal with Airbnb in which the company would connect hosts who needed their homes cleaned with unionized workers an approach that the two sides were already testing in New York and Los AngelesThe agreement collapsed after a prominent hospitality workers union Unite Here protested that the deal would merely provide political cover to Airbnb which the union accuses of destroying goodpaying hotel jobs and creating housing shortagesThe unions president D Taylor said that Unite Here was always open to working with employers but that unions typically lacked the clout to cut good deals when they wandered into an industry where their presence was weakYoure settling a contract that has lower standards than the dominant union in that industry could get because you dont have leverage Mr Taylor saidThe service workers union declined to commentGiven the number of people Amazon employs  more than  in the United States not including seasonal workers  and its influence over numerous industries the proposed New York headquarters arguably represented the highest stakes yet for a test of these competing approachesSome experts said a deal allowing a union to represent buildingservice workers at the proposed Amazon complex could have been valuableThey have the opportunity to show the people who work there at all levels that unionization is good said Catherine Fisk an expert on labor law at the University of California Berkeley That its a way to equitably allocate wages that there is an orderly process for dealing with sexual harassment allegations with issues about absenteeism  whatever the company is concerned aboutBut others were skeptical that allowing janitorial workers to unionize would have any benefit for the companys broader work force in New York much less anywhere else in the countryThe problem said Ruth Milkman a sociologist at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York is that servicing buildings is just too far removed from what most Amazon workers do Many companies have unionized buildingservice workers but are otherwise unionfree she saidLike those companies Amazon seemed intent on drawing the line at service workers It walked away from discussions with labor about a framework that could have made it easier to organize employees who perform core functions like packing goods at the companys fulfillment centersThe question is whether Amazon can sustain this hard line indefinitely If it can progressives and labor activists may have contributed to the loss of  jobs and billions in future tax revenue without winning any tangible benefits for workersBut there is reason to believe that Amazon may have to bargain with labor in New York at some point and that unions and other progressive groups will have established an important principle when that happensAfter all many of Amazons facilities are not like automobile plants or call centers in that the company can easily plunk them down anywhere Amazon tends to locate warehouses reasonably close to customers of whom there are potentially millions in the New York area It has sought to put its whitecollar hubs in areas with many highskilled workers a practice that also favors cities like New YorkIn its statement about the demise of the Queens plan the company noted that there are currently over  Amazon employees in Brooklyn Manhattan and Staten Island and we plan to continue growing these teamsAnd that logic is likely to apply to a variety of tech companies that seek customers and workers in liberal hubsYou dont have huge numbers of highly educated people who they need who want to move to small cities in Arkansas Professor Fisk said I think California and New York and a lot of other places may have more leverage to insist on the highroad approachFollow Noam Scheiber on Twitter noamscheiberAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBitsBy Jamie CondliffeHi Im Jamie Condliffe Greetings from London Heres a look at the weeks tech newsMachines are more than ever controlled by software not humans Occasionally it goes fatally wrongOn March   people died when an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing  Max  jet crashed Five months earlier another crash of the same model of airplane killed  people There are indications that software intended to prevent the jets from stalling may have played a role in both accidentsReporting by The New York Times suggests that the software didnt receive a detailed review by the Federal Aviation Administration before it entered use Under new rules the agency delegated much of the responsibility to Boeing If the software was at fault and the problem did slip through the regulatory net it raises questions about how safetycritical technology is vettedThose questions will become more important over the next few yearsA year ago an Arizona woman was struck and killed by one of Ubers autonomous cars The vehicles autonomy systems failed to brake as did the safety driver behind the wheelCompanies like Uber and Waymo along with most of the auto industry expect autonomous cars to proliferate over the next decade Such advances arent limited to cars  they will further automate everything from air travel to food delivery They are built on technologies like artificial intelligence that will make splitsecond decisions for humansThe Boeing software was designed to perform a simple task Nudge the airplanes nose down based on sensor readings if a stall was anticipated As harder tasks are handed to software the stakes riseAs you create more advanced AI systems the harm that can result from them failing can be really large said Jade Leung a researcher at Oxford Universitys Center for the Governance of Artificial IntelligenceBut increasing the complexity of systems makes checking them more difficult Hardware from chips to special sensors can be difficult to test And it can be difficult for humans to understand how some AI algorithms make decisionsMs Leung said regulators needed to be more aware of tailend risks  the highly unlikely but catastrophic events that could occur if something malfunctioned That might mean introducing more conservative rules that relax as technology matures ideally developed in tandem with technologists who understand deeply how the systems workVerifying the performance and safety of software is a really really hard technical challenge Ms Leung said Nonetheless its a challenge that has to be addressedWhen a company spends billions on worldleading digital infrastructure it naturally wants to wring every last cent of revenue out of it Thats partly what is driving Googles new Stadia gaming service announced on TuesdayGoogles pitch is straightforward Think of it as Netflix

offering discounts to riders ahead of its offering and the company warned We believe that much of the growth in our rider base and the number of drivers on our platform is attributable to our paid marketing initiatives Lyft only operates in the US and Canada unlike Uber which has operations across the globe But it has matched its rivals innovation by developing selfdriving car technology and expanding into shortterm bike and scooter rentalsLyft will list its shares on the Nasdaq under the ticker of er LYFTThe company expects to be valued at as much as  billion It plans to sell about  million shares including the additional shares allotted to the underwriters at between  to  a piece At the highend of that range it will raise  billionThats well above the  billion that private investors valued it at during a financing round in JuneAnd it would make it one of the largest IPOs in the past  years At a  billion valuation Lyfts offering would rank as the fifth largest since the

will have two classes of stock class A shares which carry one vote each and class B shares which carry  votes Lyft plans to sell only class A shares in the offeringLyfts two founders will hold the Class B shares That means that Mr Green the CEO and Mr Zimmer the president will own roughly  percent of the companys outstanding stock but control nearly  percent of its voting sharesThis is quite normal in Silicon Valley Facebook and Google went public with a dualclass structure that gave outside shareholders one vote per share and insiders  votes per share Snap went further It issued only nonvoting shares during its  IPOBut the practice is increasingly controversial among governance experts Kenneth Bertsch the executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors said in a letter to Lyfts outside board members The principle of oneshare onevote is a foundation of good corporate governance and equitable treatment of investorsCompanies with dualclass stock structures outperformed those with a single stock structure in recent years according to some studies But prior to  studies show such companies didnt perform as wellLyft is growing quickly Its revenue more than doubled to  billion last year from Its losses are also increasing though not nearly as quickly The company reported a loss of  million last year up from  million in  Total costs and expenses were  billion in  up  percent from  billion in  Ubers losses are smaller in percentage terms Lyfts rival which has disclosed its finances for several years even though it is not public said in February that

increasingly regulated It warns investors that it has been subject to intense regulatory pressure from state and municipal regulatory authorities across the United States and Canada and a number of them have imposed limitations on or attempted to ban ride sharingLabor Lyfts millionplus drivers are independent contractors not employees Legal actions that classify them as employees could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the company saysAutonomous driving Among the biggest risks involved in the push to driverless cars is getting beaten in the race The first companies to offer autonomous ride sharing are expected to have longterm advantages compared with traditional nonautonomous ride sharing offerings Lyft saysFor Lyfts current shareholders and employees the IPO could provide a windfall Heres a rundown of who stands to gain Mr Green and Mr Zimmer will hold stakes in the company that are set to be worth  million and  million respectively The Japanese ecommerce giant Rakuten is Lyfts biggest shareholder with a  percent stake At  a share its holdings would be valued at  billion It will own  percent of Lyfts stock after the

writes That makes it difficult for potential investors to feel confident that theyre paying the right price given the potential reward and the potential risk that the ondemand ride business isnt financially viable or as large as optimists believeLyfts investors will need to strap themselves in for what may be long periods of rather ugly numbers according to Heard on the Streets Dan Gallagher Thats because decacorns tend to share two characteristics plenty of money and a propensity to spend it in a race to build up shareInvestors may still want to decide between Lyft and Uber argues Richard Beales of Breakingviews If their fear of missing out allows them to look past the absence of foreseeable profit at either company though its hard to see any sensible course other than to put

employees Noam Scheiber of the NYT writes In December a Texas regulator proposed that companies using a digital network to dispatch workers as Uber does with car drivers could label them contractors rather than employees Thats a big deal for gigeconomy companies who want to designate workers as contractors to avoid paying unemployment insurance and overtime saving billions This month it came to light that Tusk Ventures a venturecapital and politicalstrategy firm appears to have been the primary author of the Texas proposal Tusk was retained by the ondemand cleaning and repairs company Handy and is run by Bradley Tusk once a top political consultant for Uber and a large shareholder who could make millions when the company goes public Tusk has also pursued similar efforts in other states like Illinois Worker advocacy groups say the goal is to chip away at classification rules in enough places to create pressure for a broad exemption nationally Mr Scheiber writesLast year Michael Avenatti became a celebrity for representing Stormy Daniels the adult film star in her fight against President Trump Yesterday he was arrested for what prosecutors said was an attempted shakedown of NikeMr Avenatti threatened the sports giant saying he would release evidence showing that its employees had given money to college recruits  unless he and an unnamed client were paid at least  million prosecutors saidThe company will die  not die but they are going to incur cut after cut after cut after cut and thats whats going to happen as soon as this thing becomes public Mr Avenatti told Nike

yesterdayBritains lawmakers grabbed control of the nations departure from the EU yesterday in a move that highlights the struggles of Prime Minister Theresa May Stephen Castle of the NYT reportsParliament gave itself power to vote on alternative Brexit plans Its attempt to take control of the process came as Mrs May prepared for a lastditch effort to persuade lawmakers to support her withdrawal plan which has already been rejected twice by huge margins Mr Castle writesIt will hold a series of votes tomorrow on alternatives to Mrs Mays plan These could include a socalled soft Brexit that would keep Britain tied into European economic structures a second referendum revoking Brexit completely or leaving without any deal Mr Castle explainsMrs May said she could not commit to honoring the outcome of any of these nonbinding parliamentary votes particularly if they contradicted the proBrexit stance in the Conservative Partys manifesto for the  general electionBut the situation challenges Britains political traditions where the government normally controls the agenda in Parliament and could create a constitutional showdown according to Mr CastleThe ridehailing giant said this morning that it will acquire Careem its main competitor in the region for  billion Kate Conger of the NYT reportsThe deal comes ahead of Ubers IPO and could give a boost to the companys financial prospects in the region by eliminating a rival It also gives Uber immediate access to several markets where it doesnt currently operate including Iraq Morocco and PalestineThe deal represents a change in strategy since Uber has largely sought to form joint ventures with international rivals like Didi Chuxing of China and Yandex of RussiaBut it could raise privacy concerns Ms Conger writes Careem will keep operating under its own name but will eventually share some features with Uber Though Uber has declined to share user data with the Egyptian government Careem was more

RooseAmazons surprise announcement on Thursday that it was canceling its planned expansion to a new corporate campus in New York was greeted with celebration by local activists and politicians who had opposed the deal and frustration by local officials  and more than a few real estate agents in Queens  who had eagerly anticipated an influx of wellcompensated tech workersFor some Amazons decision will represent a political failure in which officials and local labor leaders blew a onceinadecade chance to bring thousands of highpaying jobs to New YorkFor others it reflects the hubris of one of the worlds most valuable companies which sought billions of dollars in tax incentives it didnt need and then got cold feet when local organizers and officials objected to that largessBut more than anything the battle poses a challenge to one of Amazons bedrock beliefs that being loved by customers is all that mattersBy any measure Amazon is one of the most popular companies in the world It consistently ranks atop lists of Americans favorite brands and its obsessive focus on customer satisfaction has created a generation of consumers who cant imagine shopping anywhere elseAmazon is also overwhelmingly popular in New York where polls have consistently shown that a majority of city residents supported the companys planned Queens expansionBut happy customers dont necessarily translate to political powerRead more on Amazons decision to pull its planned New York headquartersAmazon acted as though its popularity  and its early support from key politicians including Gov Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio  would clear a path to political concessions But the company miscalculated the power of local organizers who turned what might have been a straightforward construction project into an allout political brawl Amazon was caught flatfooted by the opposition and belatedly mounted a charm campaign taking out fullpage newspaper ads and sending mailers to Queens residents in support of the dealIn the end confronted with a choice between fighting and fleeing Amazon packed its bagsThis is a case of significant political malpractice more than anything else said Bradley Tusk a venture capitalist and former campaign manager for Mayor Michael BloombergMr Tusk who now acts as a fixer for technology companies looking to break into regulated markets said that Amazons response to local opposition was a tonedeaf misstepAmazon did not understand the local politics on the ground at all he said They just took Cuomos word for it that everyone would be supportiveAmazon which says it still plans to expand in Northern Virginia and Nashville as originally planned blamed a small but vocal minority for sabotaging the dealWhile polls show that  percent of New Yorkers support our plans and investment a number of state and local politicians have made it clear that they oppose our presence and will not work with us to build the type of relationships that are required to go forward with the project the company said in a statementLocal business leaders echoed that criticismNew Yorkers wanted Amazon to come The people who live in Queens wanted Amazon to come said Julie Samuels the executive director of TechNYC a nonprofit organization that represents the citys tech industry A handful of politicians got in the wayMeanwhile Mr de Blasio characterized Amazon as a thinskinned weakling saying in a statement that you have to be tough to make it in New York CityThis fight echoed the political drama surrounding two other tech companies that had difficulty breaking into city politics Uber and Airbnb which faced early political opposition despite broad popularity with customersSeveral years ago in response to a regulatory crackdown that threatened to crush its business model Uber built a political war machine hiring armies of lobbyists and political consultants  including Mr Tusk  to make its case to officials across the country It enlisted users too putting customized icons inside their Uber apps and urging them to petition City Hall for a reprieve Airbnb used the same tactics mobilizing its users in the cities where it faced restrictive regulationsAmazon certainly knows how to fight Last year it successfully lobbied to kill a proposed business tax in Seattle that would have raised about  million a year for affordable housing and other programsIt could have mounted a similar campaign in New York Or it could have taken a page out of the Uber and Airbnb playbook urging Amazon Prime members in New York to contact their representatives and agitate for a dealInstead the company did its lobbying in private preferring backroom negotiations to a noisy publicfacing campaignThey failed to appreciate that this market was different than the others Mr Tusk saidThey didnt do their homeworkFor Uber and Airbnb of course the stakes of political success were existential Amazons size and market dominance have given it the ability to walk away from even a multibilliondollar deal relatively painlessly New Yorkers will still buy their toilet paper and dog food from Amazon even if the company doesnt have an office in Long Island CitySome New Yorkers who supported Amazons expansion plans may consider the companys retreat proof of the shortsightedness of politiciansI hope there will be real lessons learned here Ms Samuels of TechNYC said They were playing with fire and look what happenedBut this should be a teachable moment for Amazon tooFor years the company succeeded wildly by catering to shoppers and betting  mostly correctly  that its sterling customer reputation would insulate it from criticism over its labor practices antiunion resistance and other corporate shortcomingsBut that era may be over In New York at least there are some problems that low prices and twoday shipping cant fixAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy The Associated PressNEW YORK  Paul Buijs had logged more than  Citi Bike

Street  and its straightforward Given concerns about privacy security and fraud when it comes to money no bank is allowed to take on a new customer without verifying its existence and vetting its background What if social media companies had to verify their users the same way banks do Youd probably feel more confident that you were interacting with real people and were not just a target for malicious bots When I broached the idea of applying a know your customer principle to their business several senior executives at social media companies recoiled at the prospect questioning how they would pull off such a huge feat especially in emerging markets where many people lack credit cards and even fixed street addresses But theres precedent NextDoor the social network focused on local communities requires users to submit a credit card or phone number which it checks against databases A know your customer rule could become more important as social networks like Facebook become fully encrypted Fake users could easily spread misinformation and be harder to stop in an encrypted world  unless there was a way to verify their identities at the outsetMore Facebook says it is expanding

than  hours before Britains scheduled departure the EU last night extended the exit deadline until Oct  Stephen Castle and Steven Erlanger of the NYT writeIt took nine hours for European leaders to agree on the delay The sixmonth extension is more than the three months that the British prime minister Theresa May had asked for  and that President Emmanuel Macron of France had pushed for  but shorter than the year that some EU leaders favoredThe delay gives Britain time to get its ducks in a row The European Council president Donald Tusk urged the UK Please do not waste this time Mrs May

increase public revenuesMentioning Netflix as one example Herrera said there so far was no international agreement on how to tax digital services given that their servers may be based in countries such as the United States but there are customers in other parts of the worldHowever Herrera said there was international agreement that countries should be able to levy interim taxes on such

appetite for fastgrowing highly valued startups that are burning cashMany of the worlds most prominent tech startups are about to find out Lyft has already listed Uber will head to market in May and Slack and Postmates are expected to follow soonThe next test comes this week with Pinterest The digital pin board company plans to sell shares to investors and make its public market debut in the coming daysThis is a slightly different breed of unicorn Pinterest is burning less cash than some of the other big names going public this year like Lyft and Uber And it expects to price its IPO below its last private market valuation Lyft has struggled since its market debut last month Its shares are trading  percent below the offering priceSo is that a Lyft thing or a tech IPO thing If Pinterest can avoid a Lyftstyle early wave of selling it may ease concerns for the companies expected to follow Heres your cheat sheet for the offeringTodays DealBook Briefing was written by Stephen Grocer in

a lowkey approach rejecting Silicon Valleys typical unicorn formula of moving fast breaking things and chasing growth at all costsThat has spared it the controversies about disinformation and harmful content that have engulfed peers like Instagram Facebook YouTube and TwitterBut it has grown steadily over the last two years particularly as people outside the United States have begun to gravitate

company in  and If Pinterest does go public below its last private market valuation it would not be the first highly valued startup to do so recently Box a cloud storage company and Square a payments

lost  million in  That put it far closer to making a profit than the previous year when it lost  millionWhile it is unprofitable its losses are far lower than those of other wellknown startups like

the company will have two classes of stock class A shares which carry one vote each and class B shares which carry  votes Pinterests founders top executives employees big investors and directors will be given class B shares new investors will get class A sharesThe holders of the class B stock will have  percent of the voting power after the IPO Pinterests three founders will control about  percent of the voting power Bessemer Venture Partners will have the most control of any single investor with  percent of the voting power Pinterest acknowledges in its IPO prospectus that this will limit investors ability to influence itSuch share structures have grown in popularity in Silicon Valley Lyft also went public with a dualclass share structure its two founders now own roughly  percent of the stock but control of nearly  percent of the voting power Facebook Google and Snap have all famously used dualclass structures tooBut the practice is increasingly controversial among governance

upandcoming generation is looking very differentBy Erin GriffithSAN FRANCISCO  Technology startups worth  billion once as rare as unicorns are now plentiful enough and old enough that theres a new generation behind them  one that looks very differentSilicon Valleys current crop of highly valued tech startups which include nowhousehold names like Uber and Airbnb all benefited from the spread of smartphones and cheap cloud computing Many of these companies built global empires by simply taking existing businesses  like taxis food delivery and hotels  and making them mobile Some of the startups became giants Uber for instance may reach a  billion valuation this yearBut as those companies have matured and prepare to go public the easy opportunities for disrupting oldline industries are drying up Now many of the upandcoming startups that may become the next unicorns have names like Benchling and Blend And they largely focus on software for specific industries like farms banks and life sciences companies Thats according to an analysis for The New York Times by CB Insights a firm that tracks venture capital and startups CB Insights used a variety of data  including financial health and the strength and size of the market a company serves  to identify  startups that may be on a path to achieving a  billion valuation though there is no guarantee they will get there Software startups may seem boring But many of them are growing fast because industries like agriculture require more software tools as they adapt to the tech era said Jason Green an investor at Emergence a venture capital firm that invests in cloud software companiesA list of  startups that may be the next billiondollar unicornsMaybe its not as sexy as the companies in the first wave said Kirsten Green a venture capitalist at Forerunner Ventures A lot of those industries are big giant industries that we need in our lives and in business and they need to be modernizedOther potential unicorns such as Checkr and Earnin are building businesses off the last generation of unicorns by offering services to them CB Insights also pinpointed three startups that are popular with millennial women  Glossier Zola and Faire  as unicorn candidatesSome of these companies may reach the  billion threshold quickly as unicorn startups are created more quickly than ever said Anand Sanwal chief executive of CB

Benchling His goal To solve some of the personal frustrations he had with the outdated technology tools that he used in the molecular biology labs of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology when he was a studentBenchling based in San Francisco began providing software that allows lab scientists to replace their paper notebooks with searchable records stored in the cloud That way scientists could more easily use the records to collaborate with one another Mr Wickramasekara figured Younger researchers were also increasingly asking for such toolsSoftware has touched a lot of different sectors of the economy but it has not kept up in the field of science said Kaiser MullaFeroze Benchlings chief marketing officer Today  scientists use Benchlings software including academics at Harvard and MIT who use a free version and paying customers like Pfizer and Regeneron Benchling charges smaller companies  a year while large customers who use more advanced features pay millions of dollars a year Mr MullaFeroze said Benchling has raised nearly  million in funding Last year the startup tripled its revenue and number of customers Mr MullaFeroze saidThe company is representative of a new class of software startups as different industries adopt more technology Mr Green the venture capitalist said its become clear that software aimed at niche sectors offers larger opportunities than previously expected Health care automotive retail consumer packaged goods advanced manufacturing companies  theyre all trying to figure out how technology helps reduce costs or how technology is going to help them build their next business model said Mr Sanwal of CB InsightsOther fastgrowing startups that fit this description include Farmers Business Network which was founded in  by Charles Baron a former Google program manager and Amol Deshpande a serial entrepreneur and venture capitalist The company charges farmers  a year to share and analyze data about their farms buy supplies and sell crops Mr Baron said the startup counts  farms as customers and has raised nearly  million in funding A company like Farmers Business Network wouldnt have been possible  years ago before the proliferation of cloud computing and the digitization of farming processes Mr Baron added Now farms produce a lot of data which Farmers Business Network is helping them to process and use to make decisions Agriculture

Rhodes who founded Faire in  said millennial women are driving a resurgence of local boutiques These shoppers dont want to drive out to the strip mall and buy the most stuff thats made as cheaply as possible he said They want unique products that have a story behind them The rise of companies like Uber and Airbnb has created its own minieconomy of startups One of those is Checkr which was founded in  by Daniel Yanisse and Jonathan Perichon who worked as software engineers at Deliv a delivery startup Both had become frustrated at the slowmoving background checks for the delivery drivers they wanted to hire for Deliv so they created their own business to expedite the processNow Checkr works with Uber Lyft and Instacart It has also added other types of customers like the insurance company

sales have peaked forcing the idling of some factories And the economic slowdown in China has sent car sales plummeting But in announcing its withdrawal from Western Europe Infiniti said it intended to focus on its SUV in North America and its new models in China Against this backdrop the uncertainty surrounding Britains departure from the European Union has made it difficult for companies to plan ahead Several car companies have said they will close their factories temporarily after the country leaves the bloc in order to adjust to the disruptions that could arise The fear is that Brexit

Editing by Arun KoyyurAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byThe policy could change not just traffic but also how we think about the infrastructure cars requireBy Emily BadgerCongestion pricing has the potential to significantly change how traffic flows through Manhattan streets how commuters get around the city how companies like Uber and Lyft operateBut most radically if the policy spreads it could challenge a deeply embedded cultural idea requiring people to pay for something Americans have long demanded  and largely believe theyve gotten  free of charge The idea of the open road evokes these intertwined meanings The freedom to use it should be free Residential street parking should be free Traffic lanes should be free Stretches of public curb dedicated to private driveways Those should be free tooIn other ways the government has heavily subsidized driving or hidden the reality of who pays for it in places no one sees Local laws require offstreet parking from businesses and housing developers who pass on the construction cost of it to tenants and customers who may not drive at allFederal and state governments fund roads with gas taxes that feel far removed from a direct user fee and that have come to operate like less and less of one in an era of fuel efficiencyThey add up to a pretty giant system of subsidies said Michael Manville a professor of urban planning at the University of California Los Angeles But they dont look like what we often consider subsidiesThis system looks to us instead like an entitlement  driving is an American right and so the infrastructure that enables it should be freeCongestion pricing is premised instead on the notion that public roads are a valuable and scarce resource And we should pay in some places to use it not primarily to gin up revenue but to help manage access for everyoneIts a huge departure from how weve culturally thought about this over the years said Kari Watkins a professor at Georgia Techs School of Civil and Environmental EngineeringIn reality the government is a monopoly provider of road space and the government has largely chosen to give it away Its no surprise then that the vast majority of American commuters drive to work alone or that all those lonely commuters plus taxis Ubers buses and delivery trucks cause congestionWhen the government holds down the price of something people value Mr Manville said we get shortages And congestion is effectively a shortage of road  one that occurs at the peak times when people want to use it mostIf we had that problem with other kinds of infrastructure or commodities wed charge people more for them If airline tickets were particularly in demand their prices would go up If there were a run on avocados grocers wouldnt respond by keeping them as cheap as possible The roads hold such a special position in our brain that we use logic around them that we would never use around everything else Mr Manville saidOther countries have socialized health care parental leave or housing Jeffrey Tumlin a transportation consultant at NelsonNygaard pointed out In America weve socialized driving  and housing for our carsWe dont let people put their selfstorage containers in public parks but its just fine to store their cars on other public land for free Mr Tumlin wrote in an email Peter Norton a historian at the University of Virginia traces this thinking to the s and s when industry groups and government officials were debating whether to fund Americas expanding roads with tolls which were by then common on bridges Road builders were happy to have tolls and they appeared in places like the Pennsylvania Turnpike But auto clubs and car manufacturers dependent on car sales opposed them They preferred a gas tax a cost less visible to drivers every time they got in a car Together they were remarkably savvy about branding the choice as one between toll roads and free roads A  federal report even adopted that phrase as its titleOf course theres no such thing as a free road Mr Norton said But they were making the ambiguous association between their cause and the great cause of freedomIndustry publications at the time linked the need for free roads to patriotism the Bill of Rights even the Minutemen Today because most people seldom pay directly for roads  or because general funds do  it can seem as if no one doesTherefore the street transportation system has no cost said Yonah Freemark a doctoral student in city planning at MIT who runs the blog The Transport Politic And therefore we can just expect to have unlimited parking we can expect to have unlimited access to neighborhoods for whatever reason for freeTake those expectations to their logical conclusion in a major city today and you get mileperhour road speeds rampant double parking clogged intersections and worsening commute times You get finally the political will for congestion pricingNow the culture of limitless cheap driving may begin to shift in some places But it will take much longer to change the physical environment that has grown up around that culture over decades leaving many people without good alternatives to driving aloneWhere there are few other choices like reliable bus routes congestion pricing risks burdening poorer drivers in particular But that is a problem weve thought about before too Mr Manville said if were now willing to treat roads as we do other infrastructure He pointed to lifeline utility services subsidized rates for electricity and gas offered to users with fewer resourcesFortunately congestion pricing comes with its own builtin solution he said which is that it raises a ton of moneyEmily Badger writes about cities and urban policy for The Upshot from the Washington bureau Shes

herd of technology public offerings this year and next year is set to anoint venture capital winners Here are some of themBy Erin GriffithBrian Chesky chief executive of Airbnb likes to tell the story of his early struggles to fund his homesharing startup Many venture capitalists refused to meet with him he said in an email Some walked out in the middle of meetings That changed after venture firms such as Sequoia Capital Andreessen Horowitz and Founders Fund decided to gamble on Airbnbs potential to shake up the vacation rentals business Three investors at those firms  Alfred Lin of Sequoia Jeff Jordan at Andreessen Horowitz and Brian Singerman of Founders Fund  are now among the top players in the venture capital industry according to an annual ranking compiled for The New York Times by CB Insights which tracks the startup industry Airbnb privately valued at  billion landed more venture investors at the top of the list than any other companyIn his email Mr Chesky said Mr Lin Mr Jordan and Mr Singerman have a founders mindset and share our longterm visionAirbnb is expected to go public sometime in the next year following a bumper crop of initial public offerings that began on Friday with the ridehailing company Lyft Uber Pinterest Slack and others are also expected to list their shares in the next few months These offerings will likely mint many venture capital winners generating huge returns for those who wrote the early checks to these companies Heres a look at some of the venture investors who may reap the IPO rewardsWhen Uber goes public Mr Lin may feel a sting Thats because he made a small personal investment in the ridehailing company when it was very young but turned down numerous chances to invest on behalf of Sequoia as Uber grew into a behemoth We just didnt dream with the entrepreneurs said Mr Lin  who joined Sequoia in  Sometimes we just make the wrong callHe may have other opportunities to celebrate Mr Lin and Sequoia invested early in Airbnb DoorDash a food delivery startup valued at  billion and Houzz a home design and remodeling startup worth  billionSequoia wrote Airbnb a  check in  and invested in each of the companys later funding rounds Mr Lin said he was impressed by how the Airbnb founders could articulate a dream of the world that is very different from what exists todayYet sometimes those lofty dreams clashed with reality As Airbnb grew Mr Chesky said he wanted to hire executives from Apple and Disney companies he admired for their creativity design and simple product linesMr Lin a former executive at Amazonowned Zappos said he had gently suggested that Airbnb emulate businesses that looked more like itself ones with complex operations in many different places and a wide array of inventory like Airbnbs millions of home listings To help make the point Mr Lin introduced Mr Chesky to Jeff Wilke the head of Amazons retail business in  That meeting persuaded Mr Chesky to shift his focus Airbnb ended up poaching top Amazon executives to become its chief financial officer and head of its homes businessPart of our job is to help with the sparring of ideas Mr Lin saidWith the IPO stampede now on he said he is cautioning companies not to rush to go public because their peers are doing so These things are milestones to some degree that you celebrate he said But soon after you go public you have to go back to running your businessWhats next Mr Lin said he and his team were looking at everything from robotics and artificial intelligence to payments and shortform videoMarc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz the founders of Andreessen Horowitz have long been fixtures in the top rankings of venture capital investors thanks to investments in companies like Lyft Mr Jordan their partner has recently outdone themMr Jordan  got behind companies such as Pinterest the digital pin board which recently filed its prospectus for going public He also bet on Instacart the grocery delivery company worth  billion and Lime a scooter startup valued at  billion In  Mr Jordan also led Andreessen Horowitzs  million investment in Airbnb He has said the companys marketplace model of matching travelers with home providers reminded him of the early days of eBay where he was an executive for five years When Airbnb experienced a hiccup in   a hosts home was trashed by a guest  Mr Jordan helped the company with a new insurance program Airbnb Guarantee which was modeled after one at eBay Mr Jordan who also led OpenTable before joining Andreessen Horowitz in  said part of his investment success was due to the firms wide range of services for startups including recruiting public relations and business development It was once unusual for venture firms to to provide those services though they have become more common Apoorva Mehta founder and chief executive of Instacart said Mr Jordan often provided corporate development advice and introductions to potential retail partners Jeff has always felt like an extension of our team Mr Mehta said Mr Jordan who declined to comment on the current wave of IPOs said he was looking for the next platform which could be voice or augmented reality and virtual reality Founders Fund does not offer a suite of services to its startups Thats in keeping with the contrarian philosophy of its founder Peter ThielWere not operating the company Mr Singerman a partner at the firm said of the reason for not providing additional services He added that he also eschewed the typical venture capital practice of investing in companies based on a specific strategy or thesis That is not me he said Im actually open to anything All of this helps explain why Mr Singerman a yearold former Google engineer has backed companies as diverse as a health insurance startup a payments company a cancer drug maker and a seller of cheap novelty gifts And of course AirbnbWhen Founders Fund helped fund Airbnb in  its international growth had begun taking off We had never seen an international network effect like they had Mr Singerman said He said Mr Chesky also had a strong sense of what his customers wanted and kind of wills things into existence Mr Singerman who joined Founders Fund in  said his biggest challenge was finding the right companies and persuading the founders to let him invest To source deals he relies on a broad network of contacts which led him to Stemcentrx a cancer drug company that was sold to AbbVie in  for  billion and RigUp an online job platform for energy industry workersTheres one area in which Mr Singerman is like other venture capitalists his professed nonchalance toward IPOs Founders Fund tends to hold stock in its investments for a very very long time so a companys public offering doesnt impact us he said In  Mr Singerman invested in a company called Long Term Stock Exchange Founded by Eric Ries the author of the startup bible The Lean Startup the company wants to open a new stock exchange for young companies that are

WIRED and Fortune  eringriffith AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Kate CongerSAN FRANCISCO  The escooter boom began in Santa Monica Calif about  months ago Electric scooters owned by startups looking to mimic the success of ridehailing companies like Uber appeared around town The idea was simple Use a smartphone app to rent a scooter and then leave it at the end of the ride for the next personSoon people in cities from San Francisco to Paris were complaining that the scooters were all over sidewalks  usually without the approval of local officialsIn Portland Ore city officials worried that they would soon get their own flock of uninvited scooters So they established a fourmonth pilot program in July with a limit on scooters and a requirement that companies share detailed data about trips and injuries with city officialsThat data released Tuesday by the citys Bureau of Transportation offers the most detailed analysis of the impact of escooters on a city Scooters often replaced short car trips in Portland offering some support for one of the biggest selling points the companies have made to communities They can help reduce congestion and pollution And the scooters did not lead to as many injuries as some had fearedBut it is not yet clear if scooter companies can comply with different cities tight and varying limits and still run profitable local operations The programs often cap the number of scooters and dictate which neighborhoods they ought to be inThat is not letting the market determine how many scooters should be anywhere said Gabriel Scheer Limes director of strategic development How do you unfetter us in a way that allows us to meet demandStill Portland officials are using the pilot program to make a big point with startups It is better to ask permission and work with local regulators than risk being run out of a communityThat has not always been the case among startups trying to get a piece of the socalled sharing economy Ridehailing companies like Uber and Lyft and the shortterm rental company Airbnb have usually jumped into new markets before local regulators have had time to understand their businessesFor the scooter startups not asking for permission has had consequences After Lime and Bird began to operate without permission in San Francisco the city instituted a permit system  but issued permits to only Skip and another smaller competitor Scoot effectively locking Lime and Bird out of the city Some cities have simply impounded the scootersA lot of these companies roll into town flout local regulations see what they can get away with and how far they can push cities to accommodate them said Chloe Eudaly a Portland city commissioner I feel like there is somewhat of a reversal of that trend among these companies and they are learning thats not necessarily the best way to do businessOther cities are establishing permit programs to limit the impact of unexpected scooter invasions Washington for example said in November that companies could deploy no more than  scooters each which Bird argued would make it impossible to provide full serviceBird Lime and Skip received permits to operate in Portland They handed over a wealth of data about scooter rides giving city regulators access to information about where each trip started the route it followed where it ended and what time of day it occurred Personal information on riders such as payment data was not sharedPortland capped the number of scooters at about  roughly divided among the three companies Mr Scheer from Lime said the cap system made it difficult to determine how many scooters a city actually neededBut he added that the limits forced scooter companies to hone their operations offer scooters with smoother rides and ensure they were deployed in neighborhoods where they could draw the most riders And the caps forced the startups to compete on how well they could comply with the citys mandates rather than playing a numbers gameWe dont think this is a landgrab type of business This is one where you have to solve problems in a sustainable way said Sanjay Dastoor the chief executive of Skip Having more vehicles on the road isnt going to help if there arent places where people can ride them and feel safeThe data that Portland collected allowed the city to assess whether escooters live up to their promises of reducing pollution and congestion According to a citywide survey  percent of residents who used the scooters and took a survey said they had used escooters to replace driving their own car or taking an UberCity officials also had concerns about accessibility and safety but saw low rates of injury and will continue to study those issues during a second test runSome rules were meant to get the scooters into neighborhoods that could be underserved One hundred scooters from each company had to be positioned in East Portland a lowerincome neighborhood with poor access to Portlands public transit system About  percent of the citys rides originated in that neighborhoodScooter startups didnt always comply with restrictions according to the report The scooters often exceeded the speed limit of  miles an hour that the city had imposed and none of the startups completely fulfilled their obligations to deploy scooters in East PortlandOver the fourmonth program Portlanders took  scooter rides Nineteen percent of those rides occurred between  and  pm on weekdays But it was a small sample size compared with other cities In Paris which has no scooter cap Lime alone provided more than a million rides over four monthsWhen the Portland pilot effort ended in November all of the escooters were cleared off the streets The city is planning a second yearlong pilot program in the spring but has not decided how many scooters it will allow a spokesman saidIt seemed like a little bit of carnival on our streets for a while but I think they definitely have potential to make our

immediate access to goods and services surged  percent in  from the previous year to an estimated  billion according to a study by Rockbridge Associates a market research firmAs the industry swells dozens of health and wellness companies are tapping the trendHeal DispatchHealth MedZed Dose Healthcare and Pager will send a doctor or a nurse practitioner to a persons home or workplace to treat nonemergency problems like strep throat or a sprained ankle The IV Doc offers intravenous treatments for conditions like jet lag hangovers and food poisoning And Capsule will deliver prescriptions to a persons doorstepPeople want convenience said Josh York founder of GymGuyz a gym on wheels that sends a trainer and fitness equipment to customers homes You could get your pizza delivered but you couldnt get your workout delivered and I thought This is where the future is goingGymGuyz and other startups like the IV Doc were bootstrapped by the founders friends and family But some  especially ondemand medical companies like Heal and DispatchHealth  needed substantial cash to hire doctors lease vehicles and bring in administrative staff to handle insurance claimsCue the investors many of whom are hunting for the next billiondollar opportunitySamir M Patel a principal and cofounder of IRA Capital was so impressed with Heal after using it for athome visits and an annual physical in his office that he became an investorTo us this feels like were investing in Uber in  Mr Patel said This is going to revolutionize and change the entire health care industryUber a pioneer in the ondemand economy could be worth as much as  billion as it prepares for an initial public offering this yearHeal has raised  million from such investors as the former Qualcomm executive chairman Paul Jacobs Tull Investment Group and the singer Lionel Richie while DispatchHealth has raised  million from such investors as Questa Capital and Alta PartnersBut the potential to be the next unicorn  a startup valued at  billion or more  has created a crowded fieldThe popularity of the IV Doc prompted a flurry of smaller companies like IVDrips Drip Hydration and the Hangover ClubNutriDrip to offer similar services  sometimes at cheaper prices To fend off competition the IV Doc recently expanded to offer injectable drugs like Botox and Restylane as well as postoperative care for plastic surgeryLarge tech companies are seeking a bigger share of the more than  trillion spent annually on health care in the United States Amazon which has been making an aggressive push into health care announced last year that it would buy PillPack an online service that organizes and delivers prescription medications Apple and Alphabet Googles parent company have also made significant acquisitions as they accelerate their efforts on new technologies for doctors patients and consumersHealth care is a  trillion industry  who wouldnt want a piece of that said Jeff Becker a senior analyst and health care IT expert at ForresterBut startups are facing challenges on their path to financial viability Because mobility brings extra liability one of the biggest roadblocks is insurance for themselves Problems can crop up on the road like traffic accidents or in a customers home like an equipment malfunction Or perhaps a doctor lacking sufficient equipment makes an incorrect diagnosis These headaches can make it difficult for startups to find proper protectionDr Adam Nadelson the founder of the IV Doc approached five insurers in  before finally finding one to sign onIt was a mixture of them not understanding what we were doing and then some gave us a price that was just outrageous he saidMr York of GymGuyz had more than  meetings over six months to get an insurer before starting his company in It was very very hard I had to really paint the vision and meet with a lot of people because the business was so different Mr York said The doors were shut on me so hard that my nose was hurtingInsurance not only protects the company business owners say it also covers employees who take a risk entering a private residenceWe have walked into a house and somebody had a gun or walked into a yard where theres a pit bull said Dr Mark Prather chief executive and cofounder of DispatchHealth Both DispatchHealth and Heal always send two people to house calls for safety and efficiencyGetting their customers health care insurers on board is equally critical and providers are slowly coming aroundOwners who offer medical care contend that their business model will save insurers money because people will seek medical attention sooner if its fast easy and affordable and does not require monthlong waits for an appointment or long waits in a doctors office And they say early detection and treatment could prevent a problem from morphing into a debilitating illness that later requires an emergency room visit or hospitalization Visits to the ER can cost  to  Dr Prather saidEntrepreneurs point out another benefit Their doctors and nurses can identify health triggers in a patients homeA Los Angeles man who had called for a Heal doctor complained of migraine headaches recalled Nick Desai a cofounder of Heal The man had been to eight doctors had three MRI scans and had tried multiple medications When the Heal doctor arrived he noticed black moldSo the patient hired a cleaning person to clean the black mold  and his migraine headaches were gone Mr Desai saidInsurers are beginning to add ondemand services to their plans and even forming managed care partnerships with startups to visit people at home with chronic conditions like hypertension and diabetes Anthem Health Net Blue Shield Aetna CareFirst United Healthcare Cigna and Medicare are among the insurers that cover Heal visits in many of their PPO plans Mr Desai saidAs their businesses expand owners must navigate complex health care regulations which can vary from state to stateEvery state acts as their own country with their own kooky laws and understanding those rules and regulations costs an obscene amount of money in legal fees to understand how to operate ones business Dr Nadelson saidBefore Amazon bought PillPack it tried to enter the world of prescription drugs with a deal to acquire a stake in Drugstorecom But it ran into regulatory challenges and the effort was derailed Amazon found a solution in PillPack which has pharmacy licenses in  states and relationships with the major pharmacy benefit managers and insurersDespite the barriers experts believe ondemand health services are here to stayThis has the potential to be lifealtering said Dr Griffin Myers a cofounder and the chief medical officer at Oak Street Health a network of primary care practices for people

Quart is the author of Squeezed Why Our Families Cant Afford AmericaAn attractive woman behind the wheel of a gray car says to the camera These days anyone can have a side hustle She then whisks off to the gym for her other job as a personal trainer beaming as she goes from one gig to another This ad for the rideshare company Uber seeks to entice new drivers to join their ranks by using the side hustle comeon The company isnt alone Similarly laborious side hustles are celebrated in popular media and advertising from selfhelp articles and other web content that exhort us to say work for a design studio parttime or sell CBD oil great as a side hustle for moms supposedly Even pastors can use a side hustle according to one evangelical blogger During tax season you will also find filing suggestions for side hustlers Report all of your income Deduct expensesThe truth is working multiple gigs creates complications when you do your taxes Compared with those with salaried jobs who pay their taxes seamlessly through withholding for side hustlers the process will be a lot messier according to Steven Dean the faculty director of the Graduate Tax Program at New York University Law School You have to estimate and pay taxes on your own he notes and your expenses may not be reimbursed by your employer In other words paying quarterly tax estimates gives workers with side hustles yet another side hustle  being their own accountant although this gig doesnt even payNevertheless this nouveau moonlighting continues to be exalted as cool empowering or freeing This mantra is false Side hustles are not simply a new version of working as a wage slave so that we can do what we love in our off hours Instead far more often people take on second or third side hustles because of wage stagnation or low pay at their fulltime jobs Over the past few years I have interviewed dozens of people who work a fulltime job or close to it  teachers professors administrators and nurses among others  and supplement their incomes by driving for Lyft or serving as a barista They are not doing it for the glamour They need these second jobs because their first jobs dont cover astronomically rising rents record health care costs or swelling college tuition A full  percent of Americans do something else for pay in addition to their fulltime jobs according to an NPRMarist survey last yearYet this sales pitch for the side hustle takes what we once called more drably another job and gives it a gloss with a tiny shot of Superfly disguising unstable working hours and a lack of bargaining power as liberation You can see the twisted alchemy of what Reddits founder Alexis Ohanian has called hustle pornCommercial websites like Side Hustle Nation extol the joy of the new unstable labor although its payoff actually arrives for only a few As Nick Loper the sites chief side hustler writes My escape route was a side hustle business I built in my spare time  and you can do it too Medium has a whole Side Hustle publication It bears the legend Youre more than your day jobThis language tries to make the dreary carousel of contemporary life sound more fun The phrase the side hustle has gained a strange kind of prestige from downwardly mobile collegeeducated tech workers said John Patrick Leary the author of Keywords The New Language of Capitalism a sharp recent book on this troubling new lingo Its glitz and energy derives from a hiphop genealogy although the side hustles namechecked in that genre are perhaps not the same as those imagined by UberThe side hustle is one of a growing roster of trendy corporatized idioms like ordinary household appliances that are now smart or plain vanilla businessmen and women remade into the more exotic entrepreneurs Our jobs are now flexible although we are the ones contorting ourselves to work at all hours or we are professionally nimble because we are trying to survive on freelance gigs Ultimately like so much of this lexicon the side hustle describes the overworked outsiders to privilege who are forced into informal vocations by the absence of a legitimate economy They are then told that suffering is valiant and also groovy In a recent viral BuzzFeed piece describing millennials as the burnout generation side hustles are listed as one of the main culpritsThere are some surprising benefits to side hustles The  tax reform introduced the qualified business income deduction which provides side hustling workers with a rate reduction But some people may not understand it and this small benefit doesnt make up for an uncertain work life So what can we do For starters anyone writing about work whether as a journalist or as a social media exhibitionist should stop glorifying long hours at work or juggling multiple workplace identities Instead we could be more open about what all these side hustles are really doing to our minds and bodiesAs workers we might acknowledge that side hustle is an insidious term and resolve never to use it again More broadly we must fight other forms of this falsifying new jargon and seek out more truthful language We could follow Raymond Williams the cultural theorist who once wrote that we should interrogate the language of contemporary society and change as we find it necessary to change it as we go on making our own language and history Most important we can agitate to raise wages If we do that we wont need cute euphemisms to cloak the chaotic truth of working life in todays AmericaAlissa Quart executive director of the Economic Hardship Reporting Project

desire to wield sweeping power President Abdel Fattah elSisi of Egypt has suppressed politics cowed the media and jailed legions of opponentsNow he is extending his iron grip to a new corner of Egyptian society the countrys cherished soap operasEvery year during the holy month of Ramadan Egyptians crowd around their televisions to gorge on bigbudget miniseries starring the countrys top actors including weepy melodramas police procedurals and sweeping historical epics The best are exported across the Middle EastBut the crop of shows currently in production for Ramadan are being subjected to suffocating controls Mr elSisis officials are dictating scripts and capping wages directors and actors say A militarylinked production company has taken charge of some of the biggest showsFilmmakers have been told their stories should follow approved themes like praising the army and the police or vilifying the banned Muslim Brotherhood Those who dont play by the rules dont get on the airFor Sisi this is not just about politics or power said Ezzedine Choukri Fishere a writer and former diplomat whose novels have been adopted into TV serials He wants to reeducate the Egyptian publicThe soap opera clampdown is the cultural edge of a farreaching and intrusive brand of authoritarianism that has taken root in Egypt under Mr elSisi reaching new levels even for a country that has been governed by militarybacked strongmen for decadesHosni Mubarak who governed for  years until his ouster in the  Arab Spring also presided over an oppressive often cruel system Even so he allowed space for other centers of power like his political party and the senior judiciary which could result in surprising actions Now and then judges issued rulings that discomfited him Newspapers could criticize him to a point In  the opposition Muslim Brotherhood won a fifth of the seats in ParliamentThat space limited as it was has been virtually shut down under Mr elSisi who came to power in a  military takeover He governs through a small clique of advisers mostly drawn from the military the security services and his family that enjoys huge economic clout sees the world through a security prism and has sought to stamp out every breath of dissent Egyptians can be arrested for politically incorrect Facebook postsI would frankly feel safer talking politics in Damascus than in Cairo said Yezid Sayigh a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut Mr elSisis personalist autocracy he continued tries to dominate the public space so completely that nobody dares say anything even in private that might be deemed dissent by those in powerThat fear is what all totalitarian systems try to instill that even when the system cannot eavesdrop on you it can hear youA government spokesman did not respond to a request for commentMr elSisis approach has met with little resistance from President Trump who is scheduled to host him at the White House next week Where Washington once was a modest brake on the excesses of Egypts strongmen Mr Trump has lavished praise on Mr elSisi in previous encounters  even complimenting his taste in footwear  but has said little about the tightening vise of repression in EgyptThe United States has not had an ambassador in Cairo since July Mr elSisis governing circle is dominated by military men he trusts The armys Engineering Authority has been charged with overseeing ambitious projects worth billions of dollars including an extension of the Suez Canal that was completed in  and a new administrative capital that is under construction in the desert east of CairoMilitary courts operate with little public oversight prosecuting actors and political opponents as well as terrorism suspects Mr elSisis intelligence agencies quietly manipulate the workings of Parliament which is currently debating sweeping constitutional changes that would extend Mr elSisis term until  and could also bring the senior judiciary directly under his authority a power Mr Mubarak never hadTelevision talk shows once a ferment of raucous debate have become so predictably progovernment that many Egyptians are tuning out The foreign ministry once a bastion of Egypts proud diplomatic tradition is viewed as a much reduced forceSisi is not Kim Jong Un or Saddam Hussein said Amy Hawthorne of the Project on Middle East Democracy in Washington But hes inching Egypt toward that kind of regimeThe hand of the security agencies also extends deep into the economy often blurring the line between national security and commerceAs the ridesharing company Uber has expanded in Egypt it has faced government demands to provide access to personal information about its customers In February as the security agencies stepped up those demands the Uber app started to crash in Egypt said an official with knowledge of talks between Uber and the Egyptian governmentBut it is in his pursuit of culture and the arts that Mr elSisi has really stood outLast month the celebrated author Alaa alAswany who wrote The Yacoubian Building said a secret military court had prosecuted him for inciting hatred against the regime  a prosecution all the more striking because Mr alAswany was once an avowed elSisi supporterIn January Amr Waked an actor who starred in the Hollywood movie Syriana said in a Twitter post that he had been sentenced to eight years in prison for criticizing Mr elSisi Last week the Egypts Actors Union expelled Mr Waked who lives in Europe and another prominent actor for high treason after they attended a congressional briefing in Washington that examined Mr elSisis plans to amend the ConstitutionThen there are the soapsMr elSisi first weighed in on them in  with a speech in which he praised the positive principles of older stateproduced TV shows and criticized recent productions In the following years state officials started to press filmmakers through both censorship and quiet pressureThis season though the meddling has created an industry crisis by several accountsWith Ramadan just a month away the number of miniseries currently under production has been cut in half to about  or  one director saidThe Egyptian Media Group a company with links to the General Intelligence Service has established the dominant TV production company and bought several of the biggest TV networks according to Mada Masr one of the last independent news outlets left in EgyptA senior director speaking on the condition of anonymity said scriptwriters were ordered this winter to follow certain guidelines to glorify the military to attack the Muslim Brotherhood and to promote conservative family values that encourage young Egyptians to obey their elders  and presumably avoid the kind of questioning that led to the  Arab Spring the director saidThe directive is a sign of another major difference between Mr elSisi and Mr Mubarak said Mr Ezzidine the analyst who lives in the United StatesWhile Mr Mubarak often seemed content to simply manage Egypts dysfunction Mr Sisi appears intent on reshaping the countrys moral and intellectual fiber He has lectured citizens on their manners and their physical fitness Now he wants to purge what he views as dangerous currents of thoughtMr elSisis defenders say Egypt needs a strong leader to protect the country from the chaos that has engulfed Libya Syria and Yemen and to enact long overdue yet unpopular harsh economic reforms like recent cuts to fuel and electricity subsidies Egypts stability has contributed to a  percent increase in tourism in the past year and the energy sector is booming after major gas discoveries in the MediterraneanEven so many Egyptians are straining under the combination of austerity and repression The day after a train barreled into Cairos main station in February killing at least  people a man named Ahmed Mohy walked into the middle of Tahrir Square scene of the  protests with a sign that read Step down SisiMr Mohy  a pharmacist was outraged by the train crash which he saw as a sign of mismanagement of basic services He hoped to attract more protesters But he was arrested within minutes and bundled into a police van alongside a friend who had filmed his solo protestIn the back of the van Mr Mohy recorded an impassioned sometimes tearful video message that was posted on Facebook He would probably be tortured for speaking out he said but he insisted it had been worth itMaybe they will inject us maybe they will kill us maybe they will burn us said Mr Mohy whose Facebook page is filled with his poetry But we are facing our destiny as menWith tens of thousands of opponents already in jail such acts of public resistance are rare and Mr elSisis authority faces few obvious challenges for nowMr elSisis view is that his strength comes from divine providenceIn a  interview he told a journalist that a voice had come to him in a dream and said We will grant you what no one has had beforeBut some analysts warn that in seeking to exert such tight control over the Egyptian state and society Mr elSisi might be sowing the seeds of his eventual undoingPresiding over such a topheavy system that has alienated so many sectors of society could leave Mr elSisi vulnerable on the day his system inevitably faces an unforeseen shock said Mr Sayigh the senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East CenterSisi and the army have painted themselves into a corner by destroying anyone they could talk to Mr Sayigh said When the day comes where they need others in government or business they may have nobody to support

culture and cheap labor Now the market is slowing competition is rising and the Trump administration wants limitsBy Keith Bradsher and Ailin TangCHONGQING China  For Detroit China once meant opportunity The countrys growing ranks of drivers bought cars by the millions Its cheap labor gave American automakers dreams of someday exporting their Chinesemade cars to the United States The Big Three bet billions of dollars thereNow Chinas place in the world is shifting and that bet is starting to sourChinese consumers are buying fewer cars as the countrys economy slows Local competitors have raised their game Many young people would rather use ridesharing services similar to Uber than own vehicles themselvesAnd if the Trump administrations trade hawks have their way China wont make many cars for Americans As Washington and Beijing haggle over a deal to end their trade war the hawks are defending tariffs imposed by President Trump last year that would make it expensive to sell Chinesemade cars  including those with American brands  in the United StatesChinas slowdown presents the most immediate problem Some of Detroits Chinese factories have slowed to a crawl In the inland metropolis of Chongqing where Ford builds cars like the compact Focus three big assembly plants have been running at less than onefifth of capacity Fords joint venture in Chongqing has quietly begun dismissing thousands of its  workersSeven Zhou a yearold worker who assembled transmissions lost his job last month His paychecks had already shrunk by twothirds because he was working fewer hours He quit smoking to pay for food and rent and the family is struggling to pay for the afterschool English and math lessons his son needs for a chance at collegeI do not have much education Mr Zhou said I had hoped my child would not be like me the bottom level of laborAs China transforms many global businesses are struggling to adapt Chinas economy has matured and can no longer match the skyhigh growth rates of its gogo years The Chinese government is trying to cope with all the debt accumulated to pay for that growth Initiatives that could juice the economy have slowed The rest of the world has begun to fundamentally rethink its dependence on China to make much of what the world consumes Some within the Trump administration see China as an existential threat to core American industries like autos much as it has come to dominate production of solar panels steel and aluminum There have long been doubts among automakers and consumers about whether cars made in China could measure up to those produced in America But with the gap in quality narrowing companies in China and the United States have begun to explore the possibilityGeneral Motors which began exporting the Buick Envision from China to the United States in  has been pleading since last summer without success for the Trump administration to exempt it from a  percent tariff imposed on Chinesemade cars Ford announced in the summer of  that it would move Focus production to China from Michigan only to cancel those plans as the political landscape changed in the United States Exports from China to the United States of Detroitbrand cars are a nofly zone said Michael Dunne the chief executive of ZoZo Go an automotive consulting firm in San Diego Its just too politically sensitiveDetroits fortunes in China could still improve A final trade deal could leave the door open to Chinese exports The Chinese government could take steps to rev up domestic growth or empower its consumers to buy cars A stronger economy will lead to stronger auto sales said Irene Shen a General Motors spokeswomanBut for now Detroits Big Three are struggling in China  particularly FordBusiness from Detroit has helped China become both the worlds largest maker and its largest buyer of cars Much of the global auto parts industry has moved there as well making it especially convenient to manufacture cars in China Drawn by the countrys rapid development and consumer revolution GM invested about  billion It now makes and sells more cars through its Chinese joint ventures than it does in the United States Ford which came later invested as much as  billion Chinas carbuilding capacity is now roughly equal to those of North America and Europe combined More car factories are being built to meet regulators demands for more electric carsBut a slowing economy and an end to tax breaks for car buyers have brought the industry back to earth In January car sales in China fell  percent from a year earlier The average car factory in China already operating at a little more than half capacity has slowed even more amid the sales slump according to LMC Automotive a consulting firmAmerican brands are also being squeezed The Chinese elite still prefer premium German brands like Mercedes BMW and Audi More frugal families buy cheaper Chinese and Japanese cars and are increasingly buying usedThe ridehailing business has dealt automakers an unexpected blow The global auto industry has worried for years that companies like Uber and Lyft could eat into demand particularly among young customers That appears to have happened in China experts say where dense urban cities have enhanced the appeal of Didi Chuxing the Chinese ridehailing giant Didi now carries twice as many riders in China each year as Uber carries in the rest of the world combinedNone of the multinational automakers foresaw how disruptive that would be to demand said Bill Russo a former chief executive of Chryslers operations in ChinaYoung people in China are also more open to Chinese brands thanks in part to their improved quality Theyre a lot more favorably disposed towards Chinese brands and they have a pride in the Chinese brands said Nigel Harris the president of Fords main joint venture in China Changan FordThis winter has been difficult for American brands in China Sales of GMs Chevrolet and Buick models have faltered though Cadillacs continue to sell well and Chryslers Jeeps face stiff competition from cheaper sport utility vehicles made by Chinese companies After a dismal autumn Ford sold  percent fewer cars in China in January than it did in the same month a year earlierThe automakers are tweaking their lineups to improve sales GM and Ford are ramping up production of their respective Cadillac and Lincoln

automakers more apparent than in Chongqing an often foggy city built on steep slopes overlooking the confluence of two broad muddy rivers the Yangtze and the Jialing When a local hiring hall held an automotivethemed day last week it was mobbed with former Ford employees who had accepted severance payments and were looking for their next jobs The company has changed from running factories on up to

on Friday to antitrust claims made by the music streaming service Spotify saying its policies are fair and accusing its rival of being motivated by a need to bolster financial resultsSpotify filed a complaint with European regulators this week accusing Apple of using its App Store to undercut companies that compete with its own services like Apple MusicIn a statement published on its website Apple said that Spotify was not treated any differently from the millions of other developers that use the App StoreApple accused Spotify of trying to use the advantages of the App Store which provides access to millions of Apple users without having to pay fees that Apple says are necessary to keep the marketplace thriving Apple charges a fee of up to  percent for anything sold through the App StoreSpotify is asking to keep all those benefits while also retaining  percent of the revenue Apple said Spotify wouldnt be the business they are today without the App Store ecosystem but now theyre leveraging their scale to avoid contributing to maintaining that ecosystem for the next generation of app entrepreneursThe dispute highlights a larger debate about the role of large tech

well over   to drive into the busiest neighborhoods from th Street in Midtown all the way to the BatteryThe fees are part of a groundbreaking congestion pricing plan in the new  billion New York State budget which Gov Andrew M Cuomo and lawmakers agreed upon early Sunday morningNew York will become the first American city to charge such fees though congestion pricing has been in place for years in London Stockholm and Singapore among other communities The fees are expected to raise billions of dollars to fix the citys troubled subway system and thin out streets that have become strangled by trafficThe new fees will be imposed on vehicles that enter Manhattan below th StreetCongestion fees are not expected to start until  and no actual fee amounts have been decided A plan proposed by Gov Andrew M Cuomo would establish a panel of experts who would set the fees The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority which is part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority would collect the feesSamuel I Schwartz a traffic expert known as Gridlock Sam says drivers will probably pay  to  for cars and around  for trucks entering the city during peak business and traffic hours and less at night and on weekends Mr Schwartz was on a state task force on congestion pricing that last year recommended fees of  for cars and  for trucksHis estimates are based on state leaders goal to raise  billion annually from congestion fees which would then be used to secure bonds totaling  billion for repairs and improvements to public transitDrivers who already use tolled tunnels or the Henry Hudson Bridge from the Bronx to Manhattan would receive a credit toward the congestion fees Drivers crossing the Brooklyn Bridge and headed directly north on the FDR Drive past th Street would not be chargedState legislators are considering several possible exemptions for drivers who are low income have disabilities or are going to medical appointments Assemblyman David I Weprin a Democrat from Queens and a leading opponent of congestion pricing has called for an exemption for all city residents which seems unlikelyThough details are being worked out fees are expected to apply to people driving into the congestion zone from elsewhere in the city including parts of Manhattan north of th Street and other boroughs as well as beyondDrivers who live in the congestion zone would not pay when they drive within the zone or when they leave the zone but they will when they return from elsewhereOf course that could change if an exemption or discount is granted to residents of the congestion zone For instance London offers a  percent discount for registered residents of its congestion zoneBut more exemptions could mean higher tolls for everyone elseAfter all the fees are supposed to generate  billion a year Every exemption you provide is less revenue coming into the system said Kate Slevin a senior vice president for the Regional Plan Association a research and advocacy group that supports congestion pricingAlex Matthiessen the head of a grassroots campaign to support congestion pricing said too many exemptions could hollow out the plan making it ineffective Now we must guard against a race to the bottom as legislators seek carveouts and exemptions for every class of driverInstead he suggested taking other measures such as offering discounts on commuter railroads for city residents and subsidizing rideapp services like Uber for those with disabilities to ensure more people benefit from congestion pricingThe new fees will be charged through an electronic tolling system most likely expanding upon existing EZPass technology used for cashless tolling at the citys bridges and tunnelsDrivers entering the designated congestion zone would be automatically charged fees through EZPass tags in their cars If they did not have a tag a camera would snap a picture of the license plate to bill the driver laterAll the technology is proven its used in New York today said Bruce Schaller a former city transportation official who directed the development of a plan to bring congestion pricing to the city more than a decade ago under the mayor at the time Michael R Bloomberg It will work the same way as we had plannedOne of the biggest challenges Mr Schaller said will be finding places to mount all the EZPass readers and cameras so that they are not visually intrusive Gantries might have to be installed over wide avenues Interstate agreements might also be needed so the city could track down drivers with outofstate license platesLondon Stockholm and Singapore have been held up as international models for congestion pricing In each city the fees were greeted with skepticism and anger from many commuters and civic and business leaders But the fees later proved effective in reducing traffic congestion and air pollutionWithin a year of the fees being charged in  the number of vehicles entering an eightsquaremile area of London dropped by  percent according to city officials Traffic delays went down  percent The average speed of vehicles in the zone rose to  miles per hour from  mphAir quality improved too with a  percent reduction in emissions of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter from vehicles in the zoneIn all three cities the fees have also raised millions for transportation and infrastructure including for new buses bikes lanes and other public transit services to accommodate drivers who leave their cars at homeBut still many drivers have complained especially as the fees have gone up over time  more than doubling in London from when the fees were first institutedAnd one important reminder is that even with congestion pricing traffic problems do not simply go away Londons gridlock has returned in recent years in part because of an influx of Uber and other rideapp carsSubway riders stand to see more reliable service and fewer headaches with hefty new investment in the transit system Those riding commuter trains and buses outside Manhattan should also benefit from extra spendingFewer cars will also mean cleaner air more room for cyclists and less fraught crossings for pedestriansEven drivers could get something out of it with Mr Schwartz pointing out that they will no longer be trapped in as much trafficIt will cost them the toll charge he said But it will save them the cost of gas and timeAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Erin GriffithSAN FRANCISCO  Pinterest is preparing for its debut on Wall Street with a claim that few other unicorn startups can make It is not a financial sinkholeWhile the company is unprofitable according to an offering prospectus made public on Friday its losses are nowhere near as high as those of other wellknown startups like Uber and Lyft which are also getting ready to list their shares That makes Pinterest  which lets people create digital pin boards  one of the rarer unicorns a term applied to startups valued at more than  billion by private market investorsThe deep losses afflicting many highprofile startups have cast investor doubts on the herd of companies that are stampeding toward the public market Lyft recently revealed that it lost  million last year Uber previously disclosed that it lost  million in the fourth quarter of  alone PagerDuty a software startup valued at  billion that also filed to go public this week said in its prospectus that it was losing money Only Zoom a video conferencing company last valued at  billion showed that it was making money in an offering prospectus it filed on FridayPinterests filing reported that the company had lost  million in  But that was much narrower than a year earlier when it lost  millionAt the same time Pinterest is growing quickly The companys revenue which came from advertising totaled  million last year up  percent from a year earlier It listed a cash stockpile of  millionPinterest also said in the filing that it had  million monthly active users in the fourth quarter of  compared with  million in the fourth quarter of  Its number of users has grown steadily over the last two years particularly as people outside the United States have begun to gravitate to its serviceIn its prospectus Pinterest called itself a productivity tool for planning your dreams The San Francisco company emphasized the visual imagedriven nature of its product as well as its ability to capture peoples intent to buy things related to their pins It said its mission was to bring everyone the inspiration to create a life they loveThe document provides the first detailed look at Pinterests balance sheet The company confidentially filed to go public in February with Goldman Sachs J P Morgan and Allen  Company underwriting the offering It plans to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol PINSThe filing did not say how much money Pinterest hopes to raise in the offering and did not specify potential share prices Private market investors who have poured around  billion into the company last valued it at  billion Its largest shareholders include Bessemer Venture Partners FirstMark Capital Andreessen Horowitz Fidelity Investments and Valiant Capital Management according to the filingIn a move that has become common among tech firms Pinterest plans to divide its stock into two classes giving its founders top executives employees and directors  votes per share New investors will get one vote per shareBecause Pinterest makes money from online advertising it is a competitor to Facebook Instagram Amazon Google Twitter and Snap In its prospectus Pinterest listed those companies as competitors as well as Allrecipes a recipe website Houzz a homeimprovement website and Tastemade a cooking content companySome rivals are not increasing their revenue as quickly as Pinterest said Kathleen Smith a principal at Renaissance Capital a manager of exchangetraded funds for IPOsLike Snap Pinterest is in the cross hairs of Facebook and Facebook has always fought a nasty battle against Snap by copying everything it did she said adding that anyone evaluating Pinterests stock should consider that competitive threatPinterest was started in Silicon Valley by Ben Silbermann the companys chief executive Evan Sharp and Paul Sciarra Mr Silbermann  previously worked at Google Pinterest grew out of Cold Brew Labs a tech incubator founded by the three men in Although many unicorns made rapid growth their top priority Mr Silbermann favored what he calls quality growth That meant he tried to build Pinterest slowly and steadily even as its growth started to soar in  Pinners as users are known essentially used Pinterest to create collagelike mood boards that expressed their aspirationsToday pinners pin activities such as what they wear or what they are making for dinner as well as ideas for remodeling a home or their wedding or passions like bookmarking and other craft projectsMr Silbermann also deliberately took several years before turning Pinterest into a moneymaking enterprise In  the company began selling ads For a spell its growth appeared to be slowing and it lost executives until Mr Silbermann brought in a new chief operating officer Francoise Brougher and a new head of sales Jon Kaplan both formerly of GoogleUnlike many of its social media peers Pinterest has mostly avoided the proliferation of conspiracy theory and extremist content on its platform moving quickly to tamp down on such content when it has bubbled up In February Pinterest began removing search results for anything related to vaccines in an attempt to stop antivaccination memes from spreading across the siteIn contrast to many hardcharging and brash tech chief executives Mr Silbermann has kept a low profile He rarely sat for glossy magazine covers or showed up at tech industry conferences At one point Pinterest was called an antiunicorn because of how it shied from the spotlight The timing of the unveiling of its prospectus  late on a Friday afternoon  was also in keeping with Mr Silbermanns styleDespite Mr Silbermanns low profile the IPO is expected to generate lots of attention from investors and market observers Significant revenue growth and popularity among users is going to be a pretty good recipe for  at a minimum  creating significant buzz around an IPO said Barrett Daniels a partner at Deloitte who focuses on IPO advisory workMr Silbermann also avoided another trapping of tech founders with the prospectus He did not publish a founders letter on Friday to carry on about his companys mission and history something that had become de rigueur among other entrepreneursFollow Erin Griffith on Twitter eringriffithAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byThe

youd like to join me It involves industry disruption and crisis management with my own soulless twistThis is hightech stuff so let me define a few technical termsFirst by unicorns Im talking about fantastic beasts privately held companies worth at least a billion dollars Insert your joke here about who can catch a unicorn Unicorns like Lyft are sold to investors in  initial public offerings of stock also known as IPOs enabling insiders to make a ton of money The precise terminology for these lucky people is obscenely richAs always Ive been wondering How can I become even naughtily rich The trick is to find a business I can bootstrap to billionsDisrupting established industries seems to be the way to go Even children know that Lyft and Uber have disrupted taxi service and Airbnb has disrupted hotelsNow its my turn to make a fortune The crisis management business seems to be ripe for disruptionCrises are everywhere especially in the business world A company called Theranos failed so spectacularly that it has generated a bestselling book an HBO documentary and a big podcast Theranos claimed to have revolutionized blood tests It has been a disaster like the Fyre festival but with pricked fingersThen theres Boeing not to mention a number of current presidential campaigns You get the ideaCrisis managers are already in great demand but I intend to do something different Ill create crises then solve them leading to a staggeringly successful unicorn IPOLyft just had its IPO and may soon be followed by some of the biggest names in tech including Uber Airbnb and Slack the annoyingly ubiquitous program for sharing messages in the workplaceExciting right Hope you like roller coasters Lyfts shares dropped below their offering price by their second day of trading which means the stock price could use a  well you knowThe point with an IPO is to be an insider not a chump who gets fleeced by the insiders Lyfts founders employees and early backers are getting quite a payday Andreessen Horowitz the venture capital firm comes away with about  million in instant profit Carl C Icahn apparently made about  million according to The Wall Street Journal by selling his stake to George SorosThats the life for me mogul Ive been driving the same car for  years Its time to move up to something that extravagantly shows how much I love the planet Not a mere Tesla but the Jaguar electric EType Zero which costs about That kind of ride requires IPO money So fellow insider heres my planI formulated it with invaluable help from Eric Dezenhall He runs Dezenhall Resources which among other things does crisis management In an email I told him that my life is an unmanaged crisis so I need advice if I am to build a future in his fieldHis response was promising You do realize that the whole discipline is a farce dont you That convinced me that crisis management would be a good fitHe added All you need is a sport jacket and a clich such as Get ahead of the story a greatsounding phrase that has no meaningThis was getting better and better As a veteran journalist clichs are my mtier And as it happens I own a sport jacket There are some moth holes but Ive gotten pretty good at using a felttip pen to match the jacket color with the lining Mr Dezenhall was impressed by my inventive use of the felttip pen That in itself is crisis management he saidBut he cautioned that crisis management is no longer a matter of simply altering perceptions so that a bad situation looks like something good What people think were going to say is We didnt dump PCBs in the river were shampooing the fish and people will say Ooh thats good he said But no Thats old thinking he said His trade has evolvedInstead of just changing perceptions he said the great crisis managers provide operational solutions that address root causes That way he said a company can transcend the fickle and uncontrollable emotions that dominate the hour news cycles and waves of Twitter outrageSo he would not for example advise the chief executive of Boeing to go on a televised apology tour for  two recent crashes and the loss of hundreds of lives And in fact the companys public response has been notably muted These days he said such gestures are instantly deemed inadequate Instead he said its better to help companies actually fix their problems which will do more to vindicate them than any snappy patterThat sounded hardWhat youre saying I said sounds like it takes actual management ability I was beginning to despair And thats when the thunderbolt hit me I could work the other side of the market Crisis creationId ferret out dire problems and make them much worse Corporate executives already do that routinely of course I mean just look at the series of apologies from Mark Zuckerberg over  well almost everything But hotshot executives have been calling those problems mistakes Id call them my strategyMr Dezenhall ran with the idea He said I could get paid by short sellers or work directly with him to concoct scandals that expose companies to reputational crises which he  and I  would be paid handsomely to relieve Most of the time wed do nothing but wait for the situation to resolve itself and celebrate our successIdeally he said we would cause problems that look like random events and that dont besmirch the character of the company He pointed to a spate of

advocates have tried to capture the scope of the Bay Areas homelessness crisis  a problem that often feels unfathomable in its depth and complexityStill much of the discussion has centered on San Francisco or on the efforts of individual cities throughout the regionRead about a debate over a homeless services center proposed for a waterfront location in San FranciscoToday the Bay Area Council Economic Institute the thinktank arm of a business group is set to release a report that examines the issue through a regional lensOne of the things about the Bay Area is its a wonderful place but its very divided up Jim Wunderman the councils president and chief executive told me We have  cities in nine counties around this very large bay and theres no one city that dominates the landscapeBut that isnt how programs aimed at moving people into housing have been implemented he said even as more people in smaller suburbs find themselves in tenuous housing situations and more people live out of their cars which means theyre mobileThe group wanted to explore ways to scale up successful programs and boost coordination among communities To do that Mr Wunderman said the group needed to better understand what was at stakeThe report found Roughly  people were homeless across the Bay Area according to pointintime counts in  That was the third largest population in the country after New York  and Los Angeles  The next largest overall number was  in Seattle and King County But the Bay Area has a relatively large percentage of homeless people without shelter indicating theres a shortage of subsidized housing shortterm shelters and transitional housing That was  percent Thats compared with just  percent in New York and  percent in Seattle and King County Once again though Los Angeles had the largest percentage of unsheltered homeless people  percent The analysis found that spending on services for people experiencing homelessness or people who were at risk varied widely across the region Part of that stems from the fact that the costs to build vary widelyFor instance the report said building new permanently supportive housing costs  on average per unit in San Francisco County compared with  per unit on average in Solano CountyHowever Mr Wunderman said that particular finding shouldnt be taken as a sign that services housing and emergency shelter should be concentrated in the least expensive parts of the BayWere going to continue to need to develop programs locally he said I think this is a burden that has to be shouldered by everyoneMr Wunderman suggested one way to

Saturday morning in New York a few months ago a group of  startup founders gathered in the dank basement of a Lower East Side bar They scribbled notes at long tables sipping coffee and LaCroix while a stack of pizza boxes emanated the odor of hot garlic One by one they gave testimonials taking aim at something nearly sacred in the technology industry venture capitalJosh Haas the cofounder of Bubble a softwarewriting startup told the group that he and venture capitalists were pretty much totally on different wavelengths about the trajectory of his businessSeph Skerritt the founder of Proper Cloth a clothing company said that the hype around raising money was a trap They try to make you feel inferior if youre not playing that game he saidThe event had been organized by Frank Denbow  a fixture of New Yorks tech scene and the founder of Tshirt startup Inkaio to bring together startup founders who have begun to question the investment framework that has supercharged their field By encouraging companies to expand too quickly Mr Denbow said venture capital can make them accelerate straight into the groundThe VC business model on which much of the modern tech industry was built is simple Startups raise piles of money from investors and then use the cash to grow aggressively  faster than the competition faster than regulators faster than most normal businesses would consider sane Larger and larger rounds of funding followThe end goal is to sell or go public producing astonishing returns for early investors The setup has spawned household names like Facebook Google and Uber as well as hundreds of other socalled unicorn companies valued at more than  billionBut for every unicorn there are countless other startups that grew too fast burned through investors money and died  possibly unnecessarily Startup business plans are designed for the rosiest possible outcome and the money intensifies both successes and failures Social media is littered with tales of companies that withered under the pressure of hypergrowth were crushed by socalled toxic VCs or were forced to raise too much venture capital  something known as the foie gras effectNow a counter movement led by entrepreneurs who are jaded by the traditional playbook is rejecting that model While still a small part of the startup community these founders have become more vocal in the last year as they connect venture capitalists insatiable appetite for growth to the tech industrys myriad crisesWould Facebooks leadership have ignored warning signs of Russian election meddling or allowed its platform to incite racial violence if it hadnt in its early days prized moving fast and breaking things Would Uber have engaged in dubious regulatory and legal strategies if it hadnt prioritized expansion over all else Would the tech industry be struggling with gender and race discrimination if the investors funding it were a little less homogeneousThe tool of venture capital is so specific to a tiny tiny fraction of companies We cant let ourselves be fooled into thinking thats the story of the future of American entrepreneurship said Mara Zepeda a yearold entrepreneur who in  helped start an advocacy organization called Zebras Unite Its members include startup founders investors and foundations focused on encouraging a more ethical industry with greater gender and racial diversity The group now has  chapters and  members around the worldThe more we believe that myth the more we overlook tremendous opportunities Ms Zepeda said in an interviewSome of the groups are rejecting venture capital because theyve been excluded from the traditional VC networks Aniyia Williams who started the nonprofit Black  Brown Founders said a venturefunded system that encourages many failures for every one success is particularly unfair to black latinx and women founders who are rarely afforded the opportunity to fail period Members of these organizations she added see more value when whole groups in their communities thrive rather than ventures winnertakeall modelOther founders have decided the expectations that come with accepting venture capital arent worth it Venture investing is a highstakes game in which companies are typically either wild successes or near total failuresBig problems have occurred when you have founders who have unwillingly or unknowingly signed on for an outcome they didnt know they were signing on for said Josh Kopelman a venture investor at First Round Capital an early backer of Uber Warby Parker and RingHe said he was happy that companies were embracing alternatives to venture capital I sell jet fuel he said and some people dont want to build a jetRight now that jet fuel seems unlimited Venture capital investments into United Statesbased companies

walking health care coffee shops farming electric toothbrushesBut people like Sandra Oh Lin the chief executive of KiwiCo a seller of childrens activity kits say that more money isnt necessary Ms Oh Lin raised a little over  million in venture funding between  and  but she is now rebuffing offers of more just as her company has hit on a product people want  the very moment when investors would love to pour more gas on the fire KiwiCo is profitable and had nearly  million in sales in  a  percent increase over the prior year Ms Oh Lin saidWe are aggressive about growth but we are not a

money It took four years before the business earned enough to pay them a salary The sacrifices were very real and very intense Ms Rovello said Nevertheless the business grew steadily and profitably to  employeesBy  though as investors poured capital into some rivals the lure of easy money became too tempting to pass up and the company raised  million Tensions ensued as Arkadiums investors expected the company to continue raising money with the goal of selling or going public Ms Rovello wanted to keep running the company profitably growing revenue at  percent per year and developing a new product that could take years to pay offIn September Arkadium used its profits to buy out the investors allowing the company to remain independent and grow on its own terms Ms Rovello said she had no regrets about stepping off the venturefunded pathIf your end game is having a business that you love and continuing to thrive and making careers for people she said then Im winningIn September Tyler

Tringas said his firm Earnest Capital will have  million to invest in  to  companies per yearHundreds of emails have poured in since the announcement Mr Tringas said in an interview Theyre almost

startups the option to buy back the firms shares as a portion of their total sales That caps the firms return at three times its investment In the typical venture capital model the earnings for a homerun deal are limitlessWhen Indievc started three years ago it saw two or three applications a week mostly from venture capital rejects Now it gets as many as  applications a week mostly from companies that could raise venture capital but dont want to said Bryce Roberts the firms founderWe think there is going to be a tsunami of entrepreneurs who have experienced the onesizefitsall venture

investment mandates with perverse incentives We heard from many investors who said I cant say this publicly but Im in the machine and I know its broken and I know there is a better way Ms Zepeda

employees to settle disputes with the company in private arbitration expanding on an earlier pledge to do away with the practice in cases of sexual harassment or assaultGoogle informed its staff in an email on Thursday that the new policy would take effect globally on March  for current and future employees Gina Scigliano a Google spokeswoman confirmed the changesIn November the company agreed to scrap forced arbitration in individual cases of sexual harassment or assault after  Google workers staged a walkout demanding changes to how it treats employees The walkout was prompted by a New York Times article that revealed Google had given a senior executive Andy Rubin a  million exit package even after it found he had been credibly accused of sexual harassmentThe employee organizers behind the walkout demanded that Google also stop forcing employees into arbitration for other types of disputes Google said it had decided to make the blanket change after comparing its policies with those of other companies Employees who prefer to arbitrate privately will still have that optionThis victory never would have happened if workers hadnt banded together supported one another and walked out Google Walkout for Real Change the organizer behind last years employee walkout wrote on Twitter Collective action works Worker power works This is still just the beginningGoogle had  employees globally at the end of DecemberFor years Googles employment contracts have included a clause requiring staff to hash out grievances behind closed doors instead of suing the company in the public court systemArbitration is a common practice among technology companies to resolve disputes outside the courts It has been especially controversial in cases of sexual harassment because it tends to limit victims from speaking out about their experienceBut under growing pressure from employees companies are eliminating forced arbitration Over the last year Uber Lyft and Facebook have done away with the policy totally or in partGoogle said the policy change would not apply to former employees with unresolved disputes although current Google workers with open disputes will not be forced into arbitrationThe company said it would also do away with the practice for temporary staff contract workers and vendors it hires  although it would not force thirdparty staffing companies that supply the

start the day Get New York Today in your inboxDriving in Manhattan may never be the same againIt will soon cost more  well over   to drive into the busiest neighborhoods from th Street in Midtown all the way to the BatteryThe fees are part of a groundbreaking congestion pricing plan in the new  billion New York State budget which Gov Andrew M Cuomo and lawmakers agreed upon early Sunday morningNew York will become the first American city to charge such fees though congestion pricing has been in place for years in London Stockholm and Singapore among other communities The fees are expected to raise billions of dollars to fix the citys troubled subway system and thin out streets that have become strangled by trafficThe new fees will be imposed on vehicles that enter Manhattan below th StreetCongestion fees are not expected to start until  and no actual fee amounts have been decided A plan proposed by Gov Andrew M Cuomo would establish a panel of experts who would set the fees The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority which is part of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority would collect the feesSamuel I Schwartz a traffic expert known as Gridlock Sam says drivers will probably pay  to  for cars and around  for trucks entering the city during peak business and traffic hours and less at night and on weekends Mr Schwartz was on a state task force on congestion pricing that last year recommended fees of  for cars and  for trucksHis estimates are based on state leaders goal to raise  billion annually from congestion fees which would then be used to secure bonds totaling  billion for repairs and improvements to public transitDrivers who already use tolled tunnels or the Henry Hudson Bridge from the Bronx to Manhattan would receive a credit toward the congestion fees Drivers crossing the Brooklyn Bridge and headed directly north on the FDR Drive past th Street would not be chargedState legislators are considering several possible exemptions for drivers who are low income have disabilities or are going to medical appointments Assemblyman David I Weprin a Democrat from Queens and a leading opponent of congestion pricing has called for an exemption for all city residents which seems unlikelyThough details are being worked out fees are expected to apply to people driving into the congestion zone from elsewhere in the city including parts of Manhattan north of th Street and other boroughs as well as beyondDrivers who live in the congestion zone would not pay when they drive within the zone or when they leave the zone but they will when they return from elsewhereOf course that could change if an exemption or discount is granted to residents of the congestion zone For instance London offers a  percent discount for registered residents of its congestion zoneBut more exemptions could mean higher tolls for everyone elseAfter all the fees are supposed to generate  billion a year Every exemption you provide is less revenue coming into the system said Kate Slevin a senior vice president for the Regional Plan Association a research and advocacy group that supports congestion pricingAlex Matthiessen the head of a grassroots campaign to support congestion pricing said too many exemptions could hollow out the plan making it ineffective Now we must guard against a race to the bottom as legislators seek carveouts and exemptions for every class of driverInstead he suggested taking other measures such as offering discounts on commuter railroads for city residents and subsidizing rideapp services like Uber for those with disabilities to ensure more people benefit from congestion pricingThe new fees will be charged through an electronic tolling system most likely expanding upon existing EZPass technology used for cashless tolling at the citys bridges and tunnelsDrivers entering the designated congestion zone would be automatically charged fees through EZPass tags in their cars If they did not have a tag a camera would snap a picture of the license plate to bill the driver laterAll the technology is proven its used in New York today said Bruce Schaller a former city transportation official who directed the development of a plan to bring congestion pricing to the city more than a decade ago under the mayor at the time Michael R Bloomberg It will work the same way as we had plannedOne of the biggest challenges Mr Schaller said will be finding places to mount all the EZPass readers and cameras so that they are not visually intrusive Gantries might have to be installed over wide avenues Interstate agreements might also be needed so the city could track down drivers with outofstate license platesLondon Stockholm and Singapore have been held up as international models for congestion pricing In each city the fees were greeted with skepticism and anger from many commuters and civic and business leaders But the fees later proved effective in reducing traffic congestion and air pollutionWithin a year of the fees being charged in  the number of vehicles entering an eightsquaremile area of London dropped by  percent according to city officials Traffic delays went down  percent The average speed of vehicles in the zone rose to  miles per hour from  mphAir quality improved too with a  percent reduction in emissions of nitrogen oxides and particulate matter from vehicles in the zoneIn all three cities the fees have also raised millions for transportation and infrastructure including for new buses bikes lanes and other public transit services to accommodate drivers who leave their cars at homeBut still many drivers have complained especially as the fees have gone up over time  more than doubling in London from when the fees were first institutedAnd one important reminder is that even with congestion pricing traffic problems do not simply go away Londons gridlock has returned in recent years in part because of an influx of Uber and other rideapp carsSubway riders stand to see more reliable service and fewer headaches with hefty new investment in the transit system Those riding commuter trains and buses outside Manhattan should also benefit from extra spendingFewer cars will also mean cleaner air more room for cyclists and less fraught crossings for pedestriansEven drivers could get something out of it with Mr Schwartz pointing out that they will no longer be trapped in as much trafficIt will cost them the toll charge he said But it will save them the cost of gas and timeAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayBy Jill CowanGood

staff members decked out in jaunty red hoodies and carrying iPads Lets be buds urges a sign on one tableIt certainly looks like its going great at this chain of weed dispensaries But  like a lot of businesses around the newly commercialized marijuana industry in California  MedMen is struggling The latest quarter of this publicly traded company showed a net loss of  million on revenues of  million It had lost  million the previous quarterNot enough weed supply and too much expansion are among the reasons given for MedMens problems but the disconnect between the companys promise and reality made me think hard about some other terrible news this week Apples announcement that it was going to miss its projected revenue by billions of dollars this quarterKara Swisher answered your questions about this column on TwitterApple has hung the moon for investors for so long now that the idea of the company struggling sent the entire global stock market into a paroxysm of fear and plunging indexes It is to use an old California trope going to be a real bummer for Silicon ValleyNow stick with me here because whats happening across what are considered fastforward industries like cannabis and tech is worrisome Where is the next great boom of innovation going to come from when even the strongest brands and products might not be sure things anymoreApple is not only a bellwether company in tech but also the most expertly managed one under Tim Cook He of course was preceded as chief executive by Steve Jobs who had brought the company back from the brink of bankruptcy in  Since then it has been all uphill to the point this summer when Apple reached a  trillion valuation  the first publicly traded American company to reach that high  with a price of  a shareToday its trading at  and analysts are predicting it will settle around  Yipes Part of the problem is the meltdown of the economy in China where Apple products are popular and the Trump administrations trade war But as Ina Fried of Axios noted The problems Apple saw in China go far beyond just Apple But Apples iPhone problems extend far beyond China tooIndeed The last big innovation explosion  the proliferation of the smartphone  is clearly ending There is no question that Apple was the center of that with its appcentric photoforward and featureladen phone that gave everyone the first platform for what was to create so many products and so much wealth It was the debut of the iPhone in  that spurred what some in tech call a Cambrian explosion a reference to the era when the first complex animals appeared There would be no Uber and Lyft without the iPhone and later the Android version no Tinder no Spotify Now all of tech is seeking the next major platform and area of growth Will it be virtual and augmented reality or perhaps selfdriving cars Artificial intelligence robotics cryptocurrency or digital health We are stumbling in the darkApple has dabbled in a lot of these areas but it still makes its money by selling mobile phones and the accessories around them And while I love my AirPods and lose them weekly my forking over  to Apple for my sloppiness is not going to help compared with buying a cool new phoneThat business has surely leveled off as no one upgrades quite as quickly as they did before because of everything from the price tag and being worried about a recession to the simple fact that the new phones dont offer that much more than the old ones There is no question that Mr Cook and his team have done a tremendous job taking advantage and managing this last cycle of innovation but its apparent that its now winding downThis is a big issue not only for Apple but also for all of tech There is not a major trend that you can grab onto right now that will carry everyone forward The last cool set of companies  Uber Airbnb Pinterest and yes Tinder  were created many years ago and I cannot think of another group that is even close to as promisingWell rental scooters OK theyre cool but they are a derivative of the car rental business and are not going to make the big jumps in innovation that need to occur now How innovation happens is a much more delicate

VARIETY COLUMNSam Ezersky practices his punditry on usBy Caitlin LovingerVARIETY PUZZLE  Puns and Anagrams play faster and looser than straight cryptic puzzles and Sam Ezersky improvises riffs on top of that so to completely finish a grid like this youve got to unfurrow your brow a little bit go with the flow and promise not to YELL AT yourself or him for any oddball inclusions On the plus side this makes it easier to smile at those same oddball inclusions if and when you suss them outIf youre at all new to this game or even if youve been solving Pandas forever start with the anagrams to get a toehold There are always some easy ones like DAUBER at A for One painting an earbud  rearrange the letters in earbud to get one painting The clue beneath this at A is much the same as are D A A A D and so onFor the anagrams I especially liked D for the Deb reference today and D because it made me think of Minnie the MoocherAfter youve exhausted those more straightforward options the fun really begins Every constructor or setter as they say in cryptics  I guess a maker of Pandas could be a consetter has their own style and preferences for the infinite variety of puns that we can encounter Mr Ezersky uses some tried and true mechanisms One involves letters running either through the middle of a clue  see A NBA star Julius ERVING from the letters in Muchdeserving or around the edges  see D Place to ski around Alberta or ALTAA few straight puns which are de rigueur in puzzles like this Sends junk etc is SHIPS which means both sends and junk etc and UTILE is a Useful draw  a U TILE  in Scrabble There are also some visual and auditory gags One involves deducing missing letters in passages like A Dbis home which is if you realize youre looking at Dubai the UAE One involves recognizing one big missing letter in a sequence MNOPQST  NO R Another makes you translate numbers to letters like  to TEN or letters to words like Q to CUE to help with anagrams  or vice versa Em goes to M whose neighbors are L and N in the alphabet which become ELLEN A tough little nut in this vein was A  think of V the roman numeral for five to get this oneTheres also more endearing and personalized cluing I think that marks a puzzle with the name Ezersky Id say that product placements like the Cadillac ESCALADE and an UBER RIDE count as flourishes especially for the latter crossing OUT OF GAS I found YOUTUBE deliciously squicky Mr Ezersky also counts on us to know a little scifi but just a little  like the fact that Ewoks come from ENDOR SEE I also attribute the cute Cooks corner at the bottom left to the wiles of todays consetter with a GRATIN a PUREE a GELATO and a PITA Similarly I found the crossing of names from s music and television  SEACLIFF and FILLING IN  to be personable What did

Francisco to Manhattan would be an adjustment but he never imagined that owning a queensize bed would be a problem Or that having the space for a dresser and some shelves could be considered a luxuryThats what he discovered last October when he was considering a studio in Chelsea Time was running out as he had to move out of the temporary housing his employer Uber Eats had arranged for him I really really liked the spot I really wanted it to work said Mr Bejan  So I eyeballed it I said I think I can make this work I jumped into the decision because I was feeling rushedBut then Mr Bejan compared the apartments measurements to those of the bed dresser and shelves he was having shipped from California where he had shared a twobedroom apartment and realized they wouldnt fitMy bed alone would have come right up to the edge of the kitchen island Mr Bejan said I would have been climbing over my furniture just to move aroundHe didnt want to buy all new furniture It wasnt as if his furniture was preposterously proportioned it wasnt even particularly large For me an apartment is not just a place to store my body at night Mr Bejan said I didnt want my bed to be the primary surface in the apartmentHe got out of the deal but then had only one day to find a new place before leaving for a vacation in Amsterdam As he worked in West Chelsea he had been looking on the West Side but most of the apartments he had seen were small walkups with challenging layouts Consulting a transit map  which he had used to guide his search an easy commute being his only other priority  he decided to change tack and head east  Murray Hill ManhattanOccupation Marketing manager Uber EatsApartment hunting in New York vs California I had to consider airconditioning for the first time in my life said Mr Bejan who is from San Jose and has lived in San Francisco since collegeOn using a broker The brokers fee gave him pause but using a broker turned out to be a big help I was so overwhelmed seeing apartments he said and they kept certain things in mindGood and bad surprises A dishwasher which he wasnt expecting and noise from the QueensMidtown Tunnel At  am its loud as hell he said I made a sound dampener out of a board and foam and bearcage myself in most morningsThe best things about New York I really like the people I think theyre really genuine here people in San Francisco can be fake Plus the music scene in Brooklyn and the food I love Levain Bakery I recently took visiting friends through Central Park and strategically navigated us through the park to end up thereAs he and his real estate agent Marien Richardson of Citi Habitats toured listings around Murray Hill and Kips Bay they kept bumping into another apartment seeker and his brokerSometimes wed be there first sometimes theyd be before us I was like OK youre my competition Mr Bejan said It was really intenseAt a building in the East s the unit they had come to see wasnt available for viewing  the tenant was in the midst of moving out  but the one below was emptyFor  a month the apartment was not too small but not too large There was a small entrance hall and space for not only all the furniture he owned including the bed but also for a small sofa Plus there was laundry in the building and an unexpected bonus a dishwasher And if the view was nothing much  the one window faced a brick wall  at least the wall was on the other side of a street so there was natural lightHe was told that the apartment above had a newer floor and stainless steel appliances but it also cost about  more a month I dont need that stuff that bad This floor is fine its not like its ruining my life he said of his older parquetHe put in an application and hoped for the best The response came fast Because he didnt meet the landlords income requirements and neither of his parents lived in the tristate area so they couldnt act as guarantors the landlord wanted four months rent as security depositI was like I dont have that much money Mr Bejan said The first months rent was being offered free but he still had to come up with last months rent and the brokers fee He offered two months rent as a security deposit and the landlord countered with three The discussion stopped thereI really wanted it  Mr Bejan said But I didnt have the three months so I was like Oh wellHe was on his way to the airport the next afternoon when he got a call The landlord would take two months security deposit but he needed to sign the documents in person and bring a check Waiting until he got back was not an option After much pleading they finally agreed to a virtual document signing and a wire transfer followed by a visit to the office upon his returnIn November when Mr Bejan moved in his furniture fit even better than he had expected it to The alcove along one wall is the perfect size for his bed And the bed isnt the primary surface in the apartment its not even the first thing people see when they walk inThe apartment is spacious enough to have a few friends over for a drink before going out on Friday nights And it doesnt feel claustrophobic on Saturdays when he likes to be a homebodyThe only thing he is not in love with is Murray Hill Its fine Its convenient but it feels a bit generic he said In the future Ill look at a transit map but also do a neighborhood overlayFor weekly email updates on

more than doubled last year to about  billion even as its total revenue also doubled to about  billion But instead of expressing concern about the mounting losses executives argued that they were a sign of the companys giant ambitionsWe can very much if we chose to moderate our growth and become profitable Artie Minson WeWorks president said in a telephone interview But its a time for us to continue to accelerateMichael Gross the companys vice chairman added Were looking at building this business out not just maximizing profitability over the next one to two yearsWeWorks valuation of about  billion makes it one of the worlds most valuable privately held companies Begun as a coworking space in Manhattan eight years ago it has also become one of the biggest corporate landlords in the world It has continued to expand rapidly into new markets around the worldBut the costs of the companys rapid growth stand out even among the crowd of technology darlings that run huge losses to expand their empires Uber lost  billion last year an improvement over the  billion it lost in  while Lyft lost  million last yearSuch companies argue that for now they are willing to tolerate red ink because the cost of slowing down is too high But several companies that went public with huge losses including Groupon and Snap Inc now trade well below their initial public offering prices And many shareholders expect the businesses they invest in to eventually make moneyWeWorks ambitions to overhaul the working world have drawn the backing of deeppocketed investors like SoftBank the Japanese technology giant which believes the company represents the future of workThe company now has  paying members in  cities up significantly from  And it has continued to expand its base of corporate customers including businesses like Amazon and PepsiCo Corporate memberships now make up roughly a third of WeWorks overall subscriptionsAnd the company is spending more to add more amenities to its work spaces which already include coffee and beer in many placesMr Minson also played down the  billion loss which was calculated according to generally accepted accounting principles in favor of a number of nonstandard measures One measure called adjusted Ebitda strips out costs like taxes and stockbased compensation That led to a  million loss last year compared with  million in And then there is communityadjusted Ebitda which excludes those expenses  as well marketing administrative and other costs of growing the business By that measure WeWork earned  million last year double what it earned in WeWork executives argued that the company was in a strong financial position with  billion in cash and committed capital It also raised  million from its firstever bond sale last yearMr Gross added that the company could issue more debt or take on another investment if necessaryWe have no need to tap the equity capital markets but theres a lot of interest and demand in our story he saidAnd while critics of WeWork worry that the company might suffer in an economic downturn  particularly by being trapped in longterm leases  Mr Minson argued that the company could draw more

regular solver of those frightening lateweek gridsThats really it It boils down to practice and to evicting that voice in your head that says I am strictly a MondayWednesday solver and I cant do anything elseWell it also boils down to getting a foothold so you can eventually solve the whole thing but its not that hard The clues are written and edited to make sure that no matter who you are or where you come from there will be something that you know My first gimme in Fridays fabulous puzzle by Andrew J Ries was our Friend of the Crossword LISA LOEB the singer who also collaborated on a

Remember those constraints I was talking about before in the themed puzzles Themes are great I love them But because they have to be placed carefully in a grid it lowers that chances that youre going to find those elegantly long crunchy entries like LEAD BALLOON TETRAHEDRA BONE TIRED PAPER TOSS UBER DRIVER or ESCAPE ROOMSo give a Friday puzzle a go You dont have to finish it at first and there is

answer in the puzzle is NERDS Im calling it artistic licenseA I have to admit that this was also a gimme for me Im used to thinking of the word locks as hair in wordplay clues and with the clue One strengthened by locks it was easy enough to remember the story of SAMSOND The Cuban bread that you eat is delicious but the bread in this puzzle is slang for money so the answer is PESOD Even after I

thinking TIE PAY is a blood grouping No Deb Its Type AD Notice the space in the clue Needle point The craft of needlepoint is spelled without the space and there is a question mark in the clue so we

because we were not talking about metal hooks we were talking about throwing hooks as in punchesThis grid started with the northwest corner I had to edit it out of another themeless I was working on but repurposed it as a block of seed entries here I wanted to make sure to include some nice s going down in the northeast and southwest I especially liked UBER DRIVER and ESCAPE ROOM when I wrote the puzzle back in July  because neither had been used in The Times at that point Both have been used in The Times since this is now the fourth appearance for ESCAPE ROOM in fact so its arguably more overused than fresh at this point Thems the breaks sometimesA tip of the hat to the editing team on the cluing as always I especially liked their clues at  and Down I love it when clues appear to hint at a plural entry but the answer is singular and vice versa Among my original clues I probably like Down the bestI hope solvers enjoyAlmost finished solving but need a bit more help Weve got you

of the postTrump job marketSure opportunities await  but also perhaps some closed doorsOutgoing top administration officials typically have a wide array of options in both the public and private sector  including speaking engagements TV contracts book deals academic posts and corporate gigs But some former Trump aides have found their options more limited than did their predecessors in part due to controversy surrounding President Donald Trumps policies on issues such as the environment and immigration as well as his record of raciallycharged languageNielsen who resigned Sunday has a resume offering expertise in managing a massive cabinet agency But she also may face scrutiny as the public face of the administrations family separation policyIts a totally different environment than a normal cabinet secretary leaving a normal administration especially with her overseeing a lot of very controversial policies that have upset a lot of people said Matt Lattimer who served under President George W Bush and is cofounder of the Javelin literary agency Shes going to have to answer questions about those policiesAlready some critics are pushing to prevent Nielsen from cashing in on her tenure in the Trump administration A collection of advocacy groups has written an open letter to executives calling on corporate America to block any administration officials associated with family separations including Nielsen The letter was signed by the National Immigration Law Center Southern Poverty Law Center NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice and othersThis is about making sure these administration officials as they enter the revolving door of our government to private life that they are not allowed to profit from the misery they inflicted on thousands of families said Karl Frisch a spokesman for Restore Public Justice which is organizing the effortFrisch said the group was also readying a digital ad buy targeting NielsenSome speculated that Nielsen would be a strong candidate for consulting jobs with companies that get government contracts particularly as long as Trump is in office when her knowledge and insight will be marketablePlenty of former Trump aides have found reasonably soft landings though there have been some bumps along the wayA number of formers have signed up with speaking agencies among them Trumps most recent chief of staff John Kelly former Press Secretary Sean Spicer and Trumps original chief Reince Priebus Priebus also returned to his former law firm while Spicer wrote a book and serves as a consultant to a Trumpsupporting PAC Still Spicer did not score a TV contributor deal after he left the West Wing in  though he recently signed on as a contributor to the syndicated entertainment show ExtraAlso writing a book was

America has proven more elusive compared with aides to President Barack Obama Press Secretary Jay Carney is at Amazon senior adviser David Plouffe is at Uber and Press Secretary Josh Earnest is at United Airlines Tom Ridge the first Homeland Security secretary under President George W Bush has served on a slew of private and public boards While Trump officials have found lucrative options those corner offices have not come their wayTo be sure many Trump aides do not have the years of experience typically associated with top White House officials which may also affect their prospects And given the rapid turnover in the administration they often are not able to conduct a methodical job hunt before making an exitNielsens carefully worded resignation letter suggests she is unlikely to break with the White House as she returns to private life A former official in the George W Bush White House who previously ran her own consulting firm she had little public profile before taking the jobFor now she is working to wind down her role with the department before a Wednesday exit and evaluating options for the futureAssociated Press writer Jill Colvin contributed to this

representing air traffic controllers pilots and flight attendants offered an urgent warning on Wednesday that the lengthy government shutdown had created serious safety concerns for the nations air travel systemIn our risk averse industry their presidents said in a joint statement we cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at play nor predict the point at which the entire system will breakThe partial shutdown nearing five full weeks has caused strain across the air travel system For more than a month thousands of transportation security officers and air traffic controllers have been working without pay Union officials have been warning that the additional stress the shutdown has put on the workers could have dangerous consequencesWe are less safe today Sara Nelson the international president of the Association of Flight AttendantsCWA said on ThursdayThe nature of the concern being expressed by aviation union leaders is more general than specific In effect they are warning that the complex system intended to keep air travelers safe is being seriously tested by the shutdown and its consequences from staffing changes to the financial stress it has inflicted on workers who do not know how long they will have to survive without a paycheckStill the Federal Aviation Administration insisted on Thursday that the traveling public can be assured that our nations airspace system is safeThe FAA continually reviews and analyzes the performance of the national airspace system to assess its safety and efficiency the agency said in a statement We have not observed any appreciable difference in performance over the last several weeks compared to the same periods during the previous two yearsAir traffic controllers who are responsible for keeping planes from colliding have been working without payIts more complicated for safety inspectors who are responsible for oversight of commercial aircraft pilots and maintenance facilitiesLast week the FAA announced it was bringing back furloughed inspectors and other employees in order to ensure safety Its revised shutdown plan called for having  employees responsible for aviation safety designated as essential to protect life and safety meaning that they would work without pay during the shutdown rather than be furloughedThe FAAs original shutdown plan called for only  aviation safety positions to be considered essential for life and safety The union representing inspectors had warned that furloughing those workers was hurting the safety of the air travel systemThere are still plenty of FAA employees who have been sidelined Over all about  of the FAAs  employees are furloughed under the revised shutdown planMore than  transportation security officers  employees of the Department of Homeland Security who screen passengers at the airports  have worked through the shutdown But they have been failing to show up for their shifts at a rising rate  about one in  were absent on Sunday On average they make less than  a year and many of them have had to borrow money seek side jobs or turn to food pantries to get byDespite reassurances from Transportation Security Administration officials the agency did have a lapse in early January that frightened travelers A woman passed through a screening checkpoint at HartsfieldJackson Atlanta International Airport with a gun that she carried onto a flight that landed Jan  in TokyoThe agency later said that any perception that the shutdown caused the failure to detect the gun which was in a carryon bag would be false No similar lapses have been reported during the shutdownStaffing was already an issue even before the shutdown their union saidThe number of certified controllers is at a year low according to the National Air Traffic Controllers Association The centralized radar facility for the airports that serve New York City which is known as a Tracon has only about  controllers far short of its full complement of  said Rich Santa a regional vice president of the controllers union And  of them are eligible to retire now he saidMany of the controllers were already working the maximum of  hours per week  hour shifts six days in a row  before the shutdown said Mick Devine a Bostonbased regional vice president of the controllers union Having received their second biweekly statements showing pay of  on Thursday the controllers are worrying about how they will pay their mortgages and school loans when they need to be  percent focused  percent of the time Mr Devine saidPaul M Rinaldi the president of the union said he was starting to see routine mistakes in clearances being made because controllers are distractedCiting the large number of controllers who can retire he asked how long they would continue to work without pay before they just fill out their retirement paperwork and then go wait tables or drive Uber or Lyft so that they could put food on the tableThe shutdown has also caused the FAAs training academy in Oklahoma City to close prompting concerns about disruptions to the pipeline of new controllersA  report from the Transportation Departments inspector general found that the FAA had fallen well short of its hiring goals for air traffic controllers from  through  The report concluded that the agency would continue to face challenges in meeting its hiring goals and ensuring it hires and trains enough new controllers to offset retirementsThe FAA said in a  report that it had hired more than  controllers in the previous five years In  it exceeded its annual goal by hiring  controllers the report saidSo far according to the FAA the shutdown has not driven air traffic controllers to quit The FAA said it has seen no measurable increase in unplanned retirements or resignations by air traffic controllersMany transportation security officers have been accepting handouts from food pantries and free meals from airport concessions Some said they had resorted to selling possessions on eBay or seeking out odd jobs like delivering food Mr Devine said controllers are barred from side jobs that could be considered a conflict of interest To avoid running afoul of the rules he said they are taking lowskill lowpay gigs such as driving for ridesharing services or tending barSome people just hop in their cars as theyre leaving the airport and head to the Uber stand and pick someone up on their way home Mr Devine said describing how some controllers are earning money on the sideAt a news conference on Thursday Mr Rinaldi the president of the controllers union was asked directly if the flying public was safeHe answered The flying public is safeAir traffic controllers he said are going to make sure that you get from Point A to Point B safely But he could not promise that travelers would be on time or would make their connections and he expressed concern about how the departure of controllers would affect flightsWe cannot hold this schedule when we lose that many controllers he said and were about to lose a lot of controllersPatrick McGeehan writes about transportation and infrastructure for the Metro section He has been a reporter for the

not accept the incitement of violence against Muslims said Debbie Almontaser the secretary of the board of directors for the merchants association The quotation from Ms Omar that appeared on the cover

the efficacy of the strikes and the risks of raising tension with Pakistan Why do these people get so disturbed when India acts strongly against the forces of terror he asked at a rally this week in western India referring to opposition leaders Is their hatred for Modi so great they cant even unite when it comes to national security he said to tens of thousands of cheering supporters wearing saffron headbandsThe Congress led by Gandhi and his charismatic sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra who took up a party post in January is trying to steer the campaign back to Modis broken promises on the economyGandhi has pledged a monthly payment of  rupees to Indias poorest families benefiting  million of a population of  billion in what he called a final assault on poverty The BJPs campaign is largely around nationalism national security and this is echoed in their manifesto said Sanjay Kumar director of think tank the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies in New Delhi Congress is trying to pitch in the election with regard to farm distress rural crisis unemployment Nearly  million people are eligible to vote in an election spread over seven phases into next month to allow security forces and officials to ensure a free and fair ballotVoters will travel by buses trains boats to about a million polling stations Votes will be counted on May  and results are expected the same dayGandhi as Congress leader had attempted to forge a grand alliance with a clutch of powerful regional parties fighting the elections so as to avoid the splintering of votes But the unwillingness of other Congress officials to give in to the demands of the smaller parties and the vaulting ambition of key regional figures frustrated his effortsStill the Congress said Modi represented a threat to every opposition group by pursuing its vision of a Hindufirst India stoking fear among its Muslim minority The BJP denies such biasModis tactics were borrowed from the playbook of US President Donald Trump said Sam Pitroda an adviser to Gandhi The strategy was there is enemy at the border in that case it was Mexican and enemy also as people in the country immigrants Very

with the tech companys Echo device has gone from a handy gadget for streaming music to a ubiquitous home tool able to do everything from switching on the lights to ordering an UberAmazon announced recently that it had sold more than  million Alexa devices And the company is all in Last fall it unveiled more than a dozen assorted devices that tap into the voice assistant including a microwave and a wall clockDave Limp Amazons senior vice president for devices and services said Alexa was at scale and had gained the most traction by making parts of daily life more convenientWe started with the home were now adding the car Mr Limp said at The New York Timess New Work Summit last weekHe said that people find tasks that become habitual to them  often very different thingsAt least once a week often every day I get an email from somebody who just says that the Echo has changed their lives Mr Limp said They might not have all their mobility they might be a little elderly and they find companionship with Alexa they find the ability to interact in a way they couldnt beforeMr Limp said that Alexa might feel somewhat human to some because of the empathy put into itIf youre an adult and you say youre depressed or suicidal he said or youre potentially a victim of domestic abuse and youre talking to Alexa in that way weve talked to experts about what we should do in those situations Alexa would try to connect you to a suicide hotline or domestic abuse hotlinesHe said Alexas personality would continue to grow with the help of artificial intelligence and machine learningDo we need to make her more conversational and less transactional over time Yes he said We have thousands of people working on that right now The goal would be that an assistant of your choice would have exactly the kind of conversation that were having right nowBut do people want their conversations recorded and saved in the cloud Mr Limp said utterances were encrypted when stored much as credit card data is He said users could erase recordings if they wishedIf you messed up and said something you didnt want Amazon to have or anybody else in Amazon to see you can delete those individual utterances Or you can delete every utterance he said Its very important to realize the reason we keep the data is to make the system betterLast year Amazon Echo accounted for  percent of installed smart speakers in the United States while Google Home made up  percent and Apple HomePod  percent according to a recent survey by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners The analysis showed a sharp increase in the number of people with more than one smart speaker device up to  percent last year from  percent in Michael Levin partner and cofounder of Consumer Intelligence Research Partners attributed the increased adoption of smart speakers to less expensive devices introduced by Amazon and Google It also encouraged users to buy more than one he saidMr Levin said his companys research indicated that while more consumers were buying multiple devices they were staying true to just one operating system Once an owner starts using one or another smart home system and learns how to use it and accessorizes it its awfully hard to switch he said This of course leaves Apple and other latecomers behindThats not to say that people are replacing their smartphones with their smart speakersWe see these increasingly as the center of a smart home or business the stationary analog to mobile technology Mr Levin saidMicah Collins the director of product management for Google Home agreed that ambient devices like smart speakers and smart displays were complementary to personal devices like smartphones Users will interact with information and services through an ever increasing number of devices during the natural course of their daily lives Mr Collins saidAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byLet us help you start your day By Matthew SedaccaGood morning President Emmanuel Macron of France debates rural mayors

marketplace for that most soughtafter of necessities someone willing to play goalieBy Curtis RushTORONTO  Keith Hamilton carried himself like an NHL goaltender even before he made his first save in a pickup game at Moss Park Arena Standing  feet tall  and looking much bigger in skates  he made the net behind him appear to shrink But this was hardly the NHL Hamilton  was guarding the cage against a team of middleage men from an Ontario public utility He wore a replica Colorado Avalanche jersey Every other player was differentiated by tones more than colors turning the sessions into light versus dark a hockey version of shirts and skinsAfter an hourlong scrimmage Hamilton cut a lonely figure as he skated off the ice There were no handshakes no fist bumps He collected the cash he was promised  the going rate is about  Canadian dollars per game  changed out of his gear and drove off to the next arena This was his third game of the day He had two to go Hamilton is a hockey mercenary one of the estimated  to  hired guns in Torontos recreation leagues who are in demand as much for their position  goaltender  as  for their skills With  indoor publicly owned arenas in the Toronto metropolitan area there are many more teams than there are available goaliesTeams can do without one of their skaters There are plenty of them But if the goalie cant make it a game could be forfeited which can feel like a puck to the mouth when ice time costs more than  dollars an hourIts not like soccer where a player can just go in net said Niki Sawni  who runs a goalierental service called Puck AppBy various estimates there are as many as  rentalgoalie orders every year in the Toronto area which  suggests there is a sizable marketplace for the kind of person willing to play the bullseye in a game of target practiceIve got a screw loose sure said Mark Philipps  who still tends goal but not so much as a rental goalie anymore It takes a special type of person to want to get a puck in the headYoull run into some crazy ones said John McLeod  a film actor who picks up work as a rental goalie in his off hours Very unusual characters and I worry that I may be one of them tooIn Toronto rental goalies  a cohort of mostly men and a few women  generally range in age from  to  and come from all walks of life engineering acting education policing the tradesSome even try to make itinerant goaltending their profession Hamilton is one of thoseA musician who plays the vibraphone in a sixperson folk band called Beams Hamilton said he makes more money being a rental goalie than playing music in clubsHe averages  games a week and keeps  Canadian dollars per game paying  dollars in commission to a rental agency His cut works out to about  Canadian dollars or  in United States currency a month By his estimate he has made well over  dollars in eight years as a rental goalie And yes he said he declares all of his income on his taxesIts not enough for a mortgage and kids education but its just enough to get by he said Theres certainly more taxing ways to make a living But I sweat and I come home with bruisesThe rentagoalie concept has been around since at least  when Doug Cardy a former top junior goalie for the Toronto Marlboros got tired of people bugging me to fill in on teams five or six times a week while he juggled a fulltime jobI started telling them I want some money said Cardy a shorthaul trucker And I started with a little cardboard sign in one of the arenas with my phone numberCardy set up a business in which his goalies used pagers to check in for work The money he scratched out wasnt worth it though and Cardy now  got outGoalies Unlimited was one of the first agencies to match games with goalies in the mids Since then online competitors have proliferated with names like Book a Goalie MyPuck Goalies to Go Puck App Rent a Goalie and Get a Goalie which serves Buffalo and Chicago Most of the agencies are run by current or former goaltendersIan Peters  started his operation in New York after growing tired of paying a  Uber fare each way to play goal in pickup games He made a proposal three years ago to Ron Bursey  who runs the Canadian operation Book a Goalie and a New York tab was added to the Torontobased websiteIt started like wildfire and the business blew up said Peters who has about  goalies serving New Jersey Connecticut and New York I do it all from my phone There was resistance in the beginning because New Yorkers werent used to paying for this servicePeters charges clients  a game and a goalie gets  for his first five bookings and  for his next five A goalies pay maxes out at  In Canada rental agencies tend to take about  dollars in commission from the typical rate of  a game Goalies like Hamilton with eight years experience can negotiate a lower commission Sometimes the business keeps it all Daniel Smith  a former highlevel hockey player who became a jockey   runs Goalies Unlimited He likes to play four times a week and as a rental goalie he collects the full  fee each timePuck App which Sawni founded three years ago markets itself as the Uber of the goalierental business With a smartphone app it can undercut other services by charging a top rate of  dollars in Toronto and even less in other citiesSawni has a database of  users across Canada both goalies looking for paid work about  so far and clients looking for help in netOn Puck App a team can specify the site the games starting time and the level of play The offer is sent to all of the goalies in the database who match the criteriaPatrick Herman the owner of the MyPuck agency has a roster of over  goaltenders and fills  orders for  to  games a day The business can be cutthroat he said and he has little time for teams who try to play one service off another to get a better dealIf you want a pizza tonight its not like you call Pizza Hut and Dominos and tell them The first delivery driver that gets to my door gets my money Herman saidSome teams try to make side deals with players they like but the agencies discourage goalies from disclosing their personal contact information to clients Occasionally the client is a fascinating characterJoe Vercillo   once got a late request to work for a certain Canadian superstar in the music industry I got a call around  at night said Vercillo who is in charge of acquisitions for a small publishing company It woke me up My agent said Drake has rented the ice Can you get over in  minutesVercillo thought it was a prank because no one was inside the arena when he turned up But soon Drake and his associates arrived and Vercillo suited up for about  minutes of work They gave me  or  bucks for that Vercillo said A representative for another wellknown singersongwriter  called Burseys agency in December  requesting two goalies Justin Bieber wanted to put together a game with some friends at a Toronto arena Bieber had his own entire dressing room Bursey said adding that one of the goalies had told him that by the end of the game Teenage girls were all over the rink watching As at every level of the sport some goaltenders are better than others Daniel Altshuller  a thirdround draft pick of the NHLs Carolina Hurricanes in  became a rental goalie last year to stay sharp after taking a season offI had moved to Toronto and I didnt know anybody Altshuller said I was just doing it mostly to find somewhere to play hockeyOthers enter the marketplace for decidedly less professional reasons Dan Madeiros a commercial airline pilot advertises his services at  an

Saudi Arabias oil wealth is the only realistic source for financing this transitionWhen his initial plan to take Aramco public ran into difficulties last year Prince Mohammed turned to the Sabic deal as an alternative way to raise money But Aramco officials have indicated the public offering was only postponed not canceled and could still take placeIf so the recent meetings with investors may prove a kind of dress rehearsal An intense yearslong preparation for the IPO helped make the bond sale possible At one point around  bankers and other professionals occupied a floor at Aramcos headquarters in Dhahran preparing the oil giants raw numbers for reports that could be shown to potential investors and poring over still unresolved issues including where to list the company according to an adviser who worked on the dealThe bond sale is being closely watched not least because of the cloud that has lingered over Saudi Arabia since the murder of Mr Khashoggi in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul last year Intelligence agencies in the United States and other Western countries have concluded that the crown prince ordered the killingBut that controversy has not scared off major banks like JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley which are leading the offering and other banks in supporting roles JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley declined to commentTo the extent that Mohammed bin Salman has become persona non grata in the West doesnt make Saudi Arabia persona non grata said Chas W Freeman Jr a former United States ambassador to RiyadhIn early April Aramco released a prospectus showing it was the worlds most profitable company in  with  billion in net income and very little debt Analysts at Moodys Investors Service gave the company a strong credit rating of A the same as the Saudi government Had Aramco been an independent company it would have earned a higher rating Moodys saidThat has made the bond offering a hot ticket for investorsThe more someone doesnt need money the more we want to give it to them Reza Karim an assistant fund manager for emerging market debt at Jupiter Asset Management said in an interviewSome analysts said that Aramcos history  it was founded by Standard Oil of California  and reputation as a Westernstyle business in the staunchly conservative kingdom made it attractive to international investorsIts enclaves in the eastern part of the country  where American geologists first discovered oil in the s  resemble American suburbs with baseball diamonds movie theaters and themed restaurants In these walledoff areas women go without head coverings and hold serious jobs in areas like computer science and geology at the companyA lot of people and a lot of institutions have a very favorable view of the Aramco leadership Helima Croft an analyst at RBC Capital Markets said They look on it as a center of enlightenment and progress in Saudi ArabiaYet there is a worry  both inside and outside the company  that the Sabic transaction and an eventual IPO could foreshadow further interference by the crown prince and his associates For much of the companys history the royal family had largely left Aramcos operations to a succession of professional managers But the danger of royal intervention has risen analysts say because the crown prince and his father King Salman are no longer ruling the country by consensus as their predecessors didThough the royals have traditionally been wary of wrecking Saudi Arabias profit machine the current Saudi leaders seem willing to tinker with Aramco according to Jim Krane a Persian Gulf expert at Rice Universitys Baker Institute for Public PolicyI see this as a process of realigning Aramco and the kingdom to cope with an uncertain future for oil rather than a political raid on

thoughtful amenities Outlets and USB ports are at every seat free WiFi is available at the entranceway and the entire structure smells lovely thanks to a signature scent wafting through the corridors

November and will soon be rebranded Virgin Trains USA As fewer people in the United States apply for drivers licenses and more take ridesharing services the team behind Virgin Trains believes that this is the perfect time to make train travel a new American habit And they are starting with top urban areas in FloridaWe recognized this major mobility problem that was starting to present itself between densely populated tooshorttofly but toolongtodrive areas and we saw it as an opportunity said Patrick Goddard president of Brightline An alluring promise to passengers is a shorter trip In Florida the train stops at stations along Interstate  but compared to that stretch of highway where speeds average around  miles per hour the train chugs along at up to  miles per hour That cuts the hourlong drive from Fort Lauderdale to Miami in half the hour and a half drive between Fort Lauderdale and Palm Beach is cut to  minutes The train has mostly been used by commuters but company officials hope that it will appeal to more tourists The MiamiCentral station will soon be home to Central Fare a new food hall and is a minute drive from Port Miami the busiest cruise port in the world That station also connects to public transit options like the Metrorail and the TriRail In Orlando stations will be located at Walt Disney World and at Orlando International Airport to entice travelers to hop onboard In December Doug Maesk and his husband took the train from their home in Fort Lauderdale to West Palm Beach for a day trip The journey by car would have been annoying he said while the train ride was very smooth and quietThe seats were so comfortable there was an attendant offering snacks and drinks Mr Maesk said noting that they didnt travel first class Just being on the train was a nice way to spend a Sunday afternoon and it was a really nice way to travel He said that he and his husband are likely to use the train to Orlando to avoid the threeandahalf to fourhour drive and would spend the time working instead of sitting in traffic We just wanted to try the train once Mr Maesk said But now were really looking forward to them expanding to Orlando so we can save time and be productive at the same time  Brightlines Mr Goddard said that the company to set itself apart has invested deeply into the details in its stations and on its trainsThe transportation business is rife with stories of bad experiences whether it is airplanes or public transit or even a bad Uber driver Mr Goddard said We wanted to be the antithesis of thatAlong with its signature scent scented candles are also available for purchase the Miami station offers a gourmet coffee shop a play area for children and electric scooters to rent The station and the train are ADA compliant and accessible to people in wheelchairs and train bathrooms are touchless A deal with Lyft allows passengers to pay for train tickets and a ride under the same tab and the free WiFi is available from the instant you enter the station to the time you depart the train at your destinationSmart Smart Plus and Select are the three class options Tickets cost between  and  each way Smart is the main class which the company says is equivalent to business class and which it suggests commuters families and groups take Smart Plus costs a bit extra and includes one complimentary snack and beverage on each trip Select is the trains firstclass experience which provides access to station lounges that offer wine and charcuterie and scented cold hand towels All passengers regardless of their class are allowed up to two carryon bags for no extra fee with an option also to check luggage They can also bring up to one cat or dog on the train and the company is working on allowing passengers to book

in your inboxFor years city officials have worked to promote New York as the safest large city in America Its transformation from urban war zone in the early s to shining metropolitan destination has long been a point of pride for the Police Department For two decades murder rates have continued to plummetBut in the first three months of this year that trend took a concerning turn in the opposite direction driven by a steep spike in murders in Brooklyn As of March  the borough had recorded  homicides so far this year compared with  in the same period last year a  percent increaseDuring the same period police officials said the number of murders in the rest of the city fell slightly from  to  Murders went up in significantly in Manhattan but fell in the Bronx Queens and Staten IslandCrime rates rise and fall periodically and it is too early to tell if the increase in killings foretells a new crime wave that would challenge the sense of security that has become part of the citys identity Over time the increase may be offset by quieter periods and trends that appear worrisome in March often level off by AugustThere are month to month fluctuations not necessarily indicative of a trend said Chief Lori Pollock who oversees crime control strategiesStill the spike in murders in Brooklyn  particularly in the  precincts in the Brooklyn North command  has left police officials scrambling to contain it Senior commanders said a small number of people linked to street gangs appear to be responsible for the recent wave of shootingsTheyre gangrelated shootings and its the same related individuals who are showing up said Chief Terence A Monahan the departments highestranking uniformed officer He added that some of the people detained in connection with recent shootings were facing gun charges in other boroughs and had been released on bailThere have been  killings so far in the Brooklyn North precincts compared to  at this time last year Many of those killings have been clustered in neighborhoods like East New York and Brownsville Others have occurred on the edges of rapidly gentrifying areas like Bushwick and BedfordStuyvesant where there were four murders within a fiveblock radius earlier this yearTo counter the violence the police commissioner James P ONeill announced in March that the department would add officers to four of the citys problem precincts including the th Precinct which covers parts of BedfordStuyvesant and south Williamsburg The department is also shifting officers from Queens into public housing complexes in northern Brooklyn where much of the violence has flaredThe addition of officers has already led to a significant increase in gun arrests in Brooklyn the police saidThis is how weve reduced crime by focusing our resources Mr ONeill said I think weve turned a corner in Kings County We understand what the mission is and thats to keep people safeThe violence in Brooklyn is still a far cry from the crest of the murder wave of the early s By April in  for instance the same  precincts in Brooklyn North already had more than  killingsStill the memory of the days when the city was known as one of Americas most dangerous places haunts the police and elected officials Mayor Bill de Blasio said the police department was employing a number of strategies to counter the violence including programs to forge tighter bonds with the community in highcrime precinctsWere not going to stop until we make more fundamental changes and make people safer and make sure they feel safer at the same time Mr de Blasio saidMany residents and business owners in BedfordStuyvesant and Clinton Hill said they were aware of recent shootings yet do not feel as if their communities are under siegeDenise Davis  said a shooting in January inside the Lafayette Gardens public housing complex stood out in her mind because the neighborhood had become safer in recent yearsThere used to be a lot of shooting over here  especially right here Ms Davis said as she stood near the intersection of Franklin and Lafayette Avenues It has quieted down a little bit but youve still got robberies going onThere were some signs of insecurity and unease Drugs guns and noise was the neighborhood portrait offered by one man as he walked along Franklin Avenue He declined to give his nameThings have gotten shadier lately said Hannah

collar skyscrapers give way to manicured office parks and strip malls each seemingly a carbon copy of the last But when you look a little closer you notice that in one of those strip malls all the

referring to Southwest Houston home to Alief where Chinatown blends seamlessly into Little Saigon the Hillcroft area recently named the Mahatma Gandhi District where South and Central Asians share retail space and public schools and a host of other ethnic enclaves In this area everyones a minority he saidWe had just sat down for a midmorning feast at Ocean Palace a dim sum hall that in scope more resembles a castle moat included than a restaurant I joined Robin  and his brother Terry  to learn about this neighborhood Chinatown where they had grown up I also wanted to hear about their restaurant Blood Bros BBQ which they run with their childhood friend Quy Hoang  who carries the distinction of being the first VietnameseAmerican pitmaster in the city Mr Hoang had celebrated his birthday the night before and for reasons that you can probably figure out couldnt make it for our allotted  am time slotThe two brothers took control of the ordering conferring in low tones as they checked items off a piece of paper Over a spread of slick cheung fun rolls scalding shrimpfilled har gow dumplings chicken feet turnip cakes and more the Wong brothers told me what it was like growing up in the most diverse section of the most diverse city in the USMy best friends my childhood friends are Chinese Indian Mexican black white You get exposed to so much growing up in Alief Robin said And people here they love it they love trying new things Its part of being from this neighborhood Much of the attention around Blood Bros which opened late last year in the suburb of Bellaire has been on the owners backgrounds Two ChineseAmericans and a VietnameseAmerican pitmaster hitting the Texas trinity of BBQ  brisket pork ribs sausage  does not make for your average BBQ joint That attention only increased when they started thinking more outsidethepit Some days they will do a smoked turkey banh mi which I can say firsthand is just as good as it sounds the charcoal accents of the turkey providing a counterweight to the tanginess of the banh mis traditional fixings Theyve experimented with Thai green curry boudins a Cajun sausage traditionally stuffed with rice liver and aromatics and their brisket fried rice is one of the restaurants most popular sidesIts not about Asianinspired whatever We just make what we like Robin said after pointing out some theoretical riffs he could pull on the dim sum spread out before us only half joking We love the har gow dumplings But what if we smoked themHouston might be the least pedestrianfriendly major city Ive ever encountered You will spend a lot of time in cars Besides the relatively dense Downtown area the city is very spread out I didnt rent a car and probably should have If you choose to go carless youll be taking a lot of Ubers and Lyfts which thankfully are more affordable than in many cities in the United StatesThat being said I found Downtown a great place to stay While with the exception of some new food halls theres not all that much to do in the area if youre not part of the business casual crowd I found myself  minutes from everything whether it was dim sum in Chinatown the quirky bars and cafes of Montrose or Cafeza in the First Ward which hosts a killer open jam session every Monday night The first thing I noticed when entering Afghan Village an unassuming restaurant in a strip mall in Hillcroft a k a the Gandhi District was the flags Side by side Afghan and American flags filled most of the free space behind the counter a vertical American flag was draped across one corner of the restaurant and another small one stood tucked into a corner just above the tandoor The green black and red of the Afghan flag provided the color scheme for the whole spaceOmer Yousafzai  opened Afghan Village over six years ago He came to the United States in  following his brother studied law and then spent years working with the US military in a linguistics recruitment program That brought him back to Afghanistan where American and Afghan soldiers alike craved homecooked Afghan meals instead of the frozen food shipped in from the UAE and elsewhereThats when I started thinking An Afghan restaurant could be a good idea he told me as we dug into bowls of finely balanced lamb and chicken karahi a lightly spiced curry lamb chops and fluffy naan fresh out of the tandoorThere was never any question where he would open that restaurant Theres something about Houston that attracts so many people he said It takes you inWhen I asked him to try and pinpoint the reason for that he identified the citys diversity as a kind of selfperpetuating systemI think the reason is its diversity he said You can blend in here You can claim this place is home and nobody questions thatA childhood friend connected me with Iveth Reyes  a social worker in Houstons public school system saying that she would know where to find legitimate Mexican food Ms Reyes told me to meet her at Raizes Mexican Kitchen in Stafford just outside Houstons city limits which she said was the place to try the real deal from Michoacn the Mexican state where she was born before being brought over the border by her parents at the age of twoThe restaurants owner Aristo Gaspar  also from Michoacn has been in Houston for more than  years and now operates three restaurants around the city He brought out plates of carnitas tacos and enchiladas smothered in a chile reduction that more closely resembled mole than the salsa youll find at TexMex spots Looking up at the menu I noticed that the Mexican dishes were listed right alongside chicken and waffles Mr Gaspar has learned to adapt to many tastesThis food still tastes like home Ms Reyes said as we spread habanero sauce on the plate of enchiladasShe works in an elementary school in Gulfton Houstons most densely populated neighborhood which has long been a first stop for new immigrants to the city She didnt have the same utopian view of crosscultural harmony that I had encountered in others The younger kids all get along its like they dont even know theres a difference between them she told me But as they grow older they start forming cliquesMs Reyes told me that in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Harvey people put their differences aside and got to work repairing what was brokenYou really saw how closeknit this city is and how it can come together she said People were out helping neighbors or bringing their boats into different neighborhoods to help people get aroundShe pointed to her mother Olga Faras as an example With electricity out after the hurricane Ms Reyess mother was called into the school cafeteria where she worked to clean out the freezers Disobeying orders to throw away all the leftover food she loaded up her car instead and drove around the city looking for people in need of a mealIt sucks that it took a tragedy to bring that out of the city but it did Ms Reyes saidAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Erin GriffithSAN FRANCISCO  Slack a workplace messaging company said Monday that it had confidentially filed paperwork for an initial public offering joining the growing number of technology startups heading to the stock marketSlack which is based in San Francisco gave no details about the offerings timing and said it was awaiting a standard review of its paperwork by the Securities and Exchange Commission The move was expected given that Slacks chief executive Stewart Butterfield had long indicated that he planned to take the company public Slack recently hired Goldman Sachs to lead the offeringSlacks confidential filing comes amid a rush by privately held companies to go public this year Many of these startups which have been highly valued by private investors are part of a generation of technology companies known as unicorns Public share sales by the companies are expected to create a bonanza of riches in Silicon Valley for entrepreneurs and venture capital investorsIn December the ridehailing companies Uber and Lyft filed confidential paperwork for their own public offerings Their efforts stalled temporarily last month when a government shutdown hampered the SECs ability to review the companies registration documents Other tech companies expected to go public this year include the online scrapbooking firm PinterestSlack declined to comment beyond its statement about the confidential filingThere is likely to be a strong demand for Slack stock The company was valued at  billion by private investors last year but in recent weeks investment firms have offered to buy its shares at a price that values Slack at  billion according to a person with knowledge of the details who was not authorized to speak publiclySlack also plans an unusual form of public offering called a direct listing the person added Unlike most IPOs in which firms sell stock to public market investors in advance direct listings let a company begin trading its shares on an exchange

sell their stock immediately after the public offering instead of waiting for what is known as a lockup period to expireSlack has little need for cash It raised  million in new financing in August a

AssociatesMr Butterfield began Slack out of a gaming startup Tiny Speck While the companys game products failed to take off its internal communication tool showed promise In  the company began selling that communication tool called SlackStartups quickly adopted Slack and larger companies followed suit The company offers free and paid versions of Slack and counts more than  paying customers including  Fortune  companies Last month Slack said  million people now used its product every day The company generated more than  million in revenue last year said the person with knowledge of the detailsSome companies that have filed to go public have never reached that finish line Over the last year a number of highprofile business software companies that took steps to go public were snapped up by a tech giant at the last minute In November for example Qualtrics an analytics startup sold to SAP for  billion just days before it was set to ring the opening bell at NasdaqGoogle Microsoft and

Mao Ping the renowned Chineseborn author known as Sanmao on what would have been her th birthday She traveled the globe and wrote of her adventures inspiring generations of women to see the world beyond their own homesSanmao died in  in Taiwan but its not hard to imagine that while traveling she had encountered some risk as many women who travel today doAfter the publication of a New York Times article about the dangers women face while traveling alone  a thread in a broader fabric of harassment and violence  readers had lots of suggestions about how to keep women safe Jessica Nabongo who appeared in the article says she stays in hotels with hour security or in Airbnbs that have achieved Superhost status She tries to always take Ubers so that her location is tracked especially at nightParamount among the suggestions were calls for men to be alliesMany readers noted that men can do much to help women  and others  who travel alone by simply not ignoring the bad behavior of others If something seems amiss check on another traveler and if need be intervene safely or alert the authoritiesBelow are other suggestionsBring a basic rubber doorstop and use that to wedge under the inside of your hotellodging door while youre in your room Its almost impossible to push open a door while thats in place Allison Lane  San Francisco Has traveled to Sierra Leone Ghana Kenya Uganda Egypt India Nepal Jamaica and RussiaMany women said they practiced selfdefense tactics like martial arts But they also said that above all Heed your gut trust your instincts Carry pepper spray a pocketknife a laptop or anything that can be used as a weapon or to summon help Theres nothing to lose by going on group tours or guided excursions Others also stressed the same tactics they used at home not walking alone in the dark never taking a drink you havent seen poured and being aware of the friendly strangerSome women suggested carrying two phones in case one is stolen Others said to divide up your belongings and your cash in case youre robbed so that you do not lose everythingFree applications like Chirpey RedZone MayDay Tripwhistle and Noonlight let women flag incidents and areas of danger and show how to contact local law enforcementBe prepared to be bombarded as you step off the bus train or out of the airport These can be some of the most intense moments of solo travel Its good to already know what you want and where you are going next If you dont then just walk away a short distance observe and take a little time to get your bearings before making a decision Overnight buses are the worst when youre traveling alone as a woman More than once Ive woken up with the hand of the man next to me wandering over between my legs Now I put a bag in between me and the next person and the first time he tests the waters even if Im not sure he has bad intentions I make a point to overreact a little Kelsi Lyon  Portland Ore Has traveled to India Indonesia Burma

wearing modest clothing simply made sense and was not a way to blame women for the acts of others The United States State Department notes When it comes to health and security women travelers are more likely to be affected by religious and cultural beliefs of the foreign countries they visit The truth is that women face greater obstacles especially when traveling aloneIn moments between the wonder awe and privilege of traveling through the world I have been followed and harassed by men who assume Im a sex worker not a solo black female traveler simply trying to see a bit of the world When Im traveling solo through Southeast Asia I try to increase my visibility and underscore my humanity by making friends with locals I chat with the older male and female hawkers guards and food sellers I pass buy a thing or two and let them know how long Ill be around In many cultures elders are respected and when you connect with them they take you under their wing Learning a few words of conversation greeting thanks and emergency go a long way in this regard Martha Mukaiwa  Windhoek Namibia Has traveled to Thailand Malaysia Ghana Indonesia Germany France and ItalyI will often hire a local guide to accompany meyou are far less likely to be trifled with when you are with one They speak the language and pave the way I tip at hotels as soon as I get there in countries with a high poverty rate Concierge desk servers maids and luggage I give to them all That way if I need a rescue or anything else I am covered This has often paid off for me I once needed assistance to get back to my hotel during a riot in Ecuador I could not take a taxi  it was the taxi drivers who were rioting I couldnt get back to the hotel and it was the only time I went out without a guide I had tipped everyone at my hotel so when I called for assistance I was covered Caroline Vroom  Sarasota Fla I have traveled to South America Europe Asia Egypt   countries Not always alone But alone quite a lot I sometimes prefer it Many governments issue travel advisories for other countries for their citizens The State Department for example publishes a list of safety levels by country Its website TravelStateGov has information on every country and contact information for the closest American Embassy or ConsulateThe State Department also has advice specifically for female travelers and other groupsConsider enrolling in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program aka STEP or its equivalent in your countryUnicef has data on violence indicators that may be telling for travelers including domestic violence female genital mutilation and female homicide The World Bank has a gender data portal that provides statistics that can signal to women whether its a safe location over allTry to stay in places where other travelers are staying ie try not to stay in a place where you are the only guest Try to be sure you can lock your door when you go to sleep As useless as this may seem I have even locked the zippers of my tent together and slept with the key in my handUse your voice scream and yell when you feel threatened I have even run from an isolated street where I was being surrounded and threatened by a group of men straight into the arms of a random man and woman walking together on a more populated street screaming how happy I was to see them again Elena Steigman  Valencia Spain Has

world is a scary place for us This construct desperately needs to change if equality is ever to be possibleHere are some of my tips Pay for your safety even if it means spending a bit more Take an Uber stay in centralized accommodations and buy a local SIM card so your mobile works internationally If there are other solo female travelers around introduce yourself to them as you will naturally look out for one another along the way and make a new friend Most importantly dont succumb to the fear In my experience the world contains far more kindness and good than bad Book the flight and strap

ColumnistTanitoluwa Adewumi age  skidded around the empty apartment laughing excitedly then leapt onto his dads back I have a home he said in wonderment I have a homeA week ago the boy was homeless studying chess moves while lying on the floor of a shelter in Manhattan Now Tani as he is known has a home a sixfigure bank account scholarship offers from three elite private schools and an invitation to meet President Bill ClintonI think I am still dreaming said Tanis dad Kayode Adewumi I hope I dont wake upI wrote in my column last weekend about Tani as a reminder of the principle that talent is universal even if opportunity is not A Nigerian refugee who had learned chess only a bit more than a year earlier he had just defeated kids from elite private schools to win the New York state chess championship for his age group He lugged a trophy nearly as big as he is back to the homeless shelterNow the story gets even betterAfter my column about this hardworking family a GoFundMe drive raised more than  for Tani his parents and his brother A halfdozen readers offered housing  in a couple of cases palatial quarters Immigration lawyers offered pro bono assistance to the Adewumis who are in the country legally and seeking asylum Three film companies are vying to make movies about TaniFollow Nicholas Kristof as he travels around the United States and the world shedding light on crises and hailing unsung heroes For a behindthescenes look at Nicks gritty journalism sign up for his newsletterThe family settled on one of the more modest and practical housing offers An anonymous donor paid a years rent on a twobedroom apartment near Tanis current school The apartment is clean comfortable and freshly painted without being luxurious and the Adewumis gaze adoringly at their new kitchenI want my moms cooking again Tani mused as he explored the apartment It was bare but another donor had offered furniture sheets and towels Someone else was sending  chess booksHeartfelt thanks to all my readers for this generosity I truly have the best readersWatch Nicholas Kristof visited Tani and his family in their new apartmentAnd now the story gets even betterThe Adewumis have decided that they will not spend a cent of the  GoFundMe money on themselves They will take out a  percent tithe and donate it to their church which helped them while they were homeless and the rest will be channeled through a new Tanitoluwa Adewumi Foundation to help African immigrants who are struggling in the United States the way they were a week agoAnybody who is coming from Africa who is in the position we were in we will help them Mr Adewumi said acknowledging that details need to be worked outI asked them how they could turn down every penny of such a huge sum Didnt they want a celebration dinner New iPhones A vacationIm a hardworking guy Mr Adewumi explained He has two jobs He drives for Uber with a rented car and sells real estate through Brick  Mortar Someone has now offered him a free car so that he can keep more of the money he makes driving and Tanis mom was just offered a job as a health care aide at a hospitalI asked Tani if he was OK with seeing the  disappear He shrugged I want to help other kids he said I dont mindSurely I pressed him there was some material object he coveted There was a long silence Maybe a computer he acknowledgedThe family was tempted by the offers of full scholarships at top private schools But Tani and his parents decided that while he might accept such a scholarship for middle school he would be loyal and stick with the public elementary school PS  that taught him chess and waived his fees for the chess clubThis school showed confidence in Tanitoluwa his mom Oluwatoyin Adewumi told the PS  principal Jane Hsu So we return the confidence And then overcome with emotion the mom and the principal huggedTheres a risk that a triumph like this leaves the impression that charity is the solution rather than a way to fill gaps Fundamentally we need comprehensive systems in place to support needy kids We would never build a bridge or subway with volunteers and donations so why entrust an even more urgent cause  homeless children  to charityTani thrived because everything fell into place a good school a dedicated chess teacher and devoted parents committed to taking their son to every chess practice The challenge is to replicate that supportive environment for all the other Tanis out there with public services and private philanthropy alikeOne challenge I face is that readers often want to donate just to a particular individual I write about without addressing the larger social problem So its thrilling to see Tani and his parents use their good fortune to help other anonymous kids in need In that theres a lesson for all of usGod has already blessed me Mr Adewumi told me I want to release my blessing to othersThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor Wed like to hear

Everything always takes along drawing materials a fidget spinner and a Nintendo switch to make a crosscountry flight go fasterBy Nell McShane WulfhartThe comedian Adam Conover has made a name for himself by upturning cultural norms and assumptions His mythbusting television show Adam Ruins Everything is in its third season on TruTVMr Conovers episode on air travel led him to some interesting findings I like so many people a few years ago got sucked into the frequent fliermile game he says I started getting credit cards and trying to figure out how to maximize my miles And now Im switching to all cashback because I have recognized what a labyrinthine scam it is The airlines have devalued all of their miles for economy travelers to such an extent that if youre just the average person going to visit your family a couple times a year on an economy ticket youre going to earn so few miles it would take you decades to ever earn one of those mystical free firstclass flightsAnother thing he learned while researching the episode is the illusion of the socalled Golden Age of flying Everyone uses Mad Men as an example You know Don Draper taking his elegant crosscountry flights and the stewardess bringing him a neat scotch and he looks all classy We dispel that image by sharing what flying really looked like back then In the s planes flew a little lower than they do now In the s and the s they flew much lower to the ground It was a horrible experience There was a lot more turbulence and it was a lot more dangerous People were much more likely to die in a plane crash But the cabins were also full of the smell of cigarette smoke and fuel fumes because they werent as good at separating the fuel fumes The main reason that barf bags are on planes today is because the cabins were constantly full of the smell of jet fuel and cigarette smoke and there was so much more turbulence so people were just constantly throwing upHeres what he cant travel withoutThere is nothing better than getting to just dig in and seriously play a video game for a sixhour flight from New York to LA Into the Breach is a wonderful strategy game where you play that you are trying to stop an alien invasion But of course Zelda Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey are just two of the most superlative games ever made and so when I have time to completely lose myself in those its really really a joy I find that I have a lot of suppressed energy when Im on a plane for a long period so when Im holding a fidget spinner being able to play with it and just sort of run my hands over it helps me out quite a lot it helps me relax Ive gotten into an Uber and then said Oh wait hold on one second and run back in to get the fidget spinner because I knew I would need it on the planeMy domestic partner Lisa Hanawalt is a cartoonist and the designer of BoJack Horseman Ive noticed when shes in a situation where shes trying to distract herself with her hands she just has a sketchbook to draw in and I started doing that too Now the problem is that Ive run out of stuff to draw on a plane so Ive drawn the back of the head of the person sitting in front of me about five or six times Those are some of my best pieces Lisa looks at these and goes Oh my God youre a very good artist Maybe Ill do a gallery show one day of the drawings of the backs of peoples headsI find that a really restful relaxing way to spend time on a plane is to listen to an audiobook while drawing I use the Libby app to check out audiobooks from my public library Right now Im listening to Evicted by Matthew Desmond which is a really incredible set of stories of poverty in Milwaukee and about the underreported epidemic of eviction that is contributing to the cycle of poverty The cool thing is its the rare piece of nonfiction that isnt just dumping the policy problem on you Its incredibly beautifully reported personal accounts of individual families and what their lives are like on a daytoday

Ms Kitroeff adds If that happens orders for the  Max  the companys bestselling jet  could dry up handing an advantage to Boeings European rival Airbus which makes a similar plane the Aneo But outright cancellations of orders seem unlikely because airlines typically put down large depositsThe British Parliament voted last night to oppose the prospect of Britains withdrawal from the EU without an agreement with the bloc writes Stephen Castle of the NYTThe vote was another harsh blow to Prime Minister Theresa May Mr Castle writes A critical part of her strategy has been to play for time and use the fastapproaching threat of a chaotic disorderly and economically damaging exit as leverageMrs May said that if lawmakers can support a deal in the next few days she could request a Brexit delay until June  to put it in place he adds But that appears unlikely Parliament rejected the agreement she negotiated with the European Union in a humiliating  to  vote in January and defeated it again on Tuesday  to Without an approved agreement a longer extension would be needed forcing Britain to take part in European Parliament elections in May That suggests Mrs May might make one more effort to get her unpopular plan through Parliament threatening hardline Brexit supporters that if it fails she will seek a long delay that could potentially mean Brexit never happeningBrookfield Asset

with a fake voiceover for MSNBC  Now that the Mueller report turned out to be a big fat zero were back to prison shows  the sketch set up an episode of Lockup Chino Correctional Facility in which inmates played by Chris Redd Kyle Mooney and Kenan Thompson boasted about the crimes that had put them behind barsEnter Kate McKinnon playing the actress Lori Loughlin Oh yeah McKinnon told the gang You think thats insane I paid  grand to get my daughter into USCShe added Thats not including the  grand I blew on tuitionShe also said she owned the prison guards because I helped their kids get into a really competitive preK and boasted that she was a Nation of Islam member because shed bought my way in for  grandNext in the prison cell was Pete Davidson playing the lawyer Michael Avenatti  who was indicted this week on dozens of chargesIm accused of crimes you cant even conceive of he told the other inmates Like blackmailing a sneaker company And stealing taxes from a coffee shop to fund a racecar team Im so shady that a porn star once said that she needs to distance herself from meHe said he still planned to run for president announcing his ticket as Avenatti Baldwin Played by Michael

immemorial and this week it returned to the scene of that ABC daytime show Leslie Jones played the host Whoopi Goldberg Im as surprised as you that this show is a fit for me while Cecily Strong and Villaseor played her roundtable partners Abby Huntsman and Ana Navarro But the sketch focused mainly on the recent bickering between the hosts Joy Behar McKinnon and Meghan McCain Aidy BryantAs Bryant

the sunlight Like you can be lord of darkness on the internet but when seven cops have you pinned to the sidewalk you cant be like I summon the power of emailsJost went on to note that Trump had been asked about Assanges arrest showing a video in which the president says I know nothing really about him Its not my deal in lifeWhat is your deal in life Jost asked Im just genuinely curious since you

releasing detained immigrants into sanctuary cities to send a message to Democrats Whats the message Have some more voters Yeah man thatll show em I dont know how theyre going to handle a bunch of immigrants in a city like  New York You cant scare us with more immigrants That just means faster Ubers and more ElmosOr maybe he should send immigrants to New York Che continued prompting an image of

year elite college admissions has been touched by three different but related scandals The newest one is also the most entertaining because it includes pretend water polo players staged standardized tests and outright bribery all to help desperate rich people and TV stars buy their progeny into a topflight schoolThe other scandals are less amusing involving dilemmas of race and meritocracy with no celebrity leaven One involves revelations from the latest affirmativeaction lawsuit which has exposed how Harvards rejection of qualified Asian applicants seems to uncomfortably resemble the old Jewish quotas of the s and s The other involves a brace of Ivy League admissions offices being taken in by a toughlove Louisiana school that produced fraudulent transcripts for its AfricanAmerican students while its founder treated the kids brutally behind the scenesIn their different ways all these scandals feed into two critiques of elite academia one more leftwing and one more rightwing which take different routes to the same condemnatory claim These schools claim to be meritocratic but they arentListen to The Argument podcast every Thursday morning with Ross Douthat Michelle Goldberg and David LeonhardtThe leftwing critique focuses on class noting that the desperaterichparents scandal is just an exaggerated and criminal version of the general way that legacy admissions and athletic programs boost wealthy applicants making elite schools into havens of privilege despite their bestandbrightest boastThe rightwing critique focuses on race arguing that racial preferences are corrosive to meritbased admissions because the quest for racial balance creates unfair and discrediting results  a not too many Asians please quota system a seeming tilt against lowermiddleclass white applicants and a bias to the point of credulity in the Louisiana case in favor of AfricanAmericans and HispanicsYou can blend the two critiques by noting how racial bias in admissions and economic privilege interact  the tilt against lowermiddleclass whites may reflect the fact that schools want richer kids and their tuition dollars to take up the white slots while affirmative action can benefit the children of wealthy immigrant families as much as the descendants of slavesBlending the two critiques can get you the centrist prescription for reform Elite schools should emphasize classbased rather than racebased affirmative action the argument runs while phasing out preferences for jocks and legacies that give privileged whites their own leg up  a combination that might yield a stilldiverse more authentically meritocratic upper classI used to believe in this prescription But lately my skepticism about meritocracy itself has made me doubt whether we need more of itElite institutions by their very nature are not a massopportunity system Even especially in a democratic society they exist to shape a ruling class And the tension between legacy admissions and affirmative action and meritbased admissions is really a tension between three ways that a ruling class can be legitimated  through intergenerational continuity through representation and through aptitudeThe more meritocracy argument against both legacies and racial quotas implicitly assumes that aptitude  some elixir of IQ and work ethic  is what our elite primarily lacksBut is that really our upper classs problem What if our elite is already diligent and howdoyoulikethemapples smaht  the average SAT score for the Harvard class of  is a robust   and deficient primarily in memory and obligation wisdom and service and patriotismIn that case continuity and representation as embodied by legacy admissions and racial quotas might actually be better legitimizers for elite universities to cultivate than the spirit of talentberalles It might be better if more Ivy League students thought of themselves as representatives of groups and heirs of family obligation than as Promethean Talents elevated by their own amazing native gifts It might be better if elite universities in being open about seeking a specific ethnic mix and encouraging an intergenerational tradition ceded a certain amount of talent to public universities and even saw their average SAT score go downAnd who knows  the Ivies might even teach undergraduates a little more rigorously if they werent so determined to prove they admitted the smartest kids by never ever letting anyone flunk outThis is all admittedly fanciful because to be open about racial quotas would require private schools to sacrifice federal funds and to emphasize legacy advantages would cost them in the US News rankings And it might be culturally impossible given the sway of the meritocratic idea for elite schools to lean into their aristocratic profile rather than insisting in whatever defiance of reality that they are offering opportunity to allBut the more meritocracy world  the world where bipartisan criticism produces a Harvard class of  with fewer legacies and nonAsian minorities and an average SAT of   could be worse than what we have Because such a changes essential premise that intelligence alone really merits power is the premise

Nicholas KristofOpinion ColumnistIn a homeless shelter in Manhattan an yearold boy is walking to his room carrying an awkward load in his arms unfazed by screams from a troubled resident The boy is a Nigerian refugee with an uncertain future but he is beamingHe cant stop grinning because the awkward load is a huge trophy almost as big as he is This homeless third grader has just won his category at the New York State chess championshipMuch of the news of the last week has focused on wealthy families buying access to great universities either illegally through bribes or legally through donations There is no question that America is a tilted playing field that gives wealthy children huge advantagesSo we should all grin along with Tanitoluwa Adewumi the newly crowned chess champion for kindergarten through third grade He went undefeated at the state tournament last weekend outwitting children from elite private schools with private chess tutorsWhats even more extraordinary is that Tani as he is known learned chess only a bit more than a year ago His play has skyrocketed month by month and he now has seven trophies by his bed in the homeless shelterI want to be the youngest grandmaster he told meTanis family fled northern Nigeria in  fearing attacks by Boko Haram terrorists on Christians such as themselves I dont want to lose any loved ones his father Kayode Adewumi told meSo Tani his parents and his older brother arrived in New York City a bit more than a year ago and a pastor helped steer them to a homeless shelter Tani began attending the local elementary school PS  which has a parttime chess teacher who taught Tanis class how to playTani enjoyed the game and prodded his mom Oluwatoyin Adewumi to ask if he could join the chess clubHe is interested in the chess program which he will like to be participating in Mrs Adewumi who is working hard to master American English emailed the club She explained that she could not pay the fees for the program because the family was living in a shelterRussell Makofsky who oversees the PS  chess program waived the fees and a year ago the boy took part in his first tournament with the lowest rating of any participant His rating is now  and rising fast By comparison the worlds best player Magnus Carlsen stands at Tani has an aggressive style of play and in the state tournament the coaches watching from the sidelines were shocked when he sacrificed a bishop for a lowly pawn Alarmed they fed the move into a computer and it agreed with Tani recognizing that the gambit would improve his position several moves laterIts an inspiring example of how lifes challenges do not define a person said Jane Hsu the principal of PS  which held a pep rally to celebrate Tanis victory Hsu noted that while Tani lacks a home he has enormously supportive parents dedicated to seeing him succeedTanis mom cant play chess but takes him every Saturday to a threehour free practice session in Harlem and she attends his tournaments His dad lets Tani use his laptop each evening to practice And although religion is extremely important to the family the parents let Tani miss church when necessary to attend a tournamentTani is rich beyond measure in the strength love and support of his family Makofsky told meTanis dad has two jobs He rents a car that he uses to drive for Uber and he has also become a licensed real estate salesman Tanis mom has passed a course to become a home health aide Meeting them its easy to see where Tanis scrappy diligence came fromIt is sometimes tough for Tani His parents say that he once came home from school crying after classmates teased him for being homeless And at an immigration hearing last fall he burst into tears when he misunderstood the judge to say that the family would be deportedI feel American he explained In fact the familys asylum request is dragging on with the next hearing scheduled for AugustTani tries to put that out of his mind He lies on the floor of the shelter and practices chess for hours each evening  now preparing for the elementary national championship in MayHe is so driven said his school chess teacher Shawn Martinez He does  times more chess puzzles than the average kid He just wants to be betterMakofsky shook his head wonderingly One year to get to this level to climb a mountain and be the best of the best without family resources he said Ive never seen itTani is a reminder that refugees enrich this nation  and that talent is universal even if opportunity is not Back in Nigeria his parents say his brilliance at chess would never have had an outletThe US is a dream country his dad told me Thank God I live in the greatest city in the world which is New York New YorkUpdate Many readers have asked if they can help

Associated PressNEW YORK  Hembert Figueroa just wanted a tacoSo he was surprised to learn the dollar bills in his pocket were no good at Dos Toros Taqueria in Manhattan one of a small but growing number of establishments across the US where customers can only pay by card or smartphoneCashfree stores are generating a backlash among some activists and liberalleaning policymakers who say the practice discriminates against people like Figueroa who either lack bank accounts or rely on cash for many transactionsFigueroa an ironworker had to stand to the side holding his taco until a sympathetic cashier helped him find another customer willing to pay for his meal with a card in exchange for cashI had money and I couldnt pay he saidThe issue got some highprofile attention this week when retail giant Amazon bowed to pressure from activists and agreed to accept cash at more than  cashless stores including its Amazon Go convenience stores which have no cashiers and its book shops Amazon declined to say when the change would happenThere is no federal law that requires stores to accept cash so lawmakers are working on the issue at the state and city levelEarlier this year Philadelphia became the first city to ban cashless stores despite efforts by Amazon to dissuade it New Jersey passed a statewide ban soon after and a similar ban is working its way through the New York City Council Before this year there was only one jurisdiction that required businesses to accept cash Massachusetts which passed a law nearly  years agoThe potential societal cost of a cashless economy I think outweighs the potential benefits for businesses said Ritchie Torres a New York City councilman for the South Bronx who introduced the billPolicymakers argue that while cashless enterprises arent widespread now the practice could expand to more services including some that cater to lowerincome peopleWalmartowned Sams Club opened its first cashierless store in Dallas last year using technology that allows customers to scan and pay for items with their smartphones Kroger has installed similar technology in about  stores nationwideStadiums in Tampa Bay Florida and Atlanta have started to go cashless or nearly cashless and the Barclays Center where the Brooklyn Nets play is now effectively cashless as wellAdvocates for cashless bans worry technology is moving too fast for the  of American households   million  who do not have a bank account according to the Federal Deposit Insurance CorporationFigueroa is among the much larger group considered underbanked meaning they have a primary bank account but regularly rely on alternative financial services like check cashers More than  million US households are underbanked according to the FDICThe issue disproportionately affects AfricanAmerican and Hispanic communities About  of AfricanAmerican and  of Hispanic households have no bank accounts compared to just  of white households according to the FDICFigueroa an immigrant from the Dominican Republic only opened a credit union account two years ago It took another year to build up enough funds to use his debit card regularlyHe still occasionally relies on a check casher if he needs money quickly and much of his income comes in cash from his weekend job as a busboy He has no credit card and no apps on his phone and has only shopped online three timesBusiness owners who go cashless say they are following the lead of the majority of customers who are abandoning cash payments Retailers are under pressure to cater to customers with heightened expectations for fast and seamless service driven by companies like Amazon Uber and GrubhubLeo Kremer coowner of Dos Toros said the volume of cash transactions at his stores fell from about  a decade ago to  last year That made the cost and logistics of handling cash especially onerous Before going cashless Dos Toros locations were robbed twiceStill Kremer said the company would adjust if legally required to accept cashThere are no bad guys on this issue Everyone is trying to do the right thing and make sure there are no unintended consequences he saidCritics say banning cashfree stores is an overreactionThere are no overall estimates on how many US stores have gone cashless but it remains a rarity In New York City the trend appears to be gaining traction mostly with fast casual dining establishments like Dos Toros Far more common are stores that require a minimum purchase for noncash paymentsTo call this a trend is a bit of an exaggeration said J Craig Shearman a spokesman for the National Retail Federation in Washington Its not something the average customer would expect to see at every store at the mall any time soonIn testimony to a New York City Council committee Kremer argued that businesses that consistently serve the unbanked and underbanked population arent going to go cashless It wouldnt make sense for themBut financial experts who work with lowincome people caution against making assumptions about the shopping preferences or buying power of those who rely on cashIm uncomfortable with the idea that certain people dont shop

Joe Pisani contributed to this report from New YorkAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Daisuke WakabayashiSAN FRANCISCO  Alphabets board of directors agreed to pay a former top Google executive as much as  million when he resigned from the company in  after being accused of groping a subordinateThe previously undisclosed sum was in the separation agreement for Amit Singhal a senior vice president who ran Googles search operations until February  The amount was revealed on Monday in a shareholder lawsuit accusing the board of directors of Alphabet the parent of Google of shirking their responsibilities by agreeing to pay executives accused of misconduct instead of firing them for causeThe suit was part of the fallout over how Google has handled sexual harassment cases The New York Times reported in October that Google had handsomely paid several highranking executives in separation agreements after they were credibly accused of sexual harassment even though the men could have been fired for cause In one case Google handed a  million exit package to Andy Rubin who used to head its Android division after he was accused of sexual misconductThe shareholder lawsuit was filed in January in California Superior Court with redactions in the passages referring to board discussions An amended version was filed on Monday without the redactionsFrank Bottini an attorney for the shareholders said the boardapproved payments were an abdication of responsibilityA Google spokeswoman said Monday that the company had made many changes to our workplace and taken an increasingly hard line on inappropriate conduct by people in positions of authority She added There are serious consequences for anyone who behaves inappropriately at GoogleAccording to the amended suit Google agreed to pay Mr Singhal  million a year for two years and between  million and  million in the third year as long as he was not employed by a competitor He agreed to take a job at Uber about a year after his departure then resigned from the ridehailing company a few weeks later when the sexual harassment claim at Google became publicMr Singhal left Google after an employee said he had groped her at an offsite event Google investigated the allegation and found that Mr Singhal had been inebriated The company also concluded that the employees account was credible At the time Mr Singhal said he wanted to spend more time with his family and focus on his philanthropyMr Singhal did not respond to a request for commentThe suit also cited board meeting minutes confirming The Timess report of the  million exit package for Mr Rubin A Google employee with whom he was having an extramarital relationship accused him of coercing her into oral sex She filed a complaint and the companys investigation found her account to be credible The separation agreement for Mr Rubin was also contingent on his agreeing to refrain from working with rivalsThis lawsuit simply repeats much of the recent media coverage mischaracterizes Andys departure from Google and sensationalizes claims made about Andy by his exwife Mr Rubins lawyer Ellen Stross said in a statement Monday Andy acknowledges having had a consensual relationship with a Google employee However Andy strongly denies any misconduct and we look forward to telling his story in courtThe payout for Mr Rubin sparked widespread outrage at Google and last fall prompted a walkout of  employees who demanded that the company improve its handling of harassment claims After the walkout Google ended its practice of forced arbitration for claims of sexual harassment or assaultGoogle Walkout for Real Change the organizer of the walkout said a statement Monday The details of these outrageous exit packages signed off personally by Googles executives are a symptom of a culture that protects and awards all harassers Google is badly in need of accountable leadership and real systemic changesThe lawsuit also provided a window into the workings of Alphabets board and the power exerted by Larry Page a cofounder of Google and Alphabets chief executiveAccording to the suit the boards compensation committee proposed paying Mr Rubin a salary of  in April  with the opportunity for him to get a bonus of more than double his salary At the time Mr Rubin was an adviser to Google and no longer running the Android businessThe lawsuit said Mr Rubin had declined to accept that pay package until he had spoken to Mr Page In August  Mr Page awarded a  million stock grant to Mr RubinEight days after the  million grant was awarded a Google official emailed the board committee asking for approval of Mr Rubins compensation Without any additional documents the committee members  Paul S Otellini Intels former chief executive who died in  John Doerr of the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins and Ram Shriram of the venture firm Sherpalo Ventures  said they had approved it according to the suitMr Doerr and Mr Shriram did not immediately respond to requests for commentGoogle awarded Mr Rubin the grant even though there was an active investigation into his misconduct When Mr Page ultimately decided to part ways with Mr Rubin the  million stock grant was a sizable bargaining chip that Mr Rubin used to negotiate his exit package since an executives stock compensation is often taken into consideration during settlement

is suddenly rich Is he any wiserBy Bret StephensOpinion ColumnistI wrote a bestselling book If you write a bestselling book you can be a millionaire too With those insouciant words Bernie Sanders acknowledged on Tuesday that he has joined the ranks of the millionaires and billionaires he has vilified for most of his careerCondolences senatorSanders has plenty of company In  there were  million American households with a net worth of between  million and  million not including their primary residence Thats an increase of about  from  Another  million households are worth between  million and  million and  households are still north of thatNor is Sanders alone in Congress even  or especially  among Democrats About half of all Senate Democrats in  were millionaires That includes Virginias Mark Warner worth  million according to Roll Call Connecticuts Richard Blumenthal  million and Californias Dianne Feinstein  million At the time Sanderss net worth came to zero a sum that was at least consistent with his worldview though he did somehow manage to own three homes But now hes flush and destined to pay higher taxes so maybe his opinions will change In his biography of Harry Truman David McCullough noted that the rd president was shocked by how little money was left to him after he had to pay  percent of his hardwon earnings in state and federal taxesWith Sanders I wont get my hopes up But his experience of sudden wealth ought at least to temper the hard and ugly edges of his classwar politics Getting rich is not a form of theft As often as not its the result of a service Being rich is not a sin Typically its the result of long labor patient saving prudent investment gutsy risktaking and some stroke of originalityAnd becoming richer is no shame Wealth and philanthropy tend to correlate Of Americas  richest people four have given away at least  billion andor  percent of their net worth to charity In terms of charitable donations by individuals as a percentage of GDP the United States is by far the most generous giving  billion to charity in  The average American gives nearly twice as much to charity as the average New Zealander the runnerup among giving nations A Sanders supporter might concede some of this while rejoining that great wealth is inherently corrupting and unnecessary and that great inequality is inherently dangerous to democracy and just plain wrong Thats the thinking that now animates the movement on the left to get rid of billionaires altogether or at least cut them down to size with punitive taxation Yet its never been clear why its immoral to be a billionaire but not a mere millionaire  other than perhaps the envy that those whose income is in the th percentile college professors for instance tend to feel toward those in the th finance people Is there a consistent moral principle that distinguishes the relative goodness of five six or even seven zeroes in your portfolio versus the badness of eight or a full nineIts also unclear how Steve Jobss or Bill Gatess fortunes ever denied anyone a penny except for the dollars voluntarily shelled out to purchase iPhones and Windows In the US billionaires dont take wealth as Russian oligarchs Saudi princes or Chinese officials do They create it And in creating it they create jobs opportunities services choice equity efficiencies and sometimes even beauty  the reason why capitalist societies are invariably more attractive and dynamic than noncapitalist onesIs this an argument for unregulated capitalism No Is it a claim that billionaires have superior virtues No Does it suggest that the uberrich should have greater title to our political life than the rest of us No Does it mean we can only find earthly fulfillment through profitmaximization rather than joyoptimizationCome onBut the idea that people can be judged as individuals based on the economic class to which they belong is one of the foulest in history matching if not exceeding in its murderous consequences the legacies of racism and colonialism combined When Sanders inveighs against billyinaehs millyinaehs being presumably no longer as odious to him today as they were just a few years ago he is engaged in a form of stereotyping that is no less bigoted or dangerous for being aimed at so fewStill I wont give up all hope that Sanders might not come to see the error of his thinking After leaving the US Senate the late George McGovern  Sanderss precursor in many ways  decided he would try his hand in the world of business by operating an inn and restaurant in Connecticut It didnt go so wellMy business associates and I he wrote in a memorable  Wall Street Journal oped also lived with federal state and local rules that were all passed with the objective of helping employees protecting the environment raising tax dollars for schools protecting our customers from fire hazards etc While I never have doubted the worthiness of any of these goals the concept that most often eludes legislators is Can we make consumers pay the higher prices for the increased operating costs that accompany public regulation and government reporting requirements with reams of red tape It is a

independent ad agency Now it needs to make sure the two cultures merge without squelching the energy that made the agency such a standoutAccentures deeper push into advertising reflects the ad industrys rapidly changing competitive landscape The companys marketing arm has grown significantly in recent years as broader shifts in consumer behavior have reordered what advertising truly encompasses In the past it was about coming up with attentiongrabbing ads Now it is also about providing broader consumer experiencesThat has made the fight for marketing dollars that much more fierce with traditional ad agencies jostling with Silicon Valley firms consultants and upstarts for businessWere working with clients to reinvent how consumers buy their particular products and services Brian Whipple the chief executive of Accenture Interactive the companys digital agency said He pointed to the development of wearable devices for Carnival Cruise Lines and new fittingroom technology at clothing storesWe expect to have an Uberlike Amazonlike experience when we go to a restaurant or go to a retail store or when we order products online he saidAs the firm takes on more ambitious consumer experience projects for brands it must incorporate media and advertising and brand strategy and the like and thats where Droga and team come into play Mr Whipple  saidRead more about the uncertain future of advertising as we know itTerms of the deal which was announced on Wednesday were not disclosed The acquisition was roughly a year in the making and is expected to close by the end of MayDroga which employs more than  people will become part of Accenture InteractiveAbsorbing an independent agency into a larger entity can pose its own issues however said Greg Paull a principal at R a consulting firm that works with agencies and marketersIt will be a challenge to mix the two cultures together because they are quite different he said Still he added its shifting the paradigm from a purely creativeled business to more of a strategic and consultingled businessDroga which was founded in  by David Droga has become one of the bestknown independent ad agencies in the United States The  was appended because Mr Droga  grew up as the youngest of five brothers Droga last reported annual revenue for  when it exceeded  millionSome of its notable campaigns include Under Armours with the dancer Misty Copeland Anna Kendricks almostSuper Bowl commercial for Newcastle Brown Ale a digital campaign in which the beer company imagined the megahuge football spot it would have made if it could have afforded one and this years Game of Thrones surprise Super Bowl ad with Bud Light Droga is also responsible for The New York Timess ad campaign featuring the motto The Truth Is HardBeing subsumed into a larger consulting firm represents a sharp turn Other prominent independent agencies have steadfastly maintained their autonomy In  Wieden  Kennedy in Portland Ore which is best known for its work with Nike backed a new agency in Austin Tex on the condition that it would remain independent Colleen DeCourcy Wieden  Kennedys copresident said at the time Our whole abhorrence of controlling interest in anything is that you lose the independence to put the work firstMr Whipple pushed back at the notion that consultants did not understand creativity the way that traditional agencies did saying that the cultures of Accenture Interactive and Droga were more similar than people might expectAccenture Interactive has its own culture that is really in no way consultinglike but I will say if it were to have elements of that I think thats a good thing he said Its offices arent full of people in suits and ties talking about financials he addedAccenture Interactives revenue rose  percent to  billion for the year that ended Aug  accounting for about a fifth of Accentures overall revenue The unit established in  has acquired dozens of firms in recent years but Droga is its biggest purchase and is expected to give Accenture Interactive new clout in North AmericaMr Droga who will remain the agencys creative chairman said that while he had fielded acquisition offers before he felt Accenture and his agency complemented each otherYou can have the best advertising out there but if the ecommerce is not good or the relationship with the customer and the experience isnt great then thats irrelevant Mr Droga saidMr Paull said the deal represented a seismic shift for the industryI really think its going to change the mindset of how consultants are perceived he said While Accenture Interactive has bought several creative agencies overseas they were nothing of this scale and nothing as UScentric as thisMr Droga and Mr Whipple said they had started acquisition talks about a year ago using the code name Stellwagen for the deal a reference to a marine sanctuary Mr Whipple is an avid fisherman Accenture said it would share more about the internal structure involving Mr Droga his executives and Mr Whipple by the end of MayAnalysts and investors have increasingly posed questions to big advertising holding companies about the threat posed by consulting firms In recent months executives from the holding companies WPP and IPG have acknowledged their presence in public comments but noted that the firms were not yet big competitors in the creative realmThey have not made the investment in creativity that we believe is necessary to compete Frank Mergenthaler IPGs chief financial officer said of consulting firms at a conference last monthMr Whipple said that he viewed Accenture Interactives work in customer experience as a new category and that the firm was more likely to team up with the holding companies than compete with them Those partnerships may happen less frequently with the acquisition of Droga though he saidAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byCredits for Seamless Uber Eats and the like are a very stcentury way to support a grieving friendBy Erin Van Der MeerWhen my mother died suddenly last year at the age of  they started coming gift cards for Seamless GrubHub and Uber Eats that pinged softly in my inbox Dont forget to eat read the note accompanying one credit Another said Because you cant eat flowersMany of these sympathy gifts came from friends living nearby who might have in an alternate universe brought over foilcovered baking dishes filled with cheesy casseroles But in New York City and in  there are some hurdles to practicing that traditional grieving ritual tiny kitchens crowded subway commutes a  work culture Then there are dietary restrictions to consider For all my loved ones knew I could have stopped eating dairy or Tom Bradyd tomatoesSending a grieving person a gift card instead of delivering homemade food to ones doorstep may defy the wisdom of Emily Post But for millions of people who use mealdelivery apps the funds can come as a welcome gesture of practical kindnessAfter a memorial service for her mother in Alberta Canada Katherine AustinEvelyn a philanthropic consultant returned to her home in Brooklyn to find that a group of friends had sent her a  Seamless creditWhen my grandmother died years ago people brought lasagnas and casseroles Ms AustinEvelyn  said The Seamless gift card felt like my generations version of thatShe didnt mind that the food wasnt homemadeIt achieved the same outcome she said which was an expression of care and thoughtfulness and also being extremely usefulThese apps have made it easier than ever to order takeout and using them has become a habit for many people Americans spent  billion on food delivery services in  up nine percent from the previous year according to the NPD GroupIn addition to their convenience these credits are an invitation to seek comfort Order any food you crave be it pasta from a favorite Italian restaurant or a steaming hot bowl of ramen without worrying about the cost Or food waste Or how long before the Pyrex dishes piling up in your cupboard might constitute hoardingCatherine Down  an American who has lived in Paris for six years writing about travel and food said that sending credits helps her to be present for her loved ones living in the US when they experience lossWhen a friend had a miscarriage I really felt the distance Ms Down recalled So she ordered snacks for her friend  wasabi peas mochi frozen dumplings  and had them delivered to her home She said that using Instacart and Seamless in these kinds of scenarios makes her feel proactive and takes some of the load off the loved oneAll you need to send a Seamless gift card is the recipients email which makes it easy to support even a distant acquaintance But with its convenience comes the possibility of the gesture seeming generic or lazy depending on the person and your relationship to themAmy Cunningham a funeral director and the owner of Fitting Tribute a funeral home in Brooklyn said the gift card should be for a service the person already uses and for a generous amountFood is helpful but give it in abundance Ms Cunningham  said You need too much of something when life seems thin and lacking in any kind of pleasureMs Cunningham suggested spending  enough to feed four to six people Its also OK to ask questions before you spendPersonalize Ms Cunningham said Call someone closer to them to find out what they like and need It could be groceries a pot of food or a basket of beautiful fruit That will do better than  on SeamlessRebecca Soffer  the coauthor of the book Modern Loss lost her mother when she was  then her father four years later My tiny apartment was filled with at least  Edible Arrangements in the days after my mothers death Ms Soffer said so I think Seamless vouchers are a terrific gesture She believes a smaller amount   or   is fine as long as its only the first stepUse it as a catalyst for more meaningful involvement she said Text I sent you something let me know if you want me to come over and share it with you Set weekly calendar reminders to offer something they might need  say to watch their kids clean their bathroom or take them out for a stiff drinkIt might also pay to set reminders to check in at three months six months and a year While a Seamless credit never expires the social insulation that immediately follows a death tends to wane after a few weeks The best thing you can do for someone living with loss is to reach out after the visitors have stopped showing up in waves while your friend is still stranded on the strange island of griefAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Stanley ReedThe earnings of Saudi Arabias giant oil company have long been a mystery kept under wraps by the countrys government But on Monday Saudi Aramco opened its books revealing that it generated  billion in net income last year making it probably the worlds most profitable company by farIt handily beat Apple  billion in net income in  and ran laps around other oil companies like Royal Dutch Shell  billion and Exxon Mobil  billion The disclosure reveals a company that is hugely profitable but also tightly bound to one country and the price of oilAramco issued the financial data as it prepares to borrow up to  billion through a bond sale in what could signal a more aggressive approach to capitalraising for both the company and Saudi Arabia which is seeking to cut its dependence on oil and gas revenueThe money will help finance Aramcos  billion purchase of most of a stateowned petrochemical company from Saudi Arabias sovereign wealth fund whose chairman is Crown Prince Mohammed bin SalmanThe crown prince wants to diversify Saudi Arabias economy and the sovereign wealth fund has been investing in technology companies like Uber and Tesla as a way of doing so A planned stock sale by Aramco was expected to raise money for that purpose but it was postponed last yearThe sale of a stake in Saudi Basic Industries the petrochemical company appears to be an alternative way to raise the fundsWhile the crown prince pursues new investments and tries to recover from the political fallout caused by the killing of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi last year Aramco also appears to be trying to make itself into a broader energy producer and thus more attractive if the government decides once again to try to sell a slice of the companyAramcos chief executive Amin Nasser has said that the company is pursuing international acquisitions in areas like liquefied natural gas a chilled fuel that can be transported globally on ships like oilThe financial results also show how the companys fortunes rise and fall with the price of oil In  for instance a time of low prices the company reported only  billion in net incomeFor investors Aramcos ties to the Saudi government are also a persistent concern Unlike Exxon and Chevron its revenue streams are highly dependent on a single country that could face real instability risks Ayham Kamel an analyst at Eurasia Group a consulting firm wrote in a recent note to clientsBut analysts said that the financial information revealed on Monday showed that Aramco had plenty of firepower for more dealsAramco has a huge amount of room to issue debt said David G Staples a managing director at Moodys Investors Service which issued a credit rating for Aramco on MondayMr Staples and a colleague Rehan Akbar noted that the company had already achieved enormous size and profitability without borrowing or selling stock to investors In  Aramco paid about  billion to the government in dividends taxes and royaltiesMoodys attributed Aramcos profitability in part to economies of scale stemming from enormous production volumes extracted from oil and gas assets of unmatched size Aramco has some of the worlds largest oil fields leading to very low costsAramcos scale of production in combination with its vast hydrocarbon resources is a very strong competitive advantage Moodys analysts wroteThe prospectus reveals some longhidden details about the size of Saudi Arabias oil fields Chief among these is a monster called Ghawar which extends for about  miles in the eastern part of the country The worlds largest oil field according to the prospectus Ghawar has accounted for more than half of Saudi Arabias cumulative production yet it still has reserves of  billion barrels and is capable of producing nearly four million barrels a day both more than all but a handful of countriesThe oil wealth doesnt stop there The kingdom has four more fields that dwarf most othersAramco produced  million barrels per day in  on average more than three times the  million barrels per day reported by Exxon Mobil according to the report Over all its revenue was about  billionMoodys wrote that Aramco was conservatively managed with very low debt levelsMr Staples said that based on his conversations with Aramco officials he expected this careful approach to debt to continue a policy that is likely to find favor with investors if the Saudi government decides to revive its IPO plansThe agency rated the company A a strong rating but below that of large Western oil companies including Exxon Mobil and Shell Mr Staples said the lower rating reflected the concentration of most of Aramcos operations in Saudi Arabia which shares the same credit rating and the governments dependence on oil and gas revenueThe thinking is that if Saudi Arabia were to encounter political instability or hard times the oil company would feel the impact We have to take into account the risk profile of the country he saidThe company founded by United States oil companies Aramco is short for Arabian American Oil Company was nationalized by the Saudi government in the sIn its prospectus Aramco listed some of the risks and drawbacks that it faced in its operations The Saudi government for instance determines how much oil Saudi Aramco should produce based on its sovereign energy security goals or for any other reason The company also may face litigation over climate change or antitrust issues stemming from its membership in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries especially in the United States Aramcos prospectus saidAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported bySOCIAL QSA grandmother finds her daughter and soninlaws PDA unfit for their yearold childs eyesBy Philip GalanesI am  and no prude

going to hurt like heck tomorrow The original theme idea was a little too complicated for a Tuesday puzzle  I had the same theme entries but instead of cluing them straightforwardly as in the published puzzle I clued them in an unconventional manner So the clue for YOUR MONEYS NO GOOD HERE for example was along the lines of Discouraging message to a counterfeiter I guess I was unsure whether the theme entries themselves were interesting enough so I thought upping the wackiness in the clues might make it more entertaining The more direct clues certainly make the puzzle more Tuesday

and what we do and delivers behindthescenes insights into how our journalism comes togetherIt was midJanuary and I had just reported that New York City had sued a group of current and former real estate professionals who supposedly used Airbnb to convert more than  apartments across the city into illegal hotel rooms for touristsThe allegations were staggeringOver three years they lodged almost  guests across  residential buildings including an entire sevenunit building that was unlawfully rented to tourists through Airbnb the lawsuit said The city claimed the operation brought in more than  million in revenue by violating laws and Airbnbs own restrictionsHow exactly did they pull it offThat was the question posed to me by Cliff Levy my boss and Dodai Stewart my editor The word answer to that question is the basis for my article Inside the Rise and Fall of a MultimillionDollar Airbnb Scheme which offers a look at how cunning entrepreneurs exploit Airbnbs platform to turn a profitIve covered housing for the Metro desk for almost a year writing mostly about the citys struggle to fix its crumbling public housing system Ive also covered New York Citys continuing clash with Airbnb one of several regulatory battles the city has had with tech giants like Uber as it deciphers the impact of the socalled sharing economy on New YorkersCritics of Airbnb argue that many people use the platform to convert residential apartments into de facto hotels for tourists worsening the citys tight rental market and affordable housing crisis There are laws in place to prevent this conduct but they are often abused and the city has filed several lawsuits to take down unlawful Airbnbs before This year the city sued a real estate developer who supposedly used Airbnb to rent out  Manhattan apartments to travelers and made  million in revenueBut the lawsuit I reported on was the biggest yet seeking more than  million from the defendantsAs I began to pore over the hundreds of court documents the inner workings of the operation became clearer A complex web of corporations were set up to receive payments about  different host accounts were created and dozens of misleading identities were used to book tourists since at least  the documents revealedI interviewed city officials questioned landlords whose buildings were improperly used to book guests and spoke to tourists who had stayed at the apartmentsIt appeared a handful of people had engineered a commercial operation against local regulations listing more than  apartments on Airbnb and using multiple email addresses to circumvent the companys own rule of one apartment per hostThe article was also a collaborative effort With the help of Sarah Almukhtar a graphics editor we mapped out the locations of the Airbnb apartments which stretched south from Harlem to trendy neighborhoods like Chelsea and SoHoDoris Burke a researcher at The Times dug up old lawsuits against the business partners behind the alleged scheme That led to me to building owners who claimed they had been deceived by the partners who supposedly signed leases for apartments in their buildings and then rented them to tourists through Airbnb without the landlords knowledge And Derek Norman a news assistant helped me track down tenants who had grown irritated with Airbnbs in their buildingsZiograin Correa had lived with his wife and children for more than two years at a building in East Harlem Mr Correa said he had a recurring leak in his apartment and he would often knock on the door of the unit above his He gradually realized it was an Airbnb believing the leak was never fixed because there was never a tenant who lived there long enough to address the issueWhen I went up there there was a family from Mexico he said Then it happened again and I went up and there was a family from China Then I started to notice all the luggage It was ridiculousPerhaps the most revealing part of my reporting was landing an interview with one of the men the city had accused Max Beckman a yearold former real estate broker originally from IsraelDespite his legal troubles Mr Beckman accepted my request for an interview You can get all the facts and make a big publication he told me in an email before our interview at his lawyers officeTo my surprise he spoke openly about quitting his job in  to pursue his Airbnb venture full time despite the legal risks and described how the operation worked He also talked about the aftermath of the lawsuit and the pressure of breaking scores of apartment leases after the city forced him to shut down his businessMany people asked me why I thought Mr Beckman who described himself as a disruptive entrepreneur talked to usUltimately Mr Beckman seemed to genuinely believe that what he was doing should be legal and that the state should consider lifting restrictions on Airbnb so people like him can make money by lodging touristsLets make New York great again he told me Put that in

to save us from distraction is making us less attentiveBy Vatsal G ThakkarDr Thakkar is a psychiatrist I was backing my wifes car out of our driveway when I realized I wasnt watching the backup camera nor was I looking out of the rear window I was only listening for those audible proximity alerts  the highpitched beeps that my car emits as I approach an object while in reverse The problem was that my wifes car an older model doesnt offer such beeps I had become so reliant on this technology that I had stopped paying attention a problem with potentially dangerous consequences Backup cameras mandatory on all new cars as of last year are intended to prevent accidents Between  and  the percentage of new cars sold with backup cameras doubled but the backup fatality rate declined by less than a third while backup injuries dropped only  percent Perhaps one reason is as a report from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration put it Many drivers are not aware of the limitations of the technology The report also found that one in five drivers were just like me  they had become so reliant on the backup aids that they had experienced a collision or near miss while driving other vehicles The fact that our brains so easily overdelegate this task to technology makes me worry about the tech industrys aspirations  the fully autonomous everything Could technology designed to save us from our lapses in attention actually make us even less attentiveUbers march toward a selfdriving car hit a major speed bump last year in Tempe Ariz when one of its selfdriving Volvos struck and killed a pedestrian While a lot of focus was on how a vehicle with cameras and radar sensors could completely miss a human being on the road less has been said about the failure of the most intricately programmed system in the vehicle  the brain of the human in the drivers seat An investigation revealed that the driver was watching Hulu until the moment of the crash Because the human brain is impeccable in its ability to filter out extraneous information this type of behavior should have been predicted During normal driving our brains are in a nearconstant state of vigilance But let someone or something do the driving for us and this vigilance easily fadesSomething similar seems to have happened with a handful of fatalities involving Teslas Autopilot mode It seems that the drivers made little to no effort to interveneThe introduction of safety technology has resulted in unintended accidents in other contexts as well In December  a patient died at a major medical center when a nurse searched for an antianxiety medication in an automated dispensing cabinet by typing only its first two letters She chose the first drug that appeared in the results  Vecuronium instead of Versed Vecuronium is a paralytic drug that is sometimes used in executions When it was administered the patients vitals crashed and she died within daysTechnology seems to have turned against us once again in the deadly crashes of two Boeing  Max  aircrafts In October pilots on Lion Air Flight  in Indonesia seem to have struggled against the planes supposedly lifesaving technology Investigators suspect that sensors incorrectly interpreted the planes ascent as too steep causing the planes maneuvering characteristics augmentation system to kick in It brought the planes nose down ultimately into the Java Sea at  miles per hour Boeing had begun to develop a software fix but it wasnt ready in time for Ethiopian Airlines Flight  which just this month crashed possibly because of the same bug killing all  people on board In these cases no one can criticize the pilots for failing to pay attention Still the crashes were a wakeup call especially because pilots werent required to be trained on the new technologyThough a supercomputer will always surpass the human brain in terms of pure speed the brain is beyond complex in its ability to reprioritize salient data inputs from multiple sources If one input becomes less relevant our cognitive systems shift their attention to the next most relevant one which these days is usually our mobile devicesBut theres one feature available on some cars today that can increase a drivers vigilance instead of diminishing it  the manual transmissionA car with a stick shift and clutch pedal requires the use of all four limbs making it difficult to use a cellphone or eat while driving Lapses in attention are therefore rare especially in city driving where a driver might shift gears a hundred times during a trip to the grocery store Ive owned a stickshift vehicle for the last  years I bought my first upon graduating from med school  a used  BMW i Years later my best man wrote just married on the back windshield and the next year my wife and I drove our newborn son home from the hospital in itSadly sales of manual transmissions are falling and many automakers including Audi are discontinuing the option in the United States It appears that Ill have to keep my  S model until  if I want to teach my kids to drive a stickWhen I bought that first fivespeed BMW my dad cautioned me about safety thinking that driving a stick would be more distracting and less safe He was wrong Though research on the safety of manual transmissions is scant one study on the driving performance of teenage boys with ADHD revealed that cars with manual transmissions resulted in safer more attentive driving than automatics This suggests that the cure for our attentional voids might be less technology not moreVatsal G Thakkar VatsalThakkarMD is a

home in Norwalk Conn last March he decided to make it a smart one  where he could control the lights refrigerator thermostat televisions security cameras and everything in between  with the sound of

world has been through the surging popularity of smart speakers like Amazon Echo and Google Home whose voice assistants can answer questions play music order food read news arrange an Uber ride and control other connected smart devicesForrester predicts that more than  million households in the United States will have smart speakers by  up from  million in  The number of homes with other smart devices like refrigerators vacuums yard irrigation systems and door locks will more than double to  million in   or about  percent of households in the United States  from  million in  Forrester projectsFor many people its about convenience and speed Consumers dont just want this convenience they expect it  they demand it said Charles Henderson global head of XForce Red a professional hacking team at IBM SecurityBut the road to mass adoption of the smart home will likely be a long and bumpy one Although the number and nature of smart devices is surging by the day people have been relatively slow to actually buy and install themIts a really messy space and theres a lot of noise in this said Frank Gillett principal analyst at ForresterBuying setting up and connecting smart devices can be costly cumbersome and timeconsuming Indeed as many as onethird of smart speakers are still in their boxes according to ForresterYou need people to be patient and comfortable with working through multiple steps of instruction he saidSecurity privacy and trust remain a big concern among owners of smart speakers Its that big brother is listening concern said Charles Golvin senior research director at Gartner a research and advisory firmIn a  survey by Gartner of smart speaker owners in the United State the United Kingdom and Germany  percent said they would be more willing to use a virtual personal assistant app like Alexa Siri or Google Assistant if all of their personal data stayed on the device rather than being stored in the CloudIts no surprise that familiar names like Google Amazon and Apple have taken a lead in the smart speaker space and big brands like Samsung are creating buzz in smart appliances But the rest of the smart device universe is fragmentedMuch of the innovation is coming from focused startups and midsize companies said Mr GillettIn the smart appliances realm Samsung has emerged as a leaderWith its Family Hub smart refrigerator for example you can view the contents of your refrigerator from a smartphone at work use a grocery app like InstaCart or Amazon Prime Now to order any needed groceries for dinner and have the food delivered before arriving home The smart fridge also sends alerts about expiring food and offers recipes through Meal Planner for meals that include those expiring itemsThe fridge features a large touchscreen

this feature specifically around gametime  where people dont want to miss a play while preparing food said Adnan Agboatwalla director of innovation programs at Samsung Electronics AmericaThe key to the whole ecosystem is to make the consumers life easier he saidLooking ahead Mr Agboatwalla said he hopes to add replenishment services in which a washer and dryer for example would anticipate based on a number of cycles when the consumer needed detergent and dryer sheets  and would automatically order them from the persons preferred retailer before they run outBut demand for consumer smart

done by a pair of robotic arms Founder Christian Mackin came up with the idea after suffering back and neck injuries during a sandrail car accident in California in  He underwent surgery  and then months of physical and massage therapyI thought Id like to design a robot to do this at home he saidSo Mr Mackin who owns an engineering firm acquired a couple of collaborative robots known as cobots from Universal Robots and brought in a physical therapist to program the socalled cobots to give  different massages with a robotic arm on each side of the massage table The robots are artificial intelligenceenabled responding to voice commands to change the speed pressure and location of the massage from a light touch to deep tissue massage  depending on the persons needs and injuriesTheres even a safe word  Stop  which will immediately stop the massage With each adjustment or change a new massage is created which becomes part of the systems database of massages for all customers to useObviously its not some beautiful masseuse or masseur doing it but the massage tool feels just fantastic said Mr Mackin You cannot tell the difference And robots never get tired dont expect tips and can never face sexual misconduct accusations he jokedBut it doesnt come cheap A single massage robot will sell for  when it hits the market later this year although Mr Mackin expects the price to come

connect with what matters to themBy Ned JohnsonAs most collegebound high school seniors learn where theyve gotten in and decide where theyre going many feel that the pressure is off Whether they are celebrating acceptances to their dream schools or coping with rejections nearly all realize at this point that the die has been cast The push for high school grades that used to drive everything suddenly matters much lessSenioritis used to have positive connotations for students It meant coasting through their last semester in high school in anticipation of college entry in the fall Today that mood has shifted Many students  and their parents  have been driven to believe that high school is merely a fouryear audition for the right college A result Eighteenyearolds who feel their lives are not really driven by themRather than being a time of freedom the new senioritis is characterized by a sense of purposelessnessWithout an external motivator reward of college admission or threat of college denial far too many students have little idea of what to do or whyPsychologists use the terms external versus internal control which is the sense that someone other than the individual is responsible for his success or failure School and especially the college admissions process very much fosters this tendency Students look to teachers and parents for cues to what matters and try to imagine what they need to do to meet the approval of admissions officials Its a far cry from reflecting on a more pressing question What matters to meIt is common for many students when denied admission to their dream college to lament that its not fair or that theyve wasted all of this effort as though their work as students in high school and their aspirations for college were merely transactional rather than part of their development as learners and more so as people In the aftermath of a rejection more students than I can count have told me they should have gone to an easier high school or taken easier or harder classes taken more or fewer AP classes or should have dropped sports music or debate to get better grades Typically in this situation students and their parents cast about for some path or reason that would have delivered the result they wished for They rarely reflect on the possibility that the sport class or activity they engaged in may pay off down the road in other ways through a talent developed or interest kindled Many of these kids feel that the whole point of working hard in high school is so they can get in to an even harder college then move on to a future that they know little more about than that it will be hardcharging It is easy to understand how painfully the rejection hits since the process has all been framed around the outcome In the second semester of senior year students are still engaged with the same people and activities of the last four years but the terms pressures and motivations have changedFor the next few months the rules are very different Teachers and parents complain that they cant get teenagers to do anything Some have even proposed eliminating senior yearBut I see the end of senior year as an opportunity for kids to figure out their inner motivation post college acceptanceFor kids who have been grinding for too long the second semester can be downtime to recharge But I also encourage students to use this time with intention as it will help them enormously to be in touch with what matters to them They can make themselves their senior project Here are some suggestionsGo deep into things that matter to you especially what you didnt have time for or seemed unimportant for college admissions A senior I know who hopes to study medicine used her second semester to train as an EMT It was a great way to see firsthand whether medicine appealed at a bootsontheground level and whether she was really suited to the field It also ended up being a wellpaying parttime jobLearn how to run your own life Make a list of adult or college skills you dont know how to do like automobile maintenance or cooking Ive heard of college kids clueless as to basic kitchen skills turning to YouTube videos to learn how to make hot dogs If you havent yet learned to drive thats a skill that also belongs on this list There are real upsides to Uber but it isnt yet everywhere And you may face a situation where a friend is unfit to drive and someone needs to step upTry looking for a parttime job  on your own I was visiting a friends business recently when he picked up the phone It was someone calling to confirm the time of a job interview for a recent college grad named Ben The caller was Bens mom My friend said Well please tell Ben his interview is canceled and that he should have called himselfLike anything that matters learning how to enter manage and when necessary exit relationships benefits from experience A  study in Child Development found that young people today are less likely to have dated than young people did during the s perhaps they are more focused on passing classes than passing notes According to the General Social Survey more than half of young adults aged  to  do not have a steady romantic partner A  New York Times piece recounted the hookup culture at Ivy League universities where students shared views like A relationship is like taking a fourcredit class or I could get in a relationship or I could finish my film A friend who has been an independent college counselor for decades wistfully observes that Nobody believes me when I tell them but who you marry will matter much more than where you go to college If the first seven semesters of high school were college prep perhaps let the last one be more about relationship prepGo technologyfree for a week  or even a day Digital downtime is a challenge but can also be an awakening as to the ways that technology impacts our thought processes and ability to pay attention  a recognition students can take to college and beyond And while many believe college is where they will develop a coherent sense of self it can only help to begin that process in senior yearNed Johnson is the president and founder of PrepMatters

more than  paint colors SherwinWilliams a competitor sells a more limited but still substantial palette of  hues To buy either brand you generally have to visit a hardware store or bigbox retailer like Lowes select from an array of color chips and wait while the paint is mixed by an employee You may have to buy sample cans to test the paint on your walls at home and make a return trip to the store before you settle on the right colorIts not exactly a soulful task but for decades it was a manageable one Or perhaps it wasnt Because as with so many consumer categories that have been transformed over the past decade by tech entrepreneurs from mattresses to eyewear to hailing a cab paint is being disruptedTwo new brands  Clare and Backdrop  have emerged in the past eight months selling paint through their websites Convenience and a frictionfree life ideally one in which any desire can be fulfilled through clicking and swiping is the millennial consumers utopia and now that utopia has colors of its own with generationally appropriate names like Clares No Filter a light beige with warm undertones Say goodbye to the hardware store because now you choose the paint online and have it shipped to your home Say goodbye to testing paint on your walls because now the samples are disposable peelaway stickers Say goodbye too to choice overload because Clare and Backdrop each offer a curated selection of about  colors Thats less than half of the  colors offered by Farrow  Ball the highend British brand that previously marketed an edited palette One Kings Lane with its new directtoconsumer paint collection offers an even more edited  huesBrad Sherman a designer in New York who specializes in commercial design for tech companies like Casper and Food said he was recently served an ad for Backdrop on Instagram and was intrigued I felt it was about time somebody looked at disrupting this industry Mr Sherman said The branding the repackaging of the paint can the tools Looking at chips the color is never accurateIt can be difficult at first to tell Clare and Backdrop apart just as with Uber and Lyft in the ridehailing business Both are New Yorkbased companies founded by young people who wax on about storytelling and pain points Both tout their ecofriendly bona fides Both offer a subdued selection of colors sure to look great on Instagram and at prices comparable to most midrange paints about  per gallon And where Farrow  Ball made an art out of twee names Elephants Breath anyone Clare and Backdrop give it an ontrend spin Clares natural green is Avocado Toast Backdrops warm beige is Palo SantoFirstmover advantage however goes to Clare which debuted last July four months ahead of Backdrop With its uncluttered design and simple navigation Clares website is perhaps better at conveying the mood of domestic ease while the brands colors seem to be a little brighter a littler clearer than Backdrops said Annie Elliott an interior designer and blogger in Washington DC who goes by the nom de plume Bossy Color Im a sucker for kits and that adorable yellow Clare box  sign me up Ms Elliott said referring to the brands fivepiece tool kit which sells for Clares founder Nicole Gibbons  is a former interior designer who appeared on the TV show Home Made Simple on the OWN network Working with clients on the show and through her interiors firm showed her how lost people were about painting without an expert guideLike white for example You would think white was just white Easy Ms Gibbons said But you go to any other company and there are usually a hundred or more whites to choose from People start to get confused and doubtTaking a hypercurated approach Ms Gibbons offered only three whites with Clare and one paint finish for walls eggshell and one finish for trim semigloss She also developed a color genius tool that asks questions about your space and spits out a recommended hue The whole premise of Clare is to simplify so by the time youre at the end of this process its joy not hassle Ms Gibbons said Sometimes people just want fewer better choicesCaleb and Natalie Ebel the married founders of Backdrop also espouse fewer better but unlike Ms Gibbons they celebrate the messiness of painting Colors are represented on their site as gooey drops of wet paint and the imagery in their ad campaign is of people ready to paint not static furnished rooms The Ebels both in their early s have no background in design or color theory Ms Ebel worked in marketing and branding for an education nonprofit while Mr Ebel who has a finance degree touts his early experience at Warby Parker I worked at Warby Parker is the new I was at Woodstock With Backdrop the Ebels have applied personal branding and style signifiers to a business void of any emotion Mr Ebel saidThus Backdrops neutral beige is named Ryokan Guesthouse because two years ago before their daughter was born the Ebels spent their babymoon in Japan They are developing Spotify playlists for each color Inspired by oliveoil canisters they redesigned the boring round paint can the Backdrop can is square with a rubber stopper that gives what Mr Ebel called a beautiful pour In addition to paint and tools the Ebels sell branded work Tshirts drop cloths and coveralls Indeed they say they want to make painting appear so fun and easy that people will be inspired to change their walls every six monthsIsnt that exhaustingWell its the cheapest way to transform your space Ms Ebel saidFifty percent of Backdrops customers dont bother testing samples she added Theyre commenting on social that theyre purchasing paint because of the names When your backdrop is Surf Camp youre much more able to remember that versus just blueMs Elliott the designer said she is unlikely to buy paint based on a catchy name At the moment one goto is Benjamin Moores Simply White a shade she has used time and againBut she admitted this is for a generation of folks who are probably not going to hire a designer anyway Its for someone who wants to spend a Saturday changing the room for not a lot of money And for that I see the appealSteven Kurutz joined The Times in  and

danger of bad WiFi or no outletsWhen Im writing a longer story I print out all my interview notes and spread the pages across my kitchen table or floor in the manner of a chefs mise en place This helps me organize my thoughts before I dive into the writing I dont understand how people can work off  different documents on one tiny laptop screenI also find it very comforting to constantly make

in time for springI stopped riding the scooters because I was spending every scooting second thinking about how this would be an especially embarrassing way for a tech reporter to die Even imagining myself explaining to strangers that heavy sigh yes these crutches are from a scooter accident was enough to convert me back to a boring old analog bikeYouve written about hustle culture and toil glamour Is the idea of worklife balance deadUnfortunately a lot of the companies that outwardly promote the concept of worklife balance are the ones with the worst cultures of overwork Over time I imagine hypocrisy will turn people off working at those places Until then its up to the workers to draw their own boundaries One way to do that is to understand the difference between taking pride in their work and defining their selfworth by their jobs And maybe lowering skyhigh expectations about their companys dogooder missions and being realistic about how fulfilling their jobs will actually

city lights glinting off his head as he did the only reallive triple take I have ever seenLady he said in a deep gravelly voice youre in it Victoria ChapmanDear DiaryOn the Sunday before New Years Day my son and I drove to Macys in Herald Square He needed to buy some clothes to upgrade his wardrobe for a job that started on Jan I saw a spot at a corner along Seventh Avenue I wasnt  percent sure it was legal and I had to drive around the block to get into it but I figured it was worth a tryI pulled onto the block and approached the corner spot I noticed a police van parked a few cars backI slowed down and moved toward the corner space but decided it was no good and signaled that I was pulling back out into trafficJust then a police officer walked from the van toward a trash can on the corner He waved for me to back up into the space guiding me until I was an inch in front of the car parked behind meI saw you slow down he said Youre fineIm just over the crosswalk I protestedYoure fine he repeatedAnd the pink signs say No parking SundayYoure fine he said again his voice rising slightly Those signs are wrong Its just no parking Monday Happy New Year Ira MayerDear DiaryMy friend

Joanne KaufmanThe house did not immediately grab Harlan Coben by the lapelsIt was to tick off the liabilities situated on one of the main drags in Ridgewood NJ Locally it was a wellknown pile of Second Empire gingerbread with pink trim and a mansard roof People would drive by and gawk Sometimes they would park down the street and affecting a casual air take a nice slow walk past the property for a closer look And with three floors and nine bedrooms it was a lot of housePerhaps most problematic it was a touch too onthenose for the bestselling author of a few dozen thrillers to live in a spooky Victorian manse Its the kind of clich I try to avoid when I write said Mr Coben whose latest work Run Away the story of a Manhattan money managers desperate attempts to save his renegade drugaddict daughter is out this weekThis not being a mystery by the master himself there is no imperative to keep readers in suspense Just over  years ago Mr Coben and his wife Anne ArmstrongCoben a pediatrician were living across town in a centerhall colonial expecting their third child they now have four and looking for more space When the house came on the market it seemed like a good value he said and so the deal was doneMy wife and I were in agreement Mr Coben continued It wasnt like one of those home shows where they have a couple and she wants something totally modern and he wants something oldfashioned I watch and always wonder How did you guys get marriedBut this acquisition might have satisfied even such bickering pairs The previous owner had preserved and protected its abundant Old World charm  paneled walls and ceilings wainscoting crown molding herringbone floors beveled leadedglass doors  while showing an appreciation for modern conveniences of the SubZero kindThe Victorian had all the structure of a great old house but it really was homey Mr Coben said I couldnt turn it down I sort of fell in loveThe love burns as brightly as ever but now it has a bittersweet tinge One by one the children have gone out into the world With the youngest off to college next fall Mr Coben and his wife will be empty nesters in a very big nest But the kids like coming back to the house he said smiling gamely They all have their favorite nooks and cranniesOf course Mr Coben has his favorite spots too The library ranks high both because it provides an ideal background for the author photos on his book jackets and because plain and simple its a library It has reading matter and lots of it as well as treasures like a Maltese falcon statue a tip of the hat to Dashiell Hammett one of Mr Cobens literary idols Its kind of a clich but its here Occupation writerEdifice complex It was hard for me to imagine living in a house this spectacular Mr Coben said I had panic attacks about living in a house this coolThere is also a statue of Boston Celtics legend John Havlicek I loved him when I was a kid said Mr Coben a native of Newark NJ who played on the basketball team at Amherst CollegeSome of the volumes in the handsome builtin bookcases are foreign editions of the Coben oeuvre Such display is not born of a desire to trumpet the popularity of exhortatory titles like Hold Tight Play Dead and Tell No One in distant ports It is all about storageStorage is something of a theme for Mr Coben who has accumulated many items related to his work  both priceless and worthless  and has not the slightest idea what to do with them Thus plaques posters of the film adaptations of his novels photographs some sent by fans and blowup images of the New York Times bestseller list with this or that Coben novel in the top spot lean against one another in the library just steps from the pool tableFor the record no one in the family picks up a cue stick Ever The presence of the table is a puzzle best left to keener minds Except when reporters are around and there is an attempt to tidy up the stretch of green felt holds detritus and when Mr Coben is sitting in a chair nearby his feetHe and his wife have made a few alterations to the house over the years They painted that pink exterior trim blue added a bathroom converted a brokendown greenhouse into a sunroom outfitted the backyard with a pool and a sports court and in the spirit of DIY installed a fauxtin ceiling in the kitchen using plastic molding and gray spray paintMr Coben has an officially designated office on the second floor It was once the bedroom of his younger daughter Eve which explains the redandpurple walls Providing a sober contrast is the partners desk that Mr Coben and his wife bought to celebrate their first wedding anniversaryActually the office is kind of superfluous Unlike authors who require a setting with a specific barometric pressure to write even a check Mr Coben can work anywhere a coffee shop the back of an Uber seriously Plot turns have presented themselves during his time on the treadmill desk in the thirdfloor workout room and in the sunroom which is just off the kitchen I dont need or want one particular spot said Mr Coben who signed a deal last year with Netflix to turn several of his thrillers into series and moviesHe left the job of furnishing the house to his wife when they moved in two decades ago And sometimes he may feel a twinge of regret about that decision particularly about some of the contributions from his motherinlaw an antiques lover who is now deceased Once in a while I see something thats really ugly and I dont know why were keeping it and a lot of it was from her Mr Coben said hastily adding But I do like the player piano that came from herIt was his motherinlaw who bought him the menagerie of animalhead walking sticks in the stand by the front door She thought I should have a collection of something but I havent collected any beyond the ones she got me Mr Coben said unscrewing one of the sticks to reveal a flask another to show the dagger tucked insideJust a weapon looking for a plotFor

the mass shooting last year in Parkland Fla filed  lawsuits on Wednesday accusing the local school district and sheriffs office of negligence and seeking potentially millions of dollars in damages as compensationThe lawsuits claim that the Broward County Public Schools failed to keep students and staff at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School safe in spite of warning signs that the shooting suspect Nikolas Cruz a former student had threatened violence against the school community Mr Cruz now  and corresponding with pen pals while in jail faces the possibility of the death penalty in the attack in which  people were killed and  others wounded on Feb  This is a life sentence for me Mitchell Dworet who lost his yearold son Nicholas said at an emotional news conference in Fort Lauderdale Fla that was called to announce the lawsuits Mr Dworets younger son Alexander was injured in the shootingMr Dworets lawyer Michael Goldfarb said at least part of any damages eventually received by the Dworet family would go toward a charitable foundation it created in Nicholass nameMany frustrated Parkland residents have accused local government of failures before and during the deadly shooting and those filing the new lawsuits said they hoped the litigation would help hold officials to account Over the past  months as Parkland students  began a national youth movement against gun violence some of the victims families focused on the school district and the sheriffs office They led a successful push to oust the sheriff Scott Israel and an unsuccessful attempt to have the schools superintendent Robert W Runcie firedTo our family and our son this lawsuit will bring some accountability said Lisa Olson whose son William was shot in both arms Speaking through tears she called every day since the shooting a struggleMy son didnt go to school today she said He couldnt And we have many days like that nowLawsuits have become a sad routine following the countrys deadly mass shootings with victims families pursuing a variety of strategies to try to receive compensation force the adoption of safety measures and hold private and public entities responsible That includes lawsuits against gun manufacturers which have been seen as uphill court battlesRecently families from the  shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown Conn employed a legal approach previously used against the cigarette industry to pierce the shield that has protected the gun industry in the past and going after how gun manufacturers marketed an assault rifleThe FBI identified  activeshooter incidents in the United States last year according to a report the bureau published on Wednesday The episodes which spanned  states killed  people None was deadlier than the Parkland shootingThe lawsuits filed on Wednesday on behalf of  of those killed in the shooting and  others who were injured claim that the Broward County Sheriffs Office failed to try to stop the gunman during the rampage The sheriffs office declined to comment citing the pending litigationScot Peterson a sheriffs deputy at the time and the only armed police officer at the school on the day of the shooting remained outside the building as the attack took place Mr Peterson who retired in the days after the massacre and has maintained that he was unsure of the gunmans location is named as a respondent in the lawsuits along with the sheriffs office the school district and an unarmed campus security monitor Andrew MedinaMr Medina saw Mr Cruz get out of an Uber ride with a large bag and walk into the school but did not confront him or call for a lockdown an investigation showed He lost his job last summerHenderson Behavioral Health a local clinic that treated Mr Cruz is also named in the lawsuitsMr Cruz confessed to the police and his public defenders said he would plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence But prosecutors rejected that deal so Mr Cruz pleaded not guilty and now awaits trial on charges of murder and attempted murder No trial date has been setRecords released this week by the Broward County state attorneys office showed that while in jail Mr Cruz has been corresponding with pen pals  a woman in Britain and her brother  telling her that he envisions a life after prison in which he would get married have children and name the boys Kalashnikov Makarov and Remington after the gun manufacturers At the same time Mr Cruz acknowledged that he could die by lethal injectionIts kind of what I want but Im unsure of myself so Im just letting people save me from myself saving me from something that I can never return from he wrote on Oct  in a handwritten letter to the woman identified as Miley who created a Facebook group for supporters of Mr CruzMaybe I should get the death penalty he wrote in another letter I just want loveThe letters dating from October and November include stick figures holding hands and smiley faces with hearts Mr Cruz has also written to Mileys brother identified as LiamOne issue in the Florida lawsuits is how local governments their former employees and the clinic may be liable for compensating the shooting victims A sovereign immunity law protects any single victim from collecting more than  in damages from the government without approval from the State Legislature Those claims bills can take years to passIn an effort to avoid such a lengthy process for the Parkland families State Senator Lauren Book a Democrat filed legislation this year establishing a rare compensation fund that would set aside  million in public funds for the  victims of the Stoneman Douglas shooting But the bill which has yet to get a hearing appears unlikely to be approved before the annual session is scheduled to end on May This is a huge huge huge undertaking in the amount of time that we had to work on this Ms Book said It is not an easy liftLawyers for the families said on Wednesday that they suspected that the school district had hired a lobbying firm GrayRobinson to lobby against the compensation fund But both Ms Book and the district said the accusation was not true the district said it retained the firm for exactly the opposite purpose to lobby for the funds creationAt no time has the District or GrayRobinson lobbied against the compensation fund Kathy Koch a spokeswoman for the district said in a statementThe state continues to investigate the shooting At the same time that the families announced their lawsuits on Wednesday a commission that has already identified a range of failures on the part of local officials met to review additional issues including whether public schools in general underreport criminal and safety incidents and the manner in which victims families in Parkland were told by the authorities that their loved ones had diedAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byIt revealed the folly of the presidents approach to politicsBy The Editorial BoardThe editorial board represents the opinions of the board its editor and the publisher It is separate from the newsroom and the OpEd sectionWhat a debacle President Trumps shutdown proved to be  what a toddlers pageant of footstomping and incompetence of vainglory and selfdefeat Mr Trump tormented public servants and citizens and wounded the country and in conceding on Friday after holding the government hostage for  days could claim to have achieved nothingHe succeeded only in exposing the emptiness of his bullys bravado of his I alone can fix it posturing Once upon a time Mr Trump promised that Mexico would pay for a wall He instead made all Americans pay for a partisan fantasyMaybe you want a wall Can you possibly argue that Mr Trumps shutdown strategy advanced your cause He made the right decision on Friday  to sign a bill reopening the government through Feb  giving lawmakers time to reach a permanent deal But he could have had this same outcome without a shutdown He ultimately agreed to the sort of bill that Democrats have been pitching for weeks  one that contains not one dollar in wall fundingIn his announcement the president struggled to obscure his failure with yet another rambling infomercial about the glory of walls No matter where you go they work he said raising the question of how you can get there if in fact theres a wall in your way He had nothing of substance to offer beyond the usual specious claims that only his wall can end the border flood of drugs crime and migrant women who have been ducttaped and stuffed into vans by human traffickers To repeat Fewer bordercrossing apprehensions were made in  than at any time since  drugs are overwhelmingly smuggled through established points of entry and the only crisis at the border is a humanitarian one of people fleeing violence and seeking asylum  again mostly at established points of entry  under international lawThere is nothing to celebrate about this sorry shutdown though its perhaps understandable that congressional Democrats were reveling in Mr Trumps collapse Members of Mr Trumps conservative fan base demonstrated that even if the president continues to insist on alternative facts they are capable of acknowledging that truthWithin minutes of the announcement the bombthrowing pundit Ann Coulter  among those credited with having scolded Mr Trump into rejecting the temporary funding bill passed by the Senate last month  tweeted her judgmentGood news for George Herbert Walker Bush As of today he is no longer the biggest wimp ever to serve as President of the United StatesThe president tried to stand tough for Ms Coulter and her ilk Even as federal workers lined up at food banks sought unemployment benefits and took backup gigs driving for Uber he insisted he would not give an inch He stormed out of meetings with Democratic leaders He indulged in a public spat with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi over his State of the Union address He tweeted angrily On Thursday he was still vowing We will not caveBut on Friday he caved With a growing number of overworked stressedout air traffic controllers calling in sick staffing shortages at two airports on the East Coast began to snarl air travel The spectacle of enraged travelers canceled flights and imperiled safety turned up the heat on the White House and CongressRepublican lawmakers were already in a foul mood On Thursday the Senate voted on and failed to pass two competing plans for reopening the government Afterward there were reports of sniping and fingerpointing within the Republican conferenceAlong with their concerns about the human cost of the shutdown Republicans were no doubt antsy about the negative impact the shutdown was having on their presidents public standing Polls consistently showed that most Americans did not support the shutdown and that most blamed Mr Trump for it An ABC poll released this week put Mr Trumps approval rating at  percent and showed him to have the lowest twoyear average approval of any president in the past seven decades Perhaps he noticed that a poll released on Wednesday found that  percent of Americans thought he cared little about their problems On top of all that the Russia investigation hit the headlines again when in a predawn raid on Friday FBI agents  working without pay  arrested Roger Stone a longtime adviser to Mr Trump Mr Stone has been indicted on seven counts related to Russias meddling in the  election including witness tampering obstruction and making false statementsIt was in short shaping up to be a very bad day for the president who really cannot be blamed for wanting to change the story line Of course the new narrative  that Mr Trump got owned by Ms Pelosi  isnt likely to sit well with him either And who knows what hell do next to try to salve his ego and salvage some political capital with the minority of Americans who still seem inclined to support himIn his Friday remarks Mr Trump made threatening noises about declaring a national emergency if Congress cannot reach a compromise by the time this agreement expires Polls suggest that such a move would be wildly unpopular causing the president and his party even more grief Maybe that danger will motivate congressional Republicans to hammer out a deal without himHeres hoping that this mess leaves Mr Trump with a vital lesson  even if he doesnt care about a functional government the rest of America does Follow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook Twitter NYTopinion and InstagramAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBitsBy Steve LohrHi Im Steve Lohr I write about the technology industry from the old titans like IBM to startups working on the future of artificial intelligenceIn this weeks newsletter were largely taking a break from the consumer internet giants and the various controversies swirling around them Exception Amazons surprise announcement on Thursday to abandon its plans to build a headquarters in New York See belowInstead were going to look at recent research and reports that track how digital technology is moving into mainstream industries and the implicationsLets start with a smart piece this week by my colleague Erin Griffith The Next Wave of Unicorn StartUps Erin asked CB Insights a research firm that studies startups and venture capital to create a list of the next wave of young companies likely to reach valuations of  billion or more She then reported on some of the  companiesThe first round of wellknown unicorns led by Uber and Airbnb she writes exploited smartphones and cloud computing to upend oldline businesses The next companies poised to become unicorns are going narrower deeper and into more fieldsThey largely focus on software she writes for specific industries like farms banks and life sciences companiesThat kind of broadbased adoption across the nations  trillion economy is what will deliver growth and higher living standards for many Yet the advance of datadriven artificial intelligence will also provide realworld evidence of how much and how quickly this technology may widen income disparities and kill jobsThe short answer it seems is not as fast as technopessimists fear AIs progress is impressive but limited An article this week by Cade Metz AI Shows Promise Assisting Physicians  underlines that pointThe piece describes an AI research program whose accuracy matched or slightly surpassed human physicians in diagnosing common childhood diseases like influenza The software was trained on the medical histories lab tests and other clinical data in more than  electronic health records of children in southern ChinaIt was an encouraging demonstration But the experimental system relied on the easy access to personal data in China where privacy regulations are less restrictive and was confined to diagnosing common ailmentsThat stepbystep approach is the counsel for business in a new book by Thomas Davenport The AI Advantage How to Put the Artificial Intelligence Revolution to Work MIT Press Mr Davenport a professor of information technology and management at Babson College is a seasoned expert in using digital data to streamline operations and spot opportunities And hes been at it since well before the current AI wave which is both a technological evolution and a branding crazeHis advice to mainstream companies is that the best course is often to use basic AI tools to automate mundane office tasks in operations like accounting billing payments and customer service  and to avoid moon shotsOne of Mr Davenports prime examples of a misguided moon shot was IBMs initial efforts to apply its Watson technology to diagnosing cancer That was a highprofile science project that proved more difficult timeconsuming and costly than anticipated though IBM continues that work with several leading cancer centersSpeaking of IBM the company was out in San Francisco this week for its annual Think conference which attracted more than  attendees Its executives presented its Watson and cloud technology as the trusted path for companies across the industrial spectrum that want to embrace AIIBM cannot compete headon with Amazon Microsoft and Google in the bigspending game of building out massive data centers to provide the infrastructure layer of cloud computing to one and all So it is seeking to shift the competitionIBM talks about chapter two in the cloud market Increasingly it says companies will run not only new applications but also their legacy software on the cloud either private clouds in their own data centers or on IBMs cloud The next stage of cloud computing Virginia Rometty IBMs chief executive told Jon Fortt of CNBC is going to be driven by the modernization of missioncritical apps Thats our sweet spotAnd in a nod to reality IBM announced a Watson Anywhere initiative Its AI technology will run on the popular clouds of Amazon Microsoft or Google as well as IBMs cloudIn other news

Queens is part of a broader resistance to the tech boom and its consequences After the protests surfaced last year Fred Wilson the dean of New York venture capitalists told me that its partly from a sense that Amazon coming in is not going to help them and will only drive up their costs To really be a success in New York the benefits of the tech sector have to extend to every borough and every

history knows about Ada Lovelace Grace Hopper and the women who programmed the early Eniac computer Those stories have been told repeatedly including in booksBut Clive Thompson the author elegantly

Kinariwala woke up with a throbbing headache from a sinus infection So he did what most New Yorkers do He called his doctor got a prescription for a ZPak and walked to the Duane Reade near his apartment on the Lower East SideWhen he got there the elevator to the basement pharmacy was broken and  people were in line ahead of him he said After waiting for an hour the pharmacist told him they were out of stock His phone had died so he couldnt ask his doctor to send the prescription elsewhere It was so miserable said Mr Kinariwala  who left the drugstore that day without antibiotics Im a pinball in the middle of this thingShortly after this experience Mr Kinariwala who has a background in finance introduced Capsule an appbased service that delivers sameday medicine throughout all five boroughs Since it started in  Capsule has grown to  employees most of whom work at the companys headquarters in Midtown ManhattanThe company works with  pharmacists who verify prescriptions and field customer phone calls which range from concerns about a lost birth control pill to frequent urination Though Capsule is designed to be mobilefirst it has a storefront pharmacy in Chelsea which stocks  different medications and uses technology to track inventory They receive deliveries from wholesale suppliers several times a dayDrugstore chains have been considered an aesthetic scourge on the city for decades In a  Times article about Duane Reades takeover of the city New Yorkers called the pharmacys expansion a plague and insane Duane Reade currently has  stores in Manhattan alone including locations owned by Walgreens which purchased Duane Reade in  and has started to spread its own tentacles Walgreens currently has  locations across the city including its RiteAidowned stores CVS has But if delivery services like Capsule continue to expand Mr Kinariwala said that chain pharmacies in New York might succumb to technology in a similar way that Barnes  Noble and Borders were pushed aside by Amazon or the taxi industry has been challenged by Uber and LyftI think youll see Mr Kinariwala said in every industry people that dont serve the consumer dont deserve to exist New York is all about faster better strongerLinda V Green a professor of health care management at the Columbia Business School is skeptical of that claim I think its not obvious that a standalone pharmacy prescription service is going to make big inroads particularly in a metropolitan area where you have a Duane Reade on every other street corner she said The idea of delivering prescriptions is actually old Its not clear to me what problem theyre solving hereCapsule is not the first pharmacy to offer delivery and app services CO Bigelow a familyowned pharmacy in the West Village that dates to  has a delivery driver a messenger and an app Unsurprisingly Ian Ginsberg the owner isnt impressed by Capsule Theyre not doing anything we havent done for  years he said All theyve done is taken the human element out of it Theyre trying to scale as fast as possibleDeliveries he suggested can also be dangerous Patients dont have a facetoface opportunity with the pharmacist so there could be subpar education regarding the medication said Arash Dabestani the senior director of pharmacy at NYU Langone HealthWalgreens declined to comment but noted that they also deliver sameday in the city for a fee And it takes two weeks for the first package from PillPack a national pharmacy and subsidiary of Amazon to arrive PillPack is a mail order pharmacy Its a totally different thing Mr Kinariwala said I think of the competition as people who continue to tolerate a bad pharmacy experience PillPack did not respond to a request for commentEven though several independent pharmacies in New York offer deliveries they might not have the means to do so outside of their own neighborhoods CO Bigelow charges  to deliver beyond its surrounding area which is from the Battery to Chelsea Another pharmacy Apotheco with two locations in Midtown delivers within a mile radius but patients outside Manhattan have to call early in the morning to secure a sameday arrivalI would say everyone has been quite slow in delivering said Mr Dabestani of NYU He does not think delivery is an appropriate option for those on serious medications who need to be counseled in person The model should be patientspecific he saidNew York is a great market for Capsule because it is such a dense city said Paul Hudson the chief investment officer at Glade Brook Capital which has invested in the company along with Thrive Capital the venture capital firm founded by Josh Kushner Jared Kushners brother Theres a lot of dualincome households Mr Hudson added and the pharmacy experience in New York really hasnt been modernized as far as infrastructure and tech in a long timeDr Seth Finkelstein an obstetriciangynecologist in Manhattan who has become frustrated with traditional pharmacies has been suggesting Capsule to his patients Every time a patient calls me telling me a prescription cant be filled or I have to call insurance for preauthorization thats my time or my staffs time and thats money and time diverted to taking care of other people he said The pharmacy should be taking care of thisCapsules insurance specialists who help doctors with preauthorizations are better at dealing with insurance companies than the pharmacists at chain stores Dr Finkelstein said Although he added that the process is not perfect sometimes confused Capsule specialists call his office for guidanceMerlin Chowkwanyun a professor at Columbia was drawn to the service after losing his cool waiting in a CVS line for  minutesHe found however that the deliveries often arrived late And one time Capsule dropped off the wrong generic brand of a migraine medication he had requestedFor some people its still much easier to run into one of the hundreds of chain drugstores across the city than to wait two hours or more for a delivery If I wake up with a sty in my eye I can walk two blocks and pick up a prescription said Ms Green the health care management professor This is all about convenience and theres already a lot of other ways in which these things have become convenientBut in the age of Seamless and Amazon Prime Now Mr Kinariwala seems up to the challenge He said that he wants to see Capsule become the flip of Duane Reade within five years Its everywhere and everyone knows about it and uses it he said But everyone loves itAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byThe Trump campaign floated a proposal for a wholesale G network Its politically expedient but still a great ideaBy Kevin WerbachMr Werbach a professor at the Wharton School University of Pennsylvania served as an adviser on telecommunication policy in the Clinton and Obama administrationsThe Trump reelection campaigns wireless open access proposal was a poorly vetted scheme possibly intended to score political points It was squelched almost immediately after it became public as shocked White House staff members complained that it contradicted the administrations support for competing wireless networks The twist Open access wireless is actually a terrific idea Some forwardthinking Democrats and public interest advocates have been pushing it for decadesThe concept promoted by Republican operatives such as Newt Gingrich and Karl Rove is for a network supporting fifthgeneration G wireless technology to operate on a wholesale basis Carriers such as ATT Comcast and Verizon could buy capacity So could anyone else Apple Amazon Walmart Uber or small operators serving rural areas No company could use exclusive control over spectrum to block competitionLast year a leaked National Security Council presentation called for nationalization of G networks to improve cybersecurity and better compete against China The proposal was ignominiously killed and its author left the White House The Trump reelection campaigns proposal wisely dropped the government takeover It shifted the focus to wholesale access which could be overseen by an independent nonprofit organization like the independent system operators that manage electricity markets Todays cellphones use fourthgeneration wireless technology or G G a set of standards under development promises higher speeds improved coverage and better support for new technologies such as augmented reality autonomous vehicles and connected sensors in all types of devices G networks require denser construction of towers reducing the distance between a tower and each device To make G a reality companies and consumers around the world will have to invest hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade to upgrade hardware phones and networks The countries leading the way could reap huge economic benefitsThe December arrest in Canada of a top official of Huawei Chinas biggest communications hardware provider raised the stakes considerably Meng Wanzhou is accused of committing fraud to help Huawei evade sanctions against Iran The United States is pressuring its allies to ban Huawei from building their G networks on national security groundsThose moves will not however accelerate G deployment in the United States The Chinese government aggressively coordinates and promotes G activity which is proceeding at a breakneck pace China Tower for example added  wireless tower sites per day in  more than ten times the rate of American companies according to a report by DeloitteThe view of American policymakers which has been consistent through at least four administrations is that competition among wireless operators is superior to heavyhanded government initiatives Nevermind that while American wireless providers have a strong track record on innovation prices for consumers are high by global standards and the socalled free market is actually an oligopoly of four major carriers that could soon fall to three Way back in  a Columbia University economist Eli Noam proposed an alternative a wholesale spectrum provider that sold capacity to all Over the next few years some progressives myself included argued that cable broadband networks should be subject to a similar open access mandate And in  as the Federal Communications Commission developed the National Broadband Plan a team led by the Harvard legal scholar Yochai Benkler made a detailed case for wholesale sharing The idea was shot down each time amid furious industry opposition Why would the Trump campaign endorse open access Rivada Networks a politically connected firm that counts Peter Thiel a prominent Trump donor among its investors appears to be positioning itself for the lucrative contract to provide the technology for such a system Mr Trumps political advisers see the open access plan as a way to improve wireless service in rural areas a gift to the presidents baseThese motivations should not obscure the value of open access The communications industry has already shown that a competitive open market sometimes cant develop without government action The FCC had to prevent phone companies from squelching internet service providers and many companies that develop online applications face potential blocking of their services and discrimination by broadband operators The primary way the government makes wireless spectrum available today is through exclusive licensing to the highest bidder That can make it difficult for companies that provide niche services such as telemedicine and smart electric grids or that serve less populous areas which the big national carriers often ignoreEven some architects of the current system are reconsidering Peter Cramton for example helped more than a dozen countries design spectrum auctions Hes now Rivadas chief economist As Mr Cramton and his coauthor Linda Doyle wrote in  wholesale open access offers the best hope to break the wireless oligopoly while also using spectrum more efficientlyThey were right Making capacity available in real time at market prices limits hoarding and encourages innovation Unleashing our brilliant startup ecosystem through such market mechanisms along with opportunities for unlicensed access to wireless capacity is Americas best hope to beat China in GBut a poorly managed implementation could create a greedy wholesale monopolist or turn wireless access into a political football as is the disastrous fate of Australias open access fiber network And the details of implementation are not this administrations strong suitThere is also no guarantee that rural wireless providers will rush in to take advantage of the opportunity A wholesale system will require careful oversight and a longterm commitment by the government The political campaigns rapid walkback does not inspire confidenceNonetheless techsavvy Democrats should welcome the embrace of their open access vision Even if it means

InstagramAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byThe New New WorldBy Li YuanSAN FRANCISCO  As Mark Zuckerberg begins shifting Facebook to private messaging and away from public sharing and open conversations the vision he has sketched out for the future of social networking already exists  just not in the United StatesInstead it is a reality in China through a messaging app called WeChatDeveloped by the Chinese internet giant Tencent in  WeChat lets people message each other via oneonone texts audio or video calls Users can also form groups of as many as  people on WeChat to discuss and debate the issues of the dayWhile Facebook users constantly see ads in their News Feeds WeChat users only see one or two ads a day in their Moment feeds Thats because WeChat isnt dependent on advertising for making money It has a mobile payments system that has been widely adopted in China which allows people to shop play games pay utility bills and order meal deliveries all from within the app WeChat gets a commission from many of these servicesWeChat has shown definitively that private messaging especially the small groups is the future said Jeffrey Towson a professor of investment at Peking University It is the uber utility of business and life It has shown the pathWhat is happening in China offers clues to not only how Facebook may carry out its shift but how the internet more broadly might change Many of Silicon Valleys tech giants are dependent today on online advertising to make enough money to keep growing and innovating on new services Some call online ads the lifeblood of the internetBut WeChat which has  billion monthly active users shows that other models  particularly those based on payments and commerce  can support massive digital businesses That has implications for Google Twitter and many others as well as FacebookWeChat of course has its own flaws The messaging app is heavily censored because of requirements by the Chinese governmentFacebook declined to comment and Tencent did not immediately respond to requests for commentMr Zuckerberg didnt elaborate much this week on how the change toward private messaging would affect Facebooks business which relies on people publicly sharing posts to be able to serve them targeted advertisements In a blog post he said Facebook would build more ways for people to interact on top of messaging including calls video chats groups stories businesses payments commerce and ultimately a platform for many other kinds of private servicesYet its unclear whether Mr Zuckerberg can pull all those features off with Facebook On WeChat those services are underpinned by its mobile payments system WeChat Pay Because payments is already tied into the messaging service people can easily order meal deliveries book hotels hail ridesharing cars and pay their bills WeChat Pay itself has  million monthly active usersPeople also use WeChat Pay to transfer money and to buy personal finance products More than  million customers have purchased WeChats personal finance products which managed over  billion yuan or  billion by the end of last September Tencent has said Its users can buy everything from bonds and insurance to money market funds through the appFacebook lacks such a payments system So to be more like WeChat the Silicon Valley company could have to acquire banking and payment licenses in many countries One sign that Facebook has been thinking about payments is its work on a new crypto coin that is meant to let people send money to contacts on their messaging systemsTo make Facebook a private messaging product Mr Zuckerberg may have a lot else to learn from Allen Zhang the creator of WeChat Mr Zhang is famous for his perfectionist pursuit of a welldesigned serviceHe is renowned in Chinas tech scene as an artist and philosopher as well as for his fierce mission against anything that degrades user experience Connie Chan an investor at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz recently wrote of Mr ZhangMr Zhang fought many internal battles when Tencents revenue department pushed to put more ads on WeChat In a fourhour speech earlier this year he pondered the question of why there were not more ads on the messaging service especially the openingpage ads that are the norm in many other Chinese mobile appsMr Zhangs answer Many Chinese spent a lot of time  about one third of their online time  on WeChat he said If WeChat were a person it would have to be your best friend so that you would be willing to spend so much time with it he said How could I post an ad on the face of your best friend Every time you see it youll have to watch an ad before you can talk to itMr Zhang who has made restraint his product philosophy has been lucky because Tencent makes most of its money from online games so that it does not need to sell ads for revenueTencent doesnt break out its revenues from WeChat but its financial report for the third quarter of  said that social advertising revenue which includes WeChat grew  percent from a year earlier while the category called other businesses which includes payment services rose by  percentMr Zuckerberg does not have that luxury given that he is trying to switch from an adbased business into a different model It will be far from an easy task to pull offZuck is clearly trying to address Facebooks problems of privacy and fake news but it will greatly affect its monetization capability said Ivy Li a venture capitalist at Seven Seas Partners in Menlo Park Calif How comprehensive the surgery is going to be and whether the implementation will be twisted by all kinds of compromises is a big questionShe added Facebook is trying to seek a balance between a public square and a private space in an increasingly polarizing society The final result could be it will be abandoned by bothFollow Li Yuan on Twitter LiYuanvideoAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayBy Jill CowanGood

and what housing it does have is rapidly becoming too expensive for most people who live and work in the state Legislators have tried to make a dent in various aspects of the crisis Today my colleague Jennifer Medina explores how one of Mr Newsoms efforts is playing out in a Southern California city Not too long after he took office Mr Newsom in his State of the State address called out several cities he said were not doing their fair share to develop more affordable housing Among them Montebello a historic middle class suburb just east of Los Angeles that was once referred to as a MexicanAmerican Beverly HillsJust a short drive away from Downtown Los Angeles Montebello has long attracted government employees and other whitecollar workers eager to buy modest singlefamily homes  a kind of promised land for those looking to get out of the city Today threebedroom homes can be found for around   a relative bargain compared with much of Los Angeles So it was at least in some ways a bit of an odd choice for the governors ireState officials say the city has done little to keep up with the growing demand failing to create a clear plan for how it will expand its housing stock But

companies that FirstMark invested in years ago Pinterest and Postmates have filed paperwork to go public Pinterest unveiled an offering prospectus on Friday A third company Airbnb is expected to do the same within the next year All are likely to be embraced by Wall Street generating huge profits for FirstMarkWhich means its time for Mr Heitzmann whose New York investment firm has kept a relatively low profile to consider hiring a public relations agencyThe flood of initial public offerings is an occasion for FirstMark to tell our story he said We have been part of some of the more successful startups in the last several years and have been instrumental to their growth often as the first investor Thats a good story to tellAcross tech land investors who helped nurture unicorns the startups valued at more than  billion are now getting ready to embody a different animal metaphor the peacockThats because the companies they bet on years ago  such as Uber Lyft Pinterest Slack Postmates and Peloton  are preparing to list on the stock market which would create a bonanza of returns the likes of which Silicon Valley hasnt seen for yearsFor venture capitalists that means it is time to stop walking a tightrope of selfpromotion For years many did not want to look as if they were taking credit for the success of the startups they backed And they did not want to make it seem that the truckloads of money they stood to make were more important than their startups highminded missionsSo they sent fawning congratulatory tweets posted generic blog posts to Medium and namedropped their deals on one of a dozen interchangeable VC podcasts They thought led and became thinkfluencersNow that theyre ready to shed the false modesty some investors are calling in the prosAnn MiuraKo a partner at the venture capital firm Floodgate recently worked with the public relations firm OutCast to spotlight her special relationship with the ridehailing company Lyft Ms MiuraKo invested in Lyft in  when it was called Zimride and her firm owns about  million shares in the company That stake could be worth as much as  million when Lyft goes public which could happen this weekMs MiuraKo said Lyfts IPO would validate Floodgates strategy of investing in companies when they are just starting before the bigger venture firms get involvedWeve had great exits along the way but this is the real proof point she said We think its important to Floodgates storyWhen asked about hiring a public relations firm Ms MiuraKo deflected Later she said Every person has their own way of developing a megaphoneIn a followup statement she added Im a teacher and an investor I have a PhD in math modeling and I think like an engineer so thinking about myself and my business from a branding and marketing perspective doesnt come naturally to me but these are important factors in the success of all kinds of businesses all over the world which is why I engaged OutCast to help me think through and formalize both the Floodgate brand and my professional brandOutCast declined to commentIn Silicon Valley some public relations firms said they had noticed more queries from venture capitalists in the last month Mike Moeller founder of Aircover Communications a public relations firm said it had been busier than normal with cold calls from venture firms that were trying to stand outSome firms are realizing Huh maybe awareness doesnt just magically grow on trees he saidTheyre realizing they need to be part of this conversation added John Kuch a public relations executive at Moxie Communications Group With so much money in tech folks who have been conservative are getting out there even moreFor years venture capitalists on Sand Hill Road the epicenter of the venture industry in Menlo Park Calif were a more buttonedup lot Few used public relations firms Many investors looked askance at talking to the pressBut that changed as venture capital increasingly became a reputation game Venture firms such as Andreessen Horowitz which was cofounded by the Netscape wunderkind Marc Andreessen hired their own public relations staffSome venture firms built out entire media divisions First Round Capital for example created a digital magazine First Round Review which publishes entrepreneurial profiles advice and lessons Other investors have found time between startup pitches and board meetings to publish books deliver TED talks and amass huge followings on TwitterStill nothing crowns them as much as being associated with a unicorn company that goes public When Facebook went public in  venture capitalists who had invested in the social network solidified their reputations as rainmakers  and also were set for life They included Jim Breyer of Accel Partners David Sze of Greylock Partners and Peter Thiel of Founders FundA  Billion Jackpot for Facebook Investor one headline screamed about Mr Breyer in  marveling at how he had turned a  million investment in the social network into a pile of goldThat kind of name recognition gives investors an edge over competition in new deals Promotion is part of the game said Lisa Wu a partner at Norwest Venture Partners If you dont do it you miss out she saidTrevor OBrien who is working on a startup in San Francisco said entrepreneurs also looked at whether a venture capitalist had invested in any unicornsVCs showcasing logos from big investments does matter in terms of signaling credibility and experience he said adding that while it is not the only factor it checks a boxAlongside Ms MiuraKo and Mr Heitzmann this wave of IPOs will likely raise the profiles of Jeff Jordan a partner at Andreessen Horowitz who backed Airbnb and Pinterest and Alfred Lin a venture capitalist at Sequoia Capital who invested in AirbnbMr Heitzmann said FirstMark was not embarking on a promotion effort because of trouble raising new funds or getting into good deals Instead founders of younger companies that FirstMark has invested in have suggested he try to raise the firms profile for their sakePortfolio companies have said If you guys had a better brand it would help me recruit he saidMs MiuraKo said she didnt do any personal branding when Floodgate started in  because there wasnt much competition to invest in the very young companies that the firm was targetingYou didnt have to think about it she saidBut now its a lot noisier Ms MiuraKo was recently told by students at Stanford University where she teaches classes about startups that to stand out she should create her own channel on Discord a

newsletter in your inbox Sign up hereHi Im Jamie Condliffe Greetings from London Heres a look at the weeks tech newsWeb regulators are getting into their groove But are they going too quicklyThis past week the British government proposed new powers to issue fines and make individual executives legally liable for harmful content on their platforms My colleague Adam Satariano said it would be one of the worlds most aggressive actions to rein in the most corrosive online contentDays earlier Australia passed legislation that threatens fines for social media companies that fail to rapidly remove violent material And theres a growing pipeline of other internet regulation along with existing laws like the European Unions sweeping General Data Protection RegulationWere entering a new phase of hyper regulation said Paul Fehlinger the deputy executive director of the Internet and Jurisdiction Policy Network an organization established to understand how national laws affect the internetThis flurry of content rules is understandable Much of the material they would police is abhorrent and social medias rapid rise has caught lawmakers off guard now the public wants something doneBut the regulations could have unintended consequencesDifficulties in defining harmful mean governments will develop different standards In turn the web could easily look different depending on your location  a big shift from its founding principles This is already happening The Chicago Tribunes website for example doesnt comply with General Data Protection Regulation so theres no access to it from EuropeThere may be less visible effects If regulation required differences at a hardware level that could fragment the infrastructure said Konstantinos Komaitis a senior director at the nonprofit Internet Society which promotes the open development and use of the internet That could make the internet less resilient to outages and attacksAnd bigger richer companies will find it easier to comply with sprawling regulation which could reinforce the power of Big TechThere is a major risk that we end up in a situation where shortterm political pressure trumps longterm vision Mr Fehlinger saidMr Komaitis said avoiding unintended consequences was very simple yet very difficultIt is all about collaboration he added The idea lawmakers work together across borders to ensure rules are more consistentThe challenge is that collaboration could slow the pace of regulation that lawmakers desire But Mr Komaitis said many proposed regulations lack clear plans for implementation and envisions snags when governments come to apply them If they struggle he said collaboration and sharing of expertise may be the only way to make their plans workHow is technology blurring the lines between public and private Sign up to Charlie Warzels new limitedrun newsletter to find out more  and what you can do stop itArtificial intelligence could make our lives easier and more efficient But like any powerful technology its more complicated than that AI can be used for surveillance To control autonomous weapons It can be biased It could erode jobs The list goes onNone of those are reasons to reject AI outright But they underscore how its development must be approached with careBig Tech has struggled to publicly demonstrate that care Amazon Google and Microsoft have all drawn criticism for their AI work with military and government agencies Just this month Googles plan to create an AI ethics board ended disastrously when backlash about board members led to its dissolutionMissteps should be called out especially when theyre made by such powerful corporations But in an emergent field mistakes also serve as lessons And a new set of AI ethics guidelines from the European Commission is a good example of how trial and error will be a fundamental part of ethical AI developmentThe guidelines developed by  experts contain seven requirements that AI systems should meet to be deemed trustworthy What stands out about them for Charlotte Stix a policy officer at the Leverhulme Center for the Future of Intelligence at Cambridge University is that theyre designed to be carried outUnlike other AI ethics guidelines they attempt to join ethical principles to firm recommendations  something that has divided opinions among some people working in the field Thats why the European Commission hopes companies will adopt and test them between now and  so that they can be improvedFrank Buytendijk a vice president in Gartners data and analytics group said the guidelines sent a message to big tech companies that may have struggled with AI ethics in the past Heres your chance to do the right thingAmazon joined the ranks of tech companies wanting to blanket the world with the internetIts Project Kuiper plan which came to light in filings made by the Federal Communications Commission would put  satellites into low Earth orbit to deliver the internet to underserved communities around the world It has been likened to a network under development by SpaceX Facebook has plans for a similar system and Google has teamed up with the satellite operator Telesat along the same linesThese initiatives seek to provide affordable internet connections to people who currently lack them  from Alaska to subSaharan Africa Satellites appear to be a frontrunner Christopher Mims of The Wall Street Journal noted that according to the satellite industry veteran Shayn Hawthorne some kind of affordable satellite internet now appears inevitableFor big tech companies this is not selfless A good example of why is the Free Basics program offered by Facebooks nonprofit Internetorg a zerocost data service that provides access in some developing countries to a curated group of websites including Facebook In locations that are essentially untapped markets its provision of the web can help it secure new usersOther Big Tech players are unlikely to want to miss out Does privacy

TimesSupported byBy Michael WilsonIt has long been common wisdom in certain parts of the Bronx that the muscular tattooed man named John Rezaj should be referred to as John or JR or maybe if speaking with admiration about his approach to night life the Albanian Keith Richards One should not under any circumstances call him an Albanian gangsterYet Mr Rezaj a yearold immigrant whose family fled Albania when he was a boy has friends and associates across a wide breadth of social circles some of them less consistently observant of state and federal laws than others So in  he was happy to help a young filmmaker who wanted to learn more about Albanian gangstersThe two met on many occasions in Albanian bars and social clubs where Mr Rezaj and others talked about old times Through these conversations the filmmaker Matthew A Brown started to develop a fictional story about an Albanian gangster Then one day Mr Brown asked Mr Rezaj a big question Would he play the main characterNow the film is complete and has been making the festival rounds even while its backers are still looking for a distributor Its improbable star who has had no acting training and has spent most of his adult life avoiding both the spotlight and daylight in general has found himself schmoozing with industry people at film gatherings and posing for selfies with fellow countrymen who have heard about the movieTo me this comes natural what they wanted me to do Mr Rezaj said last week over afternoon cognacs and cigarettes at a bar Lukes Lounge in the Morris Park section of the Bronx I grew up you could say in a gangsters paradiseHis Albanian fans arent the only ones watching At the Method Fest Independent Film Festival in Beverly Hills Calif last month the John Garfield Award for Best Actor was split between two winners One was Ethan Hawke who starred in the film Stockholm The other who on that night listened in disbelief while his name was being read and pronounced correctly for a change REZAYE was Mr RezajFunny thing is hes not acting Matt told me Act how you would normally act Mr Rezaj recalled the director telling him I just get into the zone whateverMr Rezaj was  when his family ended up in the Bronx after escaping Albania by slipping through the mountains a journey he has difficulty describing without becoming emotional so he usually doesnt We were thrown in the trenches he said of early days in s New York You just dont come to America and move to a nice neighborhoodHe was a street kid What yearold do you know who has to come out of his house with a gun he asked You had to become someone else to survive I had to be what the streets demandedHe got into trouble when he was  It was a traffic dispute with a postal worker he said The guy assaulted me I saw him a few months later and I returned the favor With a baseball batHe stood trial in federal court in  and was convicted of felony assault on a federal employee He served more than four years in prison Gladiator days for me he saidI came out and I took over the world he said He opened a cafe then a couple bars he said By then Morris Park had become a base of operations for an Albanian crime ring run by Alex Rudaj called the Corporation that sought to take on the Mafias five families Mr Rudaj and others were later charged and convicted of racketeering illegal gambling and extortion They didnt want to make money the oldfashioned way a prosecutor said in  during closing arguments at the trial They wanted to make it through violence fear and intimidationMr Rezaj who was not charged in that federal case declined to comment about whether he had a role in organized crime When discussing that topic he spoke in generalities often smirking and shrugging Eventually youve got to get out of that life he said in Lukes Lounge Out here my guard is never down Im a wellknown person in this town There are people out here who dont like me A lot of things from the past they just dont disappear His right forearm is scarred from where a bullet passed through  years agoToday he lives in Westchester County with his mother He drives for Uber He was introduced to Mr Brown when the filmmaker who had become intrigued with Albanian gangsters after reading about the Rudaj mob case arrived in the neighborhood and started asking questionsIf Im going to do something good and real Ive got to talk to these guys said Mr Brown  who was born in South AfricaThe two men hit it off and Mr Rezajs friends would gather with them setting aside a habitual mistrust of outsiders Every time Id go out with John Id hear a story that could be its own film Mr Brown saidMr Brown wrote a long script for an epic revenge film set in Kosovo and New York then set it aside He wrote a page outline of a much more local story and showed it to Mr Rezaj There would be no scriptHe said Youre the story Youre the script all these stories youve been telling Mr Rezaj recalledMr Brown with Mr Rezajs help assembled a small mostly nonprofessional cast from the Bronx Mr Browns wife the actress Ashley C Williams whose credits include the stomachchurning horror film The Human Centipede First Sequence plays a person of levelheaded tranquillity in a world of violent menThe film which was shot over  days in the Bronx Queens and Brooklyn tells the story of Leon Mr Rezaj a former player in organized crime who becomes obsessed with killing the informant who sent him to prison as a young man after he runs into the man in a barIn the course of the films lean minute running time Leon becomes unhinged in a swirl of cognac and cocaine murderously stalking through barrooms and back streets with a pistol tucked under his tank top Mr Rezajs ability to explode with rage at the slightest provocation while in character is unnerving  and he said not an acting stretchI can do that anytime he said The only thing I found hard about this job was the freaking hours He hated all the repeat takes Everybody would get it right one guy would get it wrong he said Then another guy would mess up Lets do it again Lets do it again It was the worst thing to hear he added In one scene Leon beats a man beyond recognition with a bat in a garage over an overdue debt In reality Mr Rezaj was hitting a tire on the floor He was sore for daysHes truly like an animal Mr Brown said Hes completely in the moment He cant talk about it he cant because he doesnt know what hes doingA rare disagreement between the director and the lead occurred after the end of filming Mr Rezaj did not like the title that Mr Brown had given the movie I was disgusted Mr Rezaj said Im getting judged by that titleMr Brown pushed back Albanians tend not to like it as much he said Everybody else loves itThe film is called Albanian GangsterMichael Wilson

Stanford senior Travis had been working out privately last spring in anticipation of the NBA draft But an invitation to the combine never came A few teams had him work out but the message was clear that he would not be among the NBAs precious  draft picksSix feet  inches and solid but used to playing near the rim Travis said he was told he needed to add another dimension to his game  be more versatile become a better passer decrease turnovers become more athletic Given that he suddenly had to decide whether to stay at Stanford as a graduate student or to pursue a graduate degree in basketball somewhere elseFollow our live coverage of the NCAA tournament hereAnd thus was created a different kind of oneanddone at college basketballs top finishing school John Caliparis Kentucky the famed lair of ubertalented highschoolers who play one NBAmandated season of games before entering the draftGranted Im four five years older than these guys Travis said last month sitting in a lounge outside the locker room of Kentuckys practice facility But I am here for a year similar to themTraviss decision was striking because for more than a decade Calipari has been the most popular host of raw freshmen rather than seasoned seniors His modus operandi at Kentucky has been to accept without apology the best  and yearolds in July coach them up and send them off to the NBA the following June Since Calipari arrived in Lexington in  Kentucky has averaged three firstround picks a year most of them freshmen The team has also reached four Final Fours and captured a national titleEnter Travis a twotime AllPac firstteamer who turned  in November He was injured most of one season at Stanford and a medical redshirt left him with one more year of eligibility But before leaving Stanford he walked at graduation with his class he majored in Science Technology and Society a course of study that attracts many of the techminded who arrive in Palo Alto with dreams of staying in Silicon Valley after collegeThat is why moving to Kentucky also made perfect sense A highly recruited prospect from Minneapolis five years ago Travis had one year left and he sought out a school that could help him get to where he wanted to be as a basketball playerYoure playing something games a season but youre in practice almost  days said Travis analyzing the problem like an engineerSo where can I go where Im playing against a pro every day in practice he added I felt like this was the best platform where everyone can potentially be a pro at their position and thats who youre training with at night thats who youre practicing with thats who youre hanging out with eating with Everyone has the same mindset of trying to be a professionalThe jury is still out on whether he has sufficiently improved his draft stock Two NBA frontoffice executives who declined to be named because NBA rules ban public discussion of prospects delivered mixed reviews One predicted Travis will not be drafted and the other argued that thanks to Traviss time at Kentucky he had played his way into the low or midsecond roundCalipari has had Travis confined mostly to the paint But James Clark a private coach who worked with Travis last summer said that Travis had improved his shooting to the point where he could play as a stretch four  the valuable kind of power forward who can create more space for his offense by serving as a threat to score away from the rimI also think people are seeing how strong he is Clark added Hes smart with the basketball  he doesnt have a lot of turnoversAt Kentucky  which faces Abilene Christian in the first round of the NCAA mens tournament on Thursday in Jacksonville Fla Travis emerged as a starter and key force near the basket Because he is playing fewer minutes on the starstocked Wildcats most of his pergame statistics are down from the previous two seasons although his block total has skyrocketed but his impact has nonetheless been powerfulCalipari credited Travis with wrestling Grant Williams the resident bruiser on rival Tennessee to a draw in Kentuckys victory over its fellow No  seed last month As if to prove Caliparis point Tennessee won the next meeting between the teams when Travis was out with a sprained knee Tennessee also won the rubber match  by  points  in the Southeastern Conference tournament with Travis back on the court but probably not at full strengthFor Calipari the education of Travis is a task at once unusual and familiarHeres a kid that works like this that needs a little extra stuff to be able to go reach his dreams and it appealed to me Calipari said during an interview in his officeAt one point Calipari referred to Travis as a good kid and then scolded himself for calling Travis a kidThe two bonded last fall during the contentious hearings over Brett Kavanaughs Supreme Court nominationWe talked about the Supreme Court stuff that was going on said Calipari a politics junkie Havent been able to do that in the last eight or nine yearsOne night at a team dinner Calipari told Travis he thought Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota who played a prominent role in the hearings might make a compelling Democratic presidential candidate Travis agreed his family and Klobuchars are family friends he went to high school with the senators daughter Abigail Bessler Klobuchar entered the presidential race in FebruaryTravis will spend the next few years trying hard to earn an NBA spotCalipari is optimistic because Travis can shoot create off the dribble and score Hes going to be one of those guys in that league who you want in your locker room you want on your team that has the toughness to guard anybody Calipari saidThe process might take time a lucky break more improvement or a combination of all three Periods of frustration seem likelyIt is also easy to see Travis eventually ending up in business school He aspires to athletic administration at Stanford he took the time to get to know the athletic director Bernard MuirThat is something to think about later There is a more immediate task for the fifthyear senior who as of Thursday morning had won a National Invitation Tournament championship but had yet to play in an NCAA tournament gameIve been happy with what I came for Travis said recently and what I really came for is MarchMarc Stein contributed

Jamie Condliffe Greetings from London Heres a look at the weeks tech newsThere is little as fashionable in  as the desire to curb Big Techs power But knowing how far regulators should go in putting limits on Silicon Valleys largest companies isnt straightforwardAt one extreme there are calls to break up Big Tech  Senator Elizabeth Warren grabbed headlines during the week when she called for just that Ms Warren a Massachusetts Democrat argued that companies shouldnt offer their own products on platforms they controlled like Apples selling apps on its App Store  something Spotify called out to European regulators on Wednesday She also said she would roll back anticompetitive acquisitions such as Facebooks takeovers of Instagram and WhatsAppHer pitch isnt perfect as The New York Timess Kevin Roose pointed out  its too generic misses easy wins and overlooks some big issues But it is a bold inspiring rally cry for Big Techs biggest criticsAt the other end of the spectrum tech companies Ideally the likes of Facebook and Google would love to perpetually operate in the lightly regulated world that helped them grow so quickly But even Mark Zuckerberg Facebooks chief executive acknowledged that it was inevitable that there will be some regulation when he testified to the House Energy and Commerce Committee in AprilTheres plenty of room between those extremes Take for example a report published Wednesday by the British government which called for an overhaul of antitrust policies for Big Tech Its main proposal that a new regulator identify companies with strategic market status then block some activities  such as promoting their own products or services in search results over those belonging to competitors hello GoogleThat the reports authors say is a more probusiness and proconsumer solution than changing antitrust law to drive breakup of businessesSo whos right Mr Zuckerberg at least when he says regulatory intervention is inevitable Theres strong bipartisan support for such regulation As for where a line should be drawn thats harder to sayBreaking up big companies isnt easy Its expensive and takes a long time And it doesnt always go to plan The last notable attempt to do so when a judge ruled two decades ago that Microsoft be cleaved for having violated antitrust law was overturned on appeal So Ms Warren could have her work cut out for herBut it may ultimately become a question of balancing ambition with need Is it better to gamble on breaking up big companies or guarantee that new rules curb some of their behavior Thats something that lawmakers are going to have to wrestle withWhen OpenAI was founded three years ago it had a huge goal to build artificial intelligence software that was as capable as the human brain Its founders said that because it was a nonprofit with noble ambitions  it had  billion in funding from backers to pay its way  the public could trust it to build that socalled general artificial intelligenceOnly  billion doesnt go far with goals like that Huge computing resources and big salaries to attract talent burn through cash Actually it turns out some profits might be usefulSo Wired reported Open AI announced that it was changing its business model To keep up with Facebook and Google it created a OpenAI LP a company that can take money from investors that need to return a profit like venture funds That will make it easier to raise funds Down the line it might monetize some of the technology it develops But the company decided to cap the returns that investors will see  to  for every dollar investedOne way to think of that figure is that OpenAI deems a times return to be an ethical margin on building a general AI  enough to make it a feasible endeavor but not so much as to tar it with the Big Tech brush That reasoning clearly holds if you inhabit Silicon Valley But it will be interesting to see if that profit cap is enough to put everyone at easeOn March   Tim BernersLee proposed an idea for linking digital files that his boss Mike Sendall called vague but exciting It ultimately became the World Wide Web and  years later were left with much to love  and hate  about its existenceAt an event at Londons Science Museum on Tuesday to mark the webs passage into its fourth decade Mr BernersLee was asked what it might look like in another  years Heres what he said Its not I think for us to try and guess Look at whats happened over the last  years The web has changed really dramatically and a lot of that we couldnt have predicted What we can do is we can say what web we want We want a web which is open We want a web which is royaltyfree We want a web which is discriminationfreeWorthy goals And in an article he wrote this past week Mr BernersLee laid out steps that may be required to ensure they happen Governments must translate laws and regulations for the digital age They must ensure markets remain competitive innovative and open Companies must do more to ensure their pursuit of shortterm profit is not at the expense of human rights democracy scientific fact or public safety Platforms and products must be designed with privacy diversity and security in mind  And most important of all citizens must hold companies and governments accountableThirty years on Mr Sendalls analysis might apply equally well to this proposal tooElon Musk really dislikes whistleblowers According to Businessweek Mr Musk the Tesla chief executive set out to destroy one employee who leaked details about raw materials wastage at the companyHow does Google pay off

executive of Pimco one of the worlds biggest bond fund managers Mr Caplan was placed on leave on Wednesday and Mr Hodges name was stripped from the website of Sway Ventures an investment firm where he was a venture partnerMr Hodge is also listed as a board member for two wealthy private schools in California Sage Hill School and the Thacher School Blossom Beatty Pidduck Thachers head of school said on Wednesday that Mr Hodge had been on the board since  and that the board was discussing whether to let him continue serving Messages left with Sage Hill were not returned WednesdayThe actresses Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin were the boldface names in the charges announced on Tuesday by federal prosecutors in Boston but such celebrities may still be able to find work after their cases are resolved That wont necessarily be the case for the highpowered lawyers and money managers on the listProfessionals their stock in trade has to be their integrity said Laurie Levenson a former federal prosecutor and a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles Celebrities have a different stock in tradeMr Caplan who worked on complex deals for Hudsons Bay including the sale of Lord  Taylors former flagship store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan would lose his law license in New York if convicted of a felony Mr McGlashan whose reputation drew star power to a fund with the idea of positive social change may have a hard time raising money if he has a felony conviction on his record And Mr Hodge who told Harvard Business Review last year that he was surprised how quickly opportunity came my way after his retirement could see those chances to do something new dry upAfter the charges were announced the firms quickly sought to distance themselves from the accused TPGs announcement noted that the charges against Mr McGlashan were for personal misconduct and Willkie Farr pointed out that the case against Mr Caplan was a personal matter and does not involve Willkie or any of its clients Willkie also removed Mr Caplans biography from the firms websiteA lawyer for Mr Caplan and a spokesman for Mr McGlashan declined to comment on Wednesday Mr Hodge could not be reached for commentNeither TPG nor Willkie is likely to be undone by the charges against a leadership figure but both firms may face uncomfortable questions from clients and investors TPG for example has long cultivated an image as a progressive and trustworthy institution It moved quickly to install Jim Coulter its chief executive and a cofounder as acting chief of the Rise FundMr McGlashan is listed as one of several key men in agreements with investors who committed money to TPG but his suspension  or potential permanent exit  would not unwind those agreements unless several more of TPGs top managers departed according to a person familiar with the firms operations who was not authorized to speak publicly Investors in the fund have committed money for several years and the case is unlikely to have a direct financial impact on the fundOn Wednesday Mr McGlashan stepped down from the board of STX Entertainment the film studio that he helped found with the producer Robert Simonds The news was shared in an internal memo sent to STX employees and reviewed by The New York Times STX is funded in large part by TPG which said in the memo that it remained committed to the studio whose movies include the teen comedy The Edge of SeventeenRebecca Roiphe a former prosecutor and a professor at New York Law School who specializes in legal ethics said she expected few clients would leave Willkie Farr because of the charges against Mr Caplan who in April was named a deal maker of the year by The American Lawyer a trade magazine But she said the case could give potential clients a reason to ask questions about the firms culture and its process for selecting lawyers to manage the firmThey made the choice to have this person represent the firm Ms Roiphe saidCharging documents filed by federal prosecutors describe how parents were willing to pay William Singer the founder of the Edge College  Career Network a college preparatory business up to  to arrange for cheating on standardized tests or hundreds of thousands of dollars to bribe college coaches to recruit a student Mr Singer who has pleaded guilty to charges including racketeering conspiracy and obstruction of justice cooperated with the investigationAccording to prosecutors Mr Singer advised Mr McGlashan to claim that his son had learning disabilities which would allow the student more time to complete an entrance exam and Mr McGlashan gave  to Mr Singers charity The men also discussed creating a fake football recruiting profile for his sonMr Hodge paid more than half a million dollars to get two of his children into the University of Southern California according to prosecutors who also said his discussions with Mr Singer had been captured on secret recordingsMr Caplan was also caught on tape the authorities said In discussing the scheme to improve his daughters college entrance exam score in return for  prosecutors said Mr Caplan asked Mr Singer a number of times if anyone has gotten caught or ever gotten into an issue with thisAt one point prosecutors said he told Mr Singer Keep in mind I am a lawyer So I am sort of ruleorientedAn earlier version of this article misstated the

Satariano and Jack NicasLONDON  Apples powerful role as gatekeeper of the App Store has long frustrated the makers of apps who must abide by its rules or risk losing access to hundreds of millions of customers who own Apple devicesNow one of Apples biggest rivals the music streaming service Spotify says Apple is abusing its position and violating European antitrust lawsIn an aggressive attempt to undercut Apples power Spotify said on Wednesday that it had filed a complaint with European regulators accusing Apple of using its App Store to squash companies that compete with its services including Apple MusicSpotifys complaint comes at perilous moment for the worlds biggest tech companies Scrutiny over Silicon Valleys power has been increasing in recent years and has already become a topic among Democratic presidential hopefulsOne of them Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts last week proposed breaking up the tech giants as a remedy to their unfair advantages One of her ideas was to separate the App Store from AppleSpotifys complaint is just the latest example of what can happen when these enormous companies abuse their power to undermine competition Ms Warren said in a statement Wednesday We need a level playing field and that starts by breaking up giant tech companies who both own a marketplace and operate in that same marketplaceOn Wednesday a British government report also called for tougher antitrust laws for the industryApples role as a makeorbreak arbiter has long frustrated app makers by imposing rules and charging a fee of up to  percent on anything sold through its App StoreSpotify which has headquarters in Luxembourg and Sweden said it had told the European Commission an aggressive regulator of the tech industry that the policies were not just a costly nuisance but a tax that violated competition laws and merited an investigationThe policies have been particularly vexing for companies like Spotify that compete with Apple Spotify and Apple Music are the worlds largest music streaming servicesThey continue to give themselves an unfair advantage at every turn Daniel Ek Spotifys chief executive said in a message posted on the companys website He said Apple was acting as both player and referee to deliberately disadvantage other app developersApple did not respond to a request for comment The company has said the fees are reasonable given that it must maintain the App Store and is providing access to millions of potential customers who own Apple devicesApples introduction of the App Store in  revolutionized the mobilephone industry creating a new marketplace for consumers to download games productivity tools and social networking services There are now more than two million apps available on the App StoreCompanies like Spotify have thrived on Apples platform which typically generates more money for app developers than Googles Play StoreSpotifys overall sales last year rose  percent to  billion euros or about  billion but the company is not profitable and is under pressure from investors to improve its margins The company paid about  percent of its revenue to cover music rights and related costsSpotify has been a formidable competitor to Apple in attracting customers for music streaming Spotify said that it ended  with  million active users around the world including  million who were signed up for a paid subscription that did not include ads In January Apple said that its Apple Music service had  million paying usersApples control over the App Store has been an increasing source of tension as the company has focused more on online services that compete with many of the apps sold on its platform As iPhone sales have leveled off Apple has relied more on sales of software and services The largest driver of that sort of revenue is the App StoreSpotify said Apple was continually changing its policies to harm competitorsApps should be able to compete fairly on the merits and not based on who owns the App Store Mr Ek said We should all be subject to the same fair set of rules and restrictions  including Apple MusicA search for music on the App Store on Wednesday showed how Apple can give itself an advantage The top result was an ad for Apple Music followed by eight more results for Apple apps Spotify was listed thCompanies are finding ways to reduce the fees they pay to Apple In  Spotify started sending customers to an outside website to make a payment rather than processing charges within its app Netflix and Amazon have made similar movesAs a result Spotify generally does not share revenue with Apple for customers who signed up after  but pays  percent for customers who signed up before that period Apples fee decreases to  percent from  percent after the first year of a subscriptionSensor Tower an appdata firm estimated that Apple still took in  percent of the roughly  million consumers spent on Spotify on the App Store from  through But Apple punishes companies that do not use its payment system by restricting their ability to communicate with customers and preventing the release of app updates Spotify claimed Spotify accused Apple of blocking its app and other Apple competitors from services such as Siri HomePod and Apple WatchSpotify said Apple also treated companies differently Uber for example is not required to pay a fee to Apple for charges through its appApple demonstrated its power this year when in response to Facebooks violating its app rules it  temporarily shut down Facebooks internal apps including those for the companys cafeteria menu and shuttle scheduleThe European Commission has a history of turning a companys antitrust complaints into larger investigations of tech platforms Last year it fined Google a record  billion about  billion at the time for antitrust abuses related to its Android operating system and forced Google to effectively loosen its grip over the platform Google is appealing European officials are also investigating possible anticompetitive practices by AmazonEuropean regulators have expressed concerns about Apples dominance in music Last year the European Commission held up Apples acquisition of the songidentification app Shazam over concerns it would harm competition though the deal was eventually approved In  the commission accused Apple of a tax avoidance scheme and ordered the company to pay  billion in back taxes to Ireland a decision Apple is appealingIt is unclear whether Spotifys complaint will lead European regulators to start a formal investigation of Apple The term of Margrethe Vestager the top antitrust official in the European Commission ends this year meaning the decision could fall to her successorThe commission has received a complaint by Spotify which we are assessing under our standard procedures the commission said in a statementIn the United States the Supreme Court is considering a suit brought by consumers claiming that Apples control over the App Store

weather And that is the strong likelihood that the states desert parks will soon be awash in vibrant Instagrammable colorThats right Another super bloom is probably upon usIn  wildflower blooms in Southern California were so massive that they were visible from space This year experts say a combination of fires to clear out competing flora and rain mean that conditions are shaping up to be optimal for a similar displayI asked Casey Schreiner founder and editor of the website Modern Hiker about the best ways to enjoy the flowersThe short answer Research and flexibility he saidIn California Mr Schreiner said because there are so many different microclimates its tough to predict and plan for peak bloomsEveryone wants to know When should I book my campsite When should I book travel he said The reality is thats not really how this process worksIf youre truly committed to experiencing the height of a wildflower bloom in any given park or region youll need to be ready to

organizations track wildflower blooms and can offer very educated guesses on when things are going to pop Heres Modern Hikers full list of resourcesMr Schreiner said he often relied on the Theodore Payne Foundations wildflower hotline  although its season officially kicks off in March so it hasnt started putting out weekly reportsOf course the flip side to all this flexibility is that in places like AnzaBorrego Desert State Park which has come to be known as the super bloom epicenter reservable campsites might already be booked up Lodging in Borrego Springs too is most likely to be jammedThe nice thing about AnzaBorrego Mr Schreiner said is that as long as you follow certain guidelines you can pretty much camp wherever you want within the parkAlternatively you can always plan to hike a great wildflower trail like one of these whenever youre available to camp and appreciate whatever you seeNo matter what Mr Schreiner said be a responsible user of the outdoors It may be tempting to

economic sluggishness But there were encouraging signs in the data as wellBy Patricia CohenThe economys remarkably steady jobcreation machine sputtered in February and produced a mere  jobs It was the smallest gain in well over a year and came on top of other signs that the economy was off to a sluggish start in  For months the labor market could be counted on for an upbeat counterpoint to negative

delivered by last years tax cuts fades Carl Tannenbaum chief economist at Northern Trust in Chicago said Fridays news from the Labor Department was worrisome This is a disappointing report he said I dont think theres any way to sugarcoat itBut the longerterm trend is what matters and there were competing interpretations of whether the report was a troubling omen or a flukeBeyond the months

Brown Brothers Harriman Aftereffects of the government shutdown and wretched weather may have contributed to anomalies in the report This is the strangest jobs report Ive seen in a long time Mr Clemons said Its bizarre I cant help but think there is noise in there During the decadelong expansion the economy has churned out  million jobs The anemic job creation and rising wages could indicate that the pool of available workers was drying up and employers were having trouble filling openingsThe real challenge is the shortage of people said Tom Gimbel chief executive of LaSalle Network a

adding head count he said But the combination of the payroll news with the prospect of torpid firstquarter growth and stubborn trade disputes cannot be brushed off said Mr Tannenbaum the Northern Trust economist Its a signal we need to be cautious with the US economic outlook he added  On Wall Street the SP  was down roughly  percent on Friday It was the fifth straight decline for the index a marked slowdown after the first two months of the year The labor report could reflect some of the confusion and delays prompted by the day partial government shutdown which extended through most of January Furloughed federal workers and affected contractors had to scrounge for parttime work when their paychecks were halted Those circumstances were reflected in Januarys report which showed that the number of workers who snagged parttime jobs for economic reasons jumped by nearly half a million and those temporarily unemployed rose by roughly They now have paychecks and dont need to drive Uber to make ends meet said Diane Swonk chief economist at the accounting firm Grant Thornton The shutdown also postponed hiring both within the government and in the private sector in part because the federal electronic service that verifies the employment eligibility of prospective workers  EVerify  was not operating Some of those hires particularly in the public sector may be in the pipeline Government payrolls  federal state and local  were down by Delays in incometax refunds may also have had an impact if people held off with discretionary purchases Ms Swonk said The leisure and hospitality showed no growth Some of the layoffs that big retailers like Gap JCPenney Sears Dollar Tree and Abercrombie  Fitch have announced may be starting to trickle through as well with a drop of

minutes though the car thief returned He just wanted to take such a nice ride for a spin apparently If Im honest I was really upset Mr Novak said but I tried to be jovial about the whole thing Why

following yet another loss earlier this season His Orlando Magic teammates showered and dressed and leftGordons back had been bothering him and no wonder Hes in his fifth year of carrying the Magic franchise And he is in for the long haul too After doing what he described as due diligence this past summer Gordon signed a fouryear  million contract handing over most of his mids to a team that so far has failed to put a winning combination around himBut if the foot multidimensional star is still waiting for a winning supporting cast his  season is the latest best evidence yet that he is approaching a specific kind of broadbased play that is fast becoming a requirement for surviving in the NBAGordon showed it off days ago in a  win over the Golden State WarriorsHe did it all scoring  points pulling down  rebounds and using his defensive athleticism to help limit the Warriors to for shooting from point range By the end of last week the surging Magic had found themselves in eighth place in the Eastern Conference and in new territory for Gordon the playoff raceIt has taken every skill Gordon has but for his part the yearold has embraced the way the competition in the NBA has demanded that he do virtually everything on any given nightVersatility is going to be a huge part The league is going in that direction Gordon said So its going to be    foot guys able to do everything  handle the ball pass shoot rebound Thats the way the game is going to beAnd thats the way the game is for Gordon and how it has been dating back to his high school days at Archbishop Mitty in San Jose Calif where he played point guard before a late growth spurt turned him into a foot forward at Arizona and then the fourth overall pick in the  NBA draftThe Magic can use Gordon anywhereFor three consecutive possessions in a game against the Houston Rockets in January Gordon found himself bringing the ball up the floor and feeding center Nikola Vucevic in the post settling out on the wing for a pointer on a catchandshoot and then posting up himselfOffensively his efficiency is up and his assists are way up Magic Coach Steve Clifford said of Gordon I think one of our issues has been drawing fouls and getting the ball going into the paint And thats something hes done a good job withGordon was back in San Jose this past summer getting up  shots every day and the result has been a  true shooting percentage his most efficient showing in three years even as hes taken more shots from everywhere on the court and opposing defenses have constructed game plans around stopping himBut he also put in extra time on work like slide steps all with the longrange goal of becoming an elite twoway player Clifford said Gordon laid out his plans for himself when the two first spoke after Clifford was hired over the summerThe results have been extraordinary Per Synergy Gordon ranks second of  qualified players in the NBA in points per possession on isolation plays minimum  possessions with  points per possessionAnd he isnt doing this against just bigs either The Magic routinely play him against the opposing teams biggest offensive threatWhen the Magic played the Nets in January Orlando had Gordon take on Joe Harris a shooting guard the league leader in threepoint percentage and winner of the threepoint contest during AllStar weekendThat speaks to first of all what they think of Joe and also what they think of Gordons defensive game Nets Coach Kenny Atkinson said And defensively when he wants to stop a guy he can stop him  he has phenomenal athleticismThe extent of Gordons abilities on that end were revealed further against the Nets that night when a switch landed Gordon on the Nets DAngelo Russell an uberquick point guard in the midst of the finest scoring barrage of his career Russell feinted left right trying to find a pathway with his dribble from the top of the key Gordon did not let him pass and Russell clearly frustrated finally shunted the ball off to a teammateThe indications that Gordon has become a star are there What is far less clear is how Orlando puts a championship team around him though Clifford effusively endorsed him as the model player of that future rosterHe fits with what wins in the NBA right now Clifford said Hes  and hes made terrific gains already this yearClifford is a capable coach in his first season with Orlando But the roster looks less like a plan and more like a series of oneoff moves Vucevic is an excellent traditional center but his presence has kept Gordon along with young bigs Mo Bamba and Jonathan Isaac from getting significant time developing as the kind of stretch s most teams around the league deployGordon is picked to run the offense and does so effectively  his assist percentage of  is a career high  but that is in part because Orlando lacks a true starting point guard Markelle Fultz may be the answer longterm but whether the embattled former Philadelphia ers guard even plays this season remains a mysteryGordons next step per Clifford needs to be the role of goto scorer down the stretch of games which Gordon agrees with Will it happenWell well see Clifford said I mean thats what its all about Well seeBut he needs help getting to those lategame situations with a chance to win it Still as Gordon eases into superstardom in the relative obscurity of Orlandos slow rise in the East he often uses visualization to help motivate himself closing his eyes and picturing what a championship for the only franchise hes ever known would look likeHe said it gets hard to see it sometimes pointing out that a lot of things have to go right even as he said he was sure it willOf course Gordon said pulling on his pants gingerly navigating his sore backToppling the Warriors last week showed Gordon just may be right Losing to the lowly Cleveland Cavaliers on Sunday night though showed how far the Magic have to goAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byThe citys inaugural event has pushed

crossword columnJeff Slutzky makes his New York Times Crossword debut ably abetted by Derek BowmanBy Deb AmlenTHURSDAY PUZZLE  Administrivial Update Thanks to all who have written to let us know about the commenting issue The community team is currently working on it and we thank you for your patienceIts always a pleasure to see a new constructor make a debut in The New York Times and today we welcome Jeff Slutzky who learned the ropes from Derek Bowman A side note before we look at their puzzle Id like to reiterate that the best way to get started making crossword puzzles is to find a mentor and to work with that person on polishing skills before submitting work to an editor The learning curve for making crosswords is steep and hard to climb alone Still some aspiring constructors avoid this stepMaybe they want to be left alone to practice on their own or maybe they are sensitive to criticism For whatever reason they avoid working with a pro and find themselves facing a long list of rejection emails whereupon they give up and walk away from a fun hobby and a wonderful communityI dont understand that Puzzle editors only have time to give limited feedback when responding to submissions so isnt it better to have your very own pro to ask questions and work with The puzzle community is a lovely one and I have not met a more helpful crowd O K maybe emergency medical workers are actually more helpful but if you want to learn how to make a puzzle in the most efficient way join the Crossword Puzzle Collaboration Directory on Facebook and look at the list of veteran constructors who have volunteered their time to help Pick one and ask if he or she has time to help you with some of your ideas Be patient with veteran constructors time and really listen to what they tell you If they have criticism  and I hope its gentle and sensible  dont feel bad or get angry at them They are trying to make you a better and hopefully published constructor Above all dont give upMr Slutzky worked with Mr Bowman before submitting his puzzle you can read more about their collaboration in their notes below and look where he is now You could be doing that too and then we could all gather here to say nice things about your puzzleA Bass group is nice misdirection that fooled me for quite awhile The answer is NSYNC because the singer Lance Bass was a founding memberA TIL that the Nobel Prize is not only a shiny medal but also a monetary prize worth  million kronor According to xecom a currency calculator that is worth  USDA Long time out is not referring to being outside your home for a long time its talking about being out or unconscious for a long time The answer is COMAA The entry ATF is short for the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives that was added

director RIAN Johnson who is appearing in the New York Times Crossword for the first timeMr Slutzky and Mr Bowman offer us a sound addition theme wherein we are supposed to add TOR to the theme entries to give them a different meaning The revealer at A the final Across entry is TORAH clued as Sacred text  or your reaction upon figuring out this puzzles theme TOR  AhFor example at A the answer to the clue Kidnapper who gets arrested is CAPTOR IN HAND which is based on the phrase cap in handJeff Slutzky Im excited to be making my New York Times Crossword debut Its my first crossword anywhere actually I first came up with this theme several years ago but I knew nothing about crossword constructing software or word lookup programs at the time so I tried to create the whole puzzle using graph paper my pencil and my brain I didnt get very farI met Derek Bowman at the  American Crossword Puzzle Tournament Hes a veteran constructor and when I told him I had a theme idea he expressed interest in collaborating with me He came up with a couple of new theme entries as well as the great TORAH kicker at the end One of our original entries  MENTOR AT WORK clued as Yoda or Mr Miyagi from  to   was nixed by the editors because it didnt really change the meaning of the base phrase so we replaced it with CAPTOR IN HANDDerek was great to work with and I learned a lot from him Im glad we were able to put this puzzle togetherDerek Bowman After emailing back and forth a bit after we met we ended up collaborating on this puzzle Jeff had several ideas for theme entries that involved adding TOR to common phrases and I found them to be very funny ITS RAINING MENTOR sadly ended up on the cutting room floor Together we eventually narrowed it down to the theme entries listed in the grid with some guidance from Will Shortz and Sam EzerskyJeff has a great sense of humor and Im still amazed that he immediately identified the tune from Dear Evan Hansen that was lovingly redone at the ACPT talent show last year after hearing just a few notes Jeff is a whiz at musicals has a keen eye for detail and was a lot of fun to work with on this puzzleAlmost finished solving but

LeaderMs Leader is a law student and activistAs a student at Harvard I reported a sexual assault by a classmate to the university After a sixmonth investigation that ended after I graduated I received a decision from the administrative board The board voted to scratch a term defined in the administrative boards handbook Nothing wrong occurred it reads There are no grounds for actionCollege students who endure sexual assault and sexual harassment have long been frustrated by anemic responses from their schools which too often echo that message Nothing wrong occurred A new rule that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has proposed  and which the public can comment on through Wednesday  would make a bad situation even worse by all but demolishing the obligation of schools under Title IX to protect students who experience sexual harassment including sexual assault As the MeToo movement continues to empower survivors of assault and harassment in various professions to speak out we should worry not only about the effects of this proposed change on campuses but also about the related price women will pay after graduation I fear  and research suggests that the campus predators whom schools fail to hold accountable today may go on to become the abusive bosses of tomorrowThe Opinion section is now on Instagram Follow us at nytopinionI have cautiously hoped that the accountability the MeToo movement has brought to the workplace would trickle into university life But instead at the very time people like Harvey Weinstein and R Kelly have begun to face consequences for their behavior Ms DeVos is pushing to roll back the Title IX guidance that assaulted and harassed students depend on to seek justice Among other changes her proposed rule would require schools to dismiss all incidents that do not meet an extremely narrow definition of sexual harassment so severe pervasive and objectively offensive that it effectively denies a person equal access to education As Dana Bolger a cofounder of Know Your IX a national youthled campaign against sexual violence has pointed out some courts have ruled that a rape does not meet this standard The rule would essentially eliminate schools responsibility to respond to incidents off campus which make up  percent of sexual assaults of female students according to the Department of Justice Moreover schools would not be legally responsible for addressing any sexual harassment that is not reported to a school official designated to deal with that issue The overall effect of the proposed rule  which supporters say would restore dueprocess rights to those accused of sexual assault and harassment would be to make reporting already an uphill battle for raped and harassed students feel even more futile Carly Mee who represents survivors of school sexual violence as a senior staff lawyer at SurvJustice told me It is completely illogical that at a time when the public is finally coming to terms with the reality of how prevalent sexual violence is thanks to initiatives like Tarana Burkes MeToo movement the DeVos administration is simultaneously attempting to weaken Title IX protections for survivorsIts safe to assume that most perpetrators of sexual violence who have come to public notice through MeToo didnt suddenly become abusers after landing jobs in newsrooms and board rooms and on movie sets Their idea that one can abuse with impunity is learned and in many cases it is learned where most things are learned  at school Violent sexual behavior that goes unchecked during college does not reach a natural end at graduation In fact many perpetrators of sexual violence are serial offenders Of men who acknowledge using sexually violent or coercive behaviors around one in five report committing repeat assaults Another study found that men reporting a history of sexually aggressive behavior commit on average more than six sexual assaults Examples of school perpetrators who skirted accountability and then offended after graduation are already emerging Jameis Winston who was accused of rape as a student at Florida State University and is now a professional football player reached a settlement with an Uber driver who said he sexually assaulted her in her car in But the path from perpetrator of school sexual violence to workplace abuser need not be inevitable Interventions including cognitive behavioral therapy have proved to be highly effective in preventing perpetrators from reoffending Far from being unfair responding seriously to perpetrators of school sexual violence is tough kindness As the world grows increasingly intolerant of violent sexual behavior early intervention and clear messages about appropriate behavior can prevent perpetrators from reoffending and facing more longterm career legal and personal consequencesBut the first step in effectively intervening must be more not less accountability Ms Mee suggests that Ms DeVos should begin by devising policies responsive to school survivors needs The public conversations going on right now need to translate into action Ms Mee told me Those in power have a responsibility to listen to the stories being told and use this momentum to improve the system through which survivors seek justice not weaken them even further If they dont they risk emboldening perpetrators who offended in early in life to continue abusing the women in the workplace I took the unusual step of suing Harvard for its handling of my case and was unsuccessful The judge dismissed the Title IX claim because of her determination that the university was not deliberately indifferent But as Ive learned as a student activist Im far from alone in my experience of seeing a man accused of sexual assault assured by a college that his actions were not out of bounds  and wondering what that means for the women who will encounter him in the future While I obtained a restraining order against the man who assaulted me in college he graduated and got a coveted job where hell only have more and more power as time goes on While I hope hell never become the villain of another womans MeToo story I am not optimistic The proposed rules make it even more likely that men like him will leave their college campuses and enter the work force believing they can abuse women and be assured Nothing wrong occurredAlyssa Leader

HuWhat you need to know to start the day Get New York Today in your inboxThe traffic choking New York City streets has brought new congestion fees on taxis and Ubers and rallied support around a broader congestion pricing plan to charge all cars and trucks entering the busiest neighborhoodsNow city officials are ratcheting up the fight against another traffic headache parking scofflawsOn Thursday Mayor Bill de Blasio is expected to announce new measures aimed at municipal employees who abuse cityissued parking placards that are intended to help them carry out their official duties but too often are abused and contribute to clogged streetsMany employees brazenly display the placards while parked illegally  including in crosswalks on sidewalks and blocking bus and bike lanes  or while using personal vehicles when not workingUnder the de Blasio administration the number of cityissued placards has soared and critics have accused the mayor of doing little to tackle the problemNow city officials are promising a more aggressive campaign A new enforcement team of traffic agents will issue tickets and target placard abuse in neighborhoods that have become hot spots such as Downtown Brooklyn and Chinatown Any placard found to be misused three times will be revoked under a new three strikes policy previously it had been left to the discretion of the agencies that issued the placardsIn addition the city will make the misuse or fraudulent use of a placard a separate violation on top of any parking violation Currently placard abuse is treated as a parking violation and carries a  fine City officials said they would push for changes to state law to establish a  fine for placard abuseThe city also plans to test out stickers as a replacement for paper placards to make it harder to transfer placards to unauthorized vehicles It will also develop a digital parking system by  in which physical placards will be unnecessary because license plates will already be linked to a database and parking violations will be automatically issued through a socalled paybyplate systemStill none of the mayors measures will significantly reduce the total number of cityissued placards which have nearly doubled to  in  from  in  according to city records The largest chunk  is issued by the Transportation Department for its own employees as well as those at other government agencies and others The Police Department issues another  to law enforcement officers and the Education Department  to teachers and school employees to park near their schoolsTransportation advocates say the police fail to vigorously target scofflaws in part because some officers themselves abuse their placardsAdvocates also accuse city officials of doling out parking placards as political favors to the powerful teachers unions and others including  new placards for teachers and school employees in  They said the city has helped create the problem because more placards lead to more opportunities for abuse and the oversupply of placards has encouraged more people to drive to work putting more cars on the roadThe elephant in the room is whether they can reduce placard abuse to everyones satisfaction without a meaningful reduction in the sheer number of placards said Danny Pearlstein a spokesman for the Riders Alliance a grassroots group of transit ridersThe placards Mr Pearlstein said have essentially created a large class of privileged city workers many of whom would otherwise be taking buses and subways Its a question of fairness he said Plenty of people have to get to work on time and do work that is important to the life of the cityCity officials said that  temporary placards for school employees were issued to resolve a labor dispute with the teachers union But the number of placards dropped to  later that year when the Education Department moved to an online application system that set out clear eligibility standards The department has also tightened oversight of placards including tracking names and vehicle information for every placard in a database and printing permits on paper that cannot be illegally copiedThe previous mayor Michael R Bloomberg challenged the citys tradition of bestowing parking placards on city employees and in  his administration cut the number in half to  from  the year before Mr de Blasios aides said the number of placards had crept back up to  by the time he took office in Bruce Schaller a consultant who helped lead the Bloomberg efforts said any comprehensive effort to curb placard abuse would sputter unless placard numbers were reducedStill Mr Schaller said he believed the new measures were at least a start If theres real followthrough to what theyre announcing then people should be able to see improvement he said Will it completely solve the problem I can guarantee you no but New Yorkers are more realistic than thatThe new measures follow renewed efforts by the City Council to cut down on placard abuse Council members led by Speaker Corey Johnson have recently proposed bills that council aides said were similar to the mayors measures or would go even further such as requiring at least  targeted enforcement sweeps every week by the Police Department that would be monitored by the Department of Investigation The bills would also require enforcement officers to call for towing any vehicle blocking bike and bus lanes crosswalks or fire hydrantsThe council is thrilled the mayor has seen the light on placard abuse Mr Johnson said And we are very much looking forward to working with him to remove this scourge from our streets once and for allThis is not the first time Mr de Blasio has vowed to take on the chronic problem In  the mayor announced a citywide enforcement plan including creating a new antiplacardfraud police unit As a result city officials said the number of summonses for illegal parking has risen to  last year from  in  But placard abuses have continued with egregious examples often documented on social mediaPlacard abuse erodes faith in government and has no place in our city  its simply a question of fairness the mayor said in a statement Misused and fraudulent placards increase congestion and pose a public safety risk These initiatives give us the tools we need to start making a real dent in this pervasive issue to help build a fairer city for allRegina Myer president of the Downtown Brooklyn Partnership which manages three business improvement districts said she welcomed the new measures The neighborhood which is home to city agency offices and courthouses has been inundated with placardcarrying drivers who double park on streets and block traffic leave cars on sidewalks and take up metered spots meant for visitors and

shelter from the storm to an uneventful mornAnd yet the citys public schools  the nations largest system  were closed for a snow dayHow did that happenWhy did Mayor de Blasio call a snow dayTiming He had to make a decision Sunday evening when the forecast looked ominous The weather changed overnight but by that point it was too late to adjust the planThe call to close schools is made early with as much time as possible for parents to plan the mayors spokesman said Then there are all the school buses to think aboutAs my colleagues Eliza Shapiro and Michael Gold wrote buses leave depots before dawn and could interfere with the nearly  snow plows combing the streetsHow many snow days have there been in New York CitySeven since  compared with  from  to  according to The Citys Alyssa KatzWhat happened with recent storms On Nov  a sudden rushhour storm took local officials by surprise and thousands of commuters were delayed and stranded Some students were stuck on a bus for  hours Then on Jan  motorists were advised to stay off the road It turned out to be not so badDid everyone get the forecast wrong or did the weather changeTemperatures were just not as cold as predicted so it didnt allow for as much accumulation said John Murray a meteorologist at the National Weather Service It was a challenging forecast with uncertainty at play and a few inches can make a dramatic differenceWho else can tell you about the weatherPractically everyone gets their information from the National Weather Service Its website is detailed and maybe not ideal for people who just want to know if they need an umbrella or scarf For that there are some very good newsletters I can think of a fewIf you want a little more information there is an array of weather appsLiz Robbins a former

into two contexts it says in The Timess Manual of Style and Usage commonly called the stylebook A pun should be a surprise encounter evoking a sly smile rather than a groanAnd of course use it sparingly as a trace element rather than a stapleThats well said Fred Firestone told meMr Firestone is the host of Punderdome a competitive punmaking contestHow Punderdome works Contestants have about a minute to come up with as many puns about a broad topic as possible Then they read their puns to the audience whose reaction is calculated by a very official human clapometerWhoever emerges victorious squares off with a winner from a previous contestThe main rules no hate no hurt feelings and encouragement for allSo what does Mr Firestone think of the stylebooks entry on punsTo my surprise he not only liked it but said that was what he was attempting to emulateThe conventional wisdom is a pun is an eyeroll What we try to do is set up a situation where it is really a sidesplit he said We dont want people rolling their eyes Oh my gosh because I dont think wed get people coming backAnd come back they have Tonights show at  pm at Littlefield in Brooklyn is the th Punderdome to

EwingGeneva  After years of promising electric cars established carmakers are actually starting to build themBut manufacturers are realizing that a shift to battery power also requires them to retool their sales machinery The old comeons are obsolete Range is the new horsepower Connectivity replaces cylinder count And sustainability is the new status symbol Volvos Polestar  electric car unveiled last week even comes with a leatherfree vegan interiorThe need for carmakers to win over a public still hesitant about buying a car that needs half an hour or more to recharge is becoming more urgent as electric vehicles move closer to mass productionBatterypowered rides like the BMW i Nissan Leaf and Teslas lineup have been available for years But this onceniche category is now expanding at a breakneck paceThere are dozens of new electric cars on display at the Geneva International Motor Show which opened to the public on Thursday and continues through March  These are not concept cars that may never be for sale as tended to be the case at previous shows They are vehicles with familiar brand names that you will be able to buy this year or nextAn electric Porsche is coming at the end of this year Volkswagen is refitting a German factory to build a batterypowered car that beginning in  will sell for about the same price as a GolfAudi a unit of Volkswagen showed nothing but batterypowered vehicles and hybrids at the Geneva show Renault one of the first companies to offer electric cars is renewing its lineup Volvo skipped the show in order to leave the stage to its allelectric Polestar will be a decisive year for electromobility Herbert Diess the Volkswagen chief executive said at a company event in GenevaIts also a moment of truth for the traditional automakers which have long argued that their decades of experience in manufacturing will allow them to avoid the startup problems suffered by Tesla and to dominate the next wave of automotive technologyTeslas financial woes which have prompted it to shutter retail stores and lay off  percent of its work force may prove them right But it remains to be seen whether the entrenched carmakers can generate the same energized fan baseThe key to selling any product is differentiation making your car seem cooler and more capable than all the others Long ago it was V engines sixspeed automatic transmissions and the actor Ricardo Montalbn caressing the soft Corinthian leather seats of a Chrysler CordobaBut a lot of the features that set conventional cars apart like fast acceleration quiet interiors and smooth handling are pretty much standard with electric carsWhile gasoline engines need at least a few seconds to gather momentum batteries deliver instant pep Electric motors make very little noise And battery packs heavy and usually spread out beneath the passenger compartment provide a low center of gravity and help glue an electric car to the roadAutomakers also need to prevent their models from becoming commodities as the whole idea of car ownership is under attack by Uber Lyft and other rideshare companiesOne way Volvo and others are trying to answer the upstarts is by importing a bit of Silicon Valley vibe even if their engineers are in Sweden or Stuttgart Polestar which is positioning itself as a brand separate from Volvo staged the recent unveiling of the Polestar  as if it were a new iteration of the iPhoneThomas Ingenlath the chief executive of Polestar bounded onto a stage in Gothenburg Sweden wearing a mustardcolored zipup jacket over black slacks and a Tshirt and white sneakersPolestar is redefining premium for the electric age Mr Ingenlath said standing in front of a giant video screen His presentation broadcast online was heavy on the cars digital features including an inch touch screen and Google voice recognition software that allows drivers to summon driving directions or call up a tune from SpotifyA United States version of the Polestar  will go on sale early next year initially in California and Washington State for about  The Polestar  a performance hybrid has just begun rolling off a Chinese production line Dealerships will be small retail spaces in city downtowns and some may be popup storesWhen Mr Ingenlath got to the part about the Polestar s vegan interior he showed an image of cows looking content presumably because they were not fated to become car seats I will spare you now the video of mass production of leather Mr Ingenlath said somewhat darklyRicardo Montalbn who died in  may not have been a fan but the pitch underlined the carmakers assumption that electric car buyers will skew greenThe primary motivation of a customer who wants an electric vehicle is being friendly to the planet Olivier Murguet executive vice president for sales at French carmaker Renault said in an interview in GenevaBut he added electric vehicle customers pay close attention to the same things as other car buyers like the purchase priceElectric cars continue to cost thousands of dollars more than conventional vehicles High price remains an obstacle mostly because of the cost of the batteries That may be less of a problem than it seems Electric vehicles already on the road are holding on to their value well Mr Murguet said That allows carmakers to offer attractive leasing terms because they know the cars will command a good resale price when the lease expiresEuropean customers can lease a Renault Zoe a twodoor batterypowered subcompact for  euros a month or  Even if the price of the cars is higher the amount to finance from a customers perspective is not that much more Gilles Normand senior vice president for electric vehicles at Renault said in an interview in GenevaAnd many buyers of electric cars wont be individuals but carsharing services that buy them by the dozens and can spread the cost among more users Those buyers tend to pay attention to the cost of a car over its life span rather than just the initial purchase price Electric cars look better from that angle because they dont require oil changes and electricity is cheaper per mile than gasolineThe whole business case is changing for all of us Chris Delaney president of Europe for tire maker Goodyear said as he sat in a selfdriving electric shuttle van on display in Geneva Goodyear is supplying specialized tires for the vehicleWhile electric vehicles account for only about  percent of Goodyears current sales Mr Delaney said they account for  percent of new business from manufacturers  an indication of how fast demand is rising Electric cars pose a design challenge for tiremakers as well The cars high weight and fast acceleration require a more robust tireThe open question is whether any of the established carmakers who still make most of their money from conventional vehicles can generate buzz as effectively as Elon Musk Teslas chief executive Despite all of Teslas problems Mr Musk commands widespread respect in the industry for transforming the image of electric cars from nerdy science projects to desirable performance vehiclesSo far no other car manager has demonstrated Mr Musks ability to make Tesla the center of the conversation though not always in a good wayTesla did a lot to build up the market for electric cars Detlev von Platen head of sales and marketing at Porsche said We have a lot of respect for what they accomplished Theyre a reference for usAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byCalifornia TodayAn illustration from Biddy Mason Speaks UpBy Jill CowanGood morningHeres the signup if you dont already get California Today by emailWhen you think of the people who built Los Angeles the names that most likely jump to mind  William Mulholland the Chandlers  are often those of white men Its not surprising and its not unusual among American citiesThats why when I heard Laura Atkins a Berkeleybased childrens book author mention Bridge Mason known as Biddy on an episode of the podcast East Bay Yesterday I took noteMs Mason she said had been born enslaved won her freedom in a California court in the mids and eventually became a prominent downtown LA landowner  not to mention the growing metropoliss richest womanShe organized the citys First AME church and was a philanthropistIts Black History Month so Ive been thinking about what it means to honor the legacies of people whom history has traditionally left outMs Atkins and Arisa White a poet have written a book about Ms Masons life Biddy Mason Speaks Up part of a series about civil rights leaders So I asked them how they decided to write about her and about different ways of thinking about historical figuresA lot of what we thought about was the idea of the kind of linear heroic narrative where theres one singular person who saves the day versus more of a feminist recovery project Ms White said We have to amass Biddy Masons story by pulling through different threadsThe book which is illustrated by Laura Freeman alternates between a story told from Ms Masons perspective and pages that are filled with definitions of words like power race and westward expansion as well as timelines and discussion questions for readers about how those themes play out in their own livesOn one page the authors ask Have you ever been taken away from someone you loveOn another What does freedom mean to youMs White said she was also excited to highlight a different way of building wealth Ms Mason worked as a midwife and a healer who used herbal remedies her enslaved grandmother had taught herAmong her clients were some of LAs richest residents including Pio Pico the last governor of Mexican CaliforniaIts bringing to life a different kind of intelligence that I dont think young readers access when they think about enslaved people she saidMs Atkins said she knew that the idea of reframing history through a feminist collectivist lens might sound a little too well Berkeley for a lot of educatorsBut she said she had been heartened by the responseWeve gotten some real love from people out in the world and appreciation for the way it empowers students to engage she saidA note We often link to content on sites that limit

they keep reporting for work in the midst of what is now the longest federal shutdown in United States historyWhich raises the question Why do they keep showing up Lawmakers are beginning to float the idea that perhaps they shouldnt and that some sort of coordinated absence by federal workers might be the quickest way to persuade President Trump and congressional Democrats to find a deal to end the shutdownCouple senior Republican lawmakers tell me the only way this breaks open is if TSA employees stay home and Americans get furious about their flights Thats the only out they say And theyre close to the WHWorkers understand the power they have a walkout of Transportation Security Administration employees would effectively cripple air travel in the United States for example But they do not appear close to wielding that leverage On Wednesday TSA reported its national rate of unscheduled absences was  percent up from  percent a year ago but not high enough to significantly worsen wait times in most major airports Here are the reasons more federal workers are still showing up for work despite not getting paid The National Labor Relations Act extends a right to strike to American workers  but it specifically does not give that right to government workers A law passed during President Jimmy Carters administration bars federal workers from striking When air traffic controllers walked off the job in  demanding better pay and working conditions President Ronald Reagan ordered them to return to work When they did not he fired them For an employee deemed excepted from furlough during a shutdown  which is to say forced to work without pay  walking off the job could carry a similar penalty Guidance from the federal Office of Personnel Management prohibits excepted employees from taking any sort of leave including vacation or sick days during a shutdown If an excepted employee refuses to report for work after being ordered to do so the guidance says he or she will be considered to be absent without leave AWOL and will be subject to any consequences that may follow from being AWOLUnion leaders and federal workers frequently stress that furloughed employees want to be allowed to return to their jobs  and that employees working without pay are doing so largely because they care about their work be it protecting public lands inspecting food for safety or catching drug smugglers at the borderIt sounds corny I know said Jacqueline Simon the director of public policy for the American Federation of Government Employees the largest federal workers union But federal employees are extremely devoted to the mission of their agencies she said They dont just fall into these jobs They believe in public service they believe in what they do Theyre not just going to walk away There may come a point when some of them have to to feed their families but no one wants to do thatThe National Air Traffic Controllers Association has seen no unusual increase in controllers missing work the unions executive vice president Trish Gilbert said on Friday Asked if the controllers association would consider organizing a strike a walkout or another job action if the shutdown continued in the long run Ms Gilbert said the union would not condone or endorse any kind of activity like thatWe have taken an oath she said We know were important to the United States economy and we are going to work Were just not getting paid So even if this drags on people will come to workAt least five lawsuits have been filed against the federal government by groups including the American Federation of Government Employees the National Treasury Employees Union and the air traffic controllers associationA United States District Court judge ruled on Tuesday against issuing any temporary restraining order that would allow workers to stop coming to work or order them to be paid But those cases will continue to work their way through the judiciary with another court date set at the end of the monthThe average federal worker has lost about  since the shutdown took hold in late December On Wednesday the president was expected to sign a bill promising that those workers would receive retroactive payLoyalty does not make workers immune to economic reality they still need to make mortgage and car payments In the highcost Washington area Ms Simon said a TSA employees salary starts at  a year which doesnt give you any cushion for absorbing any interruption in your pay Reporting the agencys elevated rate of unscheduled leave on Wednesday TSA officials said that many employees are reporting that they are not able to report to work due to financial limitations Furloughed employees can work other jobs to make ends meet A staff member with the White House Council of Economic Advisers has begun driving for Uber to pay the bills the councils director said this week But moonlighting is a lot harder for excepted employees who still must show up at their regular job every dayWith a strong labor market and an unemployment rate hovering around  percent many of those employees might eventually quit to take a job that brings an immediate paycheck An analysis from the online jobs site Indeed suggests that might already be brewing It looked at job search behavior from midDecember through midJanuary for workers at some affected federal agencies including the IRS and the TSA Indeed researchers found that clicks on job listings rose at least  percent for each of those worker groups over that period a sign that employees affected by the shutdown are searching for jobs more right now than they usually do at this time of year said Martha Gimbel Indeeds director of economic researchMs Simon said that some workers might eventually be forced to take other jobs if the shutdown stretches on For now she said there is no talk about a coordinated sickout or other walkout from work Federal employees she said are sharing their heartache with one another  and their indignationThey dont like being treated as hostages she said Katie Rogers contributed reportingJim Tankersley covers economic and tax policy Over more than a decade covering politics and economics in

hours until the start of the biggest event of Dmitriy Salitas career as a boxing promoter the homestretch when he needed to make sure all of the kinks were ironed out contracts tickets paychecksBut he turned his cellphone off watching the time carefullyIn a thfloor hotel room with floortoceiling windows overlooking the brightly lit Ferris wheel on Atlantic Citys boardwalk he bowed his head and flipped through a thick pocketsize book whispering to himself and pacing back and forth in prayerHe then sat in a chair with a plate of food and settled in for the next  hours when he essentially would be walled off from any involvement in a production that could vault  or set back  his budding promotional careerSalita a yearold former welterweight is the rare Orthodox Jew in bigtime boxing and as such he observes the SabbathFrom sundown Friday to sundown Saturday he adheres to the faiths prohibitions on phones television or internet and perhaps most difficult for his line of work handling moneyFor Salita it has long presented a challenge in an occupation in which some of the most important work happens at the very time his faith demands he cloister himselfWhen he was a boxer it had limited his ability to fight in the summer when the sun sets late As a promoter he has had to miss some of his fighters matches and use creative scheduling to make paymentsThis past weekend it meant trusting that his small team would take care of any lastminute problems and that he would arrive late to an event headlined by his top fighter Claressa Shields taking on Christina Hammer for the undisputed middleweight world titleYoure down for the count champ Kelly Swanson one of Salitas publicists told him as Salita chuckled and prepared to eat Shabbat dinner Friday nightSalita was  when his family moved to Brooklyn from Odessa in what is now Ukraine When his mother was hospitalized with breast cancer a few years later he was introduced to the rabbi at Chabad of Flatbush a synagogue belonging to a branch of Hasidic Judaism Salita began exploring his faith more deeply inspired in part by the fact that he was in a country with religious freedom he saidBut he also received encouragement from an unlikely source Jimmy OPharrow his boxing trainer at the Starrett City Boxing Club in Brooklyn Salita had started going to OPharrows gym at  and was the rare white fighter there OPharrow who died in  had said about Salita Kid looks Russian prays Jewish and fights blackJimmy always encouraged my individuality to learn about myself my culture Salita said It gave me confidence to do what I needed to do socially and spirituallyBy the time he turned professional in  Salita was observing the SabbathHe could not fight on Friday nights a showcase for upandcoming fighters Those who followed his career said his religion had little to do with his never winning a world title during this year career Although he had a  record his only shot at a world championship against Amir Khan in  ended by technical knockout  minute  seconds into the first roundThe truth is that his skill level didnt match up with a class profession said Bob Arum Salitas first promoterSalita started promoting as a way to resurrect his career After losing to Khan he promoted the next card on which he fought He got the Jewish Channel to broadcast the fight He did that for two more of his fights and got into the promotional business full time after his last fight in Oscar De La Hoya and Floyd Mayweather Jr are among the marquee faces of a trend of boxers becoming promoters But Salita has a much tougher road because his fighting career was not nearly as heralded as theirs and he does not have the flair and drama of big names like Arum and Don KingBut what Salita lacks in star power people say he makes up for with his earnest style and strategy He is personable and talks so softly sometimes that people have to lean in to hear himWhen he came to Shields a twotime Olympic gold medalist he brought a newspaper article he had read about her and a vision for her careerWhen I had a conversation with him about me becoming world champion within seven fights fighting on Showtime me becoming a millionaire he said Everything you are saying is obtainable but I see more for you Shields saidSalita began promoting Shields in her second professional fight By her fourth fight she won her first world title On Saturday she faced Hammer who was undefeated in a unification fight on Showtime It was the first time that women had headlined a Saturday night card televised on ShowtimeAnd so it was that Salita sat nervously in his dark hotel room at  pm on Saturday anxious as the minutes ticked The undercard fights started at  pm but the Sabbath did not end until When the clock in the room hit  pm  he likes to have a minute buffer  Salita was up and in the bathroom putting on his suit He took out his prayer book flipped through the pages whispering a prayer He kissed it and at  pm was out the door his eyes trained on his cellphone as he texted nonstopHe quickly got a call Someone could not find the tickets that were supposed to have been left for them at the arenaOK Im on my way over there he saidHe stopped in a friends room they chanted a final Sabbath prayer and Salita poured himself a shot of CognacYeah hes nervous the friend Vadim Tovshteyn said In an Uber and Salita got another call Six minutes away one mile he told the person on the other end Another call Two minutes away he said Yeah Im walking in Salita said over the phoneIn the arena it was greetings all around for Salita who wears a black skullcap with his gray suit He checked on Shields in her dressing room where gospel music blasted as she got her hands wrapped and then he took his seat ringsideThe upstart nature of Salita Promotions with a core staff of about four was clear The fight was in a seat auditorium It was nearly full The crowd was spirited but nowhere near the size of most major championship fights Still it was a long way from the club shows he promoted early on where he lost money and could not get a major broadcaster to pay attention And the result he said was significant not just for boxing but for societyShields dominated the fight to move to  and hand Hammer whom Salita also promotes her first defeat in  bouts Everyone was highfiving and hugging Salita who believes Shields could become a bona fide starEddie Hearn of Britishbased Matchroom Boxing promotions said the ShieldsHammer bout could have benefited from a major promoter according to BoxingScenecom But with the biggest female star in Shields some said that Salita could corner a market that many bigname promoters have ignoredIf youre an established female fighter I want Dmitriy to be my promoter said Steve Farhood a Showtime boxing analystSalita is now looking forward to what will undoubtedly be his most lucrative bout as a promoter Jarrell Miller a heavyweight who was the first fighter Salita signed faces Anthony Joshua the world champion from England making his United States debut at Madison Square Garden on June  Miller is a big underdog but an upset would be like a golden ticket for Salitas promotional careerHe has a good flair for promoting he is something special Arum saidAfter the news conference on Saturday night Salita reflected on a Jewish belief that God created everything with a purpose and as a human you do your best to make it reach its potentialAs a promoter he said my responsibility is to make sure every fighter does the best they can with what theyve gotAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byThe ShiftBy Kevin RooseThe gig economys work force is fighting back and in some cases its winningOn Wednesday Instacart the Silicon Valley upstart that delivers groceries and other household items to customers through an app reversed a tipping policy that had outraged workers who accused the  billion company of cheating them out of rightfully earned wagesWe heard loud and clear the frustration when your compensation didnt match the effort you put forth Apoorva Mehta Instacarts chief executive wrote in an open letter to Instacarts contract workers known as shoppersInstacarts workers had taken to Reddit forums and private Facebook groups to express their anger with the policy which counted tips toward the guaranteed minimum payments the company offered to shoppers In some cases the more customers tipped the less Instacart paid themIts offensive its unethical and in this climate its a very dumb thing to do Matthew Telles an Instacart courier in Chicago said this week before the reversalIn the letter to shoppers Mr Mehta apologized for the tipping policy which he called misguided He said that from now on Instacart would calculate tips separately from base pay He also said the company was putting new minimum payments into effect at least  for orders that require only delivering an item and  to  for orders that involve picking items off supermarket shelvesIn addition Instacart said it would retroactively compensate workers who had lost base pay as a result of the old tipping systemThe victory at Instacart which will ultimately affect thousands of workers is just the latest in a string of successful pressure campaigns by workers for gig economy platforms Drivers for Uber and Lyft in New York successfully agitated for a citywide minimum wage that went into effect this week Postmates another highflying startup recently settled a classaction suit with thousands of delivery workers who contested the way the company classified them as contract workersSubscribe to With Interest Its a Sunday newsletter with essential business insights thatll prep you for the week aheadIts no secret that many modern gig workers exist in a state of permanent precarity with few legal protections unstable working conditions and pay that varies based on whos flush with venture capital money that week Most gig economy workers are still classified as contract workers meaning that they arent covered by federal minimum wage laws and other labor protectionsStill by organizing en masse and expressing vocal opposition to exploitative policies they have managed to wring some concessions out of the billiondollar corporations whose labor they provideFor Instacart the drama began late last year when it changed its method for paying its contract workersUntil then Instacarts shopper pay was determined by an algorithm that factored in a fixed base payment for each order along with a peritem bonus and extra payments for certain tasks such as delivering over long distances After the change late last year Instacart presented shoppers with a single itemized earnings estimate and guaranteed them a  minimum payment for each batch they acceptedBut Instacart shoppers began to notice that for some orders the tips that customers had added during checkout were being counted toward their  minimum rather than being paid out on top of themAngry shoppers collected shocking examples of low pay like a receipt submitted by an Instacart shopper who appeared to have been paid a total of  after a  tip Instacart claimed that the payment was an edge case and that it was putting new policies in place to prevent similar incidentsIn another example two identical Instacart batches paid out   the guaranteed minimum  even though one delivery earned a  tip and the other a  tip In the case of the  tip Instacarts batch payment came to  in the case of the  tip Instacart paid only We started to notice customers who said they tipped but a lot of times we wouldnt see the tips said Kaylania Chapman a worker in Orlando Fla who delivers orders for both Instacart and DoorDash a rival delivery app with a similar tipping policyThe workers complaints started to be picked up by news outlets including Fast Company and NBC And they caught the attention of Working Washington a unionbacked labor group in Seattle which collected more than  signatures of Instacart shoppers who objected to the companys pay practices Some began asking for cash tips outside the app while others encouraged customers to leave cent tips  a nominal amount meant to show solidarity with workers  through the app and then adjust the tips higher after a delivery was madeOn Wednesday after the announcement that Instacart was changing its policies a representative from Working Washington Sage Wilson said In the space of two weeks Instacart workers came together sparked a national media sensation and transformed the entire pay model of a  billion corporationDoorDash which is valued by investors at  billion has not announced plans to change its tipping policy which dates to DoorDashs pay model provides transparency consistency and predictability a company spokeswoman said on Tuesday Since implementing this pay model more than a year ago weve seen a significant increase in dasher retention percentage of ontime orders and dasher satisfactionAfter Instacarts announcement on Wednesday the DoorDash spokeswoman declined to commentMany Instacart shoppers were thrilled by the companys aboutface In a private Facebook group some celebrated their successful campaign to get the company to change its tipping policy and make them whole on previous paymentsI cant believe it Back pay one shopper wroteTHIS is why you stand up for yourself against corruption wrote anotherIm very excited that we got Instacart to listen to our complaints said Ashley Knudson an Instacart shopper in Seattle I feel like we have some work to do and were not going to back down until we get the consistency that we need in our batch payments We consider this a small victory for acknowledging their mistreatment but we look forward to pushing onward and having our voices be heardMany gig economy workers still face economic insecurity and exploitative platform policies of course and lawmakers may ultimately need to come to their rescue On Tuesday Representative Ro Khanna a Democrat who represents parts of Silicon Valley told BuzzFeed News that Instacarts nowdefunct tipping policy was a deceptive business practice that should endBut ultimately it may be up to customers to demand more accountability and workerfriendly policiesElizabeth Haslam a DoorDash customer in California who has spent more than three years placing orders from the delivery service said on Tuesday that she was shocked to learn about the companys tipping policiesIt made me really angry that I was contributing to a company that would do that she said And it makes me wonder how many other services are doing the same thingKevin Roose is a columnist for Business and a writeratlarge for The New York Times Magazine His column The Shift examines the intersection of

keeping bad from getting worseLast week crowds gathered in Brooklyn Heights to stick a collective finger in yet another crumbling dike the BrooklynQueens Expressway Notoriously choked with traffic a clattery belching potholed sluice of despair built for  vehicles now used by  cars and trucks a day the longneglected midcentury highway is collapsing Experts give it until   in infrastructure terms the day after tomorrow  when big trucks may no longer be able to use itServing working stiffs from Staten Island truck drivers from New Jersey slicing smack through tony litigious brownstone Brooklyn it is a modern American parable Having bent the continent to our will devising bridges and dams railroads and highways the United States in the early st century has fallen conspicuously behind other countries paralyzed by our inability to fix failing infrastructureWe treat collapsing sewers and tunnels like trips to the dentist procrastinating until disaster strikes and then we have to spend a fortune on recovery Faced with staggering costs we squabble along partisan lines pitting drivers against subway riders suburbanites against citydwellers red versus blue  blocking change in the name of prudence missing one after another opportunity for progressSummoned last week by community groups the Brooklyn Heights Association and A Better Way the crowd in Brooklyn Heights assembled for a town hall at lovely old Plymouth Church to help quash two nasty plans  one painful the other even more so  that the citys Department of Transportation had put forth a few months backThe plans offered alternatives for repairing the despised roadway a crucial mileandahalf of which morphs into a sixlane triplecantilever affair clinging to the hillside beneath the Heights  a kind of bunkbed arrangement conceived during the s by the prolific landscape architects Michael Rapuano and Gilmore ClarkeThe cantilever system was a victory for People Power over the Establishment It diverted the highway from running straight through the middle of Brooklyn Heights as Robert Moses the citys allpowerful planning czar back then had wanted but community groups protested The top bunk became the Brooklyn Heights Promenade one of the loveliest spots in the whole citySaving it is now inextricably linked to the destiny of the BQE Ideally New York should leave the Promenade alone and probably just give up on this stretch of the expressway the way other cities have torn down highways to create parks and flourishing neighborhoods  the way the Bloomberg administration removed traffic from Broadway where it passes through Times SquareDrivers adapt Its one of the counterintuitive laws of automotive behavior We forget that carcentered urbanism didnt always have such a stranglehold on New York City As late as the early s overnight street parking was illegal Unfortunately politicians and traffic engineers fixate on accommodating the number of drivers we haveAnd there seem to be more of them than ever what with the subways decline and hordes of Uber cars and Amazon delivery trucksThe solution congestion pricing may soon impose tolls to help fix the subways and reduce the number of cars and trucks on roads like the BQE A study released the other day by the Regional Plan Association  commissioned by A Better Way  suggested that congestion pricing could reduce traffic on the BQE into Manhattan by  percent enough to allow the road to shrink down to four lanes Thats assuming politicians catering to countless constituencies dont exempt so many routes that congestion pricing becomes toothlessSome years ago a BQE proposal surfaced that imagined digging a tunnel beneath Downtown Brooklyn to create a shortcut for the highway where it connected with the Brooklyn Bridge reducing travel times and removing the entire cantilevered stretch past the Heights It accommodated four lanes and looked attractive on paper City officials say it will be as cataclysmic and complicated as Bostons Big DigWhich is one explanation for the Department of Transportations  billion plans Choice A involved a decade or two of lane closings total Carmageddon Choice B turned the Promenade into a sixlane highway for nearly as longAs it happened both plans were already pretty much shelved before the town hall meeting started Mayor Bill de Blasio reversing himself after several months announced a panel of experts would consider alternative proposalsThere are a bunch of proposals out there now One by a Brooklyn planner named Marc Wouters envisions erecting a second elevated highway a temporary parallel bypass next to the cantilevered stretch of the BQECity Comptroller Scott M Stringer has floated a plan of his own to close the BQE except to trucks making one level of the elevated roadway a linear park His likely opponent in the next mayoral race City Council Speaker Corey Johnson allying himself with many transportation advocates wants to replace the cantilevered section of highway with a more modest boulevard and spend the money that would have been used on its repair to improve public transitBoth politicians took to the Plymouth Church podium the other evening The crowd cheered But the scheme that provoked the most oohs and aahs came from the architecture firm Bjarke Ingels Group or BIG which has an office in Dumbo Cunningly labeled the BQP for BrooklynQueens Park BIGs plan has been quietly circulating among community leaders and transportation officials for a few weeks It surfaced online and in The Daily News the day of the town hallThe plan moves the elevated BQE down to littleused Furman Street which runs below the highway where it skirts Brooklyn Bridge Park Furman would be widened by cutting into the berm now shielding the park from the highway The berm rebuilt would then slide back over the new road burying it  at grade  while making room above for the socalled BQX streetcar if that were ever to happen and also acres of new parklandIn essence the elevated expressway would yield to a vast new wash of greenery extending Brooklyn Bridge Park all the way up to the PromenadeThe benefits in terms of noise air quality and open space are abundant BIG says the disused cantilevers could be turned into more parkland or parking lots revenuegenerating shops or apartments whatever Brooklynites wantedLike the Clarke and Rapuano scheme but for the st century the BQP reframes an infrastructural headache as a civic opportunity Back in  the New York State Department of Transportation under Gov Andrew Cuomo clearly daunted by the challenge simply fobbed off on the city the failing BQE  which as an interstate was the states responsibility The state can do that It does this sort of thing all the timeMayor de Blasio then passed along the problem to Polly Trottenberg the citys transportation commissioner who has described fixing the elevated highway as the most challenging project not only in New York City but arguably in the United StatesTo her credit she has now heard the outcry She is open to other plans BIGs includedThere are many obstacles to the BQP and they are formidable There is an immense sewer line that runs directly below Furman serving much of BrooklynThere are venting plants and substations for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority that are in the wayOne part of the plan imagines moving a lobby to the third floor of an occupied apartment building because the covered highway would abut the current entrance Joralemon Street would become a dead end without any obvious place for cars to turn aroundThe list goes onBrooklyn Bridge Park costs some  per acre per annum to maintain It raises operating funds through private development Brooklynites have spent years in court contesting even the smallest private incursions into the park Unless the new parkland were financed differently the added acreage via the BQP would require the construction of something along the lines of a brandnew  square foot condo or commercial developmentMoses soured New Yorkers on big change Resistance is the default mode Whether the challenge is public housing Hudson Yards Penn Station or the BQE City Hall today doesnt seem to grasp the concept of urban designThe BQP sets a bar at least which is worth pursuing The mayor should do more than trust a panel of outside experts to judge what comes over the transom and offer quick solutions The project needs state and federal buyin It requires a proper interagency master planning process one steeped in community consultation This takes time And it cant be left up to traffic engineersThe crowd at Plymouth Church that arrived to man the barricades departed with the promise of something betterNew Yorkers deserve as muchAdvertisementAdvertisement

On June   Google made a pledge to its small but growing number of customers in a blunt word statement Google is sensitive to the privacy concerns of its users The internet allows individuals to explore and communicate with unprecedented ease but it also allows websites to collect and distribute personal information with equal ease We at Google know that many users are understandably concerned about such practicesThe statement which today reads like a quaint artifact of a simpler time would become the companys first privacy policy  a gently lawyered explanation of how the company collects and distributes its users data and information Googles was far from the first privacy statement from a big technology business but its one of the first examples of the form from a company

like to protect your privacy  even as many companies began to collect and display information invasivelyTechnology companies have also tried to explain all the ways they protect your privacy  but the rhetoric was different from reality where a number of companies experienced hacks and data breachesSince the early s companies have argued that despite all the data they collect you still own it  and yet default designs and settings and lax security have long left information vulnerableFinally since the advent of concerns about Google and Facebooks use of personal data for advertising  companies have pointed out that they dont sell your data  and nonetheless many of the companies business models are predicated on a targeted advertising model that relies on the continued collection of increasingly personal informationIts been almost  years since Googles first privacy statement The internet today is a significantly different place one thats largely powered by the transmission and

paychecks even in gogo industries like technology suggesting the economic pain is broader than official figures showBy Alexandra Stevenson and Cao LiThe job fair in the Chinese boomtown of Shenzhen offered a whitecollar future for a country that rose to economic greatness on the strength of its assembly lines bulldozers and cranes Technology financial and real estate companies pitched jobs in sales engineering accounting and logistics A ayear salary said one poster isnt just a dream But for many job seekers it still seemed like one At one end of the event hall two dozen candidates sat dejectedly under a banner that read Hope you find a good job soonJob hunting said Hou Hao a yearold accountant who could not find a position that matched her previous permonth salary now feels like being constantly slapped in the face Chinas slowdown which has idled factories and construction sites is rippling through its offices Educated whitecollar workers are being hit with job cuts and shrinking paychecks Even big technology companies like JDcom the online retailer and Didi Chuxing Chinas answer to Uber and one of the worlds most valuable startups have not been spared The whitecollar job distress suggests the slowdown in Chinas economy the worlds second largest is broader than official numbers indicate China increasingly relies on middleclass spenders who are helping to broaden the economy beyond its industrial base But these consumers are not spending the way they used to and that lethargy is ricocheting through every part of the economy from the real estate market to Chinas oncethriving tech sector The slowdown also suggests the government will have a harder time pulling the economy out of its slump Chinas policy tools to kickstart growth  unleashing waves of loans from the statecontrolled banking system or building new highways and airports  will not be much help for workers who process insurance claims or enter data into computer systems Supporting those businesses and workers would require longerterm reforms like getting state banks to lend more to private businesses or cutting red tape for entrepreneurs In the past by virtue of building a bridge you could get the economy growing said Fraser Howie cowriter of three books on the Chinese financial system Now he added there is no obvious catch up and therefore it makes it all the more important that China makes important difficult decisions to move forwardChinese leaders have acknowledged that creating jobs could be a challenge During his annual news conference on Friday Li Keqiang Chinas premier said that Beijing would make employment for college graduates and laidoff workers a priority this yearChina does not disclose reliable jobs or layoff data so the full impact of the slowdown is not clear Some surveys show there is still high demand for jobs in certain sectors But multiple signs point to trouble for other office workers One measure based on a survey of services businesses suggests shrinking employment in a variety of industries Search results from Baidu Chinas biggest search engine analyzed by Nomura the Japanese bank show the term job seeking rose to a high in December Human resources executives and senior staff at tech firms property developers and other large private companies described layoffs in recent months of up to  percent at some firms involving hundreds of workers according to a recent survey by the research firm Global Source PartnersOn one major job recruitment website Zhilian the number of openings across all sectors posted in the fourth quarter fell  percent from the same period in  New positions at technology firms and internet startups fell  percent in the third quarter of  from a year earlierChinas office workers have suffered during past slowdowns but cuts now have a broader impact as the countrys economy matures and they become a bigger part of the work forceFor workers like Sherry Xu the weakened job market undermines the basic premise that a college education leads to a more secure future than a factory job Ms Xu a yearold finance professional attended a prestigious university and then rose through the ranks of the finance industry Recently Ms Xu was called into a meeting with human resources right after she finished pitching to a group of potential investors Her employer a financial firm was having a difficult time she was told Layoffs would start soon She would be among themThe job market isnt looking good said Ms Xu who after the meeting accepted a freelance contract with the same firm at half her earlier pay I feel this time it will be harder than ever for me to find a jobJust a week after Lunar New Year celebrations in China in February Didi Chuxing the countrys largest ridesharing and taxihailing service notified employees that it would cut  jobs  roughly  percent of its work force according to a person with direct knowledge of the plan who was not authorized to speak publicly The cuts would target jobs that are outside the companys core focus of safety technology engineering and international operations employees were told Chinese news media reports also said Didi was cutting back perks like free snacks and beverages In a statement Didi said it would adjust benefits but would not make major cuts without providing specifics Didi said its benefits were as varied as health care services meal and transportation subsidies and corporate gym access JDcom the ecommerce company has started to evaluate employees with the goal of shedding  percent of its top executives it told staff in February Asked about the cuts JDcom said it planned to hire  new employees in  JD highly values its work force Tracy Yang a spokeswoman said in a statement Layoffs like other economic events have become politically sensitive and companies are reluctant to confirm the winnowing of staff In response to reports that the ecommerce giant Alibaba was planning to freeze recruitment the company

the attackAuthorities said they were looking into the possibility the shooting was an act of terror with the counterterrorism agency raising its threat assessment to the highest level They had also ordered the evacuation of all mosques in the city but its unclear if that move stems from a specific threat or as a precaution in the wake of the attack in New Zealand But they didnt rule out other

everythingBeethoven hardly lacks for exposure but to mark the th anniversary of his birth in  Carnegie Hall announced on Wednesday that it would go all in and devote roughly a fifth of its  season to his musicAll his piano sonatas All his string quartets Lots of his chamber music And not one but two cycles of all nine symphonies one performed on period instruments with John Eliot Gardiner conducting the Orchestre Rvolutionnaire et Romantique and another on modern instruments with Yannick NzetSguin and the Philadelphia OrchestraWe all feel this is really the pivotal figure in the history of Western classical music Clive Gillinson Carnegies executive and artistic director said in an interview Everything he touched he changed and transformedMr NzetSguin who became music director of the Metropolitan Opera this season will be the subject of a Perspectives series that will give New Yorkers a chance to hear him conduct all three of his ensembles the Philadelphians the Met Orchestra and the Orchestre Mtropolitain of Montreal The mezzosoprano Joyce DiDonato the singersongwriter Anglique Kidjo and Mr Gardiner will also have Perspectives series and Jrg Widmann will hold the Richard and Barbara Debs Composers ChairTheres a lot to chew on in the season which will open Oct  with Franz WelserMst conducting the Cleveland Orchestra and will end June  with Daniel Barenboim and the Vienna Philharmonic So here is a tip sheet with critics and writers for The New York Times highlighting some of the concerts that intrigue them next seasonMUNICH PHILHARMONIC OCT  AND BAVARIAN RADIO SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA NOV ORCHESTRE MTROPOLITAIN NOV  AND ORCHESTRE SYMPHONIQUE DE MONTRAL MARCH  The season brings a couple of battleofthebands moments Most halls would be happy to import a single orchestra from Munich or Montreal but Carnegie is bringing a pair from each city So New York audiences will be able to contrast performances of Valery Gergiev conducting the Munich Philharmonic with those of Mariss Jansons leading its neighboring Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra And they will be able to compare the Orchestre Symphonique de Montral under the baton of Kent Nagano with that citys lesserknown ensemble the Orchestre Mtropolitain MICHAEL COOPERAMERICAN COMPOSERS ORCHESTRA NOV  This ensembles reliably excellent taste results in a program that features new orchestrations of Ives songs by Hilary Purrington and Hannah Lash as well as the premiere of a guitar concerto by Ms Purrington Her recent A Clarion Call is packed with haunted harmonies and riotous humor that Ives might well have admired SETH COLTER WALLSIRISH CHAMBER ORCHESTRA NOV  Unique synergies often develop when an orchestra is led by a composerperformer In his collaboration with the Irish Chamber Orchestra Jrg Widmann as conductor and solo clarinetist serves up a meticulously balanced program with compositions that showcase his debt to Bach Versuch ber die Fuge and rock  beats per minute alongside works by Mendelssohn Weber and Mozarts own Bachflavored Adagio and Fugue in C minor CORINNA da FONSECAWOLLHEIMCONRAD TAO NOV KIRILL GERSTEIN FEB IGOR LEVIT MAY  A great way to refresh repertory staples is to perform them alongside new and recent works The brilliant young pianist and composer Conrad Tao offers a particularly bold example of this approach in his solo recital at Weill Recital Hall which fascinatingly juxtaposes the old Bach Rachmaninoff Schumann and the new David Lang Julia Wolfe Jason Eckardt At Zankel Hall the formidable Kirill Gerstein will play unusual works by Liszt Brahms and Gyorgy Kurtag steeped in Hungarian dances and folk song as well as pieces by Haydn Busoni Bartok the flinty seldomheard Piano Sonata Thomas Ads and to end Schuberts exuberant Wanderer Fantasy Igor Levit will join Carnegies Beethoven salute in Stern Auditorium with Sonatas No   and  and the stillastounding Hammerklavier ANTHONY TOMMASINISO PERCUSSION DEC  The program for this virtuosic and often mindopening quartet A Century of Percussion is something of a greatest hits concert They will revisit pieces like David Langs the socalled laws of nature Steve Reichs Music for Pieces of Wood and John Cages Third Construction But the evening will also include the local premiere of a new work by Julia Wolfe JOSHUA BARONEORCHESTRE RVOLUTIONNAIRE ET ROMANTIQUE FEB  There is hardly a shortage of recordings of Beethovens symphonies but the one I inevitably turn to is John Eliot Gardiners vigorous colorful altogether vital cycle with this periodinstrument ensemble After a pair of crack Berlioz performances at Carnegie this past fall this team is surely ready to put the old Ludwig van through his paces ZACHARY WOOLFETHE CROSSING MARCH  Such is their radiant sound and the vibrancy of the repertory theyve cultivated its gotten to the point Id hear anything this Philadelphia vocal ensemble sings At Carnegie theyll join the cellist Maya Beiser whose charismatic crossgenre experiments have seductive savvy in the New York premiere of Michael Gordons Travel Guide to Nicaragua ZACHARY WOOLFEBOSTON SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA APRIL  After presenting Act II of Wagners Tristan und Isolde at Carnegie last spring the Bostonians will be back under the baton of Andris Nelsons for Act III These two concerts are a test drive for the tenor Jonas Kaufmann who has been gradually rolling out his Tristan Other cast members include Emily Magee as Isolde and Gnther Groissbck as King Marke JOSHUA BARONEQUATUOR BNE APRIL MAY  Even outside of anniversary years cycles of the Beethoven string quartets mushroom all over the concert landscape But this French ensemble known for its passionate and rigorous playing is sure to bring something special to its sixconcert survey in the spring Do stick around for the encores which these players use to shoot off in unexpected directions with improvised takes on folk music jazz or the Beatles CORINNA da FONSECAWOLLHEIMTIMO ANDRES APRIL  Aaron Coplands midthcentury Piano Sonata is the oldest work youll find in this solo recital which features a wide range of pieces by contemporary composers like John Adams Donnacha Dennehy and Frederic Rzewski  and of course Mr Andres himself Later in the evening is a premiere from the young composer Gabriella Smith JOSHUA BARONEMAURIZIO POLLINI MAY  Theres enough Beethoven this season to last a lifetime but its a lifetime of Beethoven that Mr Pollini  years young will bring to this performance of the final three piano sonatas Theres no artist Id rather hear play this music DAVID ALLENVIENNA PHILHARMONIC JUNE  Poor Mahler with just six performances of his symphonies next season at Carnegie I wouldnt want to miss Michael Tilson Thomas conducting the Sixth in his farewell performance at the hall before stepping down as music director of the San Francisco Symphony March  but Daniel Barenboim has a peculiar productive way with these scores that makes these concerts more promising than the norm He leads the Fifth Seventh and Ninth DAVID ALLENAn earlier version of this article misstated who will sing the role of Isolde in the Boston Symphony Orchestras concert of Act III from Tristan und

about the scandalBut today we wanted to dig into the Los Angeles contemporary art scene Jason Farago a critic for The New York Times recently made his way west for a piece exploring LAs place in a global art ecosystem He wrote about how he approached an expansive landscape Its almost a rite of passage for a New York Times art critic to be sent to Los Angeles to take the temperature of the citys museums and galleries and to pronounce whether the secondlargest city in America has caught up to our hometown As long ago as  one of my predecessors wrote that spectacular myths hover with the smog over Los Angeles obscuring the considerable progress this city has made in terms of the arts during the last few yearsSo when my editor and I sat down to plan my recent story on contemporary art in Los Angeles timed to the West Coast debut of Londons Frieze Art Fair we set ourselves some ground rules No clichs of LA as a dream factory of endless sunny days No cooing over allegedly cheaper rent which has become a myth of its own Even the goto jokes about traffic no longer made sense now that the New York subway has buckled into chronic dysfunctionOver a week in Los Angeles  plus a few days in Palm Springs scoping out the sculpture of the Desert X biennial  my priority was to assess the city on its own terms I visited just about every museum and gallery from Brentwood to Boyle HeightsI had coffees with museum directors and beers with recent MFAs whose local concerns dovetailed with global artistic ambitions Plunked in the middle of it all were two new art fairs  Frieze held on the Paramount backlot and Felix staged in the guest rooms and cabanas of a Hollywood hotel  that were the first to draw a global audience to Los Angeles after years of false starts My colleague Jori

Hollywood newer ones like Chteau Shatto downtown and nonprofits like Art  Practice Mark Bradfords space in South LAThe collector base is growing though it remains small relative to the citys wealth Alternative spaces like the Underground Museum the Cabin and Bel Ami are doing very good workThe citys boosters want critics to tell you that Los Angeles is now the center of the contemporary art scene But the truth is that no single city can lead the way in producing the art of our time Los Angeles like every large city is now a constituent of a global art system where none of us is insulated

TransportationAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Cecilia KangWASHINGTON  The Federal Trade Commission has no shortage of critics who say it cannot protect Americans from the prying eyes of Big Tech Instead of forceful action against the likes of Facebook and Google they say the FTC leans on rules that make it hard to impose penalties bigger than rounding errors for the companiesThose critics have an unusual champion Joseph J Simons the man running the agencyWe have this over yearold statute that is our main authority Mr Simons said in his first sitdown interview since becoming chairman  months ago And clearly legislators who approved that were not thinking about data security and privacy issuesIn the deregulatory era of the Trump administration Mr Simons  a Republican lawyer who has jumped between the public and private sectors for more than  years is a rare voice for strengthening the governments handMr Simons has urged Congress to expand the FTCs privacyenforcement powers and allow it to impose fines more easily write new rules and hire more experts He also says the agency should police how all companies and nonprofits  not just technology companies  collect and handle peoples digital dataBut none of those changes will happen before Mr Simons must make the most anticipated decision on data privacy in the agencys history In the coming weeks he and the FTCs four other commissioners are expected to conclude an investigation into whether Facebook violated its promises to protect peoples dataThe outcome of the case is seen as a referendum on the governments ability to rein in tech giants that have amassed incredible wealth and power from collecting and bartering user dataThe FTCs decision on Facebook will be highly consequential for the FTC and Facebook for the tech industry and for consumers said David Vladeck who led consumer protection at the agency during the Obama administration The commissions action will set the barThe case has taken on huge significance in Washington where Facebook has become Exhibit A for an industry accused of a wide range of problems from enabling foreign election interference to crushing competitorsA rising chorus of Republican and Democratic lawmakers has criticized the FTC for not restraining the companies datacollection practices which are central to some of their businesses The agencys biggest penalty on a tech company was a  million fine imposed on Google in  for misrepresenting how it used some online tracking tools Google reported  billion in revenue that yearOn Friday Senator Elizabeth Warren the Massachusetts Democrat who is running for president announced a sweeping plan to strengthen regulations against big tech companiesThe FTC has been a disappointment with its lack of enforcement in the past which for Facebook and Google has amounted to a slap on the wrist Senator Josh Hawley a freshman Republican from Missouri said in an interview Mr Hawley investigated Google for competition violations when he was a state attorney generalThe Facebook investigation is focused on whether the social network violated a  consent decree in which it promised to protect user data and inform users of changes in how their data was used The inquiry started last March under Mr Simonss Republican predecessor Maureen Ohlhausen after a report in The New York Times revealed that the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica had analyzed the data of  million users without their permissionThe agency is considering imposing a multibilliondollar fine on Facebook as well as new requirements to strengthen protections on how data is collected and shared according to two people close to talks between the agency and the company The two sides have discussed a possible settlement for weeks said the people who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuingFacebook declined to comment about Mr Simons and the investigation The social network has defended its actions saying that when it learned a researcher violated its terms of service by giving user data to Cambridge Analytica it demanded that the data be destroyed and was promised that it had beenOn Wednesday the company announced plans to shift to a more privacyfocused platform Mark Zuckerberg the companys chief executive said Facebook would invest in encrypted communications and refashion its messaging tools to emphasize private conversationsMr Simons declined to discuss the Facebook case And he was even guarded about his own use of technology He would not say whether he used Facebook or two other popular apps owned by the company Instagram and WhatsApp He doesnt use other social media like Twitter he said aides write the tweets from his official FTC accountI dont even know how to access my account Mr Simons saidHis comfort zone is antitrust regulation a major focus for the FTC and an area in which he has worked for most of his career In his meticulous office Mr Simons keeps handy a worn Yale Law Journal with red plastic tabs on antitrust articles He has had six of its authors speak at the FTC since he arrivedIn one of his first actions as chairman he held hearings on updating merger reviews and antitrust enforcement in the digital age In late February he announced a task force of  antitrust staff members to study potential problems that could arise from past tech mergersIn antitrust you want to focus on areas where there is likely to be market power or monopoly power Mr Simons said So it is not unreasonable to look at big digital platforms and say well that might be an ripe area to look atHe is new to the world of data privacy and admits he is cramming to understand it immersing himself in articles and grilling staff about data protection But that he said allows him to bring a fresh perspective to privacy enforcementI am willing to look at everything with a fresh eye and to question longheld beliefs and assumptions he saidThe FTC monitors whether companies like Google Uber and Facebook break promises written into privacy policies But it cant directly fine a company for a firsttime offense it can only charge a company with deceptive or unfair business practices which the agency must prove in court The potential penalty against Facebook could reach billions of dollars because the case hinges on whether it violated a previous settlementMr Simons argues that the agency needs more direct authority to oversee privacy practices and fine companies He says it is too hard to prove to a court that someone has been harmed by a companys unauthorized use of their dataIts important that we get civil penalty authority he said For companies that have lots of money the impact would be sufficient to deter themPrivacy groups say the agency has missed numerous opportunities to punish companies with its existing powers Many compare the commission with European regulators which have levied hefty fines on Google Facebook Amazon and Apple for violating antitrust privacy tax and security lawsSome privacy advocates are also concerned about Mr Simons inexperience in the area saying it requires a deep understanding of complicated technologiesI dont think he understands the dimensions and implications underlying the consumer privacy threat said Jeffrey Chester executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy a nonprofit consumer advocacy groupMr Simons said there were obvious differences between how the United States and Europe viewed privacyThe EU has this strong sense of the right to be forgotten he said We dont have that We have the opposite of that We have the First AmendmentAnd he said the details of how the government handled digital privacy should be for lawmakers not him to sort outPrivacy involves very important societal and cultural values that really need to be determined by the Congress Mr Simons said pointing toward Capitol Hill less than a mile up Pennsylvania Avenue from his officeNot he said by unelected FTC commissionersAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Chris StanfordWant to get this briefing by email Heres the signupGood morningWere covering

Matthew Buck and Sandeep VaheesanMr Buck and Mr Vaheesan work for the Open Markets InstituteAt his Senate confirmation hearing Attorney General William Barr signaled an interest in confronting the power of big tech corporations like Facebook and Google As Mr Barr put it a lot of people wonder how such huge behemoths that now exist in Silicon Valley have taken shape under the nose of the antitrust enforcers And since taking office President Trump has repeatedly attacked Americas biggest technology corporations especially Amazon Facebook and Google Among other accusations he has charged Amazon with ripping off the Post Office and Google with  censoring conservative users He recently criticized Facebook Google and Twitter for ridiculous bias in favor of Democrats By most appearances Mr Trump is a foe of big techMr Barr however will find that those huge behemoths will continue to dominate because in part the administrations chief antitrust enforcer is their champion On top of granting tech platforms huge windfalls in his tax reform law Mr Trump appointed a friend of big tech Makan Delrahim to lead the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice Mr Delrahim has consistently promoted the interests of the biggest tech companiesWhile we believe Mr Delrahim a veteran corporate defense lawyer and antitrust official in the George W Bush administration was correct on the merits in trying to stop the ATTTime Warner merger that action was an outlier In a Senate hearing in December he boasted that he strengthened the Justice Departments amicus brief program as a means of reshaping antitrust law In its briefs which represent the views of the federal government as an expert in antitrust law and are influential in court the department has supported legal interpretations that would make Amazon Google Facebook and other dominant firms more powerful On top of looking into possible procedural improprieties between the president and Mr Delrahim Congress should demand an explanation for  and put a stop to  Mr Delrahims undertheradar effort to revise antitrust lawIn the most prominent case Apple v Pepper the Supreme Court will decide any day now whether ordinary Americans can hold tech platforms accountable The Antitrust Division filed briefs siding with Apple Our organization the Open Markets Institute filed an amicus brief in support of Pepper In its briefs the Justice Department argued that iPhone users should not be able to sue Apple for monopolizing the sale of iPhone apps Although the text of federal law grants everyone consumers workers and businesses the right to sue antitrust violators for damages the Justice Department is seeking to restrict private citizens ability to hold corporate power to account In contrast a bipartisan coalition of  states filed a brief endorsing the right of all consumers to obtain compensation and be made wholeThe Justice Department took an even more radically promonopolist position in

Detroit illegally monopolized this clearinghouse when it blocked Viamedia an ad management company Through such refusals to deal monopolists can suppress emerging competition or extend their dominance into new marketsThe government advised the court to adopt the  ruling by Judge Neil Gorsuch then on the th Circuit in Novell v Microsoft which broadly insulates a monopolist from the charge that it improperly cut off rivals access to a good or service they need to compete Under Novell if someone sues a monopolist for refusing to deal with competitors the conduct is illegal only if the monopolist sacrificed profits in the process and that its sole effect was to hurt competition This standard would make stopping refusals to deal virtually impossibleThe Antitrust Divisions position in Viamedia is especially helpful to Google and Facebook whose core services are free to users Consider Facebooks  decision to cut off users friend lists from Vine a video streaming app launched by Twitter Thanks to Facebooks move users of Vine could not invite friends to join the app Under the standard endorsed by the Justice Department Facebook would be protected from legal liability for stifling Vine unless an antitrust enforcer could show that Facebook sacrificed profits in this predatory act Because Facebook does not charge users this would be a tall order for the government excluded rivals and injured consumersAlong with these promonopoly briefs the Antitrust Divisions leadership has publicly expressed almost uncritical admiration for technology giants Disregarding both congressional intent in enacting the antitrust laws and the latest evidence on the economic and political harms from corporate concentration our top antimonopoly enforcers have been fawning over monopolyMr Delrahim and his deputies routinely praise the biggest tech companies and adopt their legal rationalizations In a speech in Mexico City in November he asserted on the basis of little evidence that market power is a motivating factor for investment in a freemarket economy and disparaged rules to protect competitive markets as akin to breaking a mans leg to make him run faster Mr Delrahim recently hypothesized that large digital platforms have grown because they provide innovative and disruptive services that consumers seem to like and want to use and expressed nationalistic pride in the dominant tech platforms being American Contrary to these claims however actions by the European Commission and documents published by Britains Parliament indicate that the tech platforms have used abusive practices to maintain and extend their powerIn December Andrew Finch the Antitrust Divisions principal deputy assistant attorney general contended that consumers often benefit from concentration and dismissed calls to break up or regulate tech platforms as drasticThe division dresses up its actions in the rhetoric of humility In a June  address Barry Nigro a deputy assistant attorney general at the Antitrust Division said that when enforcing antitrust law First we should do no harm and warned we should be wary of trying to prescribe the correct path forwardYet as the Justice Departments top antitrust enforcers proclaim humility and practice restraint when it comes to monopolies they do not extend this courtesy to elected officials Cities and states seeking to structure markets through the democratic process can expect hectoring not humility from the departmentThe Justice Department has to the benefit of Uber and Lyft interfered with municipal efforts to improve the lives of ridehailing drivers These drivers on average earn less than the local minimum wage in many places In November  the Department of Justice as well as the Federal Trade Commission filed a brief against Seattles law granting collective bargaining rights to ridehailing driversThe Justice Department has also weighed in on the legality and wisdom of state rules on for example the practice of law In a statement of interest in a case challenging a Florida bars rule the Antitrust Division paid tribute to new competition from mobile platforms that can profoundly change an industry This type of freestanding policy lecture voices a hostility to democratic market structuring and is outside the divisions statutory duty to police corporate cartels mergers and monopoliesWhen trying to understand the Trump administrations position on tech monopolists ignore Mr Trumps tweets and look to what his antitrust enforcers do and say Mr Trumps antitrust chief is hindering the ability of federal state and local governments and the public to tame the power of tech giants Instead of this deference to corporate power and condescension to our elected representatives the department should be confronting monopolies in tech and elsewhere and respecting the policy choices of state and local officialsMatthew Buck is a reporterresearcher with the Open Markets Institute From  to  he worked as a paralegal

skeptical of astrology But as an investor he has zero doubts about the business potential of the  billion mystical services market Its an area that he has been trying unsuccessfully to invest in for nearly two decadesMr Birnbaum researched lots of astrology startups in the Web  era but concluded then that they were not good investments They were pretty much just marketplaces sending traffic off to random astrologers he said They were definitely shadyThis year he finally backed one Sanctuary an app that can be described as Uber for astrological readings For  a month you can receive a monthly oneonone chat consultation with an astrologer The app also provides free daily horoscopesMr Birnbaums decision to back a horoscope company through Five Four Ventures the incubator he runs gets a lot of grins from people in the finance world he said But they get it Astrology is having a cultural moment and for investors that translates to dollar signs In recent years astrology traded its psychedelic newwave stigma for modern Instagrammy witch vibes and those vibes are very popular with millennial women This means theres money to be made Startups  professional nonshady ones with interesting business models  are bubbling up eagerly raising funding from people like Mr BirnbaumA few weeks after Sanctuary became available for download CoStar an app that lets people download and compare their birth charts raised just over  million in funding from the Silicon Valley venture capital firms Maveron and Aspect Ventures as well as W based in New York CoStars website promotes the fact that astrology allows irrationality to invade our technorationalist ways of living The app has been downloaded more than three million times Its Instagram account has more than  followersBanu Guler the chief executive and cofounder of CoStar said not every investor she pitched was enthusiastic about her company and that some dismissed its practice area as pseudoscience I get that youre not into astrology she said but if you had access to a something or teenager who is a girl thats who you need to talk toA third app called Pattern is spreading among finance and Hollywood types it is founded by Lisa Donovan the cofounder of Maker Studios which sold to Disney for  million Ms Donovan said she hasnt raised a formal round of outside funding yetMs Guler a Scorpio with Cancer rising and moon in Leo believes CoStar can be really big Bigger than the dozens of horoscope blogs or online shops selling crystals and tarot cards Maybe even bigger than meditation apps one of which was recently valued at  billion by investorsMeditation Ms Guler said is an antisocial way of interacting with the world She views astrology as a form of collective wellness with CoStar helping people relate to each other based on star signs Another big difference between astrology and meditations practitioners Astrologers are not allergic to making moneyCoStar is free but users can pay  to compare their chart to that of a friend who isnt a member This is where the relating comes in They can answer questions like Why did we get into that insane fight and why did you shut down Ms Guler said Is it because youre a Capricorn Mars Maybe So lets talk about itAnarghya Vardhana a partner at Maveron and a Libra said CoStar has the potential to be as big as Spotify the music streaming app worth  billion or Tinder the ubiquitous dating app owned by Match GroupIt probably has this aura of being unscientific or whatever Ms Vardhana said But Ms Guler did a really good job of understanding all of that and rooting it in as much science as possible CoStar promotes its use of artificial intelligence and data from NASA to track movements of the starsMs Guler emailed a university psychology program asking if theyd take MRI scans of people while using the app to learn about how people are reacting to it She got no response Having money will help with that she saidThe casual observer might attribute astrologys surging popularity to the stereotype of the narcissistic millennial Of course the selfieloving nanoinfluencer generation is eager to hear that theyre unique and special no matter how woowoo it seems Horoscopes are a more personalized version of BuzzFeedstyle identity content thats designed to be relatable and shareable  Things That Only People Named Jennifer Will Understand or  Signs You Were Raised By Persian Parents In AmericaWhats better than something that is basically a story about you Mr Birnbaum saidBut that explanation ignores what many in the astroverse consider the major turning point for Big Zodiac The election of Donald Trump It changed everything according to Aliza Kelly the astrologerinresidence at Sanctuary She writes its horoscopes and conducts some of its readings Watching The New York Timess forecast needle tip from Hillary Clinton to Mr Trump raised peoples doubts about certain scientifically proven systems Ms Kelly said People became so much more receptive to the idea of there being different ways of seeing the world she said They turned to astrology in order to create some sense of structure and hope and stability in their livesPresident Trumps election inspired Ms Guler to leave her work in fashion media and create CoStar I was like We gotta figure out something more meaningful than what we are doing she said The role social media played in the election  and how it is changing how we operate as humans in the world was a part of her concern Ms Guler saidInvestors see other trends feeding into astrologys resurgence Ms Vardhana said People are seeking smaller specialized communities online while participation in organized religion is declining Millennials and the rest of us are lonely and want community no matter how many followers we have on social media Why wouldnt we turn to the stars and moons and planets and houses of the horoscopeThis is a phenomenon and maybe astrology and the technology of CoStar is well equipped to address it Ms Vardhana said The challenge she said will be converting more mainstream skeptics without alienating the astronerdsA few minutes into my reading on Sanctuarys app Ms Kelly my ondemand astrologer asked me if her assessment of my birth chart rang true According to her interpretation last year was a very important year for me to redefine my values As a Libra rising my relationships are very important to me she noted And in the next few weeks I should put myself out in the world to make connections Sure I typed into the app It was just vague enough that if I did a little mental backbend I could find examples to support her conclusions I felt hesitant to share anything too personal about myself with a stranger until I remembered that by entering the date city and precise time of day I was born I had already bared my soul astrologically speakingSanctuarys inapp readings are bitesize designed to answer a specific question or dilemma Sometimes Ms Kelly said in an interview you just want to know why someone is being a jerk or how you can best navigate that dynamic You dont need to talk about ancestral traumaRoss Clark Sanctuarys chief executive cofounder and a Leo estimates that there are  selfemployed astrologers in the country Sanctuary is starting with around  who Ms Kelly and the Sanctuary team has helped vet and train on the companys reading system He emphasized the apps live oneonone connections Were not trying to be some sort of spiritual Alexa where were using AI to replace someone he said If you think about the practice its really emotionalThe apps create a shortcut to intimacy Armed with purported knowledge of your peers personalities conversations can skip over the polite gettoknowyou small talk and dive right into the ancestral trauma In that way it doesnt even matter that the science is actually fake It creates a selffulfilling prophecy where perceived intimacy leads to real intimacy Later when I interviewed Ms Kelly she mentioned that this was a good story for me a Pisces to be doingWhy Because she said Pisces are spiritual healers and emotional philosophers The quest for spiritual awakening and enlightenment is what Pisces energy is all about she said Its in your bloodIt felt like a convenient conclusion given her companys interest in getting me to write a story Then again who was I to argue with the stars With my blood It felt absurd but also just satisfying and amusing enough that I did not reject the suggestion Instead I said SureErin Griffith reports on technology startups and venture

plant is standardized A something woman nearby was overheard telling her friend that he looked like the lead singer of a boy bandJoel Stanley the chairman of the company ran around handing out

though he has shaved since mostly hung out at a table with his fiance Katie holding hands and savoring the food And at a party later Jared was drinking cocktails with his mother at a wooden table at

the partyI think most of us are intimidated by it Josh said We tried to take it down We cant handle itI think we are a marketers dream because we have a family dynamic Joel said They feel like were a

poverty in a tiny community named St Louis Okla which has a current population of  The four eldest were raised in a twobedroom trailer with no drinkable water Even when they moved into a larger house they said five boys shared one bed  a water bed with no headboard or frame just a mattress They also have four sisters Jennie  Joy  Julee  and Jensyn  who arent involved in Charlottes Webs daily operations though Julee worked in customer service the first few years and Jennie is an investor in the companyNick Ferguson  who has known the Stanley family since he was in fifth grade said almost every time he goes to a bar or restaurant with one of the brothers now a stranger approaches themThey are a goodlooking group of dudes girls have always taken notice Mr Ferguson said But now even guys will come up and say Are you one of the brothers Sometimes they just want to say hi but other times they want to talk at length about Charlottes Web and my buddy has to say Im trying to have dinner with my friends right nowKristi Mahaffey met Rich Stanley through a mutual friend They were students at Kansas State University and married less than a year from the date they met He was very charming and very very charismatic she said He kind of had this Tom Selleck look that was hard not to fall forMr Stanley was committed to Christianity and God less so his sales job which he was continually quitting so they moved to St Louis to help grow a Southern Baptist church With four children and one on the way all they could afford was the twobedroom trailer Mrs Fontenot said she had to drag all the children to the church every morning to collect drinkable waterHer mother Signa Mahaffey whom the family calls Gammy helped them move into a threebedroom home in nearby Shawnee There five more children were born They had tap water but often couldnt afford to pay the electricity bills It would get turned off and Mom would tell us it was campfire time Josh Stanley said We would get so excited and pull out the candles and roast the marshmallowsJordan remembered how stressful it felt when the car broke down constantly Jesse asked to be dropped off blocks from school because he was embarrassed by that same car As a yearold Jared collected pennies to buy gallons of milk because his brothers told him it would fill him up like a mealAt the film festival Josh was joking with his mother about how many younger siblings he has I am a professional diaper changer he said I can whip up a formula I can even nurse The first child was named Joshua David from the Bible For the next one a girl they couldnt decide if they should name her Jennie or Danny The coin chose Jennie and it set the J names in motion Mrs Fontenot saidThe brothers fought growing up and still do Josh and I have broken each others noses Joel Stanley said At the dinner Joel was laughing at Josh for being longwinded Josh was making fun of Joels outfitIf the boys wanted to do anything special like go on a ski trip with their youth group they had to raise their own funds They started a yardraking business by putting up signs all over town that said Rake your yard the easy way Hire me Jared Stanley was particularly skilled at selling candy bars doortodoor even going into office buildings He must hold the world record Mrs Fontenot saidJosh Stanley remembers using money he made from a paper route to buy pillows from a thrift store so he could sleep on the floor instead of the crammed bed One day I just had enough he saidWhen I was  Joel was  and he was basically working full time while a senior in high school said Mr Ferguson the family friend Even though I was young I remember thinking that was a sacrificeHe never met Rich Stanley who left in  when the youngest child Jensyn now  was a year old He is now  and living in Denver where he works as an Uber driver The sons generally talk about him respectfully if coolly Still they rented him a home when they made enough money and on the phone Rich Stanley said he is a loyal customer I use Charlottes Web five to six times weekly he said It has made a noticeable difference in my cognitive thinking and in my joint healthIn  Kristi married Steve Fontenot an oildrilling consultant But by that point the boys were on their way to forging their own fortuneIn  Josh asked his mother to come with him to look at office spaces in the Denver area Since college he had been working with developmentally disabled children in group homes He had read up on medical marijuana and he wanted to open his own dispensary His mothers distressed reaction Pull the car over right nowShe later read papers on the topic and then slowly got on board It wasnt like the family was oblivious to marijuana Josh definitely did pot growing up in high school Mrs Fontenot said I knew he was doing it but it wasnt disruptive and I was so busy having babiesJosh moved into the warehouse so he could work on his project full time sleeping on a sleeping bag on the floor But at the time there was no medical marijuana bill There was only one constitutional statute the one he operated on that said one caregiver could grow six plants for one patient By Joshs own account he was serving tens of thousands of people I knew that is not what the law intended he said At one point the governors office called Joshs lawyers in and as Josh recalled said that he had beaten the system for now but would be in handcuffs soon Josh responded by starting the first c in Colorado to lobby for a medical marijuana bill Luckily for him Bill  passed in  helping pave the way for regulated medical marijuana salesOne day he arrived at the dispensary to find protesters many from a rightwing Christian coalition group holding signs saying Jesus was against him No banks would lend him moneyAt the time Joel was in Texas working for an oil company Jon was traveling the world Jordan was in Colorado clearing the forests for fire prevention as a chain saw operator Jared was working at a bar Jesse was playing basketball at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs J Austin was still in high schoolOne night most of them were in Denver for a concert by John Prine a country folk singersongwriter They gathered at their mothers house and listened to Josh lay out his vision and arguments Everyone except J Austin still in high school joined Joshs endeavorAt that point Joel assumed the role CEO of the company Most growers of cannabis at the time were searching for strains that contained high percentages of THC the extract that makes people high But the Stanleys were searching for plants that contained more CBD the extract that purportedly heals They crossbred multiple varieties to get one that contained  percent and named the products derived from it after their first patient Charlotte a little girl with Dravet syndrome a very rare and destructive form of epilepsy that caused her to have hundreds of seizures The brothers were still focused on medical marijuana as a business but that changed in August  when CNNs Sanjay Gupta did a special on their success with Charlotte Fifteen thousand families reached out to them in the next month they said and the company decided to focus on CBD Charlottes Web was bornAccording to the company sales have tripled every year since  It currently ranks No  in the world for sales of hempbased CBD according to New Cannabis Ventures an information platform focused on the cannabis industry In September in Canada the company raised  million in an IPO There is nothing sexy about the Charlottes Web lab in Boulder Colo Its a factory operation filling up to  bottles of CBD oil a day In the lobby there are framed signs attesting to the companys quality control The most fun part is a little plaque with a pig on it that Charlottes Webs bank made for it to celebrate the IPO There arent even pictures of the goodlooking brothersBut this will probably change soonIn December the  Farm Bill passed in the United States Congress legalizing CBD across the United States As long as it contains less than  percent THC and therefore doesnt get you high you can grow it cultivate it charge for it even ship it across state lines there are some restrictions for quality control Also some places are declaring where it can be distributed New York City for example just took away the right of food vendors to sell itThe moment the  farm bill passed I knew it was the moment to join Charlottes Web said Eugenio Mendez who left his job as global vice president of marketing of water enhanced water and sports drinks at CocaCola to become Charlottes Web chief growth officerWhile Charlottes Web isnt legally allowed to declare any medical benefits the company said it gets hundreds of letters a week from people saying it works for Parkinsons lupus PTSD and opioid withdrawal There are people giving it to their pets Then there are the casual users people taking oil at parties to prevent hangovers the next day Others take it in the morning because they believe it keeps them calm alert and feeling good Some think it helps with anxiety and insomniaMr Hetzler suggested his film crew try it to ease the physical pain of making a movie I remember being approached by one of our crew members after a long day of rigging lights and moving gear he said He told me the CW balm worked incredibly wellIts a strange reality when the same product is being used for both lifes biggest medical challenges and to prevent hangovers But thats where we are with CBD said Dr Rachna Patel the author of The CBD Oil Solution who began prescribing medical marijuana in  Typically the way it works is you have a medicine there is research done on it scientists figure out what it works for then people use it she said Its the opposite with CBD People are using it and then they are like It works for this and now science needs to study it CBD may be hype It may be placebo It may be a miracle cure Legislation could shut it all down at any moment But in the current culture the Stanleys have a huge advantageSince the beginning of  Charlottes Web has experienced a  percent growth in sales online The product is now found in  stores across the United States The company is forecasting revenue growth of  to  million in  up from  million in Each brother has contributed something different to its success One of the

economy than previously estimated the White House acknowledged on Tuesday as President Trumps economists doubled projections of how much economic growth is being lost each week the standoff with Democrats continuesThe revised estimates from the Council of Economic Advisers show that the shutdown now in its fourth week is beginning to have real economic consequences The analysis and other projections from outside the White House suggests that the shutdown has already weighed significantly on growth and could ultimately push the United States economy into a contractionWhile Vice President Mike Pence previously played down the shutdowns effects amid a roaring economy White House officials are now cautioning Mr Trump about the toll it could take on a sustained economic expansion Mr Trump who has hitched his political success to the economy also faces other economic headwinds including slowing global growth a trade war with China and the waning effects of a  trillion tax cutThats a total of  million in unpaid wages each workdayTo blunt the shutdowns effects the administration on Tuesday called tens of thousands of employees back to work without pay to process tax returns ensure flight safety and inspect food and drugs But some people involved in the shutdown discussions in the White House have privately said they anticipate that Mr Trump will grow anxious about the economic impact in the coming days accelerating an end to the stalemate Others close to the president believe Mr Trump has leverage and are encouraging him to stand by his demandsFor now the White House shows no signs of being ready to relent and Kevin Hassett the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers continued to blame Democrats for the economic damageCongress needs to look at the harms that were talking about Mr Hassett said and address themMr Hassett said on Tuesday that the administration now calculates that the shutdown reduces quarterly economic growth by  percentage points for every week that it lasts  the cumulative effect of lost work from contractors and furloughed federal employees who are not getting paid and who are investing and spending less as a result That means that the economy has already lost nearly half a percentage point of growth from the fourweek shutdown Last year economic growth for the first quarter totaled  percentMr Hassett attempting to illustrate the pain caused by the shutdown said on Tuesday that one of his furloughed staff members had begun driving for Uber to make ends meetMr Trump has demanded that Democrats who control the House of Representatives include  billion for a border wall in any measure to fund the government Democrats have refused and along with some Republicans have tried to persuade the president to reopen the government and negotiate border security afterward The House has passed several bills to fund parts of the government including the Internal Revenue Service that are not related to border security Senate Republicans have declined to schedule votes on those billsOn Tuesday in an effort to try to splinter the Democrats opposition the White House invited several House Democrats from districts Mr Trump won to discuss a path forward None showed upThe impasse has left  federal employees furloughed or working without pay along with throwing thousands of government contractors at least temporarily off the jobMr Hassett said it was possible that the damage could grow He also said much of the damage should be repaired once the shutdown ends and workers get back pay But he acknowledged that the shutdown could permanently reduce growth expectations if businesses and markets begin to expect that Congress and the president will repeat the experience again and againSome economists have begun to warn that such a situation is likely and that economic confidence could be undermined as businesses consumers and investors lose faith in the ability of political leaders to find agreement on issues like raising the federal debt limit and approving trade dealsThat lack of confidence could snowball into a selfinflicted economic contraction on the heels of what appears to have been the nations strongest year of growth since the  financial crisis Financial markets are already highly volatile amid concerns about the trade fight with China slowing global growth and signs of weakness in American housing and manufacturing sectorsThe economy could easily stall in the first quarter and then the question is what happens in the second if the shutdown persists said Ian Shepherdson the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics The longer it goes on the longer it takes to recoverThe longer the federal government remains closed for business more services are affectedIf the shutdown continues through the end of March Mr Shepherdson said in a research note he would expect the economy to shrink in the first quarter While federal workers are likely to receive back pay once the furlough ends most government contractors will not and the longer spending is depressed the higher the risk that the businesses they run or patronize will fail Mr Shepherdson saidThe shutdown is threatening to derail this economic expansion Bernard Baumohl the chief global economist for the Economic Outlook Group said in a research note on Tuesday Its effect on federal workers spending plans is particularly worrisome for the automotive and housing markets which were already showing signs of trouble before the shutdown he saidOn Tuesday a Federal Reserve Bank of New York survey showed weakening manufacturing activity in the United States the latest in a line of similar warnings Economists at JPMorgan Chase called the data an early indication of additional slowing in the sector adding that the shutdown was probably hurting business sentimentMichael L Corbat the chief executive of Citigroup told analysts on Monday that right now we see the biggest risk in the global economy as one of talking ourselves into a recessionWith no end in sight federal workers appear ready to seek alternate employment before things get worseThe online jobs site Indeed analyzed job search behavior from midDecember through midJanuary for workers at some affected federal agencies including the IRS and Transportation Security Administration It found clicks on job listings rose at least  percent for each of those worker groups over that period a sign that employees affected by the shutdown are searching for jobs more right now than they usually do at this time of year said Martha Gimbel Indeeds director of economic researchWith the shutdown occurring in a tight labor market many workers have other options and they seem to be trying to take advantage of them Ms Gimbel said If the shutdown leads to a loss of talent for the federal government it could be harder for it to compete for new hires in a labor market this tightThat might already be happening inside the White House Mr Hassett said on Tuesday that a prospective new hire had told the council that he might turn down the job he had been offered out of graduate school because the government is unable to bring him onto the payrollMaggie Haberman and Julie Hirschfeld Davis contributed reportingAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Ellen RosenIf youve been worrying that drones would be filling the skies over your head dropping packages off day after day at your neighbors house leaving food on doorsteps or photographing your every move you can relax a little At least for nowThe hype over commercial drones is so far largely just that One of the people who contributed to that hype was Jeff Bezos the Amazon founder In a  Minutes interview in December  he predicted that deliveries by drones could become commonplace within five yearsThe fifth anniversary of Mr Bezoss prediction has come and gone but widespread deliveries by drone are not yet a reality neither by Amazon nor by any other companyRegulatory thickets technical complexity and the publics skittishness have proven to be formidable hurdles At a minimum the unresolved issues include whether it is safe to allow drones to fly beyond a pilots visual line of sight to operate at night and to fly over peopleBut that doesnt mean theres likely to be a dronefree future And maybe there shouldnt beTest programs around the world that use the technology for lifesaving pharmaceuticals as well as for food and even coffee are attempting to prove that delivery by drones is not only safe but efficient and environmentally soundSeveral companies including Zipline which is distributing blood by drone in Rwanda and Swoop Aero an Australian company that is dispensing vaccines and other medication on Vanuatu in the Pacific are focused on medical needsOthers are turning their sights on consumers hoping drones can be part of the answer to helping small businesses compete with behemoth retailers  or even helping the big guys keep their competitive edgeUltimately says the analyst Colin Snow whether for sunscreen or sushi the big question is whether it makes economic sense to do last mile delivery by drone Some studies say yes while others say noChinese aviation administrators for example have already approved drone deliveries by the ecommerce giant JDcom and delivery giant SF Holding Co But in the United States it will depend on whether regulators eventually allow drone companies to have autonomous systems in which multiple aircraft are overseen by one pilot and whether they can fly beyond the vision of that pilot Current regulations do not permit multiple drones per operator without a waiver Operators like Wing the dronedelivery company owned by Google parent Alphabet have that capabilityBut the immediate economic return isnt clear yet According to the chief executive of Wing James Burgess scale doesnt concern us right now We strongly believe that eventually we will be able to develop a delivery service for communities that will enable them to transport items in just a few minutes at low costThe company whose drones can now travel round trip up to  kilometers  just over  miles  is participating in various stages of testing on three different continents Its first pilot program is in a suburb of Canberra Australia where it is working with local merchants to deliver small packages including overthecounter medicine as well as food The Australian regulators have issued a permit to allow one pilot to operate up to  drones at a time with virtual oversightWeve tried to keep expectations to a minimum and stayed humble We didnt have a lot of preconceived notions Mr Burgess said The Wing drone is a hybrid that includes yes wings for horizontal flying as well as miniaturized propellers  like a helicopters  that allow for hovering over a destination Somewhat surprisingly the most popular item ordered in the Australia pilot is coffee which can be received  still hot  in as little as three minutes from the time the order is placedThis spring the company will begin a new trial in Helsinki for which it is soliciting views as to what should be deliveredMr Burgess also said that separate from drone tests the company and others were working on a socalled unmanned traffic management system Akin to virtual air traffic controllers the system will be designed to permit multiple aircraft  manned and unmanned  to fly safely in the airspace simultaneously Wing is also one of several companies participating in a pilot program in Virginia As with its testing in Finland and Australia Wing will focus on the delivery of consumer goods including foodThe Virginia site in Blacksburg near Virginia Tech is one of  chosen by the Federal Aviation Administration as part of its Unmanned Aircraft Systems Integration Pilot ProgramThe  were culled from  applications from state local and tribal governments agency spokesman Les Dorr said in an email Those in the industry didnt apply directly but could show their interest he said and more than  companies respondedWing and Uber are two of the companies participating But Amazons Prime Air division is not among those testing its technology In a statement issued when the  locales were announced last May the company said While its unfortunate the applications we were involved with were not selected we support the Administrations efforts to create a pilot program aimed at keeping America at the forefront of aviation and drone innovationAmazons Prime Air is however part of a consortium of companies participating in the European Unions test of drone deliveries in BelgiumA number of smaller drone companies are involved in testing programs elsewhere North Carolina has partnered with Silicon Valleybased Matternet and Zipline to deliver essential medical supplies and laboratory samples In addition Israeli startup Flytrex which is already delivering goods by drone in Reykjavik in partnership with online Icelandic retailer AHA will focus on food in Holly Springs NC a fastgrowing suburb of RaleighThose in the industry not surprisingly say that the response from residents has been positive A Pew Research Center survey in December  however found that  percent of Americans disapprove of drones flying near homes  percent support drones while  percent favor limits on usePart of the reluctance some say is concern about privacy and sound As a result local governments are trying to educate their residents about drone operation Noise levels are comparable to dishwashers and cars driving nearby according to a report by FlytrexPrivacy concerns are in part alleviated by ensuring that drones do not have forwardfacing cameras capable of photographing those on the groundWhile the FAA has chosen the  pilots the programs still need to apply for agency waivers because they will fly beyond the visual line of sight fly at night and fly over people fundamentals not allowed under current law The agency is seeking comments on expanding permissible uses under current law it is also testing to evaluate the parameters of regulationAs a practical matter this means that some of the pilot programs are not yet operational as they await FAA approvalThats OK said James Pearce a spokesman for the North Carolina Department of Transportation which prefers to ensure that the drones can safely fly and that those on the ground are not exposed to any risks including those that are selfinflicted We need to make sure that people know not to try to grab the dronesThe FAA is making quarterly visits said Aaron Levitt the assistant director of engineering for Holly Springs NC and a drone enthusiast He recently spent several days on a site visit with agency representatives as they prepared for the first phase which will permit  restaurants to send orders to a local athletic complex and planned for a later phase when the drones will fly beyond the line of sightWhile the deliberate pace may seem slow Mr Levitt like others interviewed remains sanguine Its like the red flag laws when cars began to populate the roads You had to have someone walking ahead with a flag to warn others Thats where we are today with drones  not being able to fly beyond the visual line of sight is like not allowing a car to drive faster than a person can walkWhile the companies FAA and local governments test the capabilities and limits theres another factor that comes into play Unlike traditional car or truck deliveries batteryoperated drones dont rely on fossil fuels for their short flights A  study in the journal Nature found that electric drones were far more efficient than trucks vans larger gasoline drones and passenger cars when comparing for distance traveled And though the study found that benefits may be reduced once the electricity used for recharging and warehousing was factored in drones clearly have less environmental impact than a oneitem delivery by carThe environmental benefits are real Mr Burgess saidOr as Yariv Bash the chief executive of Flytrex said Now youve got a guy driving a oneton car bringing a halfpound hamburger Its crazyAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported

figures like Stevie Wonder Snoop Dogg and YG Before the service began Hussles voice boomed from the speakers and thousands of fans sprung to their feet to sing along the bass shaking the ground giving the event the feel of a concertThe outpouring reflected the depth of admiration for Hussle who incorporated his upbringing and experience as a gang member into his music which spoke powerfully to many who live in the citys poorest neighborhoods and well beyond As his musical success propelled him in recent years Hussle funneled investments to the South Los Angeles streets on which he had grown up earning devotion from fans neighbors and local leaders Hussles Marathon Clothing store became a potent symbol of black entrepreneurship and was transformed into a makeshift memorial last month after

audience as he spokeIt is a heartbreak to again lose a member of our family It is a heartbreak because its so unnecessary he said It is so painful to know that we dont have enough people taking a position that says Listen we must have stronger gun lawsIt is unacceptable he added in what was the most overtly political speech during the memorial It is almost like the world is becoming blind I pray that we will grow and that the leaders who have responsibility to perpetuate life will do it by making sure that the laws will make it very hard for people to have guns and take their frustrations out to kill lifeAfter his remarks he performed the song Tears in HeavenIn a tribute Snoop Dogg said that he and Hussle were drawn to each other like magnets He said that other upandcoming

bearing fruitKendrick Lamar another local Los Angeles hero in his own letter recalled touring with Hussle in  Casually I would go out to the crowd and listen to the substance he spewed on stage

to perform in London on Thursday posted a photo of himself watching the service to Instagram Sent off like a king and rightfully so he said Sending our love from across the worldBefore entering Staples Center many fans stopped to take pictures in front of a black armored truck that Hussle owned The all money in truck was used for promotions and became a fixture outside his clothing store The truck was treated like a piece of public art positioned in the middle of a closedoff street surrounded by fencing and plainclothes security guards Kathleen Gonzalez  said that what she remembered most about Hussle was how he treated everyone  a homeless man an average man a man without papers who was here illegally He gave everyone the same praise he received added Ms Gonzalez a therapist who works with special needs children in South Los Angeles Nowadays its really rare to see thatEven as the city came together on Thursday to mourn Hussle she said her community was on edge over the threat of more violence Being from that part of the city its something you keep in mind she said Nipsey wouldnt want that Some mourners came from far away Ron Solomon flew in from Atlanta on Wednesday night and went straight to Hussles shop in Crenshaw Everything he lived is what I believe in too he said Uplifting his people Not letting the system beat usThe NBA allstar James Harden of the Houston Rockets and DeMar DeRozan of the San Antonio Spurs also came to mourn Hussle They wore white to honor their friend and fellow South Los Angeles native and entered with somber faces not speaking to anyonePresident Barack Obama sent a letter praising Hussle which Karen Civil a hiphop media personality read at the service Mr Obama said that he had heard Hussles music through his daughters While most people look at the Crenshaw neighborhood where he grew up and see only gangs bullets and despair Nipsey saw potential the former president wrote He saw hope He saw a community that even through its flaws taught him to always keep going Angelique Smith Hussles mother stood up to the microphone dressed entirely in white with a tulle veil covering part of her face She spoke at length of her own spiritual beliefs calling on Hussles ancestors to lead him on his journey I have perfect peace she said I am happy I am complete I am strong and if I can feel this way so can youWith the help of

them and only them  got that teens to try vaping insteadFor smokers By design blares the companys website A new  million TV ad campaign called Make the Switch echoes that theme featuring testimonials from exsmokers all comfortably above the legal smoking age who have swapped their cigarettes for a JuulThis benevolentsounding mission  helping nicotineaddicted adult smokers switch to something far less likely to kill them  is Juuls new pitch and the way it hopes to rehabilitate its image as one of Silicon Valleys most problematic startupsYou cant fault Juul for trying The company which is valued at  billion has been through the wringer lately with regulators public health advocates and concerned parents accusing it of fueling an epidemic of teenage nicotine addiction by marketing to young people with fruitflavored pods colorful youthfilled ads and social media campaigns It has been sued by users and lambasted by lawmakers and the Food and Drug Administration which is investigating whether Juuls marketing practices deliberately targeted underage users conducted a surprise inspection of the companys headquarters last year In November Juul announced it would shut down its Instagram and Facebook accounts and stop selling most flavored pods in storesAdding to the concern is that last month Juul took a  billion investment from Altria the tobacco giant behind Marlboro and other popular brands in exchange for  percent of the companyNow after making billions of dollars and joining forces with Big Tobacco Juul is billing itself as a publichealth crusaderJuul is far from the first company to attempt a humanitarian makeover Facebook an outgrowth of a Harvard students juvenile attempt to quantify the attractiveness of his classmates now claims to have been motivated by a virtuous impulse to connect the world Uber created by two tech entrepreneurs who wanted to zoom around San Francisco in luxury cars later tried to convince people that it wanted to provide affordable mobility to the massesBut in Juuls case revisionist history is particularly important because the way Juul markets itself is central to the question of how it should be treated Many consumers investors and ethical technologists would rightly shun a company that knowingly targeted minors with harmful products and cleaned up its act only after public pressure But if you believe that Juul had a noble anticigarette mission all along its easier to excuse its missteps as the product of innocent navetUnfortunately for Juul plenty of evidence suggests that the company didnt always take its public health agenda so seriouslyIn  in an interview with The Verge Ari Atkins a research and development engineer who helped create the original Juul said that we dont think a lot about addiction here because were not trying to design a cessation product at allHe added that anything about health is not on our mindIn other early interviews James Monsees Juuls cofounder and chief product officer played down the idea of a public health missionWere not an activist company he said in a  interview If you dont like what were making better than cigarettes then have a cigarette thats fineIn an interview the next year Mr Monsees called Juuls predecessor a tobacco vaporizer known as Pax the dystopian future of tobacco and said the companys vaporizing technology might someday find a market beyond cigarette smokersIn a statement this week Mr Monsees said the company had been forced to be careful about its marketing Under federal regulations the company is allowed to bill its device as a switching product for smokers but not as a smoking cessation tool or a health device He said that while Juul initiated campaigns in the past that we would not do today it was always focused on eliminating cigarettesSince  we have been focused on creating a product to help people switch away from smoking combustible cigarettes  the number one cause of preventable death in the world Mr Monsees said That focus has been clear in the key milestone moments in the creation of the company  it is what we said in our  Stanford graduation thesis and our first fundraising letter in Juuls founders did in fact talk about improving health as a motivating factor early in the companys existence In a  email sent to potential investors Adam Bowen Juuls other cofounder mentioned wanting to offer a new alternative for healthconscious smokers The pairs graduate thesis presentation delivered while they were studying at Stanford in  pitches vaping as a healthier substitute for cigarettesBut Juuls public marketing told a different story Few of the companys early ads made any mention of cigarettes risks or advocated for smokers to switch most were focused on playing up vapings cool factor As recently as  the front page of the companys website said nothing about switching from cigarettes at all only that the Juul offered an intensely satisfying vapor experienceRecently Juul  now equipped with an army of lobbyists and a slick communications team that includes a former White House spokesman  has studiously revamped its image Glossy profiles have been written about the companys lifesaving mission and Juuls new chief executive Kevin Burns has gotten on message emphasizing the companys focus on adult smokersThis abrupt aboutface has drawn skepticism from critics Matthew L Myers the president of the antismoking advocacy group Campaign for TobaccoFree Kids characterized Juuls new ad campaign as little more than a PR effort aimed at lawmakers and regulatorsJuul has engaged in all the traditional tactics of a company that is trying to fend off meaningful regulation rather than actually change their behavior Mr Myers said That is classic Big TobaccoFor all the handwringing no one is suggesting that Juuls nicotine pods are less healthy than cigarettes or that the company should stop marketing itself as a smoking alternative Theres every reason to believe that vaping is significantly less harmful than smoking and many adult smokers have in fact used Juuls products to help them quitBut motives matter And Juuls shifty selfpresentation suggests that the company may not be acting entirely on the levelJuul wants you to believe that it became a teenage sensation entirely by accident that its products were only ever meant for adult smokers and that taking billions of dollars from Big Tobacco is consistent with the values of a company that has always put a priority on health over profitsThe truth is much hazier

and is causing vacationers to rethink their summer travels and stirring anxiety among the homeowners who rely on themThe fallout over the  percent tax has inserted New Jersey into a broader debate as states and communities grapple with the explosive growth of the online homesharing economy A patchwork framework of local ordinances has failed to keep pace with the rapid rise of Airbnb the largest homesharing site which was valued at  billion two years ago and has upended the rental market around the worldMuch like Ubers dominance has caused a regulatory challenge for cities and Amazons ascent has prompted states to adopt internet sales taxes the popularity of Airbnb has begun to push lawmakers to impose new rules even as they find ways to tap the enormous revenue it generatesMassachusetts also recently passed a statewide tax on shortterm rentals aimed at Airbnb and other homesharing sites a proposal to increase the sales tax on similar rentals has been introduced in ColoradoIn New York City Airbnb and local officials have been at war over efforts to crack down on the industry A federal judge blocked a law in January that would have required Airbnb to provide detailed information about listings and hosts and the city recently filed a lawsuit against a group of real estate brokers accusing them of using Airbnb to illegally rent out dozens of apartmentsState and local governments that have moved to rein in Airbnb and other homesharing sites have set off alarm bells among those whose economic survival is tied to the shortterm rental market and who are angry that

the NJ Shore Rentals Coalition to lobby lawmakers and Mr Murphy to exclude shore rentals from the tax A bill that would do that has been unveiled in Trenton though it is unclear if it has enough support to passThe vast majority of the Jersey Shore are homes that were rented out long before the sharing culture thats developed with Airbnb said Duane Watlington vice president of the coalition We believe that if the unintended tax is not corrected there will be less money spent on vacations further exacerbating the need for tax revenuesThe Murphy administration has signaled that it would consider revising the tax to ease the burden on the Jersey ShoreThe administration stands ready to work with the Legislature to amend the law to more closely mirror the intent of our original budget

asking strangers for money and visiting food pantries was finally endingBut many of the federal workers who have been furloughed or working for free since December were leery of the threeweek deal reached on Friday to reopen the government New worries gnawed How long before they got paid Would federal contractors see even a dime of back payAnd most of all after the longest shutdown in American history would they and  other federal workers be back in the same mess in three weeks if President Trump and Democrats do not reach an accord on whether to fund his proposed border wallThis was all for nothing basically said Angela Kelley  a furloughed worker for the Bureau of Land Management in Milwaukee who picked up shifts as an Uber driver to earn money to buy gas and groceries as the shutdown dragged onOn Friday Mr Trump praised federal workers as fantastic people and incredible patriots and acknowledged the toll they had suffered But several federal employees said they still felt angry after being treated like pawns they said in a fiveweeklong Washington standoff They said the shutdown had left deep scars on their families and finances and undermined their faith in elected leaders and in the careers they had chosenThe New York Times talked with more than a dozen federal workers and contractors  from wildland firefighters to Coast Guard families to museum security guards  about how they had survived the shutdown and the uncertainty they now faceJohn Hare  is one of thousands of Coast Guard employees and retirees worried that they may find themselves in the same precarious position a few weeks from nowBecause the Coast Guard is the only branch of the military that is part of the Department of Homeland Security it was affected by the shutdown About  activeduty reserve and civilian employees had already missed either one or two paychecks while another  military retirees would have gone without a pension payment for the first time on Feb After  years of service Mr Hare was forced to retire from the Coast Guard last August after learning he had a rare form of cancer that spread from his appendix His wife had to stop working to care for him and missing Mr Hares pension check of  would have put a significant dent into the family budgetThe faith in our leadership to be able to negotiate with each other has been broken Mr Hare of Rolesville NC said on Friday And they chose to break faith with the US militaryI certainly question the hostagetaking of government employees paychecks he said And nobody that was in power who had the power to stop this none of them were injured by the shutdownIt is less a sense of relief because nothing has been solvedYvette Hicks  a security guard at the Smithsonian museums said she woke up on Friday and prayed once again for the shutdown to end As a single mother she said the shutdown had taken a toll on her familys budget and her own mental healthWhen she learned on Friday she might be returning to work Ms Hicks said she had been crying Her yearold daughter and yearold son were due home from school soon and she was trying to put up a brave face for them She said her son Kaden had nevertheless told his teachers that his mother was now sad all the timeMs Hicks said her family had once been homeless and that she believed her job at the Smithsonian was a path to stability She even saved up enough to book a springbreak vacation for her children to an indoor water park in Virginia But as the bills piled up and her paychecks stopped she said she canceled the trip and lost the  deposit she had paid for a roomIts just a hurting thing she said This has damaged my familyAnthony Powers  had begun thinking about leaving his year career as part of an elite team of wildland firefighters with the United States Forest Service in Southern California He was that frustrated with his nations leadersOur country is being run by children he saidOn Friday he was relieved but not elated noting that everything could shut down again soonMr Powers and his colleagues typically spend this time of year clearing away brush to help lessen fire danger in the coming year None of that has been happening for the last month or so and his team needs more than three weeks to get the job done He also has a national conference set for the end of February and the shortterm opening leaves him in limbo Is it going to happen Should he plan for it Not plan for itTheres been so much planning for this to go into the longterm he said Now its like where do you resetNic Trujillo  a single father and collections representative for the Internal Revenue Service in Ogden Utah said the shutdown had done financial and emotional damageHe had not paid rent in January because he needed to pay other expenses On Friday he and his yearold son were just one week away from being evicted and having to move in with extended familyStaying at home had also left him depressed Before he was ordered to return to work without pay on Jan  his natural nightowl tendencies had taken over He would stay up late get up to get his son off to school then sleep for much of the dayI havent really done anything I havent really gone anywhere he said explaining that he didnt want to waste gas Its just been a very depressive timeHe said he blamed both the president and Congress for the shutdown saying that none of them knew what it was like to live paycheck to paycheckThey are so out of touch with the American people that its unacceptableKim Howell  whose husband is in the Coast Guard in Boston and has been working hour night shifts throughout the shutdown said she didnt feel much relief on Friday She said she didnt expect that her husband would get any back pay for a week or two And then there was the possibility that the government would shut down again in three weeksMs Howell said her family had been fortunate because she works for a tech startup But the loss of her husbands income strained them They had to put off rent payments utility bills and cellphone cable and internet billsShe had visited a food pantry that had been set up in Boston for Coast Guard families She worried about the impact on her three children who are   and  Her oldest child told her he felt helpless and anxious watching his parents try to navigate the crisis She did not blame any particular party but said she felt betrayed And she

between each untimely demise she scours the city for clues like a modernday Philip Marlowe uncovering important lessons that need digesting before she can get along with well lifeCreated along with Amy Poehler and Leslye Headland Russian Doll is Lyonnes first effort at writing and directing a series  one secure within the Netflix flock where later this year shell wrap up her sentence as the

like spent on self for a minute Lyonne saidAt a photo studio in TriBeCa posing for the camera in a fearsome pantsuit not unlike the one Nadia wears Lyonne  talked about adding hyphens to her job description and aging out of troublemakingHere are edited excerpts from the conversationSo how did this autobiographicalbutnot series come aboutAmy called me out of the blue one day and said You know as long as Ive known you youve always been the oldest girl in the world And Im like Is that a compliment Cut to the end of the story We ended up developing a show for NBC called Old Soul in which I played a character named Nadia and Ellen Burstyn played a character based on Ruth my reallife godmother who lives in Murray Hill and spends most of her time at the Borgata in Atlantic City and is a highroller but almost exclusively on the slot machines Chainsmoker Carltons So when that show did not get picked up it was almost like a paid investigation of what would become Russian DollWhats it like handing off your ideas to an allfemale writers room In an amazing way the first thing that goes out the window is the trope of a woman Everybody is a vulnerable complex person but I dont think that the ways in which we exhibit that are in any way how our stories have been told traditionallyHow fun was it thinking up ways for Nadia to dieTheres probably a bit of a misconception around how key the deaths are It was more an emotional story of bottoming out There are metaphorical deaths big and small throughout the day There are the bigger ones where you just feel like your whole world is collapsing because of health or a relationship falling apart Then theres the smaller deaths of the text message that didnt get responded to that youre obsessing on and it feels like youre suddenly a hollow man insideLets not forget those streetcrossing hazardsIm definitely a real criminal jaywalker Im happy for the environment that we have bicycles now in the city but its unmanageable You dont know if theyre coming from this side or the other side Its way too zany No longer is there this elegant kind of Richard Hell sort of Lou Reed lazy amble through the city as you cross the street looking over your shoulder like a cool guy Theyve killed that entire rhythm to ManhattanI dont want to spoil anything but youve cast Chlo Sevigny in a very personal roleChlo is my closest person in life and there was really only one person that felt like it was safe to entrust that role to Probably the most incredible moment for me was walking home with my little directors binder in the East Village and watching the sun begin to rise And Im like this is a very different kind of sunrise than what Ive experienced historically at this hour This was the good guys version of that and it was deep stuff Chlo and I had walked those streets so many times and now it was this world that we had built There was a lot of gratitude I just couldnt believe how things have turned outIn July you told some crossword puzzle jokes for T Magazine It seems youre obsessedI might like the crossword puzzle more than I care about cigarettes which is insane There have been relationships where Ive broken up because Im like I need this to feel more like a crossword puzzle At the time I didnt know that thats what was missing  about the stimulus or lack thereof  but its a real sweet spot Imagine if they ever really figure out virtual reality It would feel similar in terms of why people would want to escape into a futuristic pod and just live in there because the world outside has become too toxic to inhabit That was an early concept for Russian Doll that we abandoned because we realized we didnt know how to make that showYet Nadia does sneak in a puzzleYes when shes visiting Horse Brendan Sexton

Honestly it was waylaid because the prices of New York rental spaces are so extreme that I was like do I look like a Rockefeller I dont drink or anything so something that would give you the sensation

is to be an adult person as opposed to a troublemaking tweenOrange Is the New Black will end later this year That must feel pretty traumaticWhats amazing is that these scenes are so heavy to play and it comes so easy at this point just because weve lived in the bones of these people for so long My hope would be that a good group of us continue to find out where we have a hub Orange will become our

Bosman Mitch Smith and Monica DaveyCHICAGO  Two AfricanAmerican women are headed for a runoff in the Chicago mayors race setting up an election that will make historyLori Lightfoot a former federal prosecutor and sharp critic of the status quo at City Hall and Toni Preckwinkle the county board president and chairwoman of the countys Democratic Party will face one another in a runoff election set for April according to The Associated PressThe third top votegetter  William M Daley a member of Chicagos political dynasty of Daleys  earlier conceded defeatEither Ms Lightfoot or Ms Preckwinkle would be the first AfricanAmerican woman to lead the nations third largest city succeeding Mayor Rahm Emanuel as mayor Only one other woman Jane Byrne has been elected mayor in  If Ms Lightfoot were to win she also would be the first openly gay mayor of ChicagoMs Preckwinkle  a long established politician who has often been urged to run for mayor had been widely expected to do well in Tuesdays balloting amid a cast of  candidates The success of Ms Lightfoot  who has never held elective office before was far more surprising she was less well known in Chicagos political sphere and had far less moneyGet to know the candidates Heres a short profile of Ms Lightfoot And one of Ms Preckwinkle tooHer win too was seen as something of a rebuke to Mr Emanuels tenure as mayor and to Chicagos old political history Ms Lightfoot had tried to define her campaign as a rejection of machine politics and a refocusing on Chicagos struggling neighborhoods not just its gleaming downtownMore on the issues at stake in Chicagos electionMs Lightfoot emerged at a gathering of supporters late Tuesday night and seemed to take note of people who hadnt expected her success To applause she called out So what do you think of us now She added This my friends is what change looks likeThe historic nature of the runoff was not lost on Ms Preckwinkles supporters who gathered at a party on another side of town The crowd cheered when Bridget Gainer a county commissioner noted from the stage that Chicago city would one way or another have an AfricanAmerican woman as mayor later this yearTonight I am proud of my city Ms Gainer said Our whole country is going to be watching us and what were going to be doingLonnell Saffold the recording secretary for a local unit of the Service Employees International Union said having two black women in the runoff shattered a glass ceiling that Chicago probably would have never fathomed Mr Saffold said he voted for Ms Preckwinkle but that Ms Lightfoot had been his second choiceThe citys votes were sprinkled widely across the massive field of  candidates who had hoped to replace Mr Emanuel who didnt run for a third term With  percent of the votes counted Ms Lightfoot had the highest vote tally with about  percent Ms Preckwinkle had  percent and Mr Daley who was well funded and who many here had expected to easily make the runoff came in just below  percent This was a look at the top candidates in Tuesdays election an unusually wide fieldFor months Chicagos campaign has looked like a reunion of its bestknown political figures  a former police superintendent a former public schools chief a former city clerkAmong the names most familiar to voters were Ms Preckwinkle and Mr Daley a brother of this citys longestserving mayor Richard M and a son of the secondlongestserving mayor Richard J Richard M Daley who ran Chicago for  years before Mr Emanuel arrived in  was sometimes known as Mayor for Life and some Chicagoans thought the Daley name alone would at least advance the latest Daley into a runoffOn Tuesday night Dona Scott whose husband Sam was Mr Daleys campaign chairman lingered after Mr Daley conceded defeat from a stageRight now Im digesting what happened she said In my heart of hearts I believe Bill was the person to lead this citySam Scott the campaign chairman said that he felt Mr Daley was hurt by negative ads in the last two weeks from his competitorsBut there was something more at play The times have changed he said In the last couple of elections weve seen younger folks women people of color have taken something of a spotlight Its more difficult for an older white gentleman to relate to some of the changes that people think that they wantFor weeks the sheer number of candidates seemed to have left some Chicagoans flummoxed  unsure even in the final hours whom they would vote for Some political strategists said they wondered if that might discourage some people from voting at all in the election which is technically nonpartisan though Democrats reliably winMr Emanuel upended Chicagos political landscape when he announced in September that he would not seek a third term Mr Emanuel  who had been sharply criticized over his handling of school closings crime and police misconduct and had faced political challengers  said at the time that the mayors office has been the job of a lifetime but it is not a job for a lifetime After that many more candidates stepped forwardWhoever becomes the next mayor of this city of  million people will face an array of complicated sometimes interconnected challenges all at onceThe citys pension system will require an additional  billion in revenue by the end of the new mayors first term Yet residents say they are weary from years of increases in their property tax bills and fees Crime and gang violence remains a deep worry for many even as the city contends with its long history of troubled relations between the police force and residents especially in the black communityAnd although tourism has boomed downtown development along the Chicago River has flourished and corporations have flocked to the city in recent years some neighborhoods on the South and West Sides have struggled with disinvestment schools closing and people moving awayOn Tuesday Jackie Ropski a marketing director for an elementary school said that she saw this election as more important than some with so many candidates to choose from and at a pivotal moment in Chicago historyI think there is a certain amount of weight on this particular election Ms Ropski said after voting in the Irving Park neighborhood on the Northwest Side Personally I think education takes prominence among all the issues but whoever is mayor has to take a layered approach How do you solve poverty crime neighborhood tensions education Thats complexAlex Ruiz  a student and Uber driver said that the biggest issue that worried him was Chicagos financial situation and its looming pension obligations The next mayor he said had to get the citys finances in order to spread confidence to Chicagoans about the state of the cityMr Ruiz grew up only a few miles east of his current neighborhood Irving Park but his family had steadily moved west throughout his life as gentrification kept pushing them outEveryones trying to stay in this city they were born in he said If we dont address the financial issues were going to keep driving the middle class out of the cityAt Mannys deli south of downtown Natalie Wasso said she was leaning toward voting for Mr Daley if she voted at allMs Wasso  a phlebotomist who lives on the Southwest Side said she trusted the Daley family which led the city for most of her childhood Her grandmother had always voted for Daleys in past electionsWe never had a problem Thats the name we know in Chicago Ms Wasso said He can relate to us regular peopleBut Jewel Morris  a retired probation officer said he had voted for Ms Preckwinkle though he deemed her the lesser of two evils compared with Mr DaleyNo Daleys no Bushes no dynasties said Mr Morris who lives on the Near West Side We dont need any of thatThe Chicago of  is better than when he was a child he said The architecture is unparalleled the restaurants are worldclass and tourists are coming to the city in droves But the inequality feels like the Chicago of his youthYoure looking at a tale of two cities he said Its still the city of neighborhoods and still the city of segregationAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byReaders respond to three columns about increasing divisions within the party By Rachel L Harris and Lisa TarchakMs Harris and Ms Tarchak are senior editorial assistantsWhat  or who  will it take to unite the Democratic Party Last week three columnists wrote about the growing rivalry between the partys progressives and moderates and speculated as to which contingent could produce a candidate strong enough to take the presidency in  Responses to each column David Leonhardts A Dose of Moderation Would Help Democrats Ross Douthats The Democrats Have a Culture Problem and Thomas B Edsalls We Are Either a Team or Were Not reflected a common divide among our readers While many touted the virtues of democratic socialists like Senator Bernie Sanders as being able to galvanize younger voters many others called for someone like Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio who has since decided not to run saying more centrist policies helped him hold an important swing state in the midtermsA selection from these debates is below Comments have been edited for length and clarity What Id like to see is not a combination of progressives and moderates but a combination within individual Democrats of progressive policy aims and moderate temperament Turning those policy aims into reality will require longterm Democratic control of Congress and the White House Forging such a durable majority will take patience prudence and consensus building It wont be accomplished with an intolerant purist mind set that isnt shared by most Americans The progressive agenda is too important to be entrusted to the progressive personality type  Longestaffe PickeringMost selfdescribed socialists are young They have seen what their moderate parents have gotten us income inequality a deteriorating environment and college graduates driving Uber because

Berkeley CalifA more reasonable label would be Ineffective Flabby Reformism versus attempts to actually stand up and accomplish some needed goals The terms left and socialism really refer to being good to our neighbors being less selfish seeing the harm of extreme inequality opening ones eyes to historical racism and sexism in our lives and trying to save our planet from ecological catastrophes  Just Thinkin TexasWe need to move this country forward after being thrown back on our heels by the incompetent GW Bush immoral Trump and ineffective Obama We need Franklin D Roosevelts economic policies John F Kennedys and Lyndon B Johnsons social activism and rigorous environmental policies Far more Republicans will support the candidacy of Senator Bernie Sanders than that of a moderate Democrat Sanders would take all the disenchanted Trump voters and they are growing by the day  Rich D TucsonThe Democratic Party doesnt recognize that it is an elitist organization that the progressive ideals it claims to represent are akin to political gentrification at the expense of solving the underlying problems threatening Americas working class And when someone like Sen Sherrod Brown does speak for this great mass of individuals he is labeled with the pejorative term populist as though it is unfair to appeal to what most of the country really wants  Jerry Meadows Cincinnati Ive heard moderate Democrats dismissed as unicorns not worthy of pursuit I can tell you there are plenty of us in this party and if it swings too far to the fringe left not only will the party lose

living in northwest Pennsylvania the gateway to the Rust Belt Democratic Socialism is not going to work in this part of the country The right will continue to use Representatives OcasioCortez and Omar

party I might support them but my neighbors wont  Marylouise The Rust BeltA call for Democrats to move to the center when in fact the positions of the progressive candidates are strongly supported by the public seems foolish and dangerous Americans want fairer taxes universal health care a livable wage and an environmental future that controls global warming These are meat and potato issues that the electorate will support  Kevin Cummins DenverThe fact is our left represents mainstream social and political policy in intelligent forwardthinking nations Were proud of our beliefs Democrats walk away from moderate Trump voters They will never vote for you Its time to tack hard left The only way for Democrats to win is to answer to us your base And were tired of wasting our votes on centrists who have given us nothing  Nicholas Rush Colorado SpringsIf the right moves further to the right then in order for the Democrats to be moderate they also have to move right The spectrum needs balance Personally Im looking at a presidential candidate that is to the right of Bernie Sanders and to the left of Amy Klobuchar Someone who can get both coastal liberals and Midwest blue dogs to vote with excitement Someone who is to the left of moderation  Aimee PollackBaker MassachusettsDont write off us baby boomer centrist Democrats just yet Millennials may be marching to the left but Im not and neither is anyone in my social circle And there are still plenty of us remaining I see the policies of Senators Bernie Sanders Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker as arrogant and ludicrous From a simple mathematics point of view they cant win a national election with the Electoral College Representatives Alexandria OcasioCortez Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar will be the final straw to alienate the majority of white and Latino Americans who are trending right Trump will win again And if Trump goes down and a reasonable Republican like Mitt Romney steps in Ill vote for him  David G Monroe

cultures to coexist within it Liberal secular communities do and should exist alongside conservative religious ones Democrats running for federal office should not focus on cultural issues that devolve easily but on issues like foreign policy that must be resolved at the federal level  Aoy Pennsylvania I may agree with many of the very progressive ideas of Rep OcasioCortez and the new cadre of lefties in the House but I also dread the notion of a Trump reelection losing the House again and never taking back the Senate That is exactly what will happen if idealism  and in some cases

political parties across the democratic world are blowing up with Britains Labour Party just the latest to fracture Could Americas parties be nextCould we have our first fourparty election in   with candidates from the Donald Trump far right the old GOP center right the Joe Biden center left and the Alexandria OcasioCortez far left all squaring off as the deepening divides within our two big parties simply cant be papered over any longer Its not impossibleIndeed two phrases recently in the news that touch on core principles of the Democratic and Republican Parties are like fuses that could ignite much larger explosions in the coming year Those phrases are unwilling to work and national emergencyOn Feb  OcasioCortezs congressional office sent out an FAQ explainer of the Green New Deal that shes proposing The initiative aims to mobilize every aspect of American society  to achieve netzero greenhouse gas emissions and create economic prosperity for allI admire that goal and the huge energy shes brought to it among young people But one version of her offices FAQ stated that the Green New Deal would guarantee among other benefits Economic security to all who are unable or unwilling to workEconomic security for people unwilling to work Whos going to sign up for new taxes to support people unwilling to work or be retrainedWhen some commentators called this out OcasioCortezs team said the FAQ was an unfinished draft that never should have been released I dont buy it It was also too late That phrase  economic security even for people unwilling to work  was not just noted by conservatives It rattled some centerleft Democrats as well because it hinted that the partys base had moved much farther to the left in recent years than theyd realized and it highlighted the most important fault line in todays Democratic Party  the line between what Id call redividethepie Democrats and growthepie DemocratsGrowthepie Democrats  think Mike Bloomberg  celebrate business capitalism and startups that generate the tax base to create the resources for more infrastructure schools green spaces and safety nets so more people have more opportunity and tools to capture a bigger slice of the pieGrowthepie Democrats know that good jobs dont come from government or grow on trees  they come from risktakers who start companies They come from free markets regulated by and cushioned by smart governmentThe wisest growthepie Democrats have also learned something from the past few years The benefits of Nafta open trade with China and the rise of the digital economy  while vital for creating economic growth  dont just automatically trickle down any more than GOP tax cuts did They require trade insurance and surge protectors free community college portable health care coverage and pensions and a very intentional strategy to more equitably spread the benefits of growth among bosses workers and shareholdersRedividethepie Democrats  think Bernie Sanders  argue that after four decades of stagnant middleclass wages  and bailouts for bankers and billionaires but not workers in   you cant grow the pie without redividing it first Inequality is too great now There are too many people too far behindThe decision by Amazon to scuttle its big expansion in New York City marks the first big clash this election season between growthepie Democrats who insisted that tax breaks for Amazon would pay for themselves and redividethepie Democrats who saw Amazon as pitting their community in a race to the bottom with other communities over which could lavish more subsides on a tech behemoth that didnt need themIn truth the episode was a huge failure of imagination by both sides Virginia got it right explained Amy Liu urban affairs expert at the Brookings Institution in an essay last week in The Times Yes it gave Amazon some  million in subsidies but the state offered twice that amount in new investments in local transportation and schools to create a strong pipeline of technically skilled workers  something that will benefit the entire community for yearsAs for the GOP its divided between a limitedgovernmentgrowthepie right  but one that wants to just let capitalism rip  and a hoardthepie pullupthedrawbridge Trumpled far rightThe limitedgovernmentgrowthepie faction is itself split between the Never Trumpers  whove refused to prostitute themselves to Trumps serial lying cozying up to Russia and other madness  and those whove hitched a ride on Trumps wagon to get their tax cuts conservative judges and deregulationBut Trumps decision to declare a national emergency on the Mexico border has violated the partys most core principle of limited government In doing so its opened a fissure between the old limitedgovernmentgrowthepie Republicans and the antiimmigrant hoardthepie pullupthedrawbridge TrumpersThe early signs are that the limitedgovernment types  led by Mitch McConnell  are so morally bankrupt after having sold their souls to Trump for two years theyll even abandon this last core principle and go along with Trumps usurpation of Congresss power of appropriationStay tuned Over the years our two parties have usually managed to handle deep fractures This time may be differentThe level of outrage in both bases is sky high Their ability to express that outrage through weaponized social networks talk radio and cable television is powerful and pervasive and the three accelerations  in globalization technology and climate change  were going through are stressing everyone and demanding very different political choicesSo heres my hunch The  US election will be unlike any in my lifetimeThink about it Ever since World War II until the early st century the major political parties in the West were all built on a set of stable binary choices capital versus labor big governmenthigh regulation versus small governmentlow regulation open to trade and immigration versus more closed to trade and immigration embracing of new social norms like gay rights or abortion and opposed to them and green versus growthAcross the industrial world parties mostly formed along one set of those binary choices or the other But that is no longer possibleWhat if I am a steelworker in Pittsburgh and in the union but on weekends I drive for Uber and rent out my kids spare bedroom on Airbnb  and shop at Walmart for the cheapest Chinese imports and what I cant find there I buy on Amazon through a chatbot that replaced a human Monday to Friday Im with labor Saturday and Sunday Im with capitalMy point Many of the old binary choices simply do not line up with the challenges to workers communities and companies in this age of accelerating globalization technology and climate change but national governments are so paralyzed by partisanship that they cant adapt And most families are too weak to manage these forces and pass along the American dream to their kidsFortunately though all is not lost Creative adaptation is happening in many of Americas counties cities and towns where trust is much higher The most successful are forging what I call complex adaptive coalitions where business labor philanthropists social entrepreneurs educators and local government all network together to create jobs attract businesses grow housing fix potholes and improve schoolsThese coalitions are not focused on splitting the differences between the old rightleft binary choices Theyve actually moved to a totally different grid  one that asks every day on every issue What works Find it and share it so we can get the best out of these accelerations in technology globalization and climate change and cushion the worst for the most people in our communityOxford economist Eric Beinhocker recently pointed out to me research that says there are only two ways to cure political tribalism A common threat or a common project We need a common project and its obvious Build a new foundation for the middle class Ultimately that requires the local and the national levels to work together But for now we should be glad that its at least happening at the local levelDon Baer who served as President Clintons communications director has a bumper sticker for anyone who wants to run for president in  on the grid of rebuilding our country through complex adaptive coalitions  but it will

digital future without its Emmywinning series Game of Thrones or Veep both of which will end their runs in the coming monthsMr Greenblatt  was named the chairman of entertainment at ATTs Warner Media giving him oversight of TBS TNT a future streaming service and  the crown jewel  HBO Thanks to a reorganization brought about by the veteran ATT executive John Stankey Mr Greenblatt has become one of the most powerful players in the industryThere are only a few things I wanted to do he said in a telephone interview These opportunities in these kind of jobs arent open that oftenMr Greenblatt who goes by Bob was the beneficiary of corporate changes signaling that ATT will not be a passive overseer of the media empire it acquired last June for  billion He spent much of the last two decades as the head of entertainment at Showtime and NBC and his expertise makes sense for a company that is looking to increase its output while trying to hang on to is core fansHis first big assignment will be to remake the structure that was in place in the years when HBO TBS and TNT were owned by Time Warner under which HBO operated independentlyThe overarching goal is to produce enough quality content to make the new incarnation of ATT  with its planned streaming service front and center  a fearsome competitor to the deeppocketed tech companies Netflix Amazon Hulu and Apple Dont forget the Walt Disney Company which has plans to enter the digital fray in a substantial fashion thanks in part to the trove of content it acquired with its purchase of the bulk of st Century Fox for  billionAnd Mr Greenblatt will become the caretaker of something dear to those who have spent their Sunday nights glued to Sex and the City The Sopranos and Game of Thrones HBO The networks chief executive Richard

that could have been brought in he said I dont want to just come in and upend everything and destroy what theyve builtMr Greenblatt said he was approached by Mr Stankey the longtime ATT executive and Warner Media chief executive last fall not long after he had stepped down from NBC Talks accelerated in JanuaryI was immediately excited about it he said Though not undaunted by it You know from my history I like a challengeA meaningful change will come about in short order HBOs center of gravity will shift from New York Mr Pleplers base of operations to Los Angeles where Mr Greenblatt built his careerHe dreamed of being in show business when he was growing up in Rockford Ill about  miles from Chicago Literally in the cornfields Mr Greenblatt said He set his sights on becoming a producer when

University of Wisconsin and the University of Southern California Mr Greenblatt landed a job at the Lorimar studio in the late s That was where he worked with Peter Chernin the executive and producer who would play a role in virtually every turn of his career in the years to comePeter is my ultimate mentor my uber mentor Mr Greenblatt saidMr Chernin left Lorimar for a new TV network  Fox  and persuaded Mr Greenblatt to join him The timing was impeccable Fox was entering its gogo s phase with addictive soaps like Beverly Hills  and Melrose Place and the family drama Party of Five Mr Greenblatt also helped put The XFiles on the air despite his initial hesitationHe decided to strike out on his own as a producer in the late s forming a studio with the producer David Janollari  with financial backing from th Century Fox thanks to Mr Chernin In that role he squired a few network shows and had a critically acclaimed hit with Six Feet Under Alan Balls darkly comic funeralhome series It lasted five seasons on HBO and won the Golden Globe for best television drama in I felt the HBO glow way back then Mr Greenblatt saidHe rejoined the executive ranks at Showtime where Mr Chernin had worked in the s When I was at Showtime we were of course in the shadow of HBO Mr Greenblatt saidAt the time HBO was known for gritty male antiheroes like Tony Soprano Showtime went in a slightly different direction under Mr Greenblatt programming shows like Weeds with Mary LouiseParker and Nurse Jackie with Edie Falco A personal favorite for Mr Greenblatt was Dexter starring the former Six Feet Under star Michael C Hall Showtime became a serious home for original programming on his watch with the number of subscribers rising to  million a  percent jump over his tenure thereIn  as NBC was trying to recover from the decision to replace its  pm dramas with a nightly Jay Leno talk show Comcast was closing on its purchase of NBC Universal When Comcast executives were looking for a new entertainment head Mr Chernin suggested his protgMr Greenblatt orchestrated a turnaround at NBC taking it from last place to first among viewers  to  years old who are prized by advertisers At the network he followed the strategy that he has relied on throughout his career find a differencemaker At Fox it was programming teenfriendly soaps when no one else was doing them At Showtime it was a new twist on the antihero At NBC it was The Voice the uplifting hugin of a show that struck a new note in a genre dominated by the acerbic American Idol And it was not such a big jump from the heartwarming qualities of The Voice to the unapologetically emotional NBC hit This Is UsMr Greenblatt also made live musicals an unexpected force on broadcast television with NBCs productions of The Sound of Music The Wiz Hairspray and Jesus Christ Superstar a winner of five Emmys And he showed off his musical chops at an NBC presentation for advertisers accompanying Ms Parton on piano for a performance of her song I Will Always Love YouWhen Mr Greenblatt left the network last September he had his piano  an  Steinway grand with ivory keys which he bought at age   moved from his NBC office to his home But he wasnt through with show business saying at the time that he would love to run a company Once again his mentor stepped inMr Chernin had a relationship with Mr Stankey and ATTs chief executive Randall Stephenson having worked with them on a joint venture called Otter Media a company ATT bought last yearI know he had conversations with John and Randall about me over the last six months or so Mr Greenblatt said Mr Chernin declined to comment for this storyNow that he has the big job the work begins Mr Greenblatt gave HBOs programming president Casey Bloys a vote of confidence saying he has done an extraordinary job He also pledged to be a friend to the creative programmerNothing is more exciting to me than Whos directing Whos doing it Mr Greenblatt said All of that is very exciting to me and I have no doubt Ill be plugged into all of thatMr Bloys announced last month that HBO would begin rolling out programming on Monday nights an example of the networks expanded slate and beefedup budget Will that plan continueThe Monday night thing I havent thought much about Mr Greenblatt said The scheduling of these networks are always tricky less so in the modern age with streaming platforms and watching things when you want Theres probably too much programming for Sunday and maybe Monday makes senseIn his new role Mr Greenblatt will split his time between HBOs offices

June  which many found unrealistic European leaders agreed to review the arrangement at the end of JuneAt a news conference after a long night of negotiations Donald Tusk the European Council president said the two sides had agreed to what he called a flexible extensionWhat it means Britain will almost certainly have to hold elections for the European Parliament on May   something Mrs May

thinks they can do what we do even though no one has a clue what we do This comment was prompted by a marketing meeting during which we were lauded for glowing review coverage that no reasonable person could attribute to our efforts while simultaneously being asked whether we had tried the Today show Because pitching the Today show is just the kind of thing that would never occur to a book publicistI often revisit my bosss assessment of our world  not as an author myself but as a person who watches an obscene number of shows and movies Hollywoods love affair with book publishing has been long and varied touching every cinematic genre And yet it is a love that dare not spell its name correctly Despite decades of sending emissaries back and forth from coast to coast swapping mediums one side looking for money the other for legitimacy we remain strangers to our cousins in storytellingTo be fair any story set in an industry other than filmmaking is bound to incur infelicities when being handled by people who think filmmaking is the noblest cause However because book publishing is a comparatively niche business the inaccuracies prick the ears Films about publishing put too fine a point on our role as narrative mulch In the romantic comedy The Proposal Sandra Bullock plays a bigshot book editor Early in the film they one imagines a producer consensus being reached have her refer to Don DeLillo as Don Deleelo The actor playing the head of the publishing house echoes the pronunciation back to her Deleelo Light of my airborne toxic event fire of my nuclear war The Proposal was released in  but was apparently filmed in a bunker with no internet access If this sounds nitpicky I might remind you that I was not the one who decided Don DeLillo was famous enough to plop into a major studio scriptMore recently in the charming series Younger Miriam Shor plays Diana Trout the head of marketing at a boutique publishing house Diana has an award on her desk from the London lit fair which absolutely no one calls it As the seasons unfurl the nonsense piles up Someone from publicity asks what PEN stands for editors have publicists publishing houses sell books to other publishing houses authors take editors with them when they switch publishers a small company with a Game of Throneslevel franchise is somehow in constant danger of bankruptcy and members of the editorial staff spew impossible commands like Were on tight launch for the fall  so I will need marketing and cover artwork by the end of this week Have these people met a managing editor Theyd be lucky to walk away with some of their fingersHappily once realism has been pulped like the first print run of a fraudulent memoir the fun can begin In Younger as in Fifty Shades of Grey a woman who looks as if she couldnt legally rent a car is given her own publishing company Joan Didion is allegedly spotted hoarding gift bags theres concern an author will be scooped up by those mouth breathers at Little Brown and the actual host of Bookworm a nationally syndicated radio show grills an author about her sex life Meanwhile the series is not without its flashes of spinechilling verisimilitude Black tie means black tie Diana says before an awards ceremony No color This isnt the GrammysHistorically book publishing works best on film when it functions as a springboard to a different world Fatal Attraction is about a book editor but well is it A childrens book is intentionally printed with pages missing in Elf But well Santa The Last Days of Disco is partially set at a publishing house We easily forgive the films suggestion that one needs a best seller to be promoted to associate editor  in fact the job title is a stopgap a means of promoting an assistant while taking away her overtime  because The Last Days of Disco is not about publishing Its a comedy of manners about New York in the early s not The Last Days of Carbon CopiesFew movies really succeed as both realism and entertainment One is The Scoundrel starring Nol Coward as a pretentious publisher Its filled with jabs like I refuse to make money improving peoples morals its a vulgar way to swindle the public and This anteroom is fairly quivering with outraged geniuses But it was released in  And while plenty of movies and shows since have done well by the actual writing life The Ghost Writer Wonder Boys Bored to Death The Scoundrel is a rare bird The closest approximation of it Ive seen is Wolf  a campy film in which an editor played by Jack Nicholson and a marketing director played by James Spader turn into werewolves as Michelle Pfeiffer looks on blondly Wolf does wonders with the publishing world before it starts howling at the moon The desks are messy the offices are quirky Time Warner is derided as a multinational media conglomerate Nicholson uses his newfound wolf powers to edit without his glasses and a publisher is advised never to stint on review copiesIts rarely said that Hollywood is coming from a good place but in the case of book publishing I believe it is Its skewed depictions often seem careless or condescending but they stem from a healthy desire to superimpose tension No one wants to read about grass growing but what they really dont want to do is watch grass growing So whats a little blackmail between editorsAt least Hollywoods version of book publishing is consistent in its warped ideas Every company is publicly owned and there is zero padding between a junior copy editor and the board or the shareholders And everyones jobs are completely interchangeable So long as you have the capacity to leave the office and come back you can acquire a book start an imprint poach an author triple a budget or sell movie rights the irony You dont have to tell anyone youre doing it either Make like youre in Good Will Hunting Scribble the answers on the chalkboard and runBut by far the strangest and most glaring commonality is the presumption of glamour This stems from a conflation with magazine publishing along with a belief that an audience will tune out unless glitter is sprayed in their eyes Story lines are chockablock with perks like fashion fittings company seats and namebrand coffee Central to the ethos of book publishing is the notion that everything cool is being pushed out nothing cool is coming in This is what binds us publishers and writers alike We try to sneak books into your house and under your pillow We crumble them over your food when youre not looking In return Bupkis Only after youve worked at a publishing house for so many decades you literally cant walk do we let you take an Uber homeSo why does Hollywood keep trying if publishing is such a tough code to crack Perhaps its because everyone likes a challenge More likely its because they know we have a secret They know theres something lasting and human and worldchanging and completely bonkers that were hiding behind our molasseslike culture and confounding royalty statements At the end of The Last Days of Disco after everyones been laid off from their respective industries Chlo Sevignys character is the only one left employed  as an

missile programThe country is now rebuilding the site Sohae Satellite Launching Station  according to American military analysts and South Korean intelligence officials The news came on Tuesday soon after Mr Kim returned from Vietnam following the breakdown of his second meeting with Mr TrumpWhy it matters The renewed activity could indicate that Pyongyang is preparing to end its moratorium on missile tests But South Korean intelligence officials reportedly told lawmakers that North Korea had been rebuilding the facilities even earlier possibly to make their dismantling more dramatic if a deal was reached with the USAbout a quarter of the  million American adults with depression gain little or no benefit from existing treatments That could change with a fastacting prescription nasal

AdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byOn TechnologyBy John HerrmanIn December of last year the Senate Intelligence Committee released two reports it had commissioned concerning Russias efforts to influence the  election The outline of the interference effort has always been easy to make out but key questions about its significance  Could Russia really affect voter sentiment by posting Did trolls really lower voter turnout in key states  are still in large part matters for speculation And the committees findings did little to change thatOn the subject of Facebook for example the reports analyzed new internal data on the campaign efforts of the Internet Research Agency Russias troll farm and offered some examples of its work We know that there were more than  million engagements with content from the Russian group  likes comments shares and clicks  but it is not currently possible to know how many came from real people Since Facebook did not provide data about any sockpuppet accounts involved in the distribution of the content or the existence of fake Likes from these accounts one report says we are operating under the assumption that this engagement was from real people and that this content was pushed into the News Feeds of their Friends as wellThose are two enormous leaps We do not currently know for sure whether these engagements were carried out by humans or bots or a mixture of the two so the researchers were left to assume the worst Its worth scanning other recent Facebook narratives for similar assumptions Did Facebook cause the gilets jaunes protests in France Is the movement a beast born almost entirely from Facebook as a recent BuzzFeed piece suggested Or are the protesters just using Facebook as they sustain a long tradition of civil unrest in FranceThe latter theory is obscured by the basic difficulty of discerning why an individual feels a certain way much less a diverse nation of millions The former however feels as though it has been hidden from us because Facebook should in theory be able to shed light on this question Its users live in a state of full surveillance with them and everything around them subject to neartotal tracking The company is at least capable of knowing how a piece of content found its way from one user to thousands or how a gilets jaunes group functions on the social platform Far more than any outside researchers Facebook is capable of answering questions about the Internet Research Agency in  For example how many of the accounts that interacted with the groups posts went on to interact with other political content Was the audience for these posts even real in the first place or part of the operation itself Both reports criticized tech companies for doing the bare minimum to assist in the committees effortsThe biggest internet platforms are businesses built on asymmetric information They know far more about their advertising labor and commerce marketplaces than do any of the parties participating in them We can guess but cant know why we were shown a friends Facebook post about a divorce instead of anothers about a childs birth We can theorize but wont be told why YouTube thinks we want to see a rightwing polemic about Islam in Europe after watching a video about travel destinations in France Everything that takes place within the platform kingdoms is enabled by systems were told must be kept private in order to function Were living in worlds governed by trade secrets No wonder theyre making us all paranoidThe original sin of our current tech hegemons is that in order to work the rest of the world cant know how they work How does Google trawl the web and produce search results Thats a secret that helped it become the dominant search engine and that sustains its business model How does Facebook choose what comes next in your News Feed How do YouTube recommendations work Too much transparency the defense goes would expose them to reverseengineering or abuse by bad actorsThe technologist Anil Dash recently described some of the internets biggest platform businesses as fake markets These are businesses that purport to be marketplaces making money by connecting parties  people who want rides with drivers advertisers with eyeballs  but are not actually markets in the strict sense of the word Theyre centrally and often assertively managed and manipulated Some hardly resemble markets at all Dash singled out Uber In that market drivers dont set prices consumers dont actually have much choice and resources are allocated by tradesecret algorithms Our ignorance of how such things work is easier to ignore when a platform is establishing itself and sharing the benefits of its growth This dynamic only starts to bother us after a platform wins when there are fewer alternatives or none at allWhen platforms become entrenched and harder for users to leave the secrets they keep are reflected back to them as resentments On Facebook where every users experience is a mystery to all others  and where realworld concepts like privacy obscurity and serendipity have been recreated on the terms of an advertising platform  users understandably imagine that anything could be happening around them that their peers are being indoctrinated tricked sheltered or misled on a host of issues These gaps in knowledge are magnified once a platform becomes involved in realworld events Twitter is broadly understood to be a catalytic political force but this understanding is usually half hunch  its relationship to the Arab Spring is still in dispute its usefulness to Donald Trump will never be fully understood and Twitter seems to be in no hurry to help figure it out Similarly Is YouTube reflecting a rise in reactionary politics enabling it or creating it These are already impossible questions to answer in full that everything is unfolding inside of a closely guarded attention marketplace makes them difficult to even approachSo did Facebook cause the gilets jaunes uprising in France Maybe interesting theory meanwhile though I dont even know why its recommending I friend someone Ive never heard of Did Facebook swing the  election Could have as far as we know anyway I cant even guess why Instagram started showing me a bunch of photos of a certain breed of dog or why its suddenly serving me ads for meal kits I know how these things make me feel but Facebook knows how they made me behave  knowledge it wont soon shareIt appears to be the tendency of the press and of our imaginations in general to extend these theories in a particular direction After years of Facebooks telling us how good it is at connecting people and influencing their decisions it is tempting to say something like Yes OK then wouldnt it have been easy to use these same tools to persuade people to vote for Donald Trump Facebook has equivocated on this question in a telling way Its helpful to imagine what it would have to say to successfully combat claims Russia used its platform to swing the election Sure this many users saw propaganda but only for a moment and besides this content didnt seem to affect their behavior in any way at all sure this amount of money was spent on ads but those ads dont appear to have done anything yes these Instagram accounts had that many followers but more than half of them were bots themselves OK  million people were exposed to this content in some way or another but they mostly glossed over it like spamTheyve inched tellingly in this direction but going all the way would involve unflattering disclosure  the sort that would need to be legally compelled Mainly it would be tantamount to admitting that the systems were not allowed to know about  and the metrics we arent allowed to see  might not be quite as valuable or as worthy of trade secrecy as Facebook needs us to think they are While its true that perceptions of the tech industry have shifted they arent necessarily closer to reality These companies mythologized their own omniscience when it was a boon to their business Versions of these myths persist but theyre no longer under their creators control  and theyre starting to bite backJohn Herrman is a technology reporter for The TimesAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byThe food writers Matt Lee and Ted Lee took jobs with a highend New York caterer for a book that explores this littleunderstood but hugely influential businessBy Kim SeversonOne June night in  the foodwriting brothers Matt and Ted Lee showed up to support a fellow Southerner who was cooking at the James Beard HouseThe s brick townhouse in Greenwich Village where Beard once lived is a showplace for chefs looking for validation from the foundation that runs it But its a notoriously stressful place to cook The kitchen is hot and small with limited access for prepping food If you screw up in front of the influential guests a shot at a national reputation can be dashed before dessert is servedTheir friend the chef Steven Satterfield of Miller Union restaurant in Atlanta had to knock out  servings each of sauted quail and braised oxtail crpinette delicate dishes that can overcook in a minute So he enlisted help from three of the best catering cooks in the city As the Lee brothers watched they unzipped their backpacks unrolled the dish towels that held their knives and attacked the kitchen like Navy SEALs swarming a ship commandeered by Somali piratesLater that night over drinks the catering cooks said the dinner had been as easy as rolling out of bed Try cooking  lamb chops to a perfect mediumrare at the same time using nothing but sheet pans Sterno and an upright aluminum cabinet on wheels called a hot boxLearn how to talk like a catererThe Lees who until that point considered catering the elevator music of the culinary arts found themselves falling into a rabbit hole that would consume them for the next four yearsThey went undercover as catering cooks and their dive into the world of mercenaries who work the fanciest parties in town has produced the new book Hotbox Inside Catering the Food Worlds Riskiest Business Henry Holt  Company  Its a revelatory detailrich and often breathless examination of a cutthroat world where the demanding clients include billionaires and celebrity brides but the cooking conditions resemble a mobile Army hospitalThe subject is a ripe one A  billiondollarayear industry in the United States catering is rarely examined by food journalists or considered by diners who are more focused on restaurants Its influence is quiet but powerful If youve ever had a miniature lobster roll or sipped soup from a shot glass at a party or attended a popup dinner you can thank a catererNowhere is catering practiced with as much cunning and challenge as in New York City On any given week  and especially during the wedding and gala seasons  hundreds of thousands of people eat food cooked by caterersSometimes the meals are as lowstakes as a snack between sessions at a mindnumbing conference Other times a badly prepared aplate meal can hurt a charity that hoped to open wallets over short ribs with horseradish creamIts astonishing that the business doesnt get the attention or respect afforded restaurants the Lees write considering all that these catering chefs are up against and regularly conquer  their nerverattling tightrope sprints through Alist celebrity territory the exquisite food torture a seasons worth of MacGyvery kitchen rescues that throw propriety food safety and convention out the door because we have to make this work right nowThe book is a departure for the Lee brothers whose previous titles have been cookbooks and whose other ventures include a Southernfoodofthemonth club television work and since  a bespoke catering business in partnership with Duvall an event planner in Charleston SC where the two grew upTed Lee  lives in Brooklyn with his wife the artist EV Day Matt Lee  is raising three sons in Charleston with his wife Gia Lee a schoolteacher and realestate agentIn some ways the brothers were primed for the task From  to  they wrote a column for The New York Times Magazine called The Industry in which they spent time with produce buyers cake movers and other unsung restaurant workersHotbox was also a chance to get off the cookbook conveyor beltWe were at a pivot point Ted Lee said How much more does the world need to hear from two white guys who grew up in Charleston in the s about how they cookTo immerse themselves in the catering business they persuaded Patrick Phelan then the executive chef of the upscale New York caterer Sonnier  Castle and one of the chefs who swooped in to help Mr Satterfield to hire themTaking turns they worked for  an hour in the prep kitchen or for  an hour during the event  what in catering parlance is called the fiesta shift when time is a cruel overlord and small mistakes have huge implicationsThe book explores their struggles to build  peppercrusted beefonbrioche snacks with celery root salad for the Park Avenue Armory gala in  or peel  hardboiled eggs to help Royal Caribbean cruises introduce a new line of restaurants to  guests They handed hot Cafe du Monde beignets to Nancy Pelosi before she became speaker of the House and grilled hot dogs to Martha Stewart at a  million Labor Day party in the HamptonsThe brothers became enamored of the tricks of the trade which insiders refer to as sheetpan magic Did someone forget the colanders back at the main kitchen Use a ballpoint pen to punch holes in the bottom of an aluminum foil pan In a pinch two metal hangers from the coat check can be fashioned into a whiskCommandeer a woven bread basket if you cant find any other way to dust  chocolate mousse cups with powdered sugar And if a drunken uncles wedding speech is dragging on too long youd better figure out a way to keep the salmon warm without overcooking itTheir teachers through much of the journey were Jorge and Juan Soto brothers from Mexico whom they met that night at the Beard House The Sotos are masters of the hot box the wheeled cabinet with racks perfectly sized to hold sheet pans that is the secret to New York cateringThe boxes are meant to transport food not cook it But in New York which restricts the use of propane and open flame the boxes are deployed as bootleg ovens With enough cans of Sterno and strategically placed sheet pans a good catering chef can bring hundreds of rare filets mignons that had been browned in a deepfat fryer back at the prep kitchen to temperature in a back room at the New York Public Library or the Whitney Museum of American ArtConversely fill a tray with dry ice and the box can become an instant refrigeratorIts an insanely analog system they write a bit like piloting a hot air balloon but its ruthlessly efficient selfcontained safe scalable and costeffective to runThe Lees credit JeanClaude Ndlec with inventing the hotbox system Mr Ndlec developed it and other essential pieces of offsite catering stagecraft when he was the banquet chef at the Plaza Hotel in the s He went on to become the executive chef at Glorious Food a catering company that started in an apartment on th Street in the s and dominated New York catering for two decades But it was Donald Bruce White  a former Broadway actor who began his food career as a bit player on Josies Kitchen a local cooking show that predated Julia Childs The French Chef  who created the citys modern catering industry in  the Lees reportIn what seems a foreshadowing of Uber Eats Mr White started delivering sameday meals ordered by telephone Soon he was directing entire parties in Park Avenue apartmentsBy the s New York was a city that loved catering Martha Stewart jumped into the game as did the powerhouse caterer Liz Neumark of Great PerformancesBy the s caterers had become fullfledged event planners and their parties were as flashy as the decade Charities began to use galas as fundraising opportunities Institutions like the Metropolitan Opera realized there was money to be made renting out space for lavish events Casting cater waiters became an industry unto itselfBy the s a new age of restaurant culture had dawned and catering customers were demanding restaurantquality food Chefs like Daniel Boulud jumped into the game but plenty of others realized it was one they didnt like playingThe way that a caterer thinks about feeding people in a large group setting is not the same as the way a chef thinks about it Mr Satterfield said in an interview You need that catering mindThe chef Bobby Flay told the Lees that when he opened a catering division of his Mesa Grill restaurant group around  it was the worst year of my lifeThe Instagram era has brought a new level of performance to catered food with meringues floating through parties suspended under white balloons and waiters pedaling raw bars fashioned from wheelbarrows and bicycles Tech and finance billionaires have raised the ante too One client the Lee brothers report regularly pays a young caterer to smuggle poulet de Bresse chickens from Paris on a Gulfstream jet at  a tripIts also an era of ultracustomization which is the antithesis of catering Couples dont want a traditional fairytale wedding they want a tale thats never been told the Lees write Caterers are handed elaborate and often confusing menus that are meaningful to the couple but daunting to executeThe biggest headaches for modern caterers the brothers posit are food preferences and intolerances dressed in foodallergy drag The elaborate assemblyline system designed to deliver hundreds of perfect plates in a minute window is getting gummed up with special requests Waiters face a barrage of questions from guests who want to know whether the main course contains soy or nightshades or if the vegetarian option is laced with dairyEvery clever caterer nowadays packs a pile of washed salad greens a soyfree dressing and a sheet pan of drygrilled vegetables for occasions when its just impossible to make that one person happy they writeA nice side effect of the brothers time in the trenches is that they have become better home cooks Throwing a dinner party for  once a stressful proposition is a breezeTheir kitchens are better organized before and during a party and theyve started using the building blocks of a good catering kitchen square stackable Cambro containers and small plastic deli tubs Theyve also become more comfortable making food ahead of time and dont worry about whether its kept at the absolute safest temperatureWe are so much more confident now because weve seen whats possible on a huge scale Matt Lee saidAnd theyve become better guests at catered events When the cocktail hour ends and the chime rings for everyone to take their seats they doWhen the service captain tells you sit stop talking and sit Ted Lee said Its critical The quality of the

the drug they want then enter some personal health and credit card information A doctor then assesses their choice with no inperson consultation If approved the medicine arrives in the mail days or weeks laterThe sites invert the usual practice of medicine by turning the act of prescribing drugs into a service Instead of doctors making diagnoses and then suggesting treatments patients request drugs and physicians serve largely as gatekeepersSome of these companies operate in a regulatory vacuum that could increase public health risks according to interviews with physicians former federal health regulators and legal experts And federal and state health laws written to ensure competent medical care and drug safety have not kept pace with online services they sayIts restaurantmenu medicine said Arthur L Caplan a medical ethics professor at New York University School of MedicineAfter answering questions online two reporters for The New York Times in California gained approval for generic Viagra prescriptions through Roman and Hims a site run by the same startup that owns the Hers site A third Times reporter ordered Addyi the libido drug through HersWhether the sites screening processes are sufficient is open to interpretation This year a doctor in California who had prescribed Viagra online through a site called KwikMedcom surrendered his medical license after the states medical board accused him of failing to provide standard medical care like examining the patient and taking vital signsSome startups like Kick Health sell blood pressure pills or other prescription drugs for unapproved uses like calming the symptoms of performance anxietyOne drug Addyi which can cause fainting if taken with alcohol arrived without the necessary safety warning protocols created by the drugs manufacturerMuch like Uber which argues that it is not a transportation company even as it connects drivers and passengers the drug sites argue that they are tech platforms not health providers The sites connect consumers  and often process their payments  to doctors who may prescribe drugs and pharmacies that can ship the medicationsTo comply with state laws the doctors work for separate companies that cater to the sites The doctors are typically paid for each health consultation or by the hour not the number of prescriptions written The sites generate revenue for themselves by charging service or processing fees to consumers the doctors or bothKick Roman and Hims each said they complied with laws and did not influence the doctors prescribing decisionsZachariah Reitano the chief executive of Ro the owner of Roman said his site encouraged people to tend to their health who might not otherwise have done soIt provides more convenient higherquality more affordable care for certain conditions and saves people a lot of time and energy Mr Reitano saidJustin Ip the chief executive of Kick said his company was trying to be careful and cautious about complying with health laws He added that federal marketing restrictions on drug makers did not apply to his companyFederal drug marketing rules apply to drug manufacturers drug distributors packers and their representatives Whether the consumer drug sites fall into any of those categories is an unsettled question And there is no single federal or state agency in charge of overseeing online prescription drug servicesWhere are the regulatory agencies in this asked Dr C Neill Epperson a womens behavioral health expert at the University of Colorado School of Medicine How can this just be OKThe new wave of sites that market drugs directly to consumers began popping up several years ago promising to streamline medical care with softwareSeveral gained traction with cheeky TV commercials billboard ads and social media feeds featuring sexual imagery like cactuses They use slick packaging wrapping doses of Viagra in condomsize envelopes or sending chocolate along with birth control pillsThe premise is so attractive to investors that Hims and Ro have raised nearly  million each They have also tapped experts for advice including Dr Joycelyn Elders a former surgeon general who is a medical adviser to Ro and mens health specialists at leading hospitalsDr Elders said she had signed on to advise Ro to promote accurate information about sexual healthNurx a San Francisco startup that markets contraceptives for women has raised more than  million Keeps a hair loss treatment site for men is based in New York and has raised nearly  millionWe believe this is a radical new way of providing care  by changing unstructured interactions into structured care by shifting work from MDs to algorithms where possible Andy Weissman a managing partner at Union Square Ventures wrote in a blog post in  after his firm led an investment round in NurxFor people who get nervous before public speaking there is Kick a San Francisco startup that operates in  states The site offers consumers a blood pressure drug  propranolol to calm a racing heart and shaking handsBut the sites home page did not disclose that the medication was not federally approved to treat anxiety In fact it suggested the opposite FDA approved prescriptions tailored to you the home page saidAfter queries from a reporter the site added a sentence on a drug information page noting that prescribing propranolol for anxiety was offlabel  or not federally approvedThe Food and Drug Administration generally prohibits pharmaceutical companies from marketing medicines for unapproved uses as they have not been federally vetted for safety and effectiveness Over the last decade Pfizer and Johnson  Johnson have each paid fines of more than  billion to settle government charges of illegally marketing unapproved drug usesDoctors are permitted to practice medicine as they see fit including prescribing drugs for unapproved uses Mr Ip of Kick noted that doctors regularly prescribed propranolol to treat anxietyBut state and professional ethical standards typically require doctors to establish relationships with new patients and examine them before prescribing a drug The interactions with physicians through the sites can be quite limitedAfter submitting the information to Hims and being charged a reporter received a message from a doctor saying he was a good candidate for erectile dysfunction treatment and asking if he had any questions The reporter had no questions and ordered the drugRoman Hims and Kick each said they designed their systems to ask the questions doctors would ask of new patients The companies said the questions changed based on a persons previous answers allowing for individualized diagnoses The companies use algorithms to flag or weed out people with medical conditions like high blood pressure that could make certain prescriptions inappropriateSome states specifically prohibit doctors from relying solely on online questionnaires to prescribe drugs to new patients Hims Kick and Roman said their processes were interactive and should not be considered questionnairesIn Ohio state regulators said doctors must  at a minimum  communicate with patients in real time through audio or video to meet their standardsBut Spence Bailey of Columbus Ohio said he had never spoken to a doctor by phone or on video when ordering hair loss medication from Hims communicating only through the sites messaging systemHe said he was satisfied but canceled his monthly subscription because it was too expensiveHims said it complied with state medical board rulesOn some sites it can be unclear who is reviewing consumers health data and prescribing the drugsA reporter in California who requested generic Viagra through Roman received a message from a doctor including his name and a link to a page listing his medical school qualifications and state licensesBut a different reporter in California who requested generic Viagra through Hims received a message without a doctors nameAfter being asked about the interaction by a Times reporter the company said it had changed its software to require doctors to include their medical credentials on such messagesA week or two after reporters were approved for prescriptions the medications arrived in discreet packagesA shipment of the Addyi libido pills from Postmeds a pharmacy based in Hayward Calif came with a colorful usage guide Its time to get busy the guide saidThe Hers questionnaire as well as an online message from the doctor had explicitly warned about fainting risks that can arise from taking the drugs with alcohol But the usage guide made no mention of it That potential danger was included only in the required FDA information insert printed in a tiny typefacePharmacists dispensing Addyi must counsel all patients on the need to avoid alcohol with every prescription according to protocols created by Sprout Pharmaceuticals the drugs manufacturerInstead the pills came with a card providing a phone number for a drug consultation with PostmedsThe idea here is that there must be an added layer of professional counseling said Ned Milenkovich a pharmacist and lawyer with the firm Much Shelist in ChicagoCindy Eckert Sprouts chief executive referred questions to Hers and the pharmacies it uses Hers referred questions to Postmeds Umar Afridi Postmeds chief executive said the required medical insert contained the alcohol warning satisfying the counseling requirementsThe startups have stayed under the regulatory radar partly by arguing that they are not health providers But the lines between the companies and the entities handling the prescribing can blurRos terms of use policy says that another company Roman Pennsylvania Medical provides the sites doctors And Mr Reitano Ros chief executive said the startups clinical directors and the owners of the physician company did not hold equity in RoBut Roman Pennsylvania has the same address in New York as Ro according to business registration documents Its president Dr Tzvi Doron is a Ro clinical directorKeeps the hairloss site also has links to a physician corporation KMG Medical Group that supplies doctors to its users Steven Gutentag Keepss chief executive said that KMG was an independent corporation and that Keeps did not control the doctors decisionsBut the two entities are closely related Keepss customers pay KMG Medical Group for their doctor consultations and KMG pays Keepss parent company Thirty Madison for the patient software it uses and other business servicesThen there is Dr Michael Demetrius Karagas a Texas physician who is KMG Medical Groups owner He too has close ties to Keeps He is the father of one of its cofounders Demetri Michael Karagas Dr Karagas did not respond to requests for commentMike Isaac Jack Nicas and Tess Riski contributed reportingAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byBy Winnie HuWhat you need to know to start the day Get New York Today in your inboxLos Angeles traffic is so bad that buses crawl along at less than  miles an hour In San Francisco car speeds have fallen to  miles per hour And Seattles streets are so choked the city needs to find ways to have fewer cars altogetherMajor cities across the United States are facing increasingly clogged roads and have had frustratingly little success in dealing with them But now that New York has adopted congestion pricing in Manhattan the rest of the country is far more likely to seriously consider embracing such a policy  even though it was once considered politically toxic according to municipal officials and transportation analystsNew Yorks use of congestion pricing could be a gamechanger said Travis Brouwer an assistant transportation director in Oregon which has considered congestion pricing for trafficjammed PortlandIf New York City can prove that congestion pricing can work and gain public acceptance it could give cities like Portland a boost as we look to introduce pricingNew York the countrys largest city will charge drivers to enter Manhattans most congested neighborhoods as a way to raise money for public transit and to persuade people to abandon their cars The tolls are expected to start in Philadelphia is now considering congestion pricing for the first time closely watching New Yorks move to see how this can help improve equity safety sustainability and mobility said Kelly Cofrancisco a spokeswoman for Philadelphias mayor Jim KenneyLos Angeles and San Francisco are already conducting studies to lay the groundwork for congestion pricing and Seattles mayor Jenny Durkan is leading efforts to have congestion pricing in place by the end of her first term in It really does help to be able to point to some peer city and say Theyre doing this and its working said Michael Manville an associate professor of urban planning at The University of California Los Angeles who has advised Los Angeles on congestion pricing At the very least it changes the conversation in other citiesNot everyone is ready to sign up Kathryn Barger a Los Angeles county supervisor has raised concerns that congestion pricing could unfairly penalize drivers in communities with limited public transit where driving isnt a choice its a necessityA handful of cities in Europe and Asia already have congestion pricing in place it has helped clear roads in London Stockholm and Singapore But it has also been assailed by drivers and critics as an unfair tax that hurts the poorFueled by an economic boom a revival of urban areas a proliferation of Uber and Lyft cars and an explosive growth in package deliveries propelled by the rise of Amazon the average speed in urban downtowns fell to  miles per hour last year down from  miles per hour in  according to INRIX a transportation analytics companyI believe the time has finally arrived to explore congestion relief pricing in major cities said Phil Washington the chief executive of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority Here in Los Angeles our congestion challenges are just as bad if not worse than ManhattansHe added We cannot sit idly by and watch it get worseIn New York many details of a congestion pricing plan  including how much drivers will be charged  are still being worked out The plan was the culmination of a campaign that started  months ago and drew transit groups as well as prominent business civic and labor leaders who saw no other way to tackle gridlockGov Andrew M Cuomo staked his name on it and wielded his political power to push it forward making it a centerpiece of the  billion state budget after past efforts had unraveled Even Mayor Bill de Blasio who had been lukewarm about congestion pricing and has had a frosty relationship with the governor threw his support behind it They had made the case that it was crucial for raising the money needed to modernize the citys crumbling subway systemAnd city transit officials facing a growing financial crisis warned repeatedly that the alternative would be huge fare increasesCongestion pricings moment follows decades of failed efforts to unclog roads around the country Historically cities responded to congestion by building more roads or widening existing ones  only to find that those too became jammed said Matthew Turner an economics professor at Brown UniversityAs a result Americas roads are carrying more traffic than ever The number of people driving to work climbed to about  million in  up from  million in  according to an analysis of census data by Social Explorer a research company Of those more than  million drove alone and only  million carpooled Just  million workers took public transportationThe increasing traffic has been accompanied by concerns over health safety and environmental implications The number of pedestrians killed in traffic in the United States is approaching a threedecade highTraffic woes have emerged as the underside of successful cities The boom leads to an influx of new residents businesses and construction More than two dozen major American cities including New York Boston Philadelphia Austin Los Angeles San Francisco and Seattle have more congestion now than a decade ago according to an annual global traffic scorecard by INRIXThe most recent scorecard found that congestion left American drivers sitting in traffic an average of  hours last year up from  hours in  That in turn cost the economy roughly  billion in lost productivity last year up from  billion in  according to INRIXIt only takes one car that doesnt get through an intersection to block two lanes of traffic said Trevor Reed an INRIX transportation analystIn Seattle Amazons relentless rise has helped to turn the city into a major tech hub Now major infrastructure and development projects are expected to lead to even more gridlockAs we build a city of the future we must reduce our reliance on cars Ms Durkan said My goal is to make our downtown core a healthier place for all with fewer cars a more equitable transportation system and less climate pollutionRoad pricing has been used on some American highways since the s with tolled express lanes  or socalled Lexus lanes  built alongside regular lanes offering a faster alternative to drivers who are willing to pay for itCities are trying to figure out how to make it work on streets Theres a critical mass forming where people are saying enough is enough said Stuart Cohen the founding director of TransForm a Californiabased group that released a recent report on congestion pricing Theyve tried everything else and nothings workingStill Charles Komanoff a New York economist whose models were used to develop the congestion pricing plan said the idea of putting a price on driving clashes with Americas carloving culture in which driving wherever the road may lead is often seen as the ultimate freedom He compared pushing congestion pricing forward to shooting a rocket to the moon Theres so much gravity  the forces opposing this are so powerful  it almost seems like defying nature he saidOregon looked at congestion pricing in  but our traffic wasnt that bad so people werent willing to pay a toll to escape it Mr Brouwer said But Portland has been gripped by congestion as Amazon and others have opened offices State officials are seeking federal approval for what would be the states first highway tolls on a sevenmile stretch through PortlandCongestion pricing has also been seen as a burden on drivers who are poor and have been displaced from downtown areas by rising housing costs and now must drive to work because of minimal access to public transitSocial equity was the conversation stopper when it came to congestion pricing Mr Cohen said In West Coast cities equity is very high on the political agendaBut Mr Cohen said gridlock also slows down the bus and transit services many poor people depend on Congestion fees he added can be discounted or subsidized for impoverished driversIn Los Angeles public buses traveled at an average of  miles per hour last year down from  miles per hour in  according to transit data Mr Washington said he wanted to use the congestion fees to pay for transit improvements and to cover fares so that everyone can ride freeA spokeswoman for Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles said he has supported looking at congestion pricing because it has the promise to dramatically reduce traffic and improve quality of lifeStill congestion pricing remains a tough sell After a recent report by Boston leaders and educators that recommended charging  to drive in some neighborhoods Bostons mayors office said the city would not be implementing congestion pricingIn New York drivers would be charged for entering Manhattan below th Street where the average speed for vehicles is down to  miles per hour from  miles per hour in John Corlett a lobbyist for AAA in New York said the new fees could shift gridlock to other parts of the city if drivers bypass the central business district to avoid tolls To say this is going to reduce congestion may be a false hope he saidBut Sam Schwartz an architect of the citys congestion pricing plan said he had received calls from officials and others in more than a dozen cities that have been monitoring New Yorks progress If you can do it in New York you can do it anywhere he saidSan Francisco is considering congestion pricing after trying other options to combat gridlock downtown including expanded bus and rail service installing dedicated transit lanes and added bike routes said Tilly Chang executive director of the San Francisco County Transportation Authority which is leading the citys congestion pricing effortEveryone agrees theres a problem Ms Chang

Patriots will sustain this weekendGail Collins My husband is from Boston and we have learned from being a Patriots household in New York what it means to be truly ostracized There are probably more Republicans in our Upper West Side neighborhood than there are Patriots fansIm not normally a sports person But Donald Trump has educated me in their big plus Whenever things are terrible in the rest of the world you can just talk with your friends or neighbors or relatives about who the best quarterback is Or how the Mets will do this year Its a very unifying conceptBret And speaking of crushing defeats thats a fairly good description of what Trump has just sustained in his shutdown showdown with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer As a purely political matter do you think he can recoverGail Im almost finished writing a book on the history of older women in America and it is really a treat to watch Nancy Pelosi wiping the floor with Donald Trump Id be happy to see any reasonably progressive reasonably sane politician doing the job but this particular saga really tickles meBret This is a good moment to admit that I was totally mistaken about Pelosi I thought her election as speaker would play into Trumps hands because he would lampoon her as the quintessential leftcoast liberal elitist Instead she wasted no time cutting his er fingers offGail Have you noticed that hes terrible even at the things he was supposed to be good at during his cheesy reality show period like making deals and firing peopleHes toast Do you agreeBret Anyone who survives a halfdozen bankruptcies and goes on to win the presidency should never be written offGail Sigh Good pointBret Trump is a master of inventing new dramas to make us forget the old ones And if unemployment and growth figures remain good a year from now hell still have a powerful argument for a second termThat said Trumps hopes of being reelected depend on his appeal to his base and his base support is eroding A poll from earlier this month has him down a net of  points with Republicans down  with white evangelicals and down  with suburban men If I were looking at those numbers as the head of the Republican National Committee Id be thinking that Trump would be wise to declare that he wont run for reelection Whether he would do that is of course another question entirelyGail Well youre presuming he has a life outside of thisBret Depends on his legal jeopardy I guessGail If the jeopardy level is high enough hed need to run again just because you cant indict a sitting president I for one do not want to imagine a  campaign in which the base believes hes a martyr who has to be saved from imprisonmentBret Maybe Bob Mueller can offer him immunity if he promises not to run OK now Im dreamingGail Were both trapped in an antiTrumpian vortex where we agree about so much but I know that deep down youre a serious conservative particularly on economic issues So I want to ask about  oh God DavosBret God is of no use in Davos Gail Go onGail Davos as you may have heard is an annual gathering in Switzerland where the economic and political elite come to have dinners and chat and pontificate This year there were two things that interested me One was that Anthony Scaramucci was there This is the guy who lasted  days as White House communications director appeared as a contestant on Celebrity Big Brother and then vanished from the series to reappear at DavosI truly believe that reality TV is a thermometer of our cultural mindset Maybe the Mooch connection is proof that Davos is indeed a magnet for the best and the brightestBret My longheld view of Davos is that nothing good that happens there is real and nothing real that happens there is good The Moochs presence this year proves both those points Go onGail One big topic was what happens to working people when automation takes over the world Dont care so much what the Davosians thought as I do about your opinion You wrote a really powerful column the other day about socialism ruining Venezuela But I dont see how capitalism survives a technoboom where automation puts half the population out of work ThoughtsBret Im not too worried Capitalism survived the transition from horseandbuggy to the Model T It survived the transition from an agricultural economy to a manufacturing economy to a servicebased one And it survived the creative destruction of countless other forms of employment Where for instance are the typesetters these daysGail Well theyre not creating hot new social media sitesBret Now the question everyone is asking is what will happen to all those truck and cab and Uber drivers  a total of three million professional drivers  once driverless cars become ubiquitous Theres no doubt the transition will be painful for some of them and policymakers need to be sensitive on that point But if history is any guide things will work out Many of those drivers will find work in industries that currently dont exist Just ask yourself where was the mobile apps economy at the turn of the century Where was the internet economy in  or the personal computing industry in Gail I still dont see the truck drivers working on mobile apps And if youre worried about the lefts solutions I dont see a whole lot of candidates running around talking about the state taking over the means of productionBret Just wait an election cycle or twoGail But if were moving to an economy in which trucks are automated robots do all the warehouse work and some kind of artificial intelligence is taking orders at the restaurant well need a government that can create a whole lot of useful public service employment to make up the differenceBret Heaven forfendGail And underwrite free college education for everybody who needs itBret NoGail And assure lowermiddleclass people decent housingBret My soul is dyingGail All of which would have to be paid for by large taxes on the very richBret Now its deadGail Thats one area where Alexandria OcasioCortez makes a lot of senseBret And buriedGail I love it when we have a real argumentBret You know I was going to change the topic to Roger Stone where wed be nodding our heads in unison But lets explore our disagreements a bit moreGail Yeah I suspect we are in accord about Roger Stone career political con man and threatener of small fluffy service dogs So back to good government Bret Im all for universities figuring out ways to become more affordable for those who need and deserve it but making college free for everybody makes it bad for everybody We would wreck a university system thats still the envy of the worldGail Ahem I believe I said free college for everybody who needs it And happy to have vigorous government oversight Employing talented Americans tossed out of their old jobs by robot accountantsBut continue with your verbal shudder Bret As for affordable housing Id sooner trust the invisible hand of the market than the heavy hand of the state Large taxes on the very rich wont raise the kind of income you need and sooner rather than later those taxes will land on the decidedly less rich And AOC should start mastering her facts rather than getting into Twitter wars with fact checkersGail Hehehe Knew Id get you with AOC Thats what people love about herThe weather is lousy Bret but Im seeing a little bit of sunshine The governments running for the moment Nancy Pelosi knocked down Donald Trumps wall plans Roger Stone is indicted and the Mueller investigation is chugging right along Now lets raise some taxes and build some bridgesBret I was with you until you mentioned taxes Purely theoretical question for you and our readers for our next conversation If Congress would agree to cut the top marginal rate to  percent in exchange for a pledge by Trump not to

sources to get back to herHow do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives Li Yuan a technology columnist in Hong Kong discussed the tech shes usingYou write about Chinese tech What tech tools do you rely on to do your job and what do you like about themIts not an exaggeration to say I live in and work on WeChat the messaging app thats the equivalent of WhatsApp plus Facebook plus PayPal plus Uber plus GrubHub plus many other things As my iPhone battery use record shows I spend about onethird of my daily ninehour phone time on WeChat That doesnt include the two to three hours I use WeChats web versionIm not alone in my heavy WeChat use There are  million internet users in China but over one billion WeChat accounts Just about every Chinese online has at least one account and some more than one Over onethird of them spend four hours or more on the app each day The prevalence has made WeChat an indispensable part of many peoples lives and work Two years ago I met two people who refused to use WeChat and I thought about writing a story about how people like them navigated work and life Before I got around to it both became my WeChat friendsSo as a journalist I have to hang out on WeChat I message and call my sources on WeChat I keep an eye on WeChat Moment which is similar to Facebook Timeline and group chats so Ill always be on top of whats going on in China When others pretend they are too busy to get back to me I comment on their Moment posts and group chats to tell them that I know they arent so busyBy now some readers must be screaming How about the censorship and government surveillance on WeChat Sadly its just the way of life in China Im not trying to make light of the issue Ive been very critical of how the tech companies work with the government to censor and monitor the Chinese public But the reality is that ordinary Chinese often feel powerless and fatalistic when it comes to censorship and surveillance Ive tried to persuade people to get on encrypted messaging apps such as Signal and WhatsApp but havent had much success I also use Weibo the Chinese equivalent of Twitter I used to be an active Weibo user and still have a few million followers there But after the government cracked down on Weibo a few years ago and shut down many of the most provocative and influential accounts I dont use it too often because the conversations are often dominated by celebrity news instead of discussions of current affairs But Weibo is still a good place to check out the hottest topics and trends Thats where I found people to talk to for a column I wrote about the generation that grew up without Google Facebook or TwitterHow do people in China use tech differently compared with people in the United StatesThe first thing many visitors to China notice is how mobile the Chinese are Many Chinese never owned a laptop or a PC and their first computer was their smartphone Email never really took off in China Some big corporations do use it But people usually resort to WeChat for a quick responseBecause of WeChats prevalence few Chinese carry business cards any more At many meetings in China theres a time when everybody takes out his or her phone and scans the WeChat QR codes of others to become friends I personally like having contacts on WeChat rather than on business cards Because its a social media platform you learn about your contacts as individuals beyond their business titlesMany businesspeople I know have two or more WeChat accounts because WeChat allows only  contacts for one account A young venture capitalist told me that it had taken him only two years to reach the limit I dont know how they manage so many contactsGenerally Chinese are more receptive to new things and more tolerant of imperfect products including mobile apps Some commentators here say Facebook is almost a Chinese company because of its move fast and break things mantra Many people in Chinas internet industry work superlong hours to make sure they beat competitors to roll out new features firstWhy are mobile wallets so popular in ChinaWhen I moved from New York to Beijing in  China was still a cashbased nation Not many people had credit cards and it wasnt easy for small businesses to get approval to install the machines I used to have to go to the ATMs all the time Going to the banks mostly giant stateowned enterprises was torturously timeconsuming Then came WeChat Pay and Alipay the mobile payment services from Tencent and Alibaba Since so many Chinese were already on WeChat and were trained to scan QR codes it took the two giants only some cashbonus campaigns at grocery stores to convert people like my mom to mobile paymentsMobile pay is now available in almost every place I visit in China including small towns Ive been carrying a yuan  bill in my wallet for months but havent found an occasion to use it Everybody  hotels department stores taxi drivers noodle stands  takes Alipay or WeChat Pay or both Even tollbooths accept mobile payment What are some hot new apps tech products or internet services in ChinaThe hottest app is a short video service Douyin which is called TikTok outside China As my colleague Kevin Roose aptly put it in a recent column its a quirky hybrid of Snapchat the defunct video app Vine and the TV segment Carpool KaraokeTo be honest Im too old for the app  Douyin targets urban teenagers and somethings  and have not spent much time on it But Ive seen some viral Douyin videos on Weibo and WeChat that are fun and goofy Some young Chinese told me that they spend hours watching Douyin videos every day which I would argue is the downside of the app Its parent company Bytedance is very good at using artificial intelligence to push content based on users viewing historyThe short video app that I check out from time to time is Douyins rival Kwai Kwai is popular in small towns and the countryside You can watch young people chasing geese and getting married in white gowns in front of mud houses I call Kwai the Hillbilly Elegy of China Its where you can get a flavor of what China is like outside the biggest coastal citiesOutside of work what tech product are you into right now Im a very lowtech person While my iPhone feels like an extension of my left arm I dont use many other electronics I didnt own a TV until a year ago and only watch Netflix sometimes I bought a microwave this year and its the simplest model because I knew I would use it only to reheat foodMy biggest tech wish is for Google Facebook Apple or another company to build a technology that can break the Great Firewall the system of filters and blocks that prevents Chinese from visiting thousands of foreign websites Instead of kowtowing to the Chinese governments demands in order to gain access to the market American tech giants could do something heroic Liberate hundreds of millions of people from information darknessAdvertisementAdvertisement

Amazon may be pulling the plug on its Queens campus but New York Citys tech boom is likely to endureLong before Amazon announced that New York had won a share of its secondheadquarters sweepstakes tech was a rising force in the local economy Google which already has thousands of workers in New York plans to double its work force in the city and build a  billion campus just south of the West Village Facebook Apple Uber and other companies are also expanding their presences as is a rising generation of homegrown companiesEven Amazon itself said Thursday that it planned to keep adding to

of the Real Estate Board of New York The geography of where these companies are its not just Midtown South or Meatpacking Its downtown its Midtown East its going to Brooklyn its going to QueensIn terms of raw economic power Wall Street still dominates Its workers earn more than  a year on average close to three times as much as tech workers As a result the finance sector accounts for a huge share of city and state tax revenue and wields disproportionate political power of payWall StreetTech sector of payWall StreetTech sectorMayors dating back to David Dinkins in the early s have sought to make the city less vulnerable to the booms and busts of finance Those efforts accelerated after the  financial crisis which wiped out thousands of jobs on Wall Street Techs rapid expansion came at an auspicious time helping the city rebound much faster than many experts had predictedThere was a wide consensus that New York City needed to diversify its economy to add balance beyond Wall Street said Jonathan Bowles executive director of the Center for an Urban Future a New Yorkfocused think tank I really think that tech has finally allowed New York to do thatNew York has never been a

tech companies to New York in the first place When Google and other West Coast giants set up outposts here in the mids they were mostly hiring advertising sales representatives and marketing managers not hardcore codersGradually however New York began to become a force for tech talent Media and finance firms were trying to become more digitally savvy and needed programmers Universities  encouraged by successive administrations in City Hall  created and expanded programs to give students digital skillsAs a share of the population New York still has far fewer programmers software developers and similar workers than Silicon Valley and Seattle In raw numbers however the New York area has more such professionals than any other urban areaBut as Amazons pullback in New York shows the technology

commercial center We wont have the magnetismNot everyone of course is pushing for tech to play a larger role in New York Amazons plans were scuttled by a powerful backlash from unions neighborhood groups and elected officials in Queens Some of that opposition was fueled by the multibilliondollar incentive package the city and state offered to lure Amazon But critics also worried that the flood of wellheeled tech workers would drive up already skyhigh rentsDan J Wang a professor at Columbia Business School said those concerns were particularly acute because of the size and concentration of Amazons planned campus which he likened to the company towns of the early th centuryThere is the possibility of displacement of existing businesses and of the exacerbation of inequality that already exists in New York Mr Wang saidOther companies such as Google have been more subtle building up presences in neighborhoods without taking overThat might explain why before the furor over Amazon techs rise had managed to stay largely beneath the radarTech has become a huge and crucial part of the New York City economy Mr Bowles said Im not sure that most New Yorkers know that right

FriedmanOpinion ColumnistAround the end of each year major dictionaries declare their word of the year Last year for instance the most lookedup word at MerriamWebstercom was justice Well even though its early Im ready to declare the word of the year for The word is deepWhy Because recent advances in the speed and scope of digitization connectivity big data and artificial intelligence are now taking us deep into places and into powers that weve never experienced before  and that governments have never had to regulate before Im talking about deep learning deep insights deep surveillance deep facial recognition deep voice recognition deep automation and deep artificial mindsSome of these technologies offer unprecedented promise and some unprecedented peril  but theyre all now part of our lives Everything is going deepWhich is why it may not be an accident that one of the biggest hit songs today is Shallow from the movie A Star Is Born The main refrain sung by Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper is Im off the deep end watch as I dive in  Were far from the shallow nowWe sure are But the lifeguard is still on the beach and  heres whats really scary  he doesnt know how to swim More about that later For now how did we get so deep down where the sharks liveThe short answer Technology moves up in steps and each step each new platform is usually biased toward a new set of capabilities Around the year  we took a huge step up that was biased toward connectivity because of the explosion of fiberoptic cable wireless and satellitesSuddenly connectivity became so fast cheap easy for you and ubiquitous that it felt like you could touch someone whom you could never touch before and that you could be touched by someone who could never touch you beforeAround  we took another big step up The iPhone sensors digitization big data the internet of things artificial intelligence and cloud computing melded together and created a new platform that was biased toward abstracting complexity at a speed scope and scale wed never experienced before So many complex things became simplified Complexity became so fast free easy to use and invisible that soon with one touch on Ubers app you could page a taxi direct a taxi pay a taxi rate a taxi driver and be rated by a taxi driverOver the last decade these advances in the speed of connectivity and the elimination of complexity have grown exponentially Because as big data got really big as broadband got really fast as algorithms got really smart as G got actually deployed artificial intelligence got really intelligent So now with no touch  but just a voice command or machines acting autonomously  we can go so much deeper in so many areasScientists and doctors can now find the needle in the haystack of health data as the norm not the exception and therefore see certain disease patterns that were never apparent before Machines can recognize your face so accurately that the Chinese government can punish you for jaywalking in Beijing using street cameras and you will never encounter a police officer Indeed with todays facial recognition technology I can dispense with the card reader at my offices security gate and instead use each employees face as an ID And cars can drive on their ownDeepMind the artificial intelligence arm of Googles parent developed an AI program AlphaGo that has now defeated the worlds top human players of the ancient strategy game Go  which is much more complex than chess  by learning from human play As The Times reported DeepMind showed yet another way that computers could be developed to perform better than humans in highly complex tasks and to mimic the way the brain functions DeepMinds next breakthrough AlphaZero did not even need to learn from humans It learned even faster by repeatedly playing against itselfToday virtual agents  using conversational interfaces powered by artificial intelligence  can increasingly understand your intent when you call the bank credit card company or insurance company for service just by hearing your voice It means machines can answer so many more questions than nonmachines also known as humans The percentage of calls a chatbot or virtual agent is able to handle without turning the caller over to a person is called its containment rate and these rates are steadily soaring Soon automated systems will be so humanlike that they will have to selfidentify as machinesAutomation is also going deep fast The Timess Kevin Roose quoted Mohit Joshi the president of Infosys a technology firm that helps other businesses automate their operations as saying in Davos last week People are looking to achieve very big numbers Earlier they had incremental  to  percent goals in reducing their work force Now theyre saying Why cant we do it with  percent of the people we haveBut bad guys who are always early adopters also see the same potential to go deep in wholly new ways They can fake your face and voice so well that they can create a YouTube video that will go viral of you saying racist things or make it look like the president of the United States just announced a nuclear attack on Russia They can use technology to fake a bank managers voice so well that it can call your grandmother and with a voice command ask her to transfer  to an account in Switzerland and shell do it  and youll never catch them in timeThats why the adjective that so many people are affixing to all of these new capabilities to convey their awesome power is deepOn Jan  The London Observer looked at Harvard Business School professor Shoshana Zuboffs new book the title of which perfectly describes the deep dark waters weve entered The Age of Surveillance CapitalSurveillance capitalism Zuboff wrote unilaterally claims human experience as free raw material for translation into behavioral data Although some of these data are applied to service improvement the rest are declared as a proprietary behavioral surplus fed into advanced manufacturing processes known as machine intelligence and fabricated into prediction products that anticipate what you will do now soon and later Finally these prediction products are traded in a new kind of marketplace that I call behavioral futures markets Surveillance capitalists have grown immensely wealthy from these trading operations for many companies are willing to lay bets on our future behaviorUnfortunately we have not developed the regulations or governance or scaled the ethics to manage a world of such deep powers deep interactions and deep potential abusesTwo quotes tell that story Last April Senator Orrin Hatch was questioning Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg during a joint hearing of the commerce and judiciary committees At one point Hatch asked Zuckerberg So how do you sustain a business model in which users dont pay for your serviceZuckerberg clearly trying to stifle a laugh replied Senator we run ads Hatch did not seem to understand that Facebooks business model is to mine users data and then run targeted ads  and Hatch was one of Facebooks regulatorsBut then Zuckerberg was also clueless about how deep the powers of the Facebook platform had gone  deep enough that a few smart Russian hackers could manipulate it to help Donald Trump win the presidencyWhen faced with evidence that fake news spread on Facebook influenced the outcome of the  election Zuckerberg dismissed that notion as a pretty crazy idea It turns out that it was happening at an industrial scale and he later had to apologizeRegulations often lag behind new technologies but when they move this fast and cut this deep that lag can be really dangerous I wish I thought that catchup was around the corner I dont Our national discussion has never been more shallow  reduced to  charactersThis has created an opening and burgeoning demand for political social and religious leaders government institutions and businesses that can go deep  that can validate what is real and offer the public deep truths deep privacy protections and deep trustBut deep trust and deep loyalty cannot be forged overnight They take time Thats one reason this old newspaper I work for  the Gray Lady  is doing so well today Not all but many people are desperate for trusted navigators Many will also look for that attribute in our next president because they sense that deep changes are afoot It is unsettling and yet theres no swimming back We are indeed far from the shallow nowFollow The New York Times Opinion section on Facebook Twitter NYTopinion and InstagramThomas L Friedman is the foreign

immediately rejected Senator Mitch McConnell the majority leader could propose legislation today that would wrap Mr Trumps proposal into a package to reopen the government News analysis People who have done business with Mr Trump say his current stance is consistent with negotiating tactics he used in the private sector focusing foremost on claiming victoryThe Trump administration announced last month that it was lifting sanctions against several companies controlled by an influential oligarch Oleg Deripaska The government characterized the move as tough on both him and RussiaBut a confidential document signed by both sides suggests that the agreement is less punishing than advertised freeing Mr Deripaska from hundreds of millions of dollars in debtHow we know The Treasury

 somewhere it had never been embattledLawmakers across the political spectrum say Big Tech for so long the exalted embodiment of American genius has too much power Once seen as a force for making our lives better and our brains smarter tech is now accused of inflaming radicalizing dumbing down and squeezing the masses Tech company stocks have been pummeled from their highs Regulation looms Even tech executives are calling for itIn the face of such a sustained assault this might be a good moment for Big Tech to lie low It could devote some of its mountains of cash  Apple alone has  billion in the bank  to genuine good works and allay widespread fears it wants to control your data and your destinyThat is not the path the companies are takingThe tech companies are not flinching said Bob Staedler a Silicon Valley consultant Nothing has hit them on the nose hard enough to tell them to cut back Instead they are expanding Theyre going around the country acquiring the best human capital so they can create the next whizbang thingThere is so much of life that remains undisrupted The companies are competing to own the cloud  to become in essence the internets landlord They have designs on cities Google made a deal in  to reimagine a chunk of waterfront Toronto from the ground up Amazon is reworking the definition of community from the inside as warehouses in rural areas provide the urban middle class with everything they want to stay home all weekendThese changes are only beginning to redefine society When every home has an Amazon Echo Google Home an Apple HomePod or some other smart speaker the companies are already signaling all human and metaphysical needs will be fulfilled For those who insist on venturing out there will be driverless cars operated by Big Tech And the companies are plunging further into artificial intelligence with consequences unclear even to themTo accomplish all this Big Tech needs hundreds of thousands of new employees which means it needs somewhere to put them This isnt a matter of reconfiguring a floor or two at corporate headquarters It means building new campuses around the countryBig Techs push into New York City and the Washington area has been well documented in recent months with Google bulking up in the first and Amazon planning satellite offices in both But even in its backyard of Silicon Valley which is a mess of traffic congestion and housing prices that have attained levels even wellpaid engineers can scarcely afford there is a boom that if anything is acceleratingAnyone who wants to believe Big Tech is chastened should visit a section of San Jose just west of downtown a jumble of carwashes and autobody shops with a sprinkling of modern apartments On a short street there is a house nearly a century old a tiny thing with only one bath Google bought it and another house last month in a package deal for  million according to county documents reviewed by The Mercury NewsMultiply that real estate transaction by dozens big parcels and small totaling hundreds of millions of dollars to date Google is planning very long term here The buses light rail Caltrain and Amtrak trains that converge on the Diridon Station transit center will give the company an opportunity to embed mass transit into its growth The eventual result will be a new Google campus of eight million square feet with offices for  workers a figure that is more than the companys total employment in But Diridon Station is just a part of Googles Silicon Valley expansion A week before the company got the two houses it bought a squarefoot building in Palo Alto Calif for  millionFacebook keeps growing too In the spring it leased one million square feet in the Silicon Valley community of Sunnyvale for its fastgrowing community operations team which deals with safety and security issues confronting Facebook users And it will soon move this year into  square feet in a San Francisco tower making it the thirdbiggest tech tenant in the city after Salesforce and UberIn total Googles employment increased  percent in the last year Facebooks work force rose by  percent in that time to  and it is advertising  additional jobsAmazons head count tripled over the last three years thanks to its warehouses and the acquisition of Whole Foods It is only the second company in the United States to employ more than  people  and that is not counting its contractorsThe expansion underlines the dizzying truth of Big Tech It is barely getting startedFor all intents and purposes were only  years into a  or year process of moving from analog to digital said Tim Bajarin a longtime tech consultant to companies including Apple IBM and Microsoft The image of Silicon Valley as Nirvana has certainly taken a hit but the reality is that we the consumers are constantly voting for themThats evident in how robust Big Techs businesses remain Last March the research firm eMarketer said Facebook including its less controversial photosharing site Instagram would earn  billion this year from digital ads in the United States In September it raised that forecast to  billionEMarketer also revised up its forecasts of Googles digital ad revenues in the United States for   and  The third big digital advertising recipient is Amazon which is far behind the leaders but gaining ground fastThe contradiction is becoming increasingly obvious One important way Big Tech serves its customers is by tracking their movements and purchases which is beginning to unnerve at least some of us In a Pew Research Center survey in June  percent of adult Facebook users said they had taken a break of several weeks from the site But even as we say we trust tech less we invite it deeper into our livesApple Amazon Facebook and Alphabet Googles parent company together generated  billion in revenue in the third quarter of  alone  up  percent from a year earlier when the four companies hauled in  billionMuch as people are now wary or even unhappy with the outsized power held by Facebook Google Amazon etc they are simultaneously quite dependent on the services they provide said David Autor an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of TechnologyBig Tech needs to be regulated many are beginning to argue and yet there are worries about giving that power to the governmentThe government doesnt have a good clue said Mr Bajarin the consultant Theyre not even asking the kind of questions that would drive to regulationWhich leaves regulation up to the companies themselves always a dubious propositionFor Facebook to have a better year in  it needs to be more upfront and transparent said Debra Aho Williamson an analyst at eMarketer This was also the advice Facebook got for  to little availAll this could change if the antitech mood continues to swell or the economy hits a really rough patch On the other hand the last recession tended to work in Big Techs favor by giving smaller competitors even more to worry aboutDuring the  financial crisis Amazons North American media sales increased  percent Borders one of its biggest bookselling competitors saw revenue drop  percent reported a record loss and was soon defunctWith so little to really worry about Big Tech is planning for a future far beyond any presentday turmoil Google which has  job openings says it is too early to say what the thousands of Diridon employees will do But Jonathan Taplin director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California has a good idea everythingTheyre in the transportation business the medical business

screenings of some  live fitness classes per week including boxing dance cardio high intensity interval training HIIT and yoga Users are facetoface with the instructor you can see your entire body as

Harvardeducated former New York City Ballet dancer said I think I knew we built something special but I dont think I expected thisMs Putnam  does Google those who have bought the Mirror just as she used to with firsttime clients at Refine Method the eightyearold boutique gym she founded But often she only finds out whom the purchase is for when the company arrives at the customers home to install it or when her company receives questions about putting the device on a very highsecurity WiFi networkThats how we found out about Leslie Mann and Judd Apatow Ms Putnam said referring to the firewall issue Her company whose offices are in the NoMad neighborhood of New York and has raised  million in funding from investors including Spark Capital Foursquare Warby Parker and First Round Capital Uber Blue Apron is selling  million of the inchthick Mirrors per month she said There are buyers in all  states with California perhaps not surprisingly the top market Luxury hotels have begun installing Mirrors in suites and in the case of the Mark its pernight penthouse Not all customers are percenters Ms Putnam stressed roughly  percent request financingMs Putnam is refreshingly new to the courting of celebrity and speaks of influencers she gave Mirrors to Sara and Erin Foster who have a lot of famous friends and public clips those Instagram videos with the delight and faint ostentation of someone who has just learned a foreign languagePreviously she had little patience for workout fads A decade ago as an instructor at various barre method gyms she was scolded for substituting in moves such as lunges that she considered more effective She created Refine which has a devoted though not boldfaced following after a year spent grilling sports scientists and professional athletes trainers about what got results Mike Boyle whose clients include NFL players and other elite athletes told her she was right about the lungesAt the time the only studio Ms Putnam could afford was a squarefoot groundfloor space on the Upper East Side that she had to give back to the church that owned it every Sunday for services She designed a cable tower made of weighted sailing pulleys and tracks for strength exercises that could easily be taken down and remounted Her husband Lowell Putnam a founder and the CEO of Quovo a financial technology company had grown up sailingBut in the spring of  newly pregnant Ms Putnam found herself in the strange position of being the owner of a gym with an optimizeddowntotheminute workout she could not face doingShe didnt like treadmills or exercise bikes enough to buy one and when she tried to stream workouts she couldnt figure out where to set up her computer or phone so she could see it while moving Around that time she also conducted a Refine members survey about improvements she had implemented including new class times trainers and custommade equipment Turned out simple mirrors shed put in at the last minute were by far Refiners favorite change They liked the instant feedbackI almost missed it Ms Putnam said Mirrors were something I took for granted because my entire career I worked out in front of themShe spoke sitting on the sofa at the companys Flatiron store sipping a hot chocolate after six hours of interviewing potential Mirror hires Occasionally she stretched a leg above her in a perfect line as if executing a tendu On her feet were gray Allbirds the only shoe she can tolerate after the Chanel ballet flats she bought on a stylists advice to look like an adult while promoting Mirror made her

used to own an elliptical machine it now functions as her motherinlaws clothing rack she saidNext up for Mirror is personal training which will start at  per session the device has a camera and yes a lens cap lest you be concerned about privacy issues Also sports prep for children because the Mirror is averaging  users per household according to company figures Later will come treadmill and spin workouts like those offered by Peloton a sixyearold company now valued at  billion that was recently mocked in a merciless Twitter threadThe Mirror company has ambitious plans for the device to be users third screen after their phone and computer with the capacity for everything from photo organizing to chat Currently users can shop through the Mirror buying fitness gear and other instructor favorites Ms Putnam years ago turned up to a Physique  instructor audition wearing a Tshirt that hung to her knees and black track pants with a yellow stripe she borrowed from her mother she still got the job and so to handle this part of the business she hired Karla Welch a celebrity stylist Ms Welch Mirrors creative director has also helped spread the word to her clients Olivia Wilde and Karlie Kloss are Mirror usersOne challenge for Ms Welch No trainers can wear black because it doesnt show up against the background For now she is enjoying buying trippy acid wash tights and leopardprint sneakersWhen I go to SoulCycle I like my instructor dressing crazy Ms Welch saidTo the disappointment of Mirrors sales staff Ms Welch recently decreed that APL sneakers not the  Yeezy Boosts she

Satariano of the NYT reports A regulator would be given the power to issue fines block access to websites if necessary and make individual executives legally liable for harmful content spread on their platforms Terrorism inciting violence encouraging suicide spreading disinformation and cyberbullying are among the topics that companies would be required to address The rules would apply to social media platforms discussion forums messaging services and search engines Facebook and Twitter will work with the government representatives from the companies saidActions in Britain and elsewhere signal a new era for the internet Western democracies have largely avoided regulating online communication Mr Satariano writes But governments have become more willing to intervene as evidence mounts that online actions are having harmful reallife consequences by contributing to violence compromising elections and spreading hateful ideologiesIn the United States where free speech is more of a core value than in other nations theres been less momentum to regulate internet content Mr Satariano adds But even in America there is increasing support for new rulesPresident Trump is ready to nominate Herman Cain and Stephen Moore  two vocal supporters of his policies  to the Federal Reserve board Many analysts say such a move would politicize the central bank Neil Irwin of the Upshot takes a look at what that would meanHistorically Fed appointees have generally been economic experts who kept their political views out of policy discussionsMr Moore and Mr Cain wouldnt change much at first Theyd hold two of  votes on the Feds Open Market Committee so their ability to swing other governors would depend on their politicking abilitiesBut over time the Fed could lose credibility The United States role as the global reserve currency  which results in persistently low interest rates and little fear of capital flight  is built in significant part on the credibility the Fed has accumulated over decades Mr Irwin writesThe financial world is watching closely I think its a very big benefit to the US economy and the financial markets that we have a strong and independent Fed and I hope that

AlbumReaders offer tips and tricks that they wish they knew before they married from checking in with the caterers to keeping tissues on hand for the ceremony By Danya IssawiThere are some lessons that can only be learned after your wedding day We asked our readers to share some of what they had learned from their trips down the aisle Here is a selection of tales of lost rings ripped gowns and sweaty nuptials from former brides and groomsIts OK to not invite people We stressed over the guest list for a long time but by keeping it to close family and friends we were able to spend quality time with all our guests Looking back I know that the day wasnt just for us It was also to celebrate the love and support of those who helped us get to this point in our lives as a couple and as individuals I was lucky enough to dance with my grandfather at my wedding It was the last time we were together as a family he passed a few months after It will remain one of my favorite memories of that dayAmelia Hoffman New York Our wedding rings were kept in one jewelry box that our best man was holding in his pocket My ring had a bracket with the center engagement ring inside my husbands ring was in the pocket of the box We repeatedly told the best man that my ring was loose so be careful opening the springloaded box Unfortunately that advice wasnt enough As I was coming down the aisle with my father he opened the box to get the rings ready without looking at it closely My ring popped out and fell to the deck of our Waterside Lake ceremony The engagement ring popped out and fell into the lake Our best man crashed to the deck but couldnt save it My husband thought he passed out from the degree weather but soon learned that my engagement ring had fallen into the lake I didnt know this happened until the middle of the ceremony when my husband had the ring in his hand and I whispered Wheres the other half He said Just roll with it So the lesson learned Have the rings in separate boxes or have them tied to a pillow Fortunately we had a successful ending with a ring retrieval We used the photographers light and a very trustworthy friend in the lake My ring was presented to me at the reception and all was made good againLeann Diederich Bellefonte PaI wish I had stayed in close touch with the caterer the week leading up to the wedding Because of a miscommunication I walked into my reception to find the wrong entree on the tables Check in all week long as you prep for the reception and triple check the menu for any changes My brotherinlaw went out and bought a bottle of each of the wines the caterer had suggested for his daughters upcoming wedding so he could sample them at home This was a genius idea You could taste them at a leisurely pace and you can also know what they taste like an hour after theyve been openedKelly Caldwell New YorkMoney saved We got married in our living room Then five months later we had a cookout with a DJ open bar and food Everyone said they had a blast and a couple people even thanked us for being nontraditional We invited all of our friends in town got a couple of Airbnbs and planned a Detroitthemed weekend We spent  for everything cash Then saved up and spent  on our twoweek honeymoon to East AfricaMegan Watt DetroitTake location seriously because your photos show so much more than a beautiful view I loved that we had our wedding in Mexico but the weather wasnt for the faint of heart We didnt even make it to pictures before our wedding party was sweaty hot and out of their suits Yes aesthetics are the ultimate goal but unhappy people arent fun And thats the point of weddings funElizabeth Kelley Columbus OhioJust as my thenfianc and I stood up from this photo he stepped on my dress and ripped part of the train Id been so careful to shield my dress from horses dirt paths unfinished wood my own heels and grass None of this was easy when youre getting married in a field outside of a ski lodge in Idaho In one second all of that work was rendered fruitless I wish someone had told me that no wedding is perfect that something is always going to go wrong More likely numerous things are going to go wrong The hairstylist will get amnesia and forget what you agreed on this also happened to me The cake will fall apart The flowers wont arrive until after the ceremony People will give toasts regardless of your efforts to stop them from grabbing a microphone after a bottle of wine Thats just what weddings are like and thats OK Its more than OK A perfect wedding is a boring wedding Its the things that go wrong that become the stories youll tell the most after the fact especially when youre trying to comfort other brides Kate Wutz Ketchum IdahoDont let your girlfriends have the keys to your wedding suite They put crackers in our bed and said it was an old Swedish tradition It ruined our sleep and we were so tired from the long dayKari Olsson Walnut Creek Calif Dont get a wedding planner Also no need to spend money on small details stationery table dcor etc No one will remember them anywayAugusta Powell Baldwin NYDont make assumptions about how many guests will decline Plan as if each invitee will be there This means you need to think carefully and practically about the guest list We started with a large list and delicately and sometimes uncomfortably whittled it down This is your day Who do you actually want to share it withRaina Allair and Matthew Kallman New YorkAs a professional event planner I thought I would handle my own wedding planning easily In reality it meant that I overthought and secondguessed every decision because I thought it had to be perfect  in hindsight I wish I had realized that good was fine I sent my bridesmaids dozens of emails with ideas for which bracelet I should wear I researched countless floral arrangements and color schemes I meticulously sewed  napkins in vintage floral fabrics And for what I wish Id just relaxed and enjoyed the process and stopped doing so much work to decide everything I always joke with my brides now Did you keep dating after you got engaged or did you stop looking for a partner Were you able to meet every single available person out there or did you stop when you found one you liked I wish Id applied that lesson to my own event and looked at a floral arrangement and said Yup that works just fineLisa Sullivan Columbus OhioWear whatever shoes you want I wore Toms because theyre comfortable People will try and tell you that you should wear cute sandals or heels but believe me you will thank yourself if you wear shoes that you enjoy Theyre your feet and you have to stand a lot of the day Be comfyJosie Crotty Columbia MdGet a dayofwedding coordinator Our hired transportation for guests to the venue dropped the ball leaving many stranded without a ride The minutes before walking down the aisle were not spent sipping champagne but on the phone screaming at the bus company while my brother was helping greataunts figure out Uber We spent a lot on the wedding and I wish we spent just a little bit more for someone to handle the hiccups in the dayCate Star Kelly SeattleAlthough now  years ago I still give all brides the same advice Make sure your band is listed in the contract by musicians name and instrument I booked my band with a band leader who played at the Chicago Gold Coast Hotel I verbally specified a piano sax drums and bass and said I hated electric guitars and accordions But it wasnt written in the contract So guess what showed up My only compensation was that my lawyer uncle got a  percent refund but it was too late to change out the musicians that nightStefanie Livolsi Pasadena CalifI always dreamed of the perfect fall outdoor event I was glued to the weather reports leading up to the ceremony It didnt rain thank goodness but it was very hot and humid despite it being October My husbands glasses fogged up during the vows and his best man was sweating more than I thought humanly possibleGina Hill AtlantaMake backups of everything that is important to you both on paper and in terms of equipment Oh and dont pay your wedding vendors through PayPalTara Tyrrell BostonI neglected to slide some tissues up the sleeve of my lacy top I spent much of the ceremony sniffing and trying to unobtrusively wipe tears of joy from my face Oh and we also forgot to make sure our cameras had fresh batteries for their flash attachments But thats no longer the problem it was in Sharon Smith Brentwood CalifDont stress over the small details They almost never matter Some brides and grooms want to plan the perfect wedding party and often get so absorbed in the planning that they think that the small things tablecloth material uplight color entrance songs will make or break the night They forget about the important things spending time with each other and families As long as the two people getting married are happy and the guests are well fed the celebration will go down as a good oneSupriya Sarkar Atlanta If there is still time Elope elope elopeFinn McMahon Winnipeg Manitoba CanadaI wish I had asked our photographer to take a group picture at every table I know its cheesy but it ensures that you have a memory of everyone who was there Our album is beautiful but it pains me that some of our

targeting the richest families By Neil IrwinWhen the United States government wants to raise money from individuals its mode of choice for more than a century has been to tax what people earn  the income they receive from work or investmentsBut what if instead the government taxed the wealth you had accumulatedThat is the idea behind a policy Senator Elizabeth Warren has embraced in her presidential campaign It represents a more substantial rethinking of the federal governments approach to taxation than anything a major presidential candidate has proposed in recent memory  a new wealth tax that would have enormous implications for inequalityIt would shift more of the burden of paying for government toward the families that have accumulated fortunes in the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars And over time such a tax would make it less likely that such fortunes developIt would create big new challenges for the IRS in ensuring compliance There is a reason many European countries that once had a wealth tax have abandoned it in the last couple of decadesAnd thats before you get to the legal and political challenges There is an open debate around whether a wealth tax is constitutional And some of the most powerful families in the country would certainly deploy their vast resources against a wealth tax and against any candidate who embraces itThe comedian Chris Rock had a routine in the early s in which he expounded on the distinction between those who are rich and those who are wealthyShaquille ONeal the star basketball player was rich Mr Rock said The team owner who signed his paycheck was wealthy And that in a nutshell gets at the conceptual difference between trying to tax peoples income as the tax code does today versus their wealthThe CEO of Walmart makes about  million a year He is rich by any definition But the Walton family descendants of the companys founder are mindbogglingly wealthy The Bloomberg Billionaires index estimates that Sam Waltons three living children are worth around  billion each putting them each among the  wealthiest people in the worldA family that has accumulated enormous wealth can escape with surprisingly low income levels and therefore tax burdensIn an extreme example Warren Buffett owns enough stock in Berkshire Hathaway to put his estimated net worth at  billion but he pays himself  a year to be its chief executive Even in years when his wealth rises by billions he must pay tax only on his comparatively modest income and on the gains from shares that he chooses to sellMs Warren and other advocates of a wealth tax argue that this accumulation of untaxed or lightly taxed wealth is a bad thing They say that it enables the creation of democracydistorting dynasties who accumulate political power and that tax policy should be used to rein them in more than the current tax code doesDeveloped by Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman two University of California Berkeley economists who are leading scholars of inequality the proposal is to tax a familys wealth above  million at  percent a year with an additional surcharge of  percent on wealth over  billionMr Saez and Mr Zucman estimate that  households would owe such a tax or about one out of  American familiesA family worth  million would owe the federal government  in wealth tax over and above what they may owe on income from wages dividends or interest paymentsIf the estimates of his net worth are accurate Mr Buffett would owe the IRS about  billion a year in addition to income or capital gains taxes The Waltons would owe about  billion eachThe tax would therefore chip away at the net worth of the extremely rich especially if they mainly hold investments with low returns like bonds or depreciating assets like yachtsIt would work a little like the property tax that most cities and states impose on real estate an annual payment tied to the value of assets rather than income But instead of applying just to homes and land it would apply to everything fine art collections yachts and privately held businesses They are both philosophical and practicalOn the philosophical side you can argue that people who have earned money and paid appropriate income tax on it are entitled to the wealth they accumulateMoreover the wealth that individual families accumulate under the current system is arguably likelier to be put to work investing in largescale projects that make the economy stronger They can invest in innovative companies for example or huge real estate projects in ways that small investors generally cantIt could disincentivize the kinds of moonshot investments that dont pay steady predictable returns but can transform society After all if wealthy investors are on the hook for a wealth tax every year they may strongly favor investments that pay a steady reliable dividend over those that are risky and will take many years to pay offThen there are the practical concernsFiguring out a persons total net worth can be a lot of work Just ask anyone who has had to sort through a large estate after the death of a relative to submit estate taxesIf the deceased owned financial assets like stock and bonds its pretty easy to check a brokerage statement and surmise the value But if the estate consisted of a collection of rare antiques  or interests in various real estate or oil and gas projects or closely held companies  estimating the value is harderIt can require an army of appraisers and other experts and an often prolonged period of IRS audits and disputes over valuationPresumably a wealth tax would apply to the same sort of base except that it would be annual rather than just when a person dies said Beth Shapiro Kaufman an estates lawyer at Caplin  DrysdaleThe very wealthy would have a permanent continuing need to tally the value of their assets and defend those valuations to the federal government The Warren plan includes substantial new funding for IRS staff to enforce the lawAnd some people may have their wealth tied up in things not easily converted to cash An early investor in Uber or another company that has achieved a high valuation without going public might have a high enough net worth to owe a wealth tax but not the easily accessible funds to pay itMr Zucman argues that people wealthy enough to owe this tax would generally have ample access to credit and that the law could even be structured to let people pay their tax obligations with illiquid assetsGene Sperling a former National Economic Council director in the Obama and Clinton administrations who now supports a wealth tax said If we were sitting here in  saying we need to create a Social Security system it would have seemed very complex but if its important enough you dont let some complexity become a reason not to push forwardThe wealth tax Ms Warren proposes would also apply to assets that American citizens own overseas So in theory a wealthy American citizen would owe tax on his Panamanian bank account and his Swiss ski chaletEnsuring payment would be tricky which is why the proposal includes all those new IRS employees and stronger international coordination to stop tax avoidance and evasion  as well as an exit fee that Americans would need to pay if they sought to renounce their citizenshipTheres an old line attributed to a thcentury French politician that the art of taxation is to pluck a goose so as to obtain the largest possible quantity of feathers with a minimum amount of hissing In the recent past wealth taxes have failed that testIn the early s  developed countries had a net wealth tax according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development That is now down to three the OECD said Switzerland Norway and Spain France recently changed its wealth tax into a tax only on real estate more akin to the American property taxOne problem was that some of the wealth tax plans kicked in at a relatively low level meaning a vast number of uppermiddleclass people faced its nuisance and expense In Europe especially it created incentives for people to relocateMr Zucman says the United States as a large country is better positioned than small countries where wealthy citizens are likely to be highly mobile already The idea is that Americans will be less likely to renounce their citizenship to avoid paying out a couple of percent of their net worth every yearAn income tax is clearly authorized by the th Amendment which states that Congress has the power to lay and collect taxes on incomes from whatever source derived A wealth tax is more likely to raise constitutional questions and its a near certainty that wellfunded opponents would wage a legal battle against itJosh Barro at New York Magazine lays out the legal questions hereThere is Some tax experts say changes to existing law would accomplish many of the goals of a wealth taxOne example that Leonard Burman of Syracuse University and the Urban Institute has suggested is to eliminate a provision of current law in which assets that increase in value can go essentially untaxed across generationsIf you start a company and its value appreciates over your lifetime then it is transferred to a family member upon your death no capital gains taxes are collected on those decades of appreciation The family member gets to start over at its current valuation for capital gains purposesThis stepup provision is one of numerous ways that families can accumulate great wealth with minimal taxation It could be eliminated Laws could be changed to make it harder to avoid the estate tax which currently kicks in at about  million for an individual and about  million for a married coupleIf you want a tax system that leans more aggressively against dynastic wealth and high inequality there are in other words tools that dont involve quite the risks and challenges of a wealth taxBut those are a lot harder to capture in a campaign ad and in the public imaginationAn earlier version of this article misstated the threshold for estate tax It is around  million for a married couple not around  millionNeil Irwin is a senior

Francisco What was your childhood like When I was  and the country was going through a revolution and war I dont remember thinking Oh my god Im suffering hardship I had no context I just was like OK This sucks But I can just go on with the day I got used to seeing people getting killed and waking up every morning to go to the roof to see which houses near us were still standing or not Thinking about it now Im like God thats horrible Back then that was just routineWhat did your parents do Both my parents were educated in the United States My dad had gone to MIT My mom was a computer scientist from Boston University And we had a whole lot of extended family herePart of the challenge for me living in Iran was that my entire family other than my mom and dad and brother basically had left and fled the country and we stayed behind The reason we stayed behind was that my father had started the technology university there and he said The countrys going through all this challenge but if the education system falls apart who knows whats going to happenWhen did you get interested in technology My dad started teaching us on a programmable calculator when my brother and I were  years old And then the next year he brought a Commodore  home In Iran at the time there was nothing fun to do There was no Xbox no PlayStation no internet We had one TV channel it was all propaganda There were no sports in school So for us this computer was an escape from just a horrid life situation It was really the only good thing we had in our lifeHow did you get out of IranTo get the permission to leave my dad had to promise the minister of education that he was coming back  that he wasnt taking his family to leave forever He was like I give you my word Im coming back And when we came to America pretty much the first thing he did was to say All right Im going back You guys can stay here My mom was like What are you talking about Were done with that country And he said I just want to go for one or two years because I gave my word and then Ill join you guys So we spent a year or two in America with our dad living in Iran only because he wanted to stay true to his wordTell me about arriving in the United StatesWe were not welloff at all Our family couldnt afford a home So all four of us lived in one bedroom in my grandmas house in one bed which is an awkward thing to do when youre  years old My parents worked three jobs but they put all of the money toward our education That left an imprint of how important education is Education is the No  thing you should invest inYou have many relatives whove also been successful in the technology industry How do you explain that Entrepreneurship is in my familys blood My grandfather and all of his brothers started a great company together almost  years ago It was called Alborz Corporation and it was one of the largest industrial companies in Iran They started by being a trading company and importing goods but then all the most popular goods theyd import theyd start manufacturing locally in partnership with whoever was the original producer Then the entire company was taken away by the government as part of the revolution So growing up in America there was this desire for us to effectively make back the money that our family had lostAfter you graduated college you went to work for Microsoft What did you work on while you were thereThe project Im most proud of is Internet Explorer Today Internet Explorer is the dead bastard stepchild of the Web browser market But I joined that team when it was nine people and two years behind Netscape Navigator in the famous browser wars It was one of the craziest startup experiences in a very large company My proudest creation there was Internet Explorer  and  At the time it was a really fantastic productIts a bit hard to imagine Microsoft acting like a startupThe Internet Explorer team was probably the hardestworking team Ive ever been on And Ive been at multiple startups We would have foosball tournaments for the team at  am just to get everybodys energy back up to continue working Everybody was working every day every night One of the team managers had a sign on his door saying This is why Im going home this evening And it was a picture that his daughter had made of the family that showed mommy and daddy and son But the picture of daddy was a car leaving the garage There were many divorces and broken families and bad things that came out of that But what I learned was that even at a person company you can get a team of  or  people to work like their life depends on itYouve gone on to be an angel investor How do you decide which companies to invest inI give coding interviews to the chief technology officers of any startup I invest in When I met Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi from Dropbox I flew them out to meet in Seattle and I had them both do coding interviews in my house I had them take a list of numbers and remove all the duplicates from the list And the other was to write the code to shuffle a deck of cards So relatively simple stuff I mean you should be able to do it in  minutes if you know what youre doing Its not rocket scienceIm not a coder Is there one right answer to those questionsNo Theres a little back and forth of seeing how youre going to go about the problem And also since these were two that were going to be startup founders what are their communication skills like Because if the CEO just writes the answers and gives it back to you thats different than if they walk you through their thinking and explain why they come up with something When youre interviewing a potential leader you need to look for both of those thingsHow did Codeorg get startedThe moment of inspiration was the day Steve Jobs died I had wanted to make a video that featured the best technologists talking about the importance of computer science and I was like God The best of them just died He cant be in my video anymore That gave me the onus to start CodeorgAnd why is it so important that kids learn to code The idea for Codeorg isnt that every kid should learn to code its that every school should teach computer science We use the word coding because its more hip But computer science really is a subject that needs to be taught And the reason for this isnt because theres so many coding jobs or that coding pays well or things like that The reason is because computer science is foundational Every school teaches biology every school teaches chemistry every school teaches algebra You wouldnt envision going to a school that just said We dont teach that Weve done some reporting on the influence that big tech companies are gaining over educational curriculum Is that appropriate What Codeorg does is focus primarily on foundational learning And even when we involve our industry donors were very clear with them that what were doing isnt vocational You cant take Codeorgs courses and then get a job at Google But it gets you interested that maybe hey I might want to pursue thatThere are a few companies that are proactively trying to get their platform into schools or trying to sell their devices into schools and theres some selfinterest there but the Codeorg ecosystem doesnt have that Do you think there should be legislation that mandates schools teach computer scienceI believe schools should be mandated to teach computer science You would never send your child to a school that didnt teach math In the st century computer science is as important as biology Understanding photosynthesis or HO or electricity is just as foundational as understanding how the internet works or what an algorithm is These things are impacting our daily lives We need future lawyers and doctors and politicians to all understand

WangALBANY  The words Albany and lively are not often used together but on Wednesday the first day of the years legislative session the halls of the New York State Capitol were roaringLegislators shouted greetings down the ornate Romanesque hallways Aides jogged between offices Lobbyists swarmed the elevators and rifled for business cardsIn the coming months there will be bills to pass and deals to cut Egos and relationships will bruise along the way But on the first day optimism was the dominant emotion at least for Democrats who this year will control both chambers of the Legislature and the governors office for the first time in a decadeThat optimism became especially clear just after  pm when Senator Andrea StewartCousins formally ascended the dais as the first woman ever to lead the Senate majority As the applause settled and the senators both Republican and Democratic took their seats after a standing ovation Ms StewartCousins  wearing a custom scarf emblazoned with New York States seal  nodded to the historic nature of her ascentNot that long ago women werent even allowed to walk on the floor of these chambers she saidMs StewartCousins then proceeded to list the many reforms she said will follow this year A sampling the codification of abortion rights under state law expansion of voting rights protection of child sex abuse victims bail reform a revamp of campaign finance lawsThere is nothing to stop us and there is so much more that we have to accomplish she saidWhile that may be true on some bills  the ones above are expected to sail through  on others fissures are already showing And for the most part the disagreements are within the Democratic Party between urban legislators and those from outside cities moderates and progressivesIn other words the liveliness of the first day is sure to continue in the months ahead but the fate of the optimism remains to be seenHere are five of the most pressing and vexing questions that loom in AlbanyThe subways need money The subways have no money On that much lawmakers agree But when it comes to how to get that money things get complicated fastThe most highprofile suggestion is congestion pricing which would charge drivers who enter parts of Manhattan during the busiest times of day Mr Cuomo has declared it the only realistic option for saving the subway and groups from unions to real estate developers have backed it But the plan foundered last year after lawmakers outside Manhattan said it would burden constituents in transitstarved areas who had no choice but to driveIt was a rare issue that fell not along partisan lines but rather geographic ones This means the Democratic takeover of the Senate does not necessarily mean the proposal will fare any better this time Ms StewartCousins represents suburban Westchester and has said congestion pricing is one of many options she will examineAssemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz a Bronx Democrat said he had seen no indication that revenue would go toward urgent repairs rather than flashier projects like the new Second Avenue subway stationsIf I had to make a list of priorities adding a few subway stations to the richest neighborhood in the country wouldnt have been my top he said adding We have to remember that we have five boroughs not just ManhattanBut other funding proposals such as a tax on high earners have been shot down by Mr Cuomo and others Assemblyman David I Weprin a Democrat from Queens said he would support a tax on commuters from outside the city but that idea cost Senate Democrats their last majority in  Even a halfway measure last year which put a surcharge on forhire vehicles such as taxis and Ubers has stalled after outcry from taxi driversAnd even if congestion pricing does pass it would not cover all the needed subway repairsBut hey at least the L train is staying openNew Yorks rent stabilization laws expire in June and activists and lobbyists are already arming for what they say will be one of the years biggest battlesTenants rights advocates say this is their chance to end loopholes that help landlords remove apartments from rent stabilization Bills that lawmakers may tackle relate to vacancy decontrol which lets landlords deregulate certain apartments when they become empty preferential rent rates which can disguise illegally inflated rent and the use of major capital improvements to allow landlords to raise rents after big renovationsBut the real estate industry has long been a source of political donations funneling money to Mr Cuomo and the longreigning Senate Republicans This year as the political winds shifted developers began giving to the Senate Democrats and they also fueled the wins by Mr Cuomo and the new state attorney general Letitia JamesStill there are signs of the industrys weakened grip Several newly elected lawmakers have pledged to fight for universal rent control Senator Michael Gianaris the chambers No  Democrat has stopped accepting real estate donations as his Queens district has seen an influx of young and vocal progressivesMichael McKee treasurer of the Tenants Political Action Committee an advocacy group said he was optimistic but not nave about winning stronger rent lawsWe obviously cant take anything for granted just because we have a Democratic majority he said Were going to have to work very hard for this because we have powerful enemies and they have a lot of moneyThe issue of school funding has perhaps offered the clearest sign that a Democratrun Albany does not mean one big happy familyThe trouble started in December when Mr Cuomo called a  lawsuit which successfully argued that the state had underfunded public schools a ghost of the past Six newly elected senators hit back to say the state still owed districts money And if the governor tries to deny me that then hes got a fight on his hands Senator Robert Jackson who was one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit said in an interviewLawmakers advocacy groups and Mr Cuomo have continued to trade barbs on the topic with the governor comparing his critics to people who believe Earth is flatNew York State United Teachers the states powerful teachers union has also called for more funding It is still pushing to increase oversight of charter schools and decouple teacher evaluations from test scores  a measure that both chambers actually agreed on last year but that ultimately died amid endofsession horsetradingA bill to create a Medicare for allstyled system for New York would be one of the most expensive items the Legislature could take up this year It has passed the Assembly several times and Senate Democrats have pledged their support too The idea has highprofile backers including the City Council speaker Corey Johnson So it should fly through rightNot exactlyPowerful insurance companies and business councils have hired lobbyists and rolled out campaigns to oppose the plan They warn of job loss and new taxes A study by the RAND Corporation last year found that singlepayer could save the state money but that the findings were highly uncertainMr Cuomo  a fiscal moderate  may also not run to sign such a bill He has called singlepayer conceptually the right idea but said it would be better tied to action on the federal level citing the huge upfront cost to the stateI have a lot of great ideas of Christmas gifts that I want to get but then Im going to have to deal with the reality of the cost and the budget he said in a radio interviewIf a promise to clean up Albany is a prerequisite for any candidates stump speech a failure to do it seems the norm once they are electedLike congestion pricing this issue doesnt fall neatly along partisan lines Both the former Democratic Assembly speaker and the former Republican Senate leader were convicted recently as were aides to the governor And the issues on the table are myriad from legislators outside income to bidrigging scandalsOne of the ugliest fights so far  and the session hasnt even started  stems from an outside panels recommendation last month that legislators receive their first pay raise in  years But the rub was the proposal to cap outside income which has been at the heart of corruption woes The Assembly speaker Carl E Heastie was decidedly not pleased by that caveat accusing the commission of overstepping its bounds and calling one of its members a chicken and a rubber stamp for the governor Mr Heastie has promised to address the issue somehow this year though hes been short on detailsThen there are the escalating threats over who will investigate the other more Several Democratic legislators have promised to make the Legislature a more robust investigative body open to probes of the governors office Mr Cuomo in turn threatened to investigate them right back in what he called an investigations battleEvery grant that the Legislature does goes through my government so I can investigate every one of those he said in a radio interviewThe Legislatures track record on actually moving oversight bills does not inspire confidence Last session the Senate passed a bipartisan bill to clean up the states contracting process and create a database of deals to track state subsidies The Assembly refused to take it up Still some reformers are optimistic that the wave of energetic progressives will finally force lawmakers to act Or as Senator Alessandra Biaggi a newly elected Democrat from the Bronx who will lead the chambers ethics committee put it Let me get to workVivian Wang is a reporter for the

Bar bakery out of not much more than glitter plywood and the brilliant idea of making softserve from the milk at the bottom of a cereal bowlWhen the time came to share a personal fun fact Ms Tosi

Bar is a movementMilk Bar is also a brand that QSR magazine the trade journal for quickservice and casual restaurant chains just named one of the most innovative fastcasual startups in the countryThe th Milk Bar opened in Cambridge Mass on Feb  to a line three blocks long This week they moved the company headquarters from a Williamsburg basement to a fancy building in Manhattans NoMad neighborhood The number of employees has jumped by  percent in the past year to  Ms Tosi has installed an almost allwoman management team led by Sujean Lee a former senior vice president at ChobaniLater this year

from RSE Ventures an investment firm founded in part by the vice chairman of the Miami Dolphins Matt Higgins who also stars on Shark TankAll of this is headspinning especially for New Yorkers who remember waiting in line at the first store in the East Village hoping the compost cookies werent sold outMs Tosi  is an introvert in overalls who carries math problems in her purse along with embroidery thread to make friendship bracelets Now she has to figure out how to maintain the Milk Bar magic while running a multimilliondollar businessGrowing fast feels like selling out but I realized if we controlled the growth it could be really cool too she said during a hour day of trainings tasting and meetingsShe knows at least one thing She doesnt want a Milk Bar on every corner like Starbucks I sat with it and lost a lot of sleep over it and finally I was just like Thats just not what we are she saidStill there is no lack of ambition in the Milk Bar universe People who manage the brand talk about making Milk Bar a verb like Google or Uber so at  pm someone might turn to a coworker and say Lets Milk Bar it and head out for cookiesWe want to tap into the person who is like I just want to live my truth in my own weird quirky way said Sarah Tabb the senior director of marketing who spent six years as a brand manager for CocaColaMs Tosi plans to open Milk Bars in cities where theres already a fan base including Chicago and Miami The company is upgrading its ecommerce which is about a third of the businessThen there is her holy grail the grocery store As someone with roots in central Ohio who grew up on hot dogs Doritos and ranch dressing she is a deep fan of packaged food and the supermarket remains an inspirational touchstone Milk Bar desserts on the shelves of Americas suburban grocery stores she said are her gift to children looking for creative inspiration in a sea of massmarket blandnessBut building an empire comes with a challenge familiar to many niche food entrepreneurs riding a growth spurt How do you do that she said without being like any other hockeystick white dudeMs Tosi may be the unicorn that can said Doug Quint a founder of Big Gay Ice Cream another onlyinNew York brand that began just after Milk Bar and also is expandingIt takes a little time before you realize her genius he said Its all so deep in her she doesnt even recognize itOne hurdle on her way up was changing her relationship with David Chang the chef who first hired her to handle office business and later made her pastry chef for his Momofuku restaurants He knew she wanted to open her own bakery and gave her the seed money to do itFor years the bakery has operated independently of the Momofuku empire but Mr Chang remains a business partner As Ms Tosi sought more autonomy for herself and Milk Bar there were arguments and frustrationShe was becoming her own thing and I didnt know how to deal with it Mr Chang said in an interview I wouldnt say it was rough but we didnt have any reference points I dont think we knew how to talk to each other as business peopleBoth describe their relationship then and now as brotherandsister She still seeks his advice which he now gives only when asked Telling her something headon isnt the right approach he said No one wants to tell Tosi shes wrongShe remains one of the boldest most ambitious people he knows Always bet on Christina he saidMs Tosi credits her upbringing for her determination She wasnt allowed to say I cant or Im bored Her mother was a nononsense accountant who still makes her signature headscarves by hand Her father was an agricultural economist They divorced when she was a teenagerWe were always told Be yourself and do whats right and do your best said her older sister Angela Morrison But Ms Tosi was particularly drivenSometimes I tell her Christina not everyone is you she saidTo watch Ms Tosi in action is to understand focus at a new level She samples every type of cookie and batch of softserve when she walks into any of her stores noting in an instant if the batter was overmixed or if the softserve temperature is off Earnest testkitchen bakers present her version after version of new products each gram of salt fat or flavoring precisely calibrated The day of the orientation Anna McGorman the director of culinary operations was taking another swing at a chocolate Milk Bar birthday cake It was still a miss albeit barely The cake was chocolate but it tasted too much like yellow cake and not enough like birthday cake Ms Tosi suggested more dark vanilla to balance the creamy dreamy vibe of clear vanillaShe knows her desire for perfection can be maddening I have too many opinions and I like to know everything she said That slows me down a lotNot everything Ms Tosi touches is gold She had to abandon plans to sell her line of fresh juice at the bakeries Even though she likes to balance her daily cookie consumption with a green juice customers didntSome people still find the term Crack Pie more offensive than cute or at least inappropriate To sell a packaged version at Target she had to rename it Milk Bar Pie MixMs Tosi has found a perfectionist partner in Will Guidara who is growing his own empire the hospitality group Make It Nice with the chef Daniel Humm Their flagship is Eleven Madison Park considered one of the best restaurants in the worldThe two married in  in a summercampthemed wedding that made the pages of People magazine and moved into a penthouse on West th Street which they bought for  million They

described himself as an exceptionally anal person arranges her coffee cups by color And I have a wine decanter now she said shaking her head in disbeliefTo balance things out she keeps a large family of plants she has nurtured from cuttings along the windowsills and an assortment of her favorite objets dart including her Popsiclestick projectsMr Guidara  says his wife is the ideal mix of intensity and graciousness Whats amazing to me is she hasnt really changed in the most hilarious ways he said She wont let him buy her expensive treats like handbags and prefers hightops and jewelry she makes herselfIt kind of drives me crazy he saidShe rarely eats at her husbands restaurants Its too public and the extra attention from the staff makes her nervous I want to go out and disappear she said Ms Tosi says one of her few indulgences is travel but sometimes its just an impromptu train trip to visit her mother and sister who live near each other in Reston Va After years of scraping by on staff meals and  bodega sandwiches having whatever she wants delivered seems like an extravagance tooIts this luxury of being like Ill have dumplings as my appetizer and pizza as my main course and then I have a bunch of cookies in the freezer she saidWith her business in overdrive life has become more complex Its a far cry from Milk Bars early days when everything was Tang toast and sprinkles and DIY

Peter Henning of DealBook asks What federal criminal laws are investigators looking at as they pore over Boeings records One statute they may consider is the federal false statements law The broad statute is used when a company provides information to a federal agency like the Federal Aviation Administration to certify the safety of a plane and makes it a crime to provide an agency with any materially false fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation  The criminal investigation may also examine a statute that makes it a crime to knowingly and with intent to defraud falsify or conceal a material fact about an aircraft part or to make any materially fraudulent representation about a part It can be applied to conduct outside the United States so long as the company is organized under the laws of this country And if there is evidence of fraud and not just false statements the Justice Department could also pursue a wire fraud caseThere is danger in any criminal investigation because even the hint of possible misconduct could have significant consequences as it tries to deal with the fallout from crashes of its bestselling aircraftMore It isnt just antistall

its reliance on trading partners and even undercutting rivals like the US He gave it pride of place in his previous three annual speechesBut that vision alarmed Washington Officials in the Trump administration have called the plan a threat to fair competition saying it encourages state subsidies for domestic companies and forces technology transfer from foreign companies with the aim of driving them out of business Ms Wei writesNow the name has gone but the ambitions remain Mr Li didnt use the words Made in China  yesterday  but he did talk about advanced computing biotech and alternative energy And he promised to make China strong in manufacturing and encourage more domestic and foreign users to choose Chinese goods and servicesThe bigger question is what this means for

Pacific Ana Swanson and Keith Bradsher of the NYT writeWhat America could get The deal would require Beijing to make big purchases of American agricultural and energy goods and to lower some barriers that prevent American companies from operating in China The potential agreement would expand markets for American financial services firms and farmers in part by requiring that China buy large amounts of energy and farm goods like liquid natural gas and soybeans The Trump administration has also been pushing China to accept an enforcement mechanism that would enable the United States to quickly reinstate tariffs if Beijing fails to live up to specific promisesAnd China In return the United States would most likely drop its tariffs on at least  billion of the  billion worth of Chinese imports currently subject to American levies Beijing is also pushing for the elimination of all of the Trump tariffs a person with knowledge of the negotiations saidBut early details indicate it would do little to substantively change the way China has long done business and would not force Beijing to curtail cyber theft or the subsidies that the administration complains create an uneven playing field for American companies The language aimed at Chinas discrimination against foreign companies like its antimonopoly law or standardsetting processes is probably too vague to be enforceable according to an unidentified source The pact also doesnt alter Chinas tight restrictions on data and many of the big purchases that Beijing is promising would occur over a number of years which could give China further leverageMore How Apple prevailed in the trade war And why President Trumps battle hasnt helped narrow the trade deficitThe Chinese telecom giant plans to take the US government to court for

Lisa Lerer your hostWhen people talk about the emerging  Democratic primary field it can sound an awful lot like the opening lines of a childrens bookOne candidate two candidates Old candidates new candidatesSome are slightly left some are farSay what a lot of candidates there areBut theres one thing many leading Democrats seem to agree on Kamala Harris is a formidable contender When you ask  candidates likely candidates and members of their teams what possible opponent they worry about the California senators name comes up frequentlyThose concerns only grew on Monday when Ms Harris formally announced her presidential bid She matched Senator Bernie Sanderss record by raising  million from  donors in the first  hours of her campaignSo why is a firstterm senator with little experience outside California state government making Democrats so nervous She doesnt fit into a neat ideological lane As my colleague Astead Herndon wrote on Monday Ms Harris comes out of the Bay Areas Democratic establishment But since joining the Senate in  shes embraced elements of a Sanderslite liberal agenda backing Medicare for All and rejecting most corporate donations As a result her team argues she can appeal to a wide array of factions in the party She would make history Should she prevail in the primary season Ms Harris would be the first AfricanAmerican woman and the first person of Asian heritage to be a major party nominee As a graduate of Howard and a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha the oldest black sorority Ms Harris has deep ties to the black community The primary map favors a candidate who can win strong support from black voters  and California Its no accident that Ms Harris is making her first campaign stop on Friday in South Carolina where AfricanAmericans will likely make up a majority of the electorate in that states early primary The rising popularity of early voting also means that primary voters will start casting ballots in her native state of California on the day of the Iowa caucuses in diverse states of Illinois and Ohio voters can start casting early ballots before New Hampshire holds its primaryAfter Iowa and New Hampshire the race moves to potentially favorable terrain for Ms Harris Nevada which borders California and has a large Latino population then South Carolina Then on Super Tuesday California will be among the states voting as will four southern states where black voters made up more than a quarter of the  primary electorateEven with these advantages Ms Harris still has plenty to worry about Already shes fending off attacks on the toughoncrime positions she took as a prosecutor in California In her first remarks after announcing her campaign Ms Harris described the criminal justice system as horribly flawed And her liberal bona fides may be found lacking by an insurgent wing that is ascendant in the partyObviously Ms Harris does not have anything locked down Need I take you back to the winter of  when Hillary Clinton led primary polls by double digits Were in the early stages of what will likely be a very very long primary contest A lot can happenJust ask Howard DeanAdvisers to former Vice President Joseph R Biden Jr are circulating a document to his supporters that outlines a rationale for him to run for president and rebuts potential lines of attack  the latest indication that Mr Biden is leaning toward a  bid but has not yet fully committedThe talking points which were sent to The Timess Jonathan Martin by an ally of Mr Biden reflect some of his core arguments he would make if he does enter the Democratic primary He and his advisers contend that his long experience in politics  he served in the Senate for over  years  would represent an appealing contrast to President Trumps erratic styleIn a time of almost unprecedented political chaos under a President whose first and last thought every day is about himself his image and using the most powerful office in the world to enrich himself Americans are reacting to  and looking for  the trustworthy compassionate leadership that Joe Biden has brought to the national and international stage his entire career the document statesBut what is more revealing about the paragraph document is that Mr Biden and his small circle of aides feel the need to sketch out his message before he announces his candidacy It is a Biden ally said a distillation of his thinking The decision to put these thoughts on paper while other Democrats are announcing fullblown campaigns indicates Mr Biden is still eager to gauge reaction to his candidacy before taking the plungeTo that end the talking points attempt to grapple with some of the most frequent critiques of Mr Biden That his initial lead in some Democratic primary polls is simply based on name identification and will melt once other candidates become better knownHe is passionate he is empathetic he is trustworthy  and voters know these things about him the document states Its why hes atop so many polls  its not because voters know his name its because they know his character That he is too moderate for todays Democratic voters and will struggle with liberalsHe was outspoken on LGBTQ rights even when every pundit around said that it was a political mistake according to the talking points adding that he also sought to address climate change early in his career and is an unwavering ally of organized labor At  Mr Biden may be too old to run for presidentHe campaigned for nearly  candidates across the ideological spectrum across  states in the last two yearsStay tuned folksDrop us a lineWe want to hear from our readers Have a question Well try to answer it Have a comment Were all ears Email us at onpoliticsnytimescomCatholic high school students from Covington Ky found themselves in the middle of a national firestorm last weekend after videos surfaced showing dozens of students appearing to be in a standoff with an older Native American man More videos later emerged that complicated the story showing the encounter had been preceded by AfricanAmerican protesters who identified themselves as Hebrew Israelites shouting slurs at the studentsThe incident has emerged as a kind of Rorschach test for views on politics race and the Trump administrationWe talked to Elizabeth Dias The New York Times religion correspondent who was in Covington about what she discovered about our political cultureLisa Why did this video touch such a nerve Elizabeth There are these flash points now in our political culture This one was particularly polarizing because it touched every nerve  race President Trump and the behavior of young white menAs a religion reporter Ive covered a lot of sensitive topics and the level of vitriol and aggression from the right and the left about every part of this story is remarkable Some of the people involved in the videos have been experiencing threats of violence all weekend So what did you learn about the context for these videos When you actually are on the ground in the kids community you start to get an idea of the cultural context behind these kinds of inflamed moments The school is in an overwhelmingly white heavily Republican and Catholic area The boys in the video their school is known around town as the Colonel Crazies for their intense school pride and their allmale brotherhood And now the Catholic community and the parents of these kids are joining together to protect themThe last time the country was this intensely focused on Catholic high school boys was during the Kavanaugh hearings This time were seeing it in a pocket of the country that fueled Mr Trumps electionAnd with the videos theres now this fight over whose narrative wins outWhat does this incident tell us about our political cultureSo Covington where this happened is right across the river from Cincinnati The Covington area voted for Mr Trump in  while the Cincinnati area has become increasingly blue They are very close but may have very different realities of what it is to be AmericanHow have politicians tried to capitalize on this episodeMr Trump jumped into the fray praising the Covington

extension to the processMrs Mays reversal was striking because she had insisted dozens of times in Parliament that Britain would definitely leave the European Union on schedule on March  Mr Castle writes But it is the latest in a long line of retreats as she has struggled to cajole the fractious Tories into supporting a revised version of the dealWhile her move lessens significantly the risk of a potentially disastrous no deal Brexit by the March  deadline an extension of the negotiating period will merely delay that danger by a couple of months not end it Mr Castle addsAll  other EU

income taxes which was intended to reduce the cost of Mr Trumps  trillion tax cut will mean filers cannot deduct  billion on their  federal returns Many filers will benefit from different parts of the tax cuts such as the elimination of the alternative minimum tax and the reduction in marginal tax rates Additionally the law doubled the standard deduction that taxpayers may take along with a host of

international art students and local schoolchildren as well as studio and exhibition space for the artistCreditCreditAdrian Wilson for The New York TimesSupported byBy Peter HaldemanOn a sultry November afternoon in Mrida Mexico I sat with my friend David Serrano on the terrace of Apoala a Mexicanfusion restaurant on the Plaza de Santa Lucia tucking into Flores de Amarillo  zucchini blossoms stuffed with Oaxacan cheese  and people watching David a Mexican by birth and a Mrida resident by choice deftly picked out the vacationers in short pants like myself because of the heat from the locals in long pants like David because of the insectsAn elegant blonde woman in slacks drifted over to the table to say hello to David  Elena he explained a fashion designer from Milan A few minutes later a tanned couple the husband leaning on a cane as a result of a riding accident dropped by  Ralf and Yvonne the Germans who run the Yucatn Polo Club After lunch we stopped at KiXocolatl  the chocolate store next to the restaurant run by two Belgians  and bumped into Carmen a painter from Mexico City and Marcela a Yucatecan artist who got out her phone to show me pictures of the sculptures she makes from sisal fiberSo it goes in Mrida the capital of Mexicos Yucatn state and a magnet for creative souls from both sides of the border and beyond They come from the United States and Canada Mexico City and Europe lured by the citys unDisneyfied Mayan and colonial heritage Among the expats the artists James Brown and Jorge Pardo the designers Laura Kirar and Marjorie Skouras and the chefs Jeremiah Tower and until his death in  David Sterling Just dont call it the next San Miguel de Allende People go to San Miguel to retire David acting as both my host and tour guide during my first visit to the city said back in the car Here you come and work I think the heat wakes you upThe heat  or maybe it was the food  was having the opposite effect on me But our Uber driver Israel a Yucatecan of Lebanese descent cranked up the AC in his Dodge Neon The radio was also rousing Israel blasted KIIS FM Youre the One That I Want as he negotiated the narrow streets lined with tall colonial houses in sherbet colors back to Davids placeWe had spent the morning driving around the centro historico Mrida named for the ancient Spanish city was founded in  by the conquistador Francisco de Montejo y Leon on the site of the Maya city of Tho On La Plaza Grande the main square David pointed out the Catedral de San Ildefonso  and the Casa de Montejo both constructed of stone from the ancient pyramids and temples both dripping with Renaissance ornamentation You see the Roman influence just as there was the Roman influence in Mrida Spain David explained The French came laterOn cue Israel had turned up the Paseo de Montejo the citys main artery and suddenly we were surrounded by palmshaded mansions in the BeauxArts style  the trophy homes of the th and thcentury millionaires who made their fortunes producing henequen or sisal from the agave plant The rich Yucatecans rejected Hispanic culture in favor of all things French and Paseo de Montejo bears more than a passing resemblance to a street in old New Orleans which happens to be a sister cityThe pale blue exterior of the yearold house in the Santiago barrio that David and his partner Robert Willson bought a few years ago is reserved almost anonymous Inside it looks the way you might imagine a casa restored by two guys who used to run one of Los Angeless premier design showrooms would look There are foot beamed ceilings and boldly patterned concrete tile floors terra cotta sphinxes and French chairs made of steel and twine The lush scent of plumeria wafts from the courtyard where a Piranesiinspired mural overlooks a turquoise poolPeople come here and visit ruins and cenotes the first time David had told me look at houses the second time and buy a house the third time Happily for firsttime visitors more than a few of those who return and buy renovate their homes as boutique hotels or rentals Hotel Diplomat down the street from Davids place is one of the more intimate B  Bs with just four rooms while Casa Lecanda two blocks from Paseo de Montejo is one of the more luxe ones Urbano Rentals offers several meticulously restored town homes in the centro historico I repaired

and rain pelted the roof  a steady cooling volley punctuated by rumbling thunderLuckily Israels musical tastes were varied The next morning he was playing Mexican techno In a light drizzle we set off

footing on the steps Careful Fabio warned We lost someone here yesterdayThey say that to everyone David observed when I told him about it back in the carAfter touring the oldest remnants of Yucatn civilization we set out for its newest frontier Many of the affluent Mexicans moving to Mrida are settling not in centuriesold casas in town or haciendas in the country but in the spanking new suburbs of el norte  a long swath of gated communities and giant malls to the north of the city Our destination was a restaurant called Tatemar in Plaza La Isla a justopened store mall developed by Carlos Slim the richest man in Mexico and an investor in The New York TimesCarlos Arnaud who owns the Oaxacanflavored Tatemar with his sister Sara steered us to a table overlooking La Islas artificial lake and handled the ordering grouper with guacamole octopus with maize pure pork and shrimp tacos Here in the Yucatn Mayan culture was untouched until the Spanish he said joining us at the table Oaxaca is

corn chilis pumpkin with culinary contributions from Spain pork lard Seville orange and other parts of Europe Mr Tower the chef who has lived in Mrida for the last decade haunts the citys food stalls for fried pork belly and other Yucatecan staples Gringos who want to master timehonored recipes like pavo en relleno negro roasted turkey in charred chili sauce can take classes at Los Dos the cooking school founded by David SterlingMeals can go on for hours here We were in Tatemar until sundown feasting and chatting David and Carlos spoke in glowing terms about Mridas rapid growth When he arrived here four years ago David said there were seven Starbucks now there are  The first wave of discovery was like  years ago Carlos noted Tulum went through all the stages of growth in five years You cant grow there like you can here because of the sizeWhen we left the mall the sun was sinking below a stand of tamarind trees Suddenly there was an explosion of bird chatter  the evening song of blackbirds known locally as XKau  a reminder that for all the golf courses and Porsche dealerships we were still in the jungleAmong Mridas best exhibition spaces Lagal Galeria La Eskalera the Fundacion de Artistas and Centro Cultural La Cupula are all in the centro historico La Cupula a sprawling gardenlinked complex hosts music dance and theater performances as well as exhibitions A show of Davids recent paintings happened to be up when I was in town so we swung by the morning of my last day in the city Predictions and Sortileges is a series of canvases executed in white acrylic on brightly painted backdrops about fortune telling We paused in front of a painting of a female medium with a pair of birds on her head surrounded by a faithful audience She gets power telling people what they want to hear David explained Like TrumpWe had been asked to lunch at the country hacienda of Laura Kirar the designer and her husband Richard Frazier So we picked up a roasted chicken at a

factory building as a multipurpose space for community eventsExpat colonies can be insular but Mridas outlanders are establishing deep roots here On our way back to the city we stopped at Plantel

and local schoolchildren as well as a studio and exhibition space for the artistAfter a full day my host had planned a casual dinner back in town But this was Mrida the meal at a simple cantina called

York who works in real estateWe passed around platters of cactus salad and vegetarian flautas and empanadas The conversation returned to Mridas recent growth Not everyone shared Davids and Carloss enthusiasm for the changes Jason groused about the traffic and noise Ross said the Levis plant was polluting the water with toxic dyesWe need Ross just to make sure its not all puppies and rainbows

exports and imports That makes growth and inflation highly dependent on the exchange rate Centralbank stimulus tends to weaken a countrys exchange rate so when the ECB embraces easymoney policies as it did two weeks ago it tends to weaken the euro against other European currencies such as the Swiss franc Because the ECB is so large Switzerland and others can do little to offset itAs a result small countries often adopt negative interest rates despite having otherwise healthy economies That can be costly particularly for commercial banks that have to pay the equivalent of billions of

years ago and it is now clear just how enthusiastically his inaugural committee went to town with itThere was  for makeup for  aides at an evening inaugural event There was another  in per diem payments to dozens of contract staff members in addition to their fully covered hotel rooms room service orders plane tickets and taxi rides including some to drop off laundryThe bill from the Trump International Hotel was more than  million And there was a documentary overseen by a close friend of Melania Trumps that was ultimately abandonedThe details of the expenditures gleaned from interviews and from documents reviewed by The New York Times and not previously made public show that the committee spent heavily on nearly every aspect of the events surrounding the inaugurationIn  days it laid out about  million roughly twice as much or more than was raised by Barack Obama or George W Bush for their first and second presidential inaugurationsThe expansive spending reflected Mr Trumps desire to make a grand entrance with roughly  events around Washington people familiar with the events said It also had the hallmarks of previous Trump efforts such as the campaign with some Trumpfamily friends circumventing existing chains of commandDisclosure of the spending details comes at a time when the inaugural committee is facing legal scrutiny over the donations that funded itInaugural committees are required to document every donation with the Federal Election Commission and the Trump teams reports are now under investigation by federal prosecutors in Manhattan and Brooklyn Investigators are also looking into whether any foreign donations which are illegal in the United States were passed through Americans and whether any donations went unrecorded people familiar with the inquiries saidPeople involved with the committee have said that they vetted all donors but that they could do only so much to prove someones money was their own False statements to the Federal Election Commission can be a crimeThe investigation by federal prosecutors in Manhattan was prompted at least partly by a recording that Mr Trumps former lawyer and fixer Michael D Cohen made of a conversation he had with a central figure in the inaugural planning Stephanie Winston Wolkoff shortly after Mrs Trump ended Ms Winston Wolkoffs role as an unpaid adviser to the first lady Ms Winston Wolkoff was dismissed after initial reports about the amount of money taken in by the entity she formed to help produce the inauguralThere is no indication of any investigation into the inaugural committees spending For the most part inaugural committees are free to spend the money they raise from private donations as they wishThe bulk of the money for the inaugural committee came from big corporations like ATT Bank of America and Pfizer and wealthy Republicans donors like Sheldon G Adelson and Andrew BealGiven the short time frame between Election Day and Inauguration Day inaugural committees cannot always seek out the lowest bidder In the case of Mr Trumps inaugural some staff members and major vendors were veterans of previous inaugurationsMuch of the spending while outsize was mundane Documents reviewed by The Times accounted for the entire  million raised for the inaugural with most of the money going to payroll expenses and roughly  entities the bulk of which were hotel chains and other vendorsRoughly  million went to charity which organizers have noted is the most ever for an inaugural committeeBut millions were written off in lost revenue That included  million for blocks of hotel rooms booked for guests who ended up arranging their own accommodations The Republican National Committee booked the excess hotel rooms before the inaugural staff was even formed but the committee had to pony up when only half as many rooms were used as the party organization had expectedAnother  million in revenue that the committee expected to recoup for a media center never materializedOther arrangements by the inaugural committee also proved unusualMs Winston Wolkoff then a close friend of Mrs Trumps was initially signed to a  million contract Along with a friend Jonathan Reynaga she formed WIS Media Partners a firm that oversaw broadcast rights for the inaugural events and worked on the documentary project featuring interviews with top inaugural committee officialsThe idea was to sell the rights to a major distributor The project was later abandoned although the interview footage still exists as do copies according to three people familiar with the effortWIS Media Partners became the inaugural committees top vendor acting as a kind of general contractor and overseeing a series of events It received nearly  million much of which was paid out to other vendorsSteve Kerrigan who was chief of staff for Mr Obamas first inaugural committee said that the firms  million supervisory fee was the equivalent of roughly onefourth of what we paid our entire person staff in  Even if Ms Winston Wolkoff shared the fee among more than a dozen other top managers as she and others say she did the charge itself Mr Kerrigan said was outrageousGreg Jenkins the executive director of Mr Bushs second inaugural said I have never heard anybody getting that kind of fee associated with any inaugural everMs Winston Wolkoff often fought with other top aides according to people with direct knowledge of events She was known to threaten to have senior officials fired at times brandishing a cellphone and saying she would text Mrs Trump or Ivanka Trump the presidents elder daughter conveying a sense of authority that people later came to realize she did not have three people with direct knowledge of the events saidA lawyer for Ms Winston Wolkoff declined to commentA spokesman for WIS Media Partners said all of the firms charges were vetted authorized and signed off on by the committees top officials including Thomas J Barrack Jr the committees chairman Rick Gates the deputy chairman and Sara Armstrong the chief executiveHe said the firms fees were significantly below the customary charges for equivalent productions and that officials provided the inaugural committee with all its audited records and receipts He said the company could not reveal more because it is legally barred by the inaugural committee from discussing its work on the inaugural eventsIn a statement Mr Barrack said he continues to be proud of the incredible work of all those that were part of the committee and that it complied with all laws and regulations and its finances were fully audited internally and independently The donors were fully vetted and disclosed to the Federal Election Commission as requiredMr Trumps inaugural committee has come under scrutiny in the past for its high administrative and logistical costs The new details help flesh out how the inaugural spent the money Among the payments was more than  million spent on the firm of the Trump campaign official Brad Parscale for online advertisements to drum up inaugural crowdsAnother  million was spent on flying in a performance group working with Steve Wynn the casino magnate and friend of Mr TrumpThe Trump International Hotel was paid more than  million for services including the use of a ballroom an annex and a space called the townhouse according to records and people familiar with the paymentsWhile two other hotels the Willard and the Fairmont collected as much or more Mr Trumps hotel was also favored by vendors who billed their expenses directly to the committeeOver all the Trump teams spending appears astronomical said Emmett S Beliveau who was chief executive of Mr Obamas first inaugural committeeMr Jenkins who handled the Bush inaugural said the scale of the Trump teams spending blows me awayMs Winston Wolkoff and Mr Reynaga brought in nearly three dozen staff members some of whom flew in from Los Angeles or other cities and remained on the East Coast for weeks WIS also helped bring in a New Yorkbased party planner named David Monn who refused to sign a contract according to two people familiar with the arrangement Mr Monn charged the committee a total of  million from which he paid subcontractorsAmong other tasks Ms Winston Wolkoff and colleagues managed the person blacktie dinner hosted by Mr Barrack at the neoClassical Andrew W Mellon Auditorium and a person candlelight dinner at Union Station They decided the decorations were not elegant enough and needed to be enhancedMr Monn spent  on sevenfoothigh wreaths mosscovered obelisks flowers and other decorations to dress up Union Station Makeup was provided for  staff members at a cost of  per person For the dinner at the auditorium table menus table numbers and place cards including an onsite calligrapher to correct lastminute mistakes amounted to  per guest Mr Monn did not respond to repeated requests for comment on MondayThe handling of expenses for contractors like WIS Media Partners was also unusual Mr Kerrigan who also served as chief executive of Mr Obamas second inaugural committee said officials negotiated fixedprice contracts that limited how much vendors could charge for expensesIf a vendors staff member ran up a big room service bill that was on them said David Cusack who was the executive director of the second committee They had a per diem and they were supposed to eat on thatFor Mr Bushs second inaugural too vendors were required to build their expenses into their contracts Mr Jenkins said He said his committee did not even hire vendors from outside the Washington area because there was no need toThe Trump inaugural committee covered not only a fixed per diem for the people brought in by WIS Media but picked up expenses including room service cab rides for assistants who dropped off laundry and an order of McDonalds All told those expenses came to In less than two months WIS billed  for hotel rooms described as Mr Reynagas including nearly  for rooms at the Trump International Hotel according to detailed expense documents reviewed by The Times He also billed thousands of dollars for meals room service and travel On one day he charged a  Amtrak train ticket from New York to Washington plus a  firstclass upgrade to meet with Mr Barrack That was followed by a  Uber ride the next day to get to Toms plane the records showThe spokesman for WIS said WIS expenses were paid through business cards tied to a few senior officials of the firm including Mr Reynaga meaning that Mr Reynaga could have been paying for other employees costsHe also said staff members stayed at the Trump International Hotel at the explicit direction of inaugural committee officials A former official of the inaugural committee denied that the WIS employees were required to stay at the Trump hotelMaggie Haberman and Sharon LaFraniere reported from Washington and Ben Protess from New YorkAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported

yearold prone to bursting into song  like the mayor Photos of him dot the hallways Teachers stop midlesson when they spot him in the hallway hoping hell come in and say hello to their classes A basketball star in the cafeteria smiles and waves The little kids in the library gawk as they hurtle byHes long been a standout in their world  the kid who was organizing flash mobs at fourthgrade assembly who founded his own theater company at  its still going who has been acting in school plays and camp shows and community theater productions for as long as anyone can rememberAnd now hes going to BroadwayEven in an industry that delights in discovery this teenagers rightplacerighttime story is one for the books Last June he was competing in the National High School Musical Theater Awards known as the Jimmys  which he won  when the lead producer of Dear Evan Hansen happened to be in the audienceShe knew immediately she wanted him for the show and on Jan  he assumes the title role playing Broadways favorite socially anxious and ethically confused adolescentIm so nervous all the time about it he said cleareyed candid and strikingly courteous as we talked in an empty classroom If I were to make my Broadway debut in any role its Evan he added somehow managing to be confident and selfdoubting at the same time This is my favorite show since I saw it and everyone has always said Im right for the role I think I agreeThe role is wrenching vocally and emotionally and Andrew will be the first teenager to tackle it on Broadway The character is  but adolescent boys are often thought to be too immature to play adolescent boys and all of his predecessors have been in their s Ben Platt who won a Tony Award originating the role was  when the show openedTheres the possibility of getting us something thats authentic and original and vital and has never been seen said the shows director Michael GreifAndrew is so young  and so new to the rigors of Broadway  that hes going to begin his run doing just five performances a week while taking vocal lessons to shore up his stamina This will be his first professional production and the creative team determined to protect him as well as their smashhit show has decided the reduced schedule is their way of investing in his longterm success the shows alternate Michael Lee Brown will do the other three performances as Andrew builds comfort and strengthIts a little scary for all of us  for him for me for his mom  because were asking a lot of him said Stacey Mindich the shows lead producer But in every single moment he has grown with us already  at every passage he has shown us he is ubercapableThis is not one of those stories about someone who happened into theater unwittingly This is a story about an unabashed theater geek  a child who has adored Broadway since he saw Beauty and the Beast at age  who has been happily singing on stage since he landed the role of Mr Bundles in a community theater production of Annie at age  who writes songs and plays the piano guitar drums ukulele and bass who has been to all four editions of BroadwayCon including the one last year where he won a lipsyncing competition while performing as Angelica Schuyler from HamiltonHis passion for the imaginary goes way beyond musicals Hes a huge fan of Star Wars  We watched A New Hope in English class to learn about archetypes and I was like Oh my God this is the coolest thing  and has dressed as General Grievous and Kylo Ren for Halloween Its not that hes drawn to the dark side its just he says that those characters look coolerHes an even huger fan of Disney which now owns Star Wars so maybe thats redundant He estimates that hes been to Disney theme parks including Disneyworld Disneyland and Disneyland Paris at least  times starting when he was  months old Something draws me to the idea of being able to live in another world he saidAnd now he really really loves Dear Evan Hansen The first time he saw the musical a couple of weeks after it opened on Broadway in  he was so overcome he couldnt find the words to talk about it when his mother came to pick him upIt really really hit hard he said I had never had such a visceral reaction to anything EverHe started playing the cast album on repeat He sent songs to friends He saw it again And againHe relates to Evan and not just because he like the character lives with his single mom I mean Im a teenager he said Ive been lucky to never personally struggle with a diagnosis of anxiety or anything but I am a teenager Of course I feel anxiety Of course I feel nervous Of course I feel aloneHe called Evan a manifestation of whats going on in our heads as teenagers  he just cant control whats going on the outside as much as most of us can And he asserted with the confidence of a teenager who has been seeing as many Broadway shows as he could for as long as he can remember there has never been a character so thoroughly real and authentic to that experienceI asked Andrew to show me around his high school  Lawrence Woodmere Academy a small private school in the Five Towns section of Long Island  since hell be portraying a high school senior on Broadway while still a high school junior himselfOf course as of a few weeks ago hes not actually showing up for class  Broadway is too timeconsuming so instead hes being tutored for  hours a weekHe grew up nearby first in Hewlett Neck and then in Woodmere His mother is an alumna and administrator at the school his father a lawyer lives in Manhattan and he has an older sister His tightknit family also includes his mothers sister who lives down the street the sisters raised their children together and Andrew regards his cousins as his brothersAndrew has been performing nonstop since Annie He had tried a variety of sports but didnt like them he was better at teaching his fellow  and yearolds to sing Beatles tunes And then his parents marriage was splitting up and his ailing grandparents had moved into his house so his mother Barbra Feldman was thrilled that he had found something he could do in a place that felt healthier than home at the time She has spent the years since supporting his enthusiasm My plan was not for my son to be a Broadway star she said My plan was to have a happy welladjusted childHe has played an amazing array of roles  the donkey in Shrek Danny in Grease Jack in Into the Woods  because over the last few years he has often been doing five shows at a time performing not only at school but also at Plaza Theatrical Productions in Lynbrook the Rockaway Theater Company and St Gregorys Theater Group in Queens and Broadway Workshop in Manhattan He has also built a large group of friends from the theater world he met his girlfriend who lives in Maryland at Broadway WorkshopHes the nicest child Ive ever worked with said Marc Tumminelli the director of Broadway Workshop And by being in amazing shows as well as shows that werent that great he built his own process so hes readyThe composer of Be More Chill Joe Iconis said he met Andrew in  when the teenager was performing as Roger in a youth theater production of Rent that Mr Iconiss brother was directing It was truly insane watching that kid sing One Song Glory as well as Ive ever heard it sung ever he said Hes some sort of insane musical theater creature who has a preternatural ability to performThe theater company Andrew founded  called Zneefrock after the name Andrew made up for the aliens at the nowclosed spacethemed restaurant Mars   began as his bar mitzvah project He wanted to hold a onenight cabaret to raise money for autism research because one of his cousins is on the autism spectrumThat evening of Les Misrables and Wicked medleys held at the school theater was so successful drawing theater kids their families and fans that it became an annual event with each one more ambitious and raising more money for charity than the one before There was the Star Wars parody musical which Andrew wrote with a friend a minimalist reimagining of Seussical and last summer a production of Be More Chill yes they managed to stage the show before it arrives on Broadway this winterAnd then most impressively last fall Zneefrock staged Jason Robert Browns The Last Five Years which is a beloved twohander about the rise and fall of an unsuccessful marriage with a different gender configuration at each performance  boygirl girlboy boyboy and girlgirl  to see how the shows complex romantic dynamic might shiftNow Andrews life is all EvanHe said his house suddenly looks as if it was decorated by Ms Mindich because there is so much stuff bearing the shows signature color Its like everything is blue now he saidHe has vowed to stop eating dairy hard when chocolate milk is still a dietary staple and started drinking a lot of tea plus water water and water Hes rehearsing up to five hours a day six days a week And hes thinking about EvanWho is this person separated from the performances that Ive seen he asks himself as he delves deeper and deeper into the role I learn a bunch of new things about him every day every rehearsal every time I

Wade Truong are taking up the tradition seeking a direct connection to what they eat By Kim SeversonWASHINGTONS BIRTHPLACE Va  It was cold crouching down in this homemade goose blind on the edge of a frozen cornfield near the Potomac RiverThe earlymorning January sun gave off considerably less heat than a light bulb All we had to eat was a communal bag of venison jerky a satsuma and eventually the hunk of dark chocolate I had kept hidden in my pocket until I felt too guiltyI had a million questions but youre not supposed to talk much when youre waiting for geese I had a shotgun but I had never killed an animal It didnt matter because there were no geese anywayAfter about five hours a small flock started to land in front of us Someone yelled Take them Everyone except me stood and fired Two Canada geese fellA dog named Tug brought them to us and we packed up and headed to the kitchen to cook what Wade Truong the chef who invited me here to hunt calls the ribeye of the skyMr Truong  grew up working in his parents Vietnamese restaurant in Harrisonburg Va He never thought about hunting until he dropped out of the University of Mary Washington and started cooking professionally Like many young chefs Mr Truong decided that he wanted to get as close to his food as possible So nine years ago he picked up his first hunting rifle He took a hunters safety class studied an old Army snipers manual and headed into the woods he said overgeared and underpreparedAfter several tries he managed to shoot his first deer He was determined to field dress it himself He studied images he pulled from Google and pried a few tips out of some hunters None of it prepared him for what the process was really like especially how shockingly hot the inside of a deer can beIt was a lot for a kid who grew up on meat that was on sale he saidHis girlfriend Rachel Owen  didnt grow up hunting either But like him she loved fishing The two who got together when they worked at the same restaurant talked about hunting on their first dateNow eight years later they have  guns between them They keep an empty caviar jar in a drawer near their dining room table to collect any stray shot left in a duck breast They blogIts the kind of modern love story you dont hear about much I cant imagine us as a couple without hunting she said Its foundationalThey spend as much free time as they can fishing and hunting with the express goal of trying to eat only protein that they kill They havent bought meat in over a year except pork fat and chicken wings Sausage needs pork fat Mr Truong said and there really isnt a substitute for chicken wingsThey are the face  or at least two faces  of a new generation of huntersIf the hunting world wants to grow in America its going to be up to the millennials Mr Truong said Its not just the blue blood upland hunters or rednecks with mudders and dogs Its usThe number of hunters in the United States has been in a slow fall since  when  million people had paid hunting licenses By  that had dropped to  million according to United States Fish  Wildlife Service records In the past few years the figure has begun to climb to  million in  Still only about  percent of Americans  or older hunt half of the number who did  years ago Supporters of the sport worry about what might happen if their beloved culture fades awayHope they say might lie with a healthconscious outdoorsloving slice of the millennial generation who were raised on grassfed beef and nosetotail eating but didnt grow up in hunting families where taking game is about both tradition and filling the freezerHipsters want to hunt But they dont want to hunt the way a rural farm boy from Illinois wants to hunt said Matt Dunfee director of special programs at the Wildlife Management Institute in an article last year about huntings decline in Outdoor Life They dont want to dress the same way they dont like focusing on antlers they dont like taking pictures of their animals he told the magazine But they want local sustainable ecologically conscious meat And within our efforts there are few places to realize those valuesSteven Rinella the outdoor writer and star of the Netflix series MeatEater said interest in wild game is rising among people in their s and sThe show his popular podcast and his books including his newest  The MeatEater Fish and Game Cookbook  are aimed in part at young hunters who want to field dress their own game and move beyond dishes like venison chili and duckbreast poppers stuffed with jalapeo and cream cheeseFor a long time there just hasnt been an intermediate between what a chef knows and what a deer hunter in Wisconsin knows he saidMr Rinellas books along with titles like Duck Duck Goose and Buck Buck Moose from Hank Shaw the former restaurant cook and writer who champions wild food in modern cooking are prominent on the bookshelves in the home that Mr Truong and Ms Owen rentOne of the big drives for me is trying to make everything we pursue exceptional Mr Truong said It shouldnt be I ground this up to make a burger with Cajun seasoning all over it Becoming a hunter had never been on Mr Truongs radar His parents grew up in the city then called Saigon They met in a refugee camp in Indonesia With the help of a Mennonite family who sponsored them they settled in Virginia and opened the Saigon Caf in Harrisonburg It was the only Vietnamese restaurant in townI basically grew up there Mr Truong said You go to an Asian restaurant and theres a kid in the back doing his homework That was me His parents who have since divorced sold the restaurant about six years agoAs a teenager more interested in partying than school he didnt always get along with his father But their fishing trips together were a bright spot and cemented Mr Truongs love of the outdoors Unlike many fathers in this part of Virginia Mr Truongs never taught him to hunt He had fought alongside Green Berets during the Vietnam War and had no interest in picking up another gun But to the son hunting seemed like the next logical step  especially as his cooking career took offHe started with deer Waterfowl came a few years later after Mr Truong became the executive chef at Kybecca in Fredericksburg a city of about  that serves both as a tourist town for history buffs and a commuter town for people working in Quantico or ArlingtonIt was a Frenchfriesandbisonsliders kind of place but Mr Truong slowly started to change the menu adding Chesapeake Bay oysters and sophisticated entrees that used vegetables from local farms One of his suppliers was Blenheim Organic Gardens run by Rebecca and Lawrence Latan who is a descendant of George Washingtons family They live on about  acres of farmland that has been in the Washington family for centuriesGeese migrating to and from the Ungava Peninsula in far northern Quebec  like to winter over in the Latans grain fields That makes for good hunting One day the couples son Cameron Latan invited Mr Truong and Ms Owen to join him and his father on a goose hunt They have been close friends and hunting partners ever sinceAlthough Mr Truong says he prefers cooking duck he has come to see Canada geese as the workhorse of his kitchen Some goose hunters contend that other more tender game birds like the specklebelly goose or the sandhill crane are the true ribeyes of the sky But the dark rich meat from a migrating Canada goose is reliable and delicious Mr Truong said He can thaw frozen breasts as fast as chicken and saut them for an easy weeknight supperMr Truong braises goose legs barbacoastyle for tacos and simmers carcasses into stock for pho styled after his mothers though he tops his with lightly charred goose breast venison braised in hoisin sauce or thin slices of goose heartHe has botched some dishes too He roasted the ribs from his first deer and they were terrible Now he braises venison ribs for hours to get rid of the chalky sticky tasteThen there was the time he tried to prepare mergansers These ducks eat fish and their flesh can take on a funky marine flavor He tried to make a wildgame version of the Vietnamese dish ca kho in which the breasts were braised in a caramelized sauceIt tasted like I burned a can of anchovies and added fish sauce Mr Truong saidHe has since become a much better game cook He is close to perfecting beavertail lardo which he set out in thin slices on a charcuterie board alongside venison pastrami and a few types of sausages when we got to the Latans farmhouse kitchen after our huntA Peking goose was roasting in the oven Three days earlier Mr Truong had inflated the skin with an air compressor stuffed it with paste made from fivespice powder ginger garlic and chiles bound with some hoisin sauce and then glazed it before leaving it to dry in the refrigeratorOn the stove a pair of goosenecks stuffed with maplescented venison breakfast sausage fried softly in a castiron pan the heads still attached Thats pretty metal he saidAs we sat down to eat Ms Owen talked about the negative response they sometimes get from other millennials who either dont like hunting or wont eat game Why is it weird that we eat wild meat said Ms Owen who doesnt have hunters on either side of her family Its the most human thing to do I feel like if youre going to eat meat at all you have to be comfortable with huntingThey also have to deal with reactions from hunters who are older or more conservative than they are People make a lot of assumptions about our politics and our value system she saidThey drew more than a few odd looks when they went elk hunting in Kentucky last year Ms Owen had the permit and Mr Truong went along as a guideWere an unmarried interracial couple where the woman had the tag she said They didnt know what to make of usAs we made our way through the meal Mr Truong turned philosophical Taking an animal you intend to eat has so much more meaning than buying a steak on a plastic tray he said It should never be a small thingHe pointed to his plate Everything from the slices of goose to the wild oyster mushrooms  even the cornbread made from a Native American variety called bloody butcher that the Latans grow  spoke of wildness and a rhythm of life that the couple is only beginning to understandYou make a conscious decision to end a life with the intention of eating it Mr Truong said Thats actually

through complexity By Tina RosenbergMs Rosenberg is a cofounder of the Solutions Journalism Network which supports rigorous reporting about responses to social problemsFirst of two articlesThe recent partial government shutdown could have been a disaster for the  million Americans who rely on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program formerly known as food stampsBut the United States Department of Agriculture which runs SNAP saved the day Along with their usual January benefits SNAPs users received an extra payment on Jan   the one they were supposed to get in FebruaryThis outcome was a product of heroic bureaucratic wrangling on the part of the Agriculture Department and the states which administer SNAP It saved millions of people from a month of severe hungerBut the early money has a downside If Ive got five bucks extra my pocket wants to burn it said Katie Stoneman a yearold divorced mother who lives in the countryside near Elsie Mich Its human nature to see a large number and be more inclined to spend that said Jeff Kaiser the chief operating officer of Propel which makes an app called Fresh EBT to help people manage their SNAP benefitsMs Stoneman has children ages  and  and for the last three years has received SNAP even while working in a pontoon boat factory It didnt pay enough to get me off of SNAP she said Not even closeSNAP pays  a month for her family about  per person per day and she usually makes it last three weeks she said  longer than many people A study by Duke Universitys Common Cents Lab which applies behavioral science to the problems of lowincome people found that  percent of benefits get spent in the first nine days When you give people  and they really need  theres only so much coping and budgeting they can do said Ellen Vollinger legal director of the Food Research  Action Center a nonprofit that addresses povertyrelated hungerBad things happen when SNAP money runs out Families eat less in the fourth week of the SNAP cycle The food they eat is not as healthy Childrens test scores suffer Emergency room admissions for high blood pressure increaseWorse  million people who are eligible for SNAP benefits dont get them Half of all applications started arent finished It could be that the forms   pages or more  can overwhelm candidates Or people simply forget to submit documents or schedule an interviewGoods and services aimed at lowincome people who have very little clout when they complain are known for indifferent customer service a longdistance bus for example Dealing with the government can be even worse because it is a monopoly provider with little incentive to do betterThe problem may be more than government indifference said Josh Wright executive director of Ideas which uses behavioral science to study and design public policies Some states  lets be realistic They dont want it to be easier he saidSigning up for SNAP getting a shelter bed going to housing court or getting out of jail after an arrest can involve considerable amounts of frustration confusion and disrespect And its often said that being poor is expensive Late fees moneytransfer fees checkcashing fees exorbitant interest reconnection fees and overdraft fees all add up to poor people spending proportionally more on financial services than wealthier peopleTechnology can provide solutions to obstaclesSystems dont take human nature into accountThe early SNAP payment did in fact set off a flood of early spending Communications about the early payment werent very good many beneficiaries might have thought that the money was extra or that their benefits card wouldnt work in February Mr Kaiser gave an example from Vermont which normally deposits benefits on the first of the month The average balance on Feb  was  compared with  on Jan But not for Ms Stoneman She was relieved when she learned February benefits were coming despite the shutdown But she knew she had to be careful I might go too far on buying groceries and not be able to be prepared for next month she said My kids have birthdays next month and I want to be able to make a cakeThen Ms Stoneman got a message on her Fresh EBT app Want help budgeting your February benefits Hide some of your benefits from your balance to help you budget You can still spend your full amount any timeShe eagerly signed up I knew I needed to set this aside and not spend it she saidOthers didnt manage it Mr Kaiser said that a third of Fresh EBT users benefits had already been spent by Feb  He said the company doesnt know yet whether the hide my benefits tool helped In midJanuary he said Propel went to Full Cart which ships free meal kits as a part of the organization Feeding Children Everywhere offering to raise the money to pay for at least half a million meals for the end of February They have so far raised a quarter of the needed funds he saidIn normal months most people with Fresh EBT use it to check their balance Before the app they had to buy something creating what Mr Kaiser calls the balance banana Or they had to call an  number That took  or  minutes Ms Stoneman said The app is better Im on it every dayAs it did with hiding benefits Fresh EBT uses behavioral science in other ways The Common Cents Lab compared two ways Fresh EBT shows people their balances Half saw only their normal wholemonth balance while the other half also saw a recommended weekly budget equal to a quarter of the monthly sum That worked People made their monthly benefits last for six extra mealsWe are stressed and forget thingsHeres an absurdly costeffective way that technology can keep people out of jail In New York City  percent of people given a ticket for a violation like littering or public drinking fail to appear at their court hearingTheyre not skipping town They fail to appear because they cant take off work or they just forget So Ideas and the University of Chicago Crime Lab studied two simple solutions First they redesigned a summons form that had been truly incomprehensible Now Show up in court with the date and To avoid a warrant for your arrest you must show up to court are in bold letters near the top Duh That simple change reduced noshows to  percentThen they tried various text message reminders The most effective was Helpful reminder go to court Mon Jun  AM Well text to help you remember Show up to avoid an arrest warrant That reduced noshows to  percent  at less than a penny per textCommon Cents Lab along with the Benefits Data Trust and Robin Hood New York Citys largest antipoverty organization tried a similar experiment with SNAP recertification They texted people reminders about deadlines necessary documents and where to get help That improved recertification rates by  percentage pointsThere are many such email or text reminder programs Mr Wright said these are relatively easy to test and many have rigorous evidence of success And these organizing nudges matter If youre high income youre likely to have one paycheck said Mariel Beasley a codirector of Common Cents Lab Low and moderateincome households are often balancing benefits multiple parttime jobs child support and money from friends and family all coming in at different timesIn addition new research shows that living with scarcity imposes a tax on our attention span equivalent to going a night without sleep If you didnt sleep how do you remember all the things you need to do said Ms Beasley Tech is a way that allows lowcost organization in our livesComplexity tilts the playing fieldFaced with a page form in bureaucratese many people would never even get started But software can ask people questions in plain language and fill in the forms automatically This is the idea behind online legal forms Ordinary people can create forms so they can represent themselves even if they dont understand the lawWe dont even sign upIn  Code for America introduced an app called Clear My Record which makes it much easier for people to expunge criminal convictions which can be a lifelong burden But people with convictions still had to learn about the service fill out forms talk to lawyers and wait About  people have used it in the California counties where it worksBut why even make people apply Last year Code for America began a trial of an automatic version Governments link the app with their criminal records data It checks for eligible convictions fills out forms and sends them to the court for expungement San Francisco is now trying it to clear marijuana convictionsThe financial system exploits usMillions of Americans take out payday loans The average user takes eight loans of  each year paying  in interestPayday loans often get people through unexpected crises when their car breaks down or someone is sick But at that average frequency many people must also be covering rent and groceries and using some of the loans to cover other loansAs abusive as they are payday loans exist because people need them Part of the problem is the very concept of payday which is essentially a shortterm loan from worker to employer If you work today what you earn should be yours todayTechnology can help overcome some of these obstacles Now employees can borrow from themselves  instantly in many cases Apps like Even PayActiv and DailyPay allow workers to get access to pay theyve earned but havent received yet Some apps charge a few dollars per month or per transaction At least one app Earnin asks you to pay whatever you think is rightMany apps help with budgeting in other ways Earnin will automatically send money to your bank account when youre in danger of an overdraft The Even app identifies recurring bills and sets aside money from your paycheck to cover them The Okay to Spend feature then tells you how much you have left over Even can also automatically put money into savingsEmployees can use some of these apps on their own but employers also offer them Uber Lyft and Walmart for example offer instant pay These apps reduce employee turnover And when employees arent stressing about bills they can focus on their jobsOf course employers could also accomplish these things by raising wages Technology is not a substitute for good public policy said Ms Vollinger of the food research groupStill technology aimed at lowincome people can make their lives much easier Its a shame then that theres so little of it Next week Ill look at the numerous obstacles to creating tech that focuses on social impact and how those difficulties can be overcome

learning disabilities and that Mr McGlashan paid  to Mr Singers charityTPG said it fired him for cause yesterday We believe the behavior described to be inexcusable and antithetical to the values of

remains cheap shareholders seem to support sensible deals and shareholder activists are continuing to push companies into transactionsBut there is no doubt that we are in a much less bullish environment for M  A than a year ago Mr Shafir said Among the pressures on dealmaking There are fears about a potential recession the ongoing trade wars and the persistent worry that the stock market will suffer like it did late last year Regulators are a big issue too especially the concern that they could be used as political cudgels One of the big topics at the conference was the growing

to be held liableLawyers for the families argued that advertising campaigns for guns appeared to be courting troubled young men like Adam Lanza who carried out the Sandy Hook shooting In a  ruling justices found that the sweeping federal protections did not prevent the families from bringing a lawsuit based on wrongful marketing claims Mr Rojas and Ms Hussey writeThe decision represents a

SeversonATLANTA  In  the last time this city hosted the Super Bowl the St Louis Rams beat the Tennessee Titans and Watershed had been frying its famous fried chicken in lard and sweet butter flavored with country ham for only a yearThe new Southern food movement that the restaurant in nearby Decatur helped define had not yet moved North Brooklynites werent worshiping biscuits and American barbecue had not met kimchi Only a few cooks or writers outside the South were giving serious thought to the connection between Southern food and that of West AfricaEven here in the booming cultural and commercial center of the American South diners had only begun to embrace a style of cooking that emphasized seasonality and history over carbohydrates and caricature Atlantas most popular restaurants were local chains dipped in the glitzy corporate sheen of the Buckhead neighborhood and highend steakhouses like Ruths Chris and Mortons were abundantNow as the city prepares to show off its new  billion MercedesBenz Stadium on Sunday when the New England Patriots meet the Los Angeles Rams Atlanta is a more evolved food town than it was thenNeighborhood beer bars and slick suburban dining rooms alike serve food that shows off Southern agriculture Food from the regions vast immigrant population is as celebrated as its local classicsAlthough diners remain loyal to local entrepreneurs like Fifth Group Restaurants which started opening reliable spots like South City Kitchen in the s the city is less impressed by carpetbagging chains And the ranks of talented young cooks tired of trying to compete in bigger cities continue to growStill Atlanta has yet to find its footing among the nations great restaurant cities Wyatt Williams who recently quit reviewing restaurants for The Atlanta JournalConstitution wrote in a parting column this month in Atlanta magazine that the dining scene was in a rut riding an economic boom that has spawned cynical moneygrabbing restaurants where the rooms are finely appointed the menus are deeply predictable and the cooking is barely passableStephen Satterfield a former sommelier in San Francisco who founded the food magazine Whetstone grew up in Atlanta During a recent trip home he described Atlanta as an insecure food town obsessed with how it measures up against cities with outsize culinary reputationsIt pains me to say it but here everyone is wellintentioned and there is plenty of capital and resources so I dont understand why there arent more places that feel of the moment he saidPlenty of Atlanta chefs and diners would disagree albeit politely The trick they advise visitors is drilling down into the right parts of townYouve got to get out of downtown said the chef Kevin Gillespie a former Top Chef contestant who has three restaurants here Get in your Uber and go to a neighborhood Thats where youll find the great stuff Youre going to leave the city with a completely different idea of what Atlanta really isOf all the local chefs scrambling to be part of the Super Bowl Mr Gillespie is the MVP He runs Gamechanger a concession inside the MercedesBenz Stadium where his closed on Sunday chicken sandwich  a homage to the faithbased policy that keeps ChickfilA restaurants shuttered on Sundays even Super Bowl Sundays  has helped make it the highestgrossing food vendor in the arenaHe is also one of three chefs whom Arthur Blank a founder of Home Depot who bought the Atlanta Falcons in  approved to cook on Thursday for the NFL owners dinner a traditional meal usually held at a fancy restaurant or a wellappointed home Mr Blank is staging the dinner at the National Center for Civil and Human Rights not far from the stadiumIt talks to the history of the city and the great connection the NFL has made with the players around issues surrounding social justice Mr Blank said Weve moved from protest to progressSome critics have complained that all three chefs are white men though Aaron Jefferson a general manager from the restaurant Iberian Pig who is AfricanAmerican was later added to oversee cocktails and wineMr Gillespie cautions visitors to not expect a city as explicitly Southern as say Charleston SC Its not Gone With the Wind down here he said Atlanta is a city that has always been about business Its not as Hee Hawy as people think it might beRather Atlanta is a metropolis filled with a lot of people from other places The citys population is less than  but the region which includes the sprawling suburbs is home to about  million People from small Southern towns have moved here for better jobs and others from big American cities have come seeking less stress and a lower cost of living The regions mix includes immigrants from Mexico India South Korea and VietnamThat influx feeds a mix of cuisines many of them represented in hundreds of restaurants and markets on Buford Highway the biggest concentration of which starts at the citys northeastern edge and continues for about  miles Taking measure of the highways offerings is a heroic task but good resources to consult are We Love BuHi a website and Instagram feed dedicated to the strip and the local food writer Christiane Lauterbachs dispatches on Twitter and in Atlanta magazine Two favorites are the homey Korean grandma food at Yet Tuh and the terrific sambalsauced okra and noodle and rice dishes at Food Terminal a modern Malaysian restaurant that shares a parking lot with an expansive multicultural supermarket a Chinese barbecue spot a VietCajun seafood restaurant and a tofu houseAtlanta has rarely met a restaurant trend it didnt like and right now that translates to food halls Some of the best restaurants in town have been carved out of restored industrial spaces Among them is Watchmans in the Krog Street Market a cheery Cubaninfluenced restaurant that turns sustainably harvested Southern seafood into dishes like grilled fish collars bathed in Alabama white barbecue sauce and dappled with salsa verde Its perfect daiquiris have developed a loyal followingNext door is the Ticonderoga Club a cozy restaurant whose menu ranges from  ounces of grilled sousvide chuck roast to a coconutbraised eggplant dish that the chef David Bies picked up in Bali Students of the Southern cocktail scene make regular pilgrimages to its tiny barThe grandest food hall of them all is inside the sprawling brick Ponce City Market a former Sears distribution center developed into a mixeduse complex by the team that created Chelsea Market in New YorkMany of Atlantas biggest names in food have a presence here Hugh Acheson pumps out coffee and fat squares of toast slathered with fresh local cows milk cheese and jam at Spiller Park and Hector Santiago sells a fine medianoche sandwich at El Super Pan Linton Hopkins one in the trio of chefs cooking for the NFL owners offers a stacked cheeseburger at HF Burger and fried chicken and biscuits next door at a little stand called Hops ChickenAnne Quatrano the chef who began Atlantas farmtotable era at her flagship restaurant Bacchanalia  years ago sells fresh Gulf shrimp and oysters at WH Stiles Fish CampMs Quatrano chairwoman of the James Beard Foundations awards committee remains a levelheaded fan of the citys food Like Mr Gillespie she says some of the best food is found in modest neighborhood restaurantsTheres a lot of young talent here she said Some of its raw but its still good That makes for really good dining at lot of the smaller placesOne is Banshee a boisterous restaurant inside a former lesbian bar in the charmingly scruffy East Atlanta neighborhood Tables are packed with diners who swipe fry bread through smears of pepperoni butter and debate whether the Sichuanspiced pork osso buco is better than the braised onion caramelle with braised beef cheeksAt Tiny Lous inside the newly refurbished Hotel Clermont not far from Ponce City Market Jeb Aldrich delivers a smart take on French classics and the pastry chef Claudia Martinez makes a crpes suzette cake that customers cant seem to stop talking aboutAtlanta also is a big breakfast town which is why in a few weeks Ms Quatrano will open Pancake Social a seat allday breakfast place in Ponce City Market Until then Java Jive Highland Bakery and Home Grown whose pancakes and chili cheese grits are worth enduring the inevitable line all make for a fine breakfast field tripAnd dont forget Waffle House The original restaurant in nearby Avondale Estates has been turned into the companys museum but there are plenty of others in full operation Pro tip Order your hash browns scattered smothered and covered with country ham and a pecan waffle cooked dark on the sideA hungry visitor also would do well to stroll the Atlanta BeltLine a mile loop of railroad bed that is slowly being transformed into an urban promenade not unlike the High Line in New York except with a lot more craft breweriesAlong the welldeveloped section that winds through the Old Fourth Ward youll find Nina  Rafi a new restaurant that serves a chicken parm that has passed the test of more than one New Yorker oldfashioned square pizzas topped with sizzling pepperoni cups and crunchycrusted Detroitstyle pies Expenseaccount diners can still get a taste of that Buckhead swank at Atlas in the St Regis Atlanta hotel The chef Christopher Grossman has a French Laundry pedigree and the quiet luxe dining room is hung with masterworks many of them from the art collection of Joe Lewis the billionaire behind the Tavistock Group a private investment company that owns the hotel Next door is Umi whose modern take on Japanese food would be at home in New York or Los AngelesMany visitors will be on the hunt for the kind of Southern food best eaten with your hands Barbecue is not hard to find here but Bryan Furman of Bs Cracklin Barbecue is the only pit master turning out wholehog barbecue from heirloombreed hogs The Busy Bee Caf a halfmile from the stadium has been around since the s and remains a reliable practitioner of the Southern staple known as the meat and three Go for the oxtails or the fried chicken and take whichever vegetable sides dishes the server recommends The new Southern food movement has been nurtured for  years at Miller Union which serves hyperseasonal dishes alongside the most interesting wine list in town Or head to Decatur a small city that abuts Atlanta proper and try Mr Gillespies Revival which serves the kind of food your Southern grandmother might make if she shopped only at the farmers marketOne last piece of advice Dont

student debt Andrew writes in his columnStudents were saddled with  trillion in debt last year a record high An idea called Income Share Agreements has been talked about for years as a way to alleviate that burden Under this system tuition is free but students agree to pay back a percentage of their income for several years if they get good jobs after graduationLambda School an online

Lambda which has focused on subjects like coding and data science into a multidisciplinary school offering halfyear programs in professions where there is significant hiring demand like nursing and cybersecurity Its an expansion that could be a precursor to Lambda becoming a fullscale universityThe Lambda model is being closely watched Its meant to treat students as investments rather than cash cows  and potentially lift their crippling debt loadBut it also comes with risksPrograms seeking safe investments might reverse the strides made in expanding educational opportunities for higherrisk

nearly  billion Vision Fund It values WeWork at  billion and brings SoftBanks total investment in the company to about  billionWhat could have been Under one possibility SoftBank would have spent  billion to buy out all of WeWorks other investors and injected  billion more in the company Several factors led to a smaller deal including market volatility and the reluctance of investors to sell shares to SoftBankThe back story SoftBank one of WeWorks biggest boosters has made multiple investments in the company Much of its capital in WeWork is from the Vision Fund which is largely backed by

Katz of Harvard said then that the gig economy accounted for nearly  percent of American workers in  up from  percent a decade earlierBut yesterday Mr Krueger and Mr Katz walked back their estimate saying that the nontraditional slice of the labor market probably went up only one or two percentage points And such work still takes a back seat to the standard singleemployer job according to more recent evidence including a study from the Labor Department released last yearWhy the disparity Mr Krueger and Mr Katz say that After the recession the labor market was on shaky ground Workers needed

WednesdayYou can find live updates throughout the day at nytimescomdealbookWed love your feedback Please email thoughts and suggestions to businessnytimescomAdvertisementAdvertisementSupported byGood Sunday morning Was this email forwarded to you Sign up hereThe week of the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum is a fire hose of news Headlines predictions sightings and tidbits that months and years later are recognized as the flash point for much larger shifts and trends can often get overlookedTo help you sort through it all weve put together this crib sheet of everything that we think was important that happened here in Davos Yes Im writing this from Davos on my way homeBefore we get into the substance a couple of observationsThe World Economic Forum has traditionally brought together the worlds top political and business leaders But this year the political leaders were largely absent  remaining in their home countries to handle crises largely of their own making President Trump with the shutdown and Prime Minister Theresa May with BrexitThe surprise guest this year was Tim Cook Apples chief executive making his first appearance it may be an indication of Apples increasing dependence on foreign markets for growthThe topic du jour besides the shutdown was a debate over where the global economy was headed Chief executives professed confidence that their earnings would continue apace while economists and investors talked about the prospect of a recession in  And others like Ray Dalio  and Seth Klarman who did not attend but whose annual letter was a constant talking point  worried about social unrest Interestingly Dr Doom  Nouriel Roubini  was actually upbeatA Chinese chief executive described his countrys economy as ugly  he used that world repeatedly  suggesting that the underlying foundation there was more fragile than most economists acknowledge That could lead to weakness in China spreading to the rest of the world And the general sense is that while the US and China may reach a trade dtente we might be headed for a decadeslong economic cold warLarry Finks letter and the concept of ESG shorthand for environmental social and governance got a lot of discussion this year  it felt like it might be a tipping point in the dialogue European companies are still more interested in ESG than US companies but it feels like a trend that isnt going away TPGs Rise Fund started a new company Y Analytics to measure ESG Bono a board member of Rise was on hand to talk about impact investing and to support his Red brand which he started a decade ago in Davos DealBook broke that story at the time as well as his One franchise Matt Damon was in town to raise money for his waterorg which is turning into a quite successful story side note Mr Damon had to borrow a suit because his bag got lost by Swiss Air Jane Goodall was also in Davos  and let me say that she is as nice as she is important Even the Vatican sent a delegation to talk about conscious and inclusive capitalismAnd Rebecca Blumenstein the deputy managing editor of The New York Times interviewed Bill Gates on Twitter about his work around the globeTodays DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in Davos Switzerland Stephen Grocer in New York and Tiffany Hsu and Gregory Schmidt in ParisThe soap opera of tariff negotiations has riveted economists and executives Will Beijing keep its promises Will Washington cooperateBut the real drama is not about trade but about technology many in Davos have said The brewing conflict could affect generations and disrupt the world order according to Fred Kempe the chief executive of the think tank Atlantic Council He wroteThe growing danger is that the tech race could become the primary battleground in a struggle between democracy and autocracy  and between China and the US The dangers of a technological Cold War a zerosum contest for global dominance that ultimately separates Chinese and US tech sectors from each other and divides up the world are increasingWhats the worry The billionaire George Soros said that artificial intelligence when in the hands of authoritarian regimes was a mortal threat to the world He cited China which is developing a social credit system that would use personal data to judge an individuals trustworthiness as an example President Xi Jinping could eventually have total control over the people making him the most dangerous opponent of open societies Mr Soros saidWhat do the Chinese think The technology industry relies heavily on global interactions and is probably suffering the most right now said Ken Hu the deputy chairman of Huawei The Chinese telecommunications company has been accused by multiple nations including the US of violating trade rules Other players such as the Chinese stateowned oil and gas company Sinopec say they expect Chinese companies to scale back foreign investment  steps already taken by Alibaba and by GAC Motor Last year nearly  percent of Chinese CEOs considered the US to be the most important foreign market this year only  percent feel the same according to one survey published this past weekHope for resolution Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said via video link that Washington was willing to play nice with Beijing if China pledged to protect intellectual property At a dinner in Davos a top Chinese regulator heard complaints from international business leaders about the ownership structure of stateowned enterprises and about the Made in China  effort which aims to take the lead in industries such as artificial intelligence and roboticsBut China wants its space Vice President Wang Qishan said in a speech that it is imperative to respect national sovereignty and refrain from seeking technological hegemony He addedWe need to respect the independent choices of model of technology management and of public policies made by countries and their right to participating in the global technological governance system as equalsA recession may not be coming this year but neither is a boom Greg Ip of the WSJ writesThe International Monetary Fund downgraded its  forecast for global growth to  percent Thats a respectable number he writes but the world is struggling to sustain even that muted paceThe reason The world cannot tolerate interest rates as high as it once did The neutral interest rate  one that is high enough to contain inflation yet low enough to avoid recession  is much lower than beforeThe underlying cause As aging workers retire and birthrates drop the labor force has grown more slowly Productivity has also eked out smaller gains than in the pastThe upshot Central banks need to proceed carefully because a little fiscal tightening goes a long wayMore on the global economy Ray Dalio founder and chairman of the hedge fund Bridgewater said he foresaw slower growth rates in the US and Europe France is sticking to a  percent economic growth forecast for  the French finance minister Bruno Le Maire said Christine Lagarde the managing director of the IMF warned against an overreliance on central banks urging countries to strengthen their economies through fiscal and structural changes In the absence of world leaders the atmosphere was downbeatAlexandria OcasioCortez wasnt in Davos this week It just felt like she wasThe New York representatives proposal to impose a  percent tax rate on income above  million came up frequently among the uberwealthy in attendanceIn those elite circles filled with people whose fortunes have soared in recent years the idea was not popularMichael Dell the billionaire founder of Dell Technologies is not a fan for one Scott Minerd the chief investment officer of Guggenheim Partners said the concept was scary Glenn Hutchins the chairman of North Island and a cofounder of Silver Lake Partners suggested that it was an attempt to score political points and that it would probably be unsuccessful Ken Moelis the chief executive of the investment bank Moelis  Company said it would be disastrous for the economyStephen Schwarzman the billionaire chief executive of Blackstone said he was wildly enthusiastic about Ms OcasioCortezs pitch He was being sarcasticBut as the economy slows and  election talk surges taxing the rich is a topic that will most likely continue to surface Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts a Democratic candidate for president proposed a socalled ultramillionaire tax this week on the  wealthiest families in the country including President TrumpsStill top earners would probably figure out how to sidestep such rules Mr Minerd saidThe political pendulum is swinging The conservatives found out theyre being held hostage by the extreme right Now the Democrats are going to find out theyre being held hostage by the extreme leftGlobalization had some powerful defenders in Davos with world leaders imploring delegates not to abandon postwar principles of international integrationSeveral took jabs at the absent President Trump without mentioning him by name criticizing his America First foreign policy and his habit of provoking trade disputes The vice president of China Wang Qishan whose own country has been accused of running roughshod over foreign competitors and global business rules nonetheless condemned practices of the strong bullying the weak and selfclaimed supremacyCarrie Lam the chief executive of Hong Kong said that certain countries were drifting from the multilateral framework of the past few decadesIf that is no longer the mainstream we could be in trouble she saidChancellor Angela Merkel of Germany who leads a country that is deeply reliant on international trade and increasingly surrounded by neighbors confronted by protectionist tendencies urged Western powers to act against the fragmentation of the international architectureShe said that global organizations such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank should be reformed and that countries should embrace compromise She addedI think we should understand our national interest in a way that we think about the interests of others and from that create winwin situations that are the precondition for multilateralismShinzo Abe the prime minister of Japan pledged his countrys support for the free open and rulesbased international order He called on forum participants to rebuild trust toward the system for international tradeWorld leaders called for more regulation Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan said his country would push for a new international system for the oversight of data useHis proposal was echoed by others The South African president Cyril Ramaphosa said African Union leaders would discuss greater oversight of the tech sector at a meeting early next month Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany cited a need for the European Union to have a common digital market Vice President Wang Qishan of China also said that more international cooperation in regulating the market was requiredTalk focused on global governance data privacy and the impact of artificial intelligence but there was no consensus on what approach to take Some official sessions tried to put a positive spin on the effects of technological advances but the optimism seemed out of step with public concern about the disruptive effect on privacy and politicsTech leaders make the rounds On his first trip to the forum Tim Cook the Apple chief executive met with world leaders including President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil and Dubais crown prince Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid alMaktoum Sheryl Sandberg the chief operating officer of Facebook acknowledged that her company needed to earn back the trust of the public Microsofts chief executive Satya Nadella said that as facial recognition technology grew he would welcome regulation that will help the marketplace not be a race to the bottomEnvironmental issues took center stage with world leaders and celebrities weighing in and new partnerships being formed One of the biggest initiatives announced at the forum was an alternative recycling platform called Loop which seeks to change the way consumers buy brandname productsThe concept The project revives the milkman concept in which products are delivered in reusable containers that are returned to the manufacturerThe partners Some of the largest consumer goods companies  including Danone Mars Petcare Mondelez International Nestl PepsiCo Procter  Gamble and Unilever  are working together on the project as a way to limit wasteThe pitchman Tom Szaky founder and chief executive of the recycling company TerraCycle headed to Davos two years ago to meet with the leaders of packaged goods companies and push his big ideaClimate concerns dominated much of the discussion elsewhere at the gathering In an interview with Prince William the naturalist David Attenborough took world leaders to task for waiting too long to address climate change Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand joined the chorus urging her global counterparts to think about the role they play in addressing climate change while Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan called for action on the issue The singer Bono poked fun at sustainable development goals saying The SDGs it does sound like a sexually transmitted disease doesnt it An expected drop in private jet traffic to Davos this year could be a sign that participants are taking the environmental impact of their travel more seriously Greta Thunberg a yearold climate activist from Sweden gave a

Alex Welsh for The New York TimesThe tech giant records peoples locations worldwide Now investigators are using it to find suspects and witnesses near crimes running the risk of snaring the innocentBy JENNIFER VALENTINODeVRIES APRIL  When detectives in a Phoenix suburb arrested a warehouse worker in a murder investigation last December they credited a new technique with breaking open the case after other leads went coldThe police told the suspect Jorge Molina they had data tracking his phone to the site where a man was shot nine months earlier They had made the discovery after obtaining a search warrant that required Google to provide information on all devices it recorded near the killing potentially capturing the whereabouts of anyone in the areaInvestigators also had other circumstantial evidence including security video of someone firing a gun from a white Honda Civic the same model that Mr Molina owned though they could not see the license plate or attackerBut after he spent nearly a week in jail the case against Mr Molina fell apart as investigators learned new information and released him Last month the police arrested another man his mothers exboyfriend who had sometimes used Mr Molinas carThe warrants which draw on an enormous Google database employees call Sensorvault turn the business of tracking cellphone users locations into a digital dragnet for law enforcement In an era of ubiquitous data gathering by tech companies it is just the latest example of how personal information  where you go who your friends are what you read eat and watch and when you do it  is being used for purposes many people never expected As privacy concerns have mounted among consumers policymakers and regulators tech companies have come under intensifying scrutiny over their data collection practicesThe Arizona case demonstrates the promise and perils of the new investigative technique whose use has risen sharply in the past six months according to Google employees familiar with the requests It can help solve crimes But it can also snare innocent peopleTechnology companies have for years responded to court orders for specific users information The new warrants go further suggesting possible suspects and witnesses in the absence of other clues Often Google employees said the company responds to a single warrant with location information on dozens or hundreds of devicesLaw enforcement officials described the method as exciting but cautioned that it was just one toolIt doesnt pop out the answer like a ticker tape saying this guys guilty said Gary Ernsdorff a senior prosecutor in Washington State who has worked on several cases involving these warrants Potential suspects must still be fully investigated he added Were not going to charge anybody just because Google said they were thereIt is unclear how often these search requests have led to arrests or convictions because many of the investigations are still open and judges frequently seal the warrants The practice was first used by federal agents in  according to Google employees and first publicly reported last year in North Carolina It has since spread to local departments across the country including in California Florida Minnesota and Washington This year one Google employee said the company received as many as  requests in one week Google declined to confirm precise numbersThe technique illustrates a phenomenon privacy advocates have long referred to as the if you build it they will come principle  anytime a technology company creates a system that could be used in surveillance law enforcement inevitably comes knocking Sensorvault according to Google employees includes detailed location records involving at least hundreds of millions of devices worldwide and dating back nearly a decadeThe new orders sometimes called geofence warrants specify an area and a time period and Google gathers information from Sensorvault about the devices that were there It labels them with anonymous ID numbers and detectives look at locations and movement patterns to see if any appear relevant to the crime Once they narrow the field to a few devices they think belong to suspects or witnesses Google reveals the users names and other informationThere are privacy concerns that we all have with our phones being tracked  and when those kinds of issues are relevant in a criminal case that should give everybody serious pause said Catherine Turner a Minnesota defense lawyer who is handling a case involving the techniqueInvestigators who spoke with The New York Times said they had not sent geofence warrants to companies other than Google and Apple said it did not have the ability to perform those searches Google would not provide details on Sensorvault but Aaron Edens an intelligence analyst with the sheriffs office in San Mateo County Calif who has examined data from hundreds of phones said most Android devices and some iPhones he had seen had this data available from GoogleIn a statement Richard Salgado Googles director of law enforcement and information security said that the company tried to vigorously protect the privacy of our users while supporting the important work of law enforcement He added that it handed over identifying information only where legally requiredMr Molina  said he was shocked when the police told him they suspected him of murder and he was surprised at their ability to arrest him based largely on dataI just kept thinking Youre innocent so youre going to get out he said but he added that he worried that it could take months or years to be exonerated I was scared he saidDetectives have used the warrants for help with robberies sexual assaults arsons and murders Last year federal agents requested the data to investigate a string of bombings around Austin TexThe unknown suspect had left package bombs at three homes killing two people when investigators obtained a warrantThey were looking for phones Google had recorded around the bombing locationsThe specific data resulting from the warrants in the Austin case remains sealed This illustration is based on the warrants description of the process but the dots do not represent actual phone locationsAfter receiving a warrant Google gathers location information from its database Sensorvault and sends it to investigators with each device identified by an anonymous ID codeInvestigators review the data and look for patterns in the locations of devices that could suggest possible suspects They also look for devices that appear in multiple areas targeted by the warrantThey can then get further location data on devices that appear relevant allowing them to see device movement beyond the original area defined in the warrantAfter detectives narrow the field to a few devices they think may belong to suspects or witnesses Google reveals the name email address and other data associated with the deviceRich Harris  The New York TimesAustin investigators obtained another warrant after a fourth bomb exploded But the suspect killed himself three days after that bomb as they were closing in Officials at the time said surveillance video and receipts for suspicious purchases helped identify himAn FBI spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the response from Google was helpful or timely saying that any question about the technique touches on areas we dont discussOfficers who have used the warrants said they showed promise in finding suspects as well as witnesses who may have been near the crime without realizing it The searches may also be valuable in cold cases A warrant last year in Florida for example sought information on a murder from  A Florida Department of Law Enforcement spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the data was helpfulThe approach has yielded useful information even if it wasnt what broke the case open investigators said In a home invasion in Minnesota for example Google data showed a phone taking the path of the likely intruder according to a news report and police documents But detectives also cited other leads including a confidential informant in developing suspects Four people were charged in federal courtAccording to several current and former Google employees the Sensorvault database was not designed for the needs of law enforcement raising questions about its accuracy in some situationsThough Googles data cache is enormous it doesnt sweep up every phone said Mr Edens the California intelligence analyst And even if a location is recorded every few minutes that may not coincide with a shooting or an assaultGoogle often doesnt provide information right away investigators said The Google unit handling the requests has struggled to keep up so it can take weeks or months for a response In the Arizona investigation police received data six months after sending the warrant In a different Minnesota case this fall it came in four weeksBut despite the drawbacks detectives noted how precise the data was and how it was collected even when people werent making calls or using apps  both improvements over tracking that relies on cell towersIt shows the whole pattern of life said Mark Bruley the deputy police chief in Brooklyn Park Minn where investigators have been using the technique since this fall Thats the game changer for law enforcementLocation data is a lucrative business  and Google is by far the biggest player propelled largely by its Android phones It uses the data to power advertising tailored to a persons location part of a more than  billion market for locationbased ads last yearIn  the company introduced Location History a feature for users who wanted to see where they had been Sensorvault stores information on anyone who has opted in allowing regular collection of data from GPS signals cellphone towers nearby WiFi devices and Bluetooth beaconsPeople who turn on the feature can see a timeline of their activity and get recommendations based on it Google apps prompt users to enable Location History for things like traffic alerts Information in the database is held indefinitely unless the user deletes itWe citizens are giving this stuff away said Mr Ernsdorff the Washington State prosecutor adding that if companies were collecting data law enforcement should be able to obtain a court order to use itCurrent and former Google employees said they were surprised by the warrants Brian McClendon who led the development of Google Maps and related products until  said he and other engineers had assumed the police would seek data only on specific people The new technique he said seems like a fishing expeditionThe practice raises novel legal issues according to Orin Kerr a law professor at the University of Southern California and an expert on criminal law in the digital ageOne concern the privacy of innocent people scooped up in these searches Several law enforcement officials said the information remained sealed in their jurisdictions but not in every stateIn Minnesota for example the name of an innocent man was released to a local journalist after it became part of the police record Investigators had his information because he was within  feet of a burglary Reached by a reporter the man said he was surprised about the release of his data and thought he might have appeared because he was a cabdriver I drive everywhere he saidThese searches also raise constitutional questions The Fourth Amendment says a warrant must request a limited search and establish probable cause that evidence related to a crime will be foundWarrants reviewed by The Times frequently established probable cause by explaining that most Americans owned cellphones and that Google held location data on many of these phones The areas they targeted ranged from single buildings to multiple blocks and most sought data over a few hours In the Austin case warrants covered several dozen houses around each bombing location for times ranging from  hours to a week It wasnt clear whether Google responded to all the requests and multiple officials said they had seen the company push back on broad searchesLast year the Supreme Court ruled that a warrant was required for historical data about a persons cellphone location over weeks but the court has not ruled on anything like geofence searches including a technique that pulls information on all phones registered to a cell towerGoogles legal staff decided even before the  ruling that the company would require warrants for location inquiries and it crafted the procedure that first reveals only anonymous dataNormally we think of the judiciary as being the overseer but as the technology has gotten more complex courts have had a harder and harder time playing that role said Jennifer Granick surveillance and cybersecurity counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union Were depending on companies to be the intermediary between people and the governmentIn several cases reviewed by The Times a judge approved the entire procedure in a single warrant relying on investigators assurances that they would seek data for only the most relevant devices Google responds to those orders but Mr Kerr said it was unclear whether multistep warrants should pass legal musterSome jurisdictions require investigators to return to a judge and obtain a second warrant before getting identifying information With another warrant investigators can obtain more extensive data including months of location patterns and even emailsInvestigators in Arizona have never publicly disclosed a likely motive in the killing of Joseph Knight the crime for which Mr Molina was arrested In a court document they described Mr Knight a yearold aircraft repair company employee as having no known history of drug use or gang activityDetectives sent the geofence warrant to Google soon after the murder and received data from four devices months later One device a phone Google said was linked to Mr Molinas account appeared to follow the path of the gunmans car as seen on video His carrier also said the phone was associated with a tower in roughly the same area and his Google history showed a search about local shootings the day after the attackAfter his arrest Mr Molina told officers that Marcos Gaeta his mothers exboyfriend had sometimes taken his car The Times found a traffic ticket showing that Mr Gaeta  had driven that car without a license Mr Gaeta also had a lengthy criminal recordWhile Mr Molina was in jail a friend told his public defender Jack Litwak that she was with him at his home about the time of the shooting and she and others provided texts and Uber receipts to bolster his case His home where he lives with his mother and three siblings is about two miles from the murder sceneMr Litwak said his investigation found that Mr Molina had sometimes signed in to other peoples phones to check his Google account That could lead someone to appear in two places at once though it was not clear whether that happened in this caseMr Gaeta was arrested in California on an Arizona warrant He was then charged in a separate California homicide from  Officials said that case would probably delay his extradition to ArizonaA police spokesman said new information came to light after Mr Molinas arrest but the department would not comment furtherMonths after his release Mr Molina was having trouble getting back on his feet After being arrested at work a Macys warehouse he lost his job His car was impounded for investigation and then repossessedThe investigators had good intentions in using the technique Mr Litwak said But he added theyre hyping it up to be this new DNA type of forensic evidence and its just notApril  May

to get off the beaten path and into the islandBy Sebastian ModakIf this is a Monday night its hard to imagine what Friday looks like About  people are spilling out of a club onto Avenida Eduardo Conde in the Santurce district of San Juan The space Im in has limited seating but the stools are empty anyway because everyone is standing One window sells fluffy fistsized empanadillas and stacks of lightly salted tostones while another one hands over cans of Medalla beer at a furious pace Everyone is here for bomba and plena two distinct but closely linked Puerto Rican musical traditions that can trace their roots to the African slaves brought to the island starting in the th centuryThe first set is all plena A dozen men fill the stage their fingers ricocheting off circular pandereta drums providing a bedrock for the callandresponse vocal lines The lyrics are largely improvised and often lewd and full of thinly veiled social and political commentary There are repeated mentions of the venue were in La Terraza de Bonanza and calls to dance la plena and love la isla Judging by the expressions on the faces of the people around me the lyrics hold several inside jokes that fly right over my headAfter about an hour theres a minute break and the set changes to bomba an even older musical tradition and a kind of cultural parent to plena anchored by barrellike drums Women take center stage A trio of vocalists face the drummers and a revolving cast of dancers leap twirl grin shout and have me so transfixed that its a full  minutes before I realize I forgot to hit the record button on my cameraI came to Puerto Rico my first stop as this years  Places Traveler hoping to see an island well on its way to recovery a year and a half after Hurricane Maria I knew I would see progress especially when compared to the fresh devastation that my predecessor Jada Yuan saw just five months after the hurricane when she visited the island What I didnt expect to see were the omnipresent smiles the sense of optimism shared by so many people I met from pig roasters to young entrepreneurs and from the meticulously manicured cobblestoned streets of Old San Juan to the rollercoaster hills in the center of the island Born in the United States to a Colombian mother and an Indian father Sebastian moved every few years during his childhood Read more about our  Places Traveler Throughout my six days on the island a single sentence spoken to me by a yearold in the oceanhugging neighborhood of La Perla just below Old San Juan was on repeat in my mind La vida contina or Life goes on The ensemble I saw at La Terraza where it plays every Monday night is more than a bar band Its a movement called Compartir de Plena or Sharing Plena Led by Alfredo Emerson and Axel Cotto the group started five years ago in the northern coastal town of Catao as a way to teach young people free of charge to play bomba and plena music After Hurricane Maria hit the group waited just two weeks before putting on a show in its hometown as a way to lift the spirits of a devastated population One week after that Compartir de Plena were back at La Terraza de Bonanza where a generator kept the beers cold and the microphones on for months These days the group sometimes streams the Terraza performances live on Instagram and Facebook Mr Emerson told me when I connected with him days after the performance Its to bring happiness to people to see and hear our native music not just here in Puerto Rico but also in other countries around the world he said La Terraza de Bonanza was the first stop in my mission to explore the island of Puerto Rico beyond the regular tourism routes I didnt make it to a beach until my last full day I never made it El Yunque the giant National Forest that attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors a year I didnt have time to hop over to Vieques the speck of land that sits off the main islands east coast like a sideways teardrop Thats not to say these arent attractions for good reasons but I came wanting to see other parts of the island to see if those places had rebounded in the same way as the cruise ship ports and tour bus destinations So I put the little time I had on the island largely into the hands of some young energetic Puerto Ricans I met  one introducing me to anotherLoreana Gonzlez Lazzarini  is from Isabela a town on the islands northwestern coast One day she mapped out a trail of chinchorros rural roadside restaurants for me stretching from the outskirts of San Juan to Orocovis in the islands center The night before my road trip speaking of the need for tourists to see the island beyond San Juan Ms Gonzlez Lazzarini told me I want tourists to experience the people of Puerto Rico Puerto Ricans main concern is always Are you having a good timeI spent the day alone weaving through the winding narrow roads that snake up and down junglecovered hills into the interior There were clear signs of the hurricanes devastation I saw the infamous blue tarps still covering the tops of houses whose roofs had been blown off a year and a half ago Rounding one corner I saw a pile of tree parts and crossing right in front of it a stray puppy dragging the beheaded carcass of an iguana a poignant if a little heavyhanded symbol for the brutality of natureSan CristbalAtlanticOceanCastillo SanFelipe del Morrooldsan juanC

yunquenationalforestIsabelaManatpuertoricoOrocovisCayeyviequesCaribbean Sea milesBy The New York TimesThat same day I saw the immense generosity that has carried the island through the hurricane and other crises over the past several years I had made the mistake of trying to go on a chinchorreo on a Wednesday  for Puerto Ricans it quickly became clear thats more of an activity for weekends But one after another the chinchorro owners whose places were closed until the weekend rattled off recommendations for spots further down the road that might be open When I finally found a place for a late lunch  Roka Dura an openair restaurant at the top of a hill overlooking Orocovis  I ate a plate of country specialties chicken chicharrn fried till the skin cracked off the meat like an extra greasy potato chip alcapurrias fritters stuffed with mashed green plantains and ground meat and longaniza a Puerto Rican take on chorizo After the meal the server who had been making sure I liked everything came over with a single sprig of fresh mint as a palate cleanser I know its organic because my neighbor grows it she saidIt took me a few days to realize it but Ms Gonzlez Lazzarinis own story is one that I heard in some form or another again and again during my time in Puerto RicoI cant think of my life without thinking of Hurricane Maria  it changed me she said Instead of BC and AD here its Before Maria and After Maria BM and AMIn Ms Gonzlez Lazzarinis case BM meant working at a major consulting firm in New York and then as a private consultant in Puerto Rico AM her clients could not pay for consulting fees Ms Gonzlez Lazzarini instead worked with a local nonprofit to distribute generators to businesses on Calle Loiza a rapidly upandcoming strip of bars and restaurants in Santurce Then she took a position with the recently established COR a local government agency working on reconstruction recovery and resilience following the hurricaneThe hurricane took so much away from us but it gave us something too Ms Gonzlez Lazzarini said It showed us how we can come together and organize as a people on our ownDriving in the countryside is not as much of a whiteknuckle experience as I had been led to believe Still you will find roads that are temporarily one lane traffic lights that are out and trucks in a rush I found driving on the conservative side got me farther than trying to match the speed and daring of those who knew where they were going better than I didPower outages can still happen  and they can be unpredictable My Airbnb along with the rest of the neighborhood in Isla Verde lost power for about six hours on one of the days I was there Luckily both power banks Im traveling with were fully charged so I could venture out for the duration with full juice on my phoneUber is easy affordable and the best way to get around if you want to leave the rental car at the hotel I often left mine behind when I was going into San Juan or when I was going out at night to avoid parking headaches and driving at night For Xavier Pacheco  a globally recognized chef AM was about finally making the leap to what he considers his lifes work a farmtotable operation hes starting with two chefpartners that will be in his words our farm with our animals and a menu that comes from what we harvest He feels a magnetic tug away from the more established centers of tourism on which he has relied He estimates that in his previous venture the wildly successful Jaquita Baya  percent of his customers were touristsIm refocusing on taking my product out of San Juan he told me as I rode shotgun in his pickup truck past the Carrazo Dam about  miles from Old San Juan The San Juan metro area is so saturated There are a lot of places outside that area that are really cool  tourists should understand how much there is to see Put another way You have these people going to Seor Frogs and its like Whats the point As a tourist you could close your eyes in there and know your way to the bathroomOn my first day with Mr Pacheco I had one of two lunches at one of the really cool places he mentioned I was hungry for lechn the whole slowroasted pig that is famous in the islands interior so we stopped at Lechonera Angelitos Place It is part of a strip that Mr Pacheco calls a mini Guavate referring to the section of the town of Cayey thats become famous for the density of its lechoneras This place is better Mr Pacheco promised I cant say how it compares with every other pig roast on the island but it is hard to imagine anything more decadent than those chunks of meat slick with melted fat and layers of thick pig skin roasted to the consistency of hard candy After our meal Mr Pacheco introduced me to Junior Rivera who has been running Angelitos for  years Mr Rivera told me that he starts the roasting process at  am every day and is in bed by  pm and that his recipe is basically a product of discovering what he likes His AM story We were closed for two days The day of the hurricane and the day after it when the roads were closed he saidOn my second day with Mr Pacheco my last on the island he took me to the northern central town of Manat On the way we stopped for a breakfast of  what else  more lechn this time at the famous Rancho de Apa in Guaynabo In Manat we met with Efrn Robles who with his wife Angelie Martinez run Los Frutos del Guacabo an organic farm that runs on an ondemand model in collaboration with local chefs Need more arugula The farm will up production Looking for grassfed goat Mr Robles is in the middle of an experimentation with crossbreeding to find the perfect balance between the longevity of the animal and the quality of meat As we walked Mr Robles picked soontobe garnishes the color of lipstick that tasted like black pepper and bright yellow bulbs that left a tingling sensation on my tongue After the hurricane flattened the farm it took Mr Robles  days to get back on his feet with some help from Jos Andrss World Central Kitchen Now hes hoping to expand potentially even into hospitality When asked if after the hurricane he had ever considered taking his business or his expertise elsewhere its a quick No I lived in Delaware for two years he told me as we took the fiveminute drive from his farm to a pristine stretch of beach Ill never forget the blizzard of Even Ms Gonzlez Lazzarini and Mr Pacheco admitted I needed to spend at least half a day in Old San Juan home to sprawling colonialera fortresses like San Felipe del Morro and San Cristbal Beyond its Instagramfriendly beauty the area packed with cruise ship tours the day I went is itself a symbol of posthurricane middebt crisis resilience Look at Old San Juan today and apart from the political graffiti that speckles its outskirts you would never imagine a hurricane that claimed the lives of almost  people had made landfall just a year and a half earlier Its in large part because of tourism The brightly colored facades of Old San Juan were somewhat controversially a top priority in the rebuilding effort given that they are the main source of tourist dollars on the island Tourist numbers are slowly creeping back to their prehurricane levels in Puerto Rico even if most of those people are sticking to the same spots But theres at least one place thats received a flood of newcomers El Centro de Bellas Artes Luis A Ferr Thats because for three weeks in January the fine arts complex was playing host to Hamilton with LinManuel Miranda reprising his role as the title character for the first time in two and a half years I went on a Thursday night during the last week of the shows run The crowd was electric even before the performance began a steady din of excited whispers filling the spaceWhen Mr Miranda stepped into the spotlight to the words Alexander Hamilton the ensemble had to pause for a full two minutes to allow the standing ovation to pass Every major number ended with raucous cheering But a different energy settled on the theater in the opening moments of Hurricane in which Mr Miranda sings In the eye of a hurricane everything is quiet And it was Even the applause at the end of the song seemed more subdued more somber By the end of the next number though the crowd was smiling whooping and loudly cheering once againAdvertisement

Illustrations by EDEN WEINGART JAN  The man on the train platform who spoke only Hindi looked at my ticket and chuckled This had been one of those days when mistakes piled up faster than I could track them I had tarried too long in Chandigarh India and the fourhour taxi ride back to New Delhi now promised to be a sixhour slog in traffic No problem I could take a train instead I thought only to run out of money on my cellphone SIM card just as I was booking a lastminute ticket I hopped in a tuk tuk and raced to the station and got there five minutes after the last fast train had left for the nightWhen I started this harebrained experiment in January to visit and report on the Timess entire  Places to Go in  list I thought that by stop  for sure Id be the Wonder Woman of travel blocking mishaps with a flick of my wrist Instead I was staring down a  am arrival in New Delhi before having to force myself awake for a morning plane to BhutanBut there was the man on the platform  a waiter for the railway whose job it is to pass out dinners  flashing a gesture that seemed to mean Dont worry Ive got you I had bought an unreserved ticket which I thought was for people whod had trouble purchasing online but which really meant Id likely have to stand for five hours But when the train pulled in the man talked to the conductor and ushered me into a sleeper car Englishspeakers all around jumped in to interpret Seven dollars in fines and upgrade fees later I was sitting in a cluster of bunks with four boisterous something women from New Delhi The words dream job come up whenever I tell people about the  Places project Like the thousands of others who answered that fateful job listing  travel the world for The New York Times  I had a vision of winning a journalism lottery of getting to leave behind my routine to swim in waterfalls in Australia paraglide off mountaintops in Switzerland and eat at Michelinstarred restaurants in France And I got to do all of those things for which I am incredibly grateful From New Orleans to Laos we offer a starter kit for exploring the worldIve also had to face reality that constant travel  alone  on an illogical route no sane human would plan might take a toll on my physical and mental wellbeing That The Times quite reasonably expected me to do work and file stories which meant spending a lot of time in beautiful destinations in front of a computer That Id make gaffes along the way and have to weather the sting of valid criticism That Id meet new friends only to have to say goodbye a few days later And that Id be mostly celibate miss the births of four close friends babies forget to call my parents That Id reach the end and all Id want is to do it over againI started out arms laden with recommendations and highlights determined to do every one of them Eat all the food in New Orleans hike to the sea cave everyone goes to in Tasmania visit every mountain temple in Pyeongchang South Korea Yet what I remember most are the small wins and human connections The kind people and delicious salchipapas deconstructed hot dogs with French fries at a Peruvian food truck on the highway outside Disney Springs Fla The man in Lucerne Switzerland who returned my laptop when I left it on a bridge in the rain That army of concerned citizens in ChandigarhTrust has been the throughline that has emerged from it all Trust in myself trust in the fundamental goodness of people trust that as a solo female traveler I could watch my back without walling myself off from experiencesYou see it was a dream job Its just that my idea of what made this dream job dreamy has changed so muchI was going on  feeling sad about being single and contemplating a sabbatical from New York Magazine where Id worked for  years when I clicked on The New York Times home page and saw something curious A job listing in the mostread articles list Did I want to travel around the world and document it it asked Sure I did So did pretty much everyone By the time I saw the listing  people had already applied The final number they tell me was The odds were so impossible and the selection process so mysterious that I couldnt allow myself to get too excited And then I got the incredible phone call telling me I had three weeks to pack up my apartment say goodbye to everyone I knew quit a workplace that felt like family and set out for a year on the road All through my s and s I had watched friends move to London or West Africa or quit their jobs and travel and wondered how they possibly had the confidence to do it I had made the huge scary leap from New Mexico to New York City after college because it was the one big city I knew and I had family there And then I stayed at the same workplace building a career I loved while living in a series of closetsize walkups and earning barely enough money to go home for the holidaysWhy do you think they picked you interviewers often asked me and I didnt know the answer I suspected it was because I hadnt done anything like this before Id never been brave enough And maybe I could be a representative for those who didnt think they were brave enough eitherGetting on that first plane to New Orleans I felt as though I were stepping into an unknowable void from which there was no return The first few months were tough Five stops in and behind on my writing I wound up in Bogot Colombia still needing to file my articles on Montgomery Ala stop No  and Disney Springs Fla stop No  I spent three straight days in my Bogot hotel losing precious time to report on and photograph the city The one day I got outside I took a taxi  minutes to the museum I wanted to see and realized Id left my wallet back at the hotelAnd I just lost it I called a dear friend of mine who works for The Wall Street Journal and has made many a global move and sobbedI know this feels daunting right now she said but you have to remember that a year is shortI argued that this was the longest year of my life and it was only February and she didnt know what she was talking about But the saying stuck in my head and acquired new meaning whenever Id hear myself complain about this wondrous opportunityFreezing down to your bones and sleeping in a bythehour motel where you shower while sitting on the toilet Suck it up Youre about to see the rainbow hills of Zhangye China A year is shortFreezing again and dinner is bar nuts because you waited past  pm when all the restaurants close You just rode a horse in Iceland A year is shortCar got towed in Auckland New Zealand while on your third trip to the Chinese consulate trying to get a visa But youre in New Zealand And youre going to China A year is shortA year is short and a year is not enoughA year is short and I was strong and the risk had always been worth itMy hour travel day from Kanazawa Japan to India was one of the trickiest of the year and I had gamed it out to the minute A  am taxi to the Kanazawa station where Id pick up luggage Id left in a locker a sixhour train ride with two transfers arriving at the Osaka airport with a generous two and a half hours to check in for my flight Id filled out the longest form in the world to get my India eVisa and paid to get it expedited And I had a ticket for onward travel to Bhutan having anticipating that India would require me to show Id booked travel to exit the country before I could get on the plane in JapanThen the AirAsia ticket counter woman asked if I had a paper copy of my eVisa I hadnt thought to print it out Nowhere else in the world in  stops had I needed to show anything but my phone at a checkin counterShe couldnt let me on the flight without it she said Checkin was closing in  minutes After a mad scramble I ended up in line at a Family Mart convenience store behind a woman printing out what looked like a page dissertation watching as the clock ticked down The complicated printer setup required downloading an app to my phone and by the time I had printed it out Id missed the deadline by  minutes I raced up two flights of escalators and down several long corridors carrying the bags I hadnt been allowed to check prepared to beg the ticket agent for leniency By some miracle the line was still open I handed everything over smiling with relief and then looked up to see my plane was on a hour delaySo like any reasonable person I went back to the Family Mart and bought a basket full of sushi snacks and teaflavored Kit Kats plus a beer to take the edge off Id estimate that at least  percent of this job was dealing with logistics And I even had a helper back in New York who would research hotels and flights for meEvery country is different with different currencies and different languages a different pace and different cultural customs An unreserved train ticket means one thing in India and another in Spain Had I done cursory research on the dualisland African nation of So Tom and Prncipe I would have known to show up with a wad of euros because the society is completely cashbased and there are no ATMs foreigners can use At first I tried following travel conventions that had worked for me on oneoff trips booking planes and hotels in advance picking the absolute cheapest fares guarding against delays by taking  am flights which are the least likely to be canceled Then four  am flights in a row with the necessary  am wakeup calls turned me into a zombieI started listening to my rhythms I am a night owl for one happy to wake up for sunrises but usually not for planes Inflexible travel plans give me anxiety particularly when they were coupled with work deadlinesThe trip had been planned to go from west to east minimizing jet lag but some time zone changes knocked me out The hour travel day from Zambia to Darwin Australia knocked me out for daysIve become far calmer from having to deal with mishap after mishap and realizing that nothing dire usually happens There would be another plane and more trains if I missed that one too Maybe Id lose a day but when youre on the road this long time becomes malleable tooSo what countries are you going to asked Tina Phillips a nurse at Passport Health in Orlando Fla which issues vaccinations and prescriptions for travelers who might encounter infectious diseases like malaria rabies or Japanese encephalitisI started listing off my  Places destinations Ms Phillips typed the country names into the computer her eyes widening as she laughed at the absurdity She sent me home with several needle sticks in my arm  in preventive medicine a video message telling my mother not to worry and a spiralbound printout of all my health vulnerabilities One of my biggest fears going into this project was getting sick or injured and having to come home early  or worse having something happen while I was in a remote location without access to adequate medical care Getting sick is painful and often gross but what worried me more was the potential time suck on a trip so tightly scheduled that it would go off the rails if I spent days groaning on a hotel bathroom floorMy waistline has expanded and diminished throughout this trip but the medical kits I built so meticulously before I left the US have remained largely untouched in my suitcase Its a stash so extensive that a customs officer at the ferry entrance to Tangier Morocco spent an hour threatening in Arabic to confiscate it and accusing me of being a drug dealerInstead I discovered I have a superpower which may be the sole reason Ive stayed relatively healthy the ability to sleep anywhere under any conditions Give me a window seat on an airplane and Ill be lights out before takeoff no earplugs eye mask or neck pillow Id fall asleep in hotels on noisy streets as dogs barked all night and in minute chunks regulated by an alarm between writing paragraphs of articles on an allnighter In Tangier two friends who joined me started looking like death because of hourlong prayer calls outside our windows every morning at  am I didnt even notice themBut the only times Ive gotten really sick were the colds I caught in Seville Spain and Chandigarh after extensive sleep deprivation I warded them off with a lot of napsThe rain in Chilean Patagonia never really seemed to stop Every article of clothing I owned was soaked Soppy socks soppy shoes The weather matched my mood Earlier that week Id called my friend crying yet again and told her I wanted to quit  I was so far behind in writing it felt like I was drowning in obligations I couldnt meet What do people do when it rains like this I asked the hotel manager in the national park Parque Pumaln We do what we always do he said If we stopped for rain nothing would ever get doneSo in a small break in the rain I went out to do what I always do take pictures talk to people get to know the placeI was in the tiny town of Chaitn which had been leveled by a volcanic eruption  years earlier Residents had come back but the buildings closest to the slope were still abandoned I went to examine the ghost town A few friendly construction workers were rebuilding a house a school I wandered further to an industrial building that had been overtaken by jungle growth straight out of Jurassic ParkThe rain started up again while I was inside exploring the concrete corridors and coming to the realization that I was inside an abandoned prisonAnd now I was trapped by torrential rainFor two hours I watched the rain flood the dirt streets before me and the inside of this prison I tweeted out my location just in case Then my phones battery died and it was just me and the torrent alone in the wilds of Patagonia with the sun going downI had to make a decision and the decision was to run through the rain And in that rain soaked and running I looked around at the bluetinged mountains around me and the jungle shrubs on all sides and the kind people laughing at this silly foreigner whod gotten caught in an abandoned prison in the rain and realized that all the rest was superfluous This was why I was hereSomething crystallized for me in that moment of how singular this trip was I started trying things I jumped off a foot cliff into freezing river water while canyoning in Megve France scuba dived and surfed for the first time in Fiji and maybe scariest of all tried a taco with a crispyfried ant at Gustu in La Paz BoliviaTwo days ago my friend Ben saw a dish on the menu of a barbecue joint in Phnom Penh Cambodia he thought I should try to commemorate making it to my nd placeCome on he said After this you can tell everyone you tried Fried Spicy Cow PenisThe whole table agreed to join me We ordered it and the kitchen brought out Fried Spicy Beef instead We changed it for you they said cheerilyAwesome said Ben We also want this oneThe dish came out It looked exactly as you would imagine Ben ate a piece Then it was my turn We have video evidence I know I said try it but you dont need to try that one I did it for you Youre welcomeEurydice Dixon  Melbourne Australia June Mollie Tibbetts  Brooklyn Iowa July Wendy Karina Martinez  Washington DC Sept Carla Stefaniak  San Jose Costa Rica Nov Grace Millane  Auckland New Zealand Dec  Maren Ueland  and Louisa Vesterager Jespersen  Imlil Morocco Dec Those are the names ages places and dates of death of seven women who were violently murdered while walking home jogging hiking or taking a birthday trip this yearOf all the news that has filtered across my phone screen while Ive been bouncing around the world none had the potential to throw me into a paralytic spiral more than reading about a woman killed simply because she was aloneWas there ever a time you felt unsafe a friend asked me recently The answer was no not like I have been in the past when I escaped attackers in my Williamsburg Brooklyn neighborhood or on a trip to France and also AlwaysCaution as a solo female traveler is healthy blind fear is not I find that for me the best system is to always remember that I am a tourist Its good to know what people who live in a place have to say about safety but also realize that the rules that apply to them who know where they are going and can blend in dont apply to meIve had to sacrifice areas of coverage I might otherwise enjoy like night life because I didnt feel safe going out alone For the one destination that was all about going out in Belgrade Serbia I hired a translatorguide to keep me company who became a fast friend In Bogot I met a young female professor through Instagram who took me out with her friends for a nightTheres a literal extra cost to being a woman traveling on your own In cities where safety seemed like it might be an issue I took cabs and Ubers rather than cheaper public transport Climbing up certain mountains or going around certain cities I opted for a guide and often paid extra because most private tours have a twoperson minimumAt one point I got delayed arriving at an Airbnb Id booked in Glasgow and had to retrieve the key after midnight from a lockbox attached to a fence on a dark side street A man clearly on something swayed back and forth about  feet away as I fumbled with the combination while also trying to keep an eye on my bags When I got inside the apartment was lovely but the building looked like it had been through a bombing and never recovered Certain landings including mine had no lights and glass covered the floor from broken windows I was hanging out with a local travel writer who usually walked me home at night but if he hadnt been there no one would have known my whereaboutsAfter that I vowed to stay only in hotels with hour front desks rather than rental apartments The idea of dating in a strange land quickly went out the window  I didnt have time and it didnt seem safe But I didnt swear off romantic leanings entirely All told I had four makeout sessions all year all in public or under what felt like very safe circumstances Those seem like little miraclesOh the stories of strangers that I could tellIn Montgomery  there was Marcus an Uber driver whod grown up in what he described as abject poverty who gave me an inspired lecture on his citys complicated racial history We picked up his neighbor a nurse from work as he does every night and finished with a feast at ApplebeesIn Puerto Rico there was Blandine a travel agent whod greeted me dancing and singing by the baggage carousel a few months after Hurricane Maria when much of the island was without power A farmer Elmer Snchez mentioned a party to me and my friend and we showed up to find at least  people dancing to the best musicians in the country playing by the light of a generatorIn Ypres Belgium there were the countless people attending the Last Post Ceremony to honor the missing fallen Commonwealth soldiers of World War I who told me the stories of their valiant dead relatives and ripped my heart in twoIn Matera Italy there were Cosimo Angelica Mariangela Alessandro and Marcello who introduced me to possibly the worlds most delicious food panzerotto fried dough with cheese and tomato sauce and made me feel like I was family even with my rusty ItalianIn Kigali Rwanda there was MA now a surrogate sister and her entire family who hosted me at a birthday gathering two days after I met them while also sharing their stories of surviving genocideWhats the biggest lesson youve learned is a question I often get I always answer That people are fundamentally good around the worldSolo travel is an experience Id urge every human and particularly every woman to try at least once Youll find that while you might physically be without people you know youre rarely alone I had a device in my pocket that allowed me to call home and to post a picture on an app that opened up conversations with strangers who just seemed to want to wish me wellWhile in Patagonia I spent four hours climbing a volcano in the rain by myself to reach a desolate summit with nothing but burned trees and ashen pebbles Out of the freezing cold mist came a hooded figure Hablas esapaol o ingles I asked English he told me He was a vegan punkrock drummer from Berlin who liked to laugh a lot and pet stray dogs and we ended up traveling together for the next five daysMy parents were my rocks through the ups and the downs Weekly phone calls with my therapist were among the best work I did Certain friends became lifelines There was Heidi Vogt with her endless logistical knowhow Jean Lee an expert on Korea and also on how to pack for any eventuality Chiwan Choi a poet friend who kept me clearheaded on writing Marie Ternes who talked me through story ideas even two days before having her first childFor the past week Ive stayed put in my nd place the small town of Kep on the Cambodian Coast The plan was to spend the holidays alone in this tranquil piece of heaven on the beach banging out my final articlesThen I got an Instagram DM from an acquaintance from Los Angeles She had seen a photo Id posted from Kep and it was a strange coincidence but she and a girlfriend would be there the next day Then I got another message from Ben who lives in Bangkok He and his girlfriend Zoe were trying to figure out one last vacation to take before they moved to New York Would I recommend Kep Within  minutes he sent me his hotel booking and flight informationThe next morning I befriended a British family at my hotel and we got along so well we went on a sunset cruise together The posse grew with each new arrival Wed feast on crabs and then head to a bar to play cards until the owner kicked us out It was a magical holiday and in it I could see glimpses of the future of being surrounded by found family content in each others company of traveling solo but never being or desiring to be truly aloneWhats next I dont know I might be physically going back to the apartment I left behind in Brooklyn  months ago but the center of my life

stronger buyers and renters market CreditCreditBrad Dickson for The New York TimesSupported byBy Stefanos ChenMore than  new apartments in New York both for sale and for rent will open their doors this year  and likely just a fraction will find residents by year endThe affordable ones of course will attract thousands of applicants but the bulk of the new units  in gleaming towers many of them conceived at the height of the last housing boom  will enter a saturated market where buyers and renters have ample choice and little incentive to rushAt the current rate of sales it will take more than six years to sell all of the new development in Manhattan alone which totals almost  units said Jonathan J Miller the president of Miller Samuel Real Estate Appraisers and ConsultantsThe pace of sales has already slowed coming into the new year with homes seeking  million or more taking an average of  days to go into contract in  according to Olshan Realty In the halcyon days of  similar homes spent only  days on the marketSuffice it to say that newcomers will have much to prove in  In Manhattan where developers bet big on Far West Side and downtown sites in areas unaccustomed to hulking towers proof of concept will rest on the pace of sales  and most everyone is being tightlipped about numbers In Brooklyn the impending partial L train closure could damage recent momentum in the rental market And in Queens awash with ambitious towers even before the announcement of Amazons campus the new year will begin to untangle hype from reality Thats good news for buyers and renters who can afford the expensive new offerings and if the market slumps further perhaps a boon for those seeking lower prices still The Times asked Localizecity a data company that focuses on New York housing to search city building records for residential projects that have been under construction for more than two years Some may drag into  but the majority are expecting moveins this year and many of the condos have been quietly selling units based on floor plans for months or even yearsOut of  anticipated units roughly  will be ready by the end of the year said Israel Schwartz a data analyst with the company Thats about the same as last year and down from the peak of  units in  but still higher than in the bullish years of  to  when demand outpaced supply and  units on average were completed every yearBrooklyn will have the most openings overall with  apartments across  buildings many of them concentrated in Williamsburg Manhattan will come in second with  units in  buildings followed by Queens with  units in  buildings The Bronx in the early stages of a building boom and Staten Island will lag behind with  and  units respectivelyThese projects will have to compete with historically high inventory already crowding the market said Grant Long the senior economist for the real estate website StreetEasy As of November there were  homes for sale in Manhattan up  percent from a year earlier Brooklyn had  units up  percent and Queens had  units a  percent jumpThere are outliers like  Central Park South which began closings last quarter and is hoping to sell a recordbreaking  million fourlevel penthouse but its success doesnt have much bearing on the rest of the market Weakness in the sales market has helped shore up rental demand in recent months but landlords reliance on concessions has continued to grow in all three boroughs suggesting tight competition and overzealous pricing according to a recent Douglas Elliman reportThe following projects a sampling of the largest in the city will lead the way or darken the path ahead for the next wave of buildersIf Billionaires Row in Manhattan a canyon of uberluxury condos in the heart of the borough represents the last building boom the next cycle may be defined by projects that hug the fringes of the islandFour of the top five new Manhattan projects with the most units are near the waterfront in areas long ignored by luxury developersOne Manhattan Square an foot tower with  units looms over the small neighborhood of Two Bridges south of Chinatown Developed by Extell a company that helped set off the luxury buying frenzy in the last cycle this project could spur a similar push on the Lower East SidePrices at the tower start at  million for onebedrooms and just over  million for threebedrooms The unit mix leans toward one and twobedrooms  a safer bet than the behemoth apartments that characterized the last cycle many of which are struggling to find buyersThere will be more than  square feet of perks including a twolane bowling alley a hammamstyle spa an adult tree house and an outdoor tea pavilion The priciest unit currently listed a  million duplex penthouse is under

Gary Barnett the president and founder of the company but added that he was pleased with sales Marketing for the tower began in  and according to a  filing with the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange  of the  units had sold at the timeTo drum up interest Extell offered to cover three to five years of common charges in its new buildings which could amount to tens of thousands of dollars a year on larger units The promotion was set to end in  but Mr Barnett said the company may extend the deal Extell is also paying buyers brokers half of their commissions at contract signing sometimes a year or more ahead of closing  a rare and somewhat risky incentive as early buyers could seek to back out of their purchasesPerhaps the projects biggest perk is a version of tax abatement no longer available to builders that covers most of a buyers property taxes for  years In exchange the developer built about  belowmarketrate rentals in a building adjacent to the tower for applicants who make roughly between  and The buildings success could influence three luxury rental projects planned nearby In December the City Council filed a lawsuit to force a public review of the proposed towers which range from about  feet to more than  feet to reconsider the height and unit mix of the towers Extells project was exempt because it was built asofrightThe developers have promised infrastructure upgrades including funding for a nearby public housing complex and neighborhood parks local subway improvements and about  new units to be leased below market rateBut the towers could also bring about  luxury rentals to the largely lowerincome neighborhood and that would hasten the displacement of longtime residents said Chris Walters a rezoning specialist with the nonprofit Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development And the range of affordable units will stretch the meaning of the word he said with some reserved for families making more than  a yearHow the Extell project performs will determine whether other developers take a risk on the neighborhood said Mr Long the StreetEasy economist It will seal the fate of what happens with the rest of those buildingsThe  Hudson Yards building in a part of the Far West Side of Midtown that has been in the spotlight since its  rezoning will open its  units to the first residents this quarterHudson Yards seems to be an anomaly because our traffic is still good said Sherry Tobak a senior vice president of Related Companies one of the developers But she declined to offer sales figures Units in the tower which has  luxury condos and  belowmarket rentals now range in price from less than  million for twobedrooms to  million for the choicest penthouse Ms Tobak admitted to some degree of concession including coverage of the socalled mansion tax which amounts to  percent of the sale price of anything above  million The first listings were offered in  based on plans and renderingsI still havent seen it said Ann Cutbill Lenane an agent with Douglas Elliman of the twobedroom she bought for herself after closing on a similar unit for a client Ms Lenane who went into contract about  months ago said she was impressed by the amenities including a resident dining room where she will be able to entertain up to  people The project also has a year tax abatement for buyersDid I buy it a little high Maybe she said But given how many attractions have been built around the tower including the futuristic Shed cultural center and the nearby High Line she is confident of its valueDue north near the waters edge of the Upper West Side three vitreous towers collectively known as Waterline Square are also expecting residents this year In total they will add  condos and  rental units to the site of former rail yards largely ignored for decades Developed by GID Development Group each tower was designed by a different architect with condos beginning around the th floor Prices range from  million for onebedrooms to  million for penthouses but the bulk of the units are twobedrooms starting at around  million Here too buyers will receive lengthy tax abatementsIts been difficult to get deals done this year said Melissa Ziweslin a senior managing director at Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group which is marketing the towers Starting last spring agents who brought buyers were given a  percent commission higher than the standard  percent she said as an added incentiveEven with the slowdown in  Ms Ziweslin said the units were selling at an average of  a square foot or about  percent higher than those in nearby buildingsThe luxury rental project at  Kent part of an unit complex on the South Williamsburg waterfront will be the largest to open its doors in Brooklyn this year About half of the completed units are spoken for said David J Maundrell who is leading the marketing with Citi Habitats New Developments but would not say how many units that represents Prices range from  a month for studios to more than  a month for the largest apartmentsThe blocky threetower complex developed by a company owned by Eliot Spitzer the former governor of New York will have two rooftop swimming pools a landscaped garden and a waterfront park on the East River A subsidized ferry service to Wall Street and Midtown departs nearbyWe had people wanting to give us sightunseen deposits Mr Maundrell said adding that weakness in the sales market has attracted some wouldbe buyers who could have decided to rent instead But in April the L train a major artery for the fastgentrifying neighborhoods along its route will partly shut down for  months of repairs That could hurt a number of projects opening in  including  Kent which relies on the only viable alternative for many Williamsburg commuters the JMZ subway linesAll of those lines will be a lot more congested said Mr Miller the real estate appraiser With the added headaches he said people may just look elsewhere as renters have a wealth of new options hitting the marketIn November  percent of rentals offered concessions in the form of free rent or discounted broker fees up from  percent a year earlier Mr Miller said And of the new units that were leased in November nearly  percent offered sweeteners The median rent after concessions was  a month down  percent from the previous yearThe impending arrival of Amazons New York campus in the Queens neighborhood of Long Island City has agents and developers hoping the buzz will translate to deals But even before the announcement the area was primed to have the most new units of any market in the city almost  across  buildings to open by year endAfter  Long Island City will continue to lead residential building citywide with  more units expected in the years to come the only market to approach that number is Williamsburg with  unitsIts like Williamsburg was five or six years ago said Jerry Wolkoff the developer behind Pointz the beloved streetart haven being converted to luxury rentals A group of artists won a  million judgment last year after Mr Wolkoff whitewashed their murals without notice in  Mr Wolkoff who had allowed the artists to paint there for years is appealing the decisionThe rental tower which will retain the Pointz name will have about  units with  to  ready for occupancy this summer he said Pricing hasnt been established but  percent of the units will be below market rateIs Mr Wolkoff worried about overbuilding or some residents distaste for how the tower was erected It will rent itself because of the amenities and what Ive done with the building he said adding that new commissioned graffiti will be displayed throughout the projectThe building frenzy has also spilled over into neighboring areas of western Queens like Astoria where the Durst Organization is building a seventower complex near the banks of the East River called Halletts Point The first tower a story unit brick building in which  percent of units will be below market rate will open around MarchThe building with unobstructed views on all four sides will have mostly studio and onebedroom apartments with a smattering of two andthree bedrooms said Jordan Barowitz the companys vice president of public affairsThe Amazon news is definitely a shot in the arm for Halletts he said but added that the company isnt counting on that in the short term as only several hundred Amazon employees will report to Long Island City in Still the move is a tantalizing if mainly symbolic prospect for builders coming to market this yearIts a quick commute to Astoria from Anable Basin

including Details W Teen Vogue and InStyle and now work with people like Stellene Volandes the editor in chief of Town  Country founded more than a century agoIn an era when glossy print publications

a threehour coffee date they discussed his goals and the ways that he might expand his public profile A love explosion Ms Vecchiarelli said As a champion of fashion and culture he seemed the perfect host for a magazine event There is something about the DNA of Jordans career and persona that overlaps completely with the DNA of Town  Country she saidMr Roth was indeed a hit Raise your hand if you spent your childhood trying on your mothers or grandmothers jewelry he instructed the crowd And that is why we are all here tonight Also why some of us are gay Everyone ate it upThis is the most genius business model Mr Roth said of Special Projects before the ceremony began Its the type of thing where everyone is going to be asking why they didnt think of it beforeMs Oliveri and Ms

heyday Teen Vogue was edited by Amy Astley an exacting protge of Anna Wintour For any given entertainment feature Ms Vecchiarelli had to learn how to please many masters Ms Astley Ms Wintour the publicist the celebrity the fashion photographer the stylist The goal was to make the opportunity work for everyone involved all of whom thought they were the star of the show she saidThanks to Ms Wintour Ms Vecchiarelli was able to establish Teen Vogue as a tryout for young stars hoping to one day receive coverage in Vogue She booked an early Jake Gyllenhaals first cover and one of Emily Blunts first big glossy magazine shoots She worked with Nicole Richie Bradley Cooper Channing Tatum Zac Efron all of them then young and not the big names they are todayAfter five years she landed at

highlighting young actors and actresses before they became household namesMs Vecchiarelli hopscotched to InStyle in  and in  she became the founding editor of DuJour a lifestyle magazine The same year Ms Oliveri left Details to go freelance She began to work with Kristina ONeill who had been named editor in chief of WSJ Magazine Ms ONeill asked Ms Oliveri to help her think about cover subjects

choreography like that is a different thing Doing ballet jazz tap since you were  is different than what I doHe went for intensive lessons in fundamental tap dancing and Fosse  Tap is hard he saidAnd he had to shave his head to accommodate the hairpiece of Fosses stringy comboverFosse changed movies and Broadway forever inventing an original American dance idiom syncopated tiny isolated movements with shades of burlesque and showbiz with a capital SHe added a dark sparkle which is a hard thing to do in dance to add negative feelings to something exuberant and vital Mr Wasson told me Just as Fosse was influenced by Charlie Chaplin the bowler hat and Sweet Charity moves Groucho Marx the walk in Steam Heat in Pajama Game and Fred Astaire Dancin Man he influenced many others homages easy to discern in videos by Beyonc Usher Justin Timberlake Madonna Lady Gaga and Michael Jackson who tried to get Fosse to direct the Thriller video See Fosse play the Snake in The Little Prince to see what Jackson adaptedThe FX shows creators know that the thricemarried always unfaithful Fosse who was constantly seducing his own dancers is a dicey character to build a show around in the MeToo era Thats why theyve elevated Verdon to the title and focused on her collaborationFosse manipulated but also wore his heart on his sleeve telling women exactly who he was Plagued by death failure selfcontempt and his memories of being sexually abused in his early teens by hardbitten burlesque dancers he depicted an increasingly nihilistic view of humanityI learned about dancing from his demons because in his material he was therapeutically raking himself over the coals said Andy Blankenbuehler the choreographer of FosseVerdon and Hamilton As he got deeper into his own style drawn to stories about broken people heartbreak and abusive situations his style was like a crushed Coke can Shoulders more and more slumped forward elbows pinched in stillness on the outside but a dark engine rotating fast insideI read Mr Rockwell something written in The New York Times about Fosses brutally truthful autobiographical masterwork All That Jazz Its about a man furiously driving his failing body like a wornout sports car throwing pills into it like a highoctane fuel packing it with more and more girls until he smashes it into the wall at the end of the worldMr Rockwell agreed Because he was essentially you could say molested when he was  he had a complicated relationship with women He revered them His style certainly shows that Hes not so much sexual as he is sensual He celebrates womens sensuality He doesnt demean it in his dance style But at the same time he had a lot of anger towards womenHe said that his acting coach referenced Dead Ringers the movie in which Jeremy Irons plays creepy twins as a good model for Fosse and VerdonIts a complex romance Mr Rockwell said Its almost like theyre twins Theres a symbiotic thing with them that transcends not just a romantic relationship its almost like theyre joined at the hipJust as Verdon left her baby son with her parents to return to dancing Mr Rockwells mother moved back to New York to pursue her performing career after her divorce leaving yearold Sam to be raised by his father except in summer when Sam joined her in New York He would go along when she did singing telegrams Once she sang to Jack LemmonMr Kail noted the irony that the great success of Verdon and Fosse in Damn Yankees provided the template for the couples Faustian bargain Fosse helped create Verdon as a leading lady when he choreographed her Whatever Lola Wants Lola Gets dance as the devils temptress seducing an older baseball player in Washington to sell his soul to regain his youth Thats when the dancers fell in love and he left his second wife Joan McCracken also a musical comedy star on Broadway He hurt Verdon with his other women but she kept working with him and she was with him when he died in DC at  from a heart attack just before the opening night of a Sweet Charity revivalMr Rockwell who has now transcended his reputation as the quirky sidekick is drawn toward gray He was surprised by the backlash at the idea that his racist cop in Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri seemed to be redeemed at the end of the movie the role won him a Golden Globe and an Oscar for best supporting actor but I cant worry about thatI grew up on the movies the American films in the s he said They were all antiheroes Midnight Cowboy Taxi Driver Five Easy Pieces Badlands Silkwood Sophies Choice Raging Bull Mean Streets These are all movies about antiheroes You dont see a lot of that now You see a lot of superheroes archetypes I think antiheroes are really fun to play Theyre just more interesting characters Like the guy in Five Easy Pieces is kind of an ass You knowHe padded himself up again for Best of Enemies out in theaters next week playing another porky racist who tangles with a strong woman and comes out a better person There is unlikely to be the same blowback because Mr Rockwell is playing a real person an exalted grand cyclops of a Ku Klux Klan group in Durham NC who becomes a convert to civil rights activism thanks to an AfricanAmerican woman played by Taraji P HensonTaraji is supercool he said We graduated high school the same year We know the same songs They bonded over a shared appreciation of music especially Doug E Freshs La Di Da DiHe said they were moved by the scalding spectacle of Charlottesville Va to make the movie Obviously racism is still very much alive you know he said And you have to continue to tell these stories I know that Do the Right Thing and Mississippi Burning had a big effect on me when I grew up So if I can contribute in that manner then thats a good thingAs Mr Rockwell likes to say you dont have to be an ass to play an ass Maybe because he played a yearold Rick once in an East Village improv comedy skit to his mothers Ilsa the actor is a great proselytizer for therapy He even asks his shrink for advice on how to think of his charactersHis partner in crime in Charlies Angels Kelly Lynch said Mr Rockwell is a doll whose strength is his combination of superchill and vulnerableHe can slide into dark characters because he doesnt judge them she said A lot of actors would say Ick I dont like this guyMr Rockwell said he doesnt believe that his character in Three Billboards is truly redeemed I think hes on his way to something But its like the end of Good Will Hunting when Matt Damon cries in Robin Williamss arms and then he drives off to find Minnie Driver Its like hes done working on himself Like Oh no more therapy You know You dont just cry and then not go to therapy anymore So its the same thing with Dixon Hes on his way to trying to be a better person But hes not done working on himself and certainly Francess character has a lot of work to do on herself Theyre both screwed upRELATED Sam Rockwell shares a bit more about himselfI asked him what he thinks happened to the characters played by him and Frances McDormand on that road trip to track down a rapistMy theory is maybe they went to a bar to get a little liquid courage to kill the guy then they ended up getting drunk and making out he said I dont think they killed the guyI asked Martin McDonagh the director and writer of the movie what he thinks about that coda Mr McDonagh recoiled I dont want to picture them fooling around he said That would be a dangerous little romanceMr Rockwell has said he would let himself be eaten alive by rats to work with Mr McDonagh The Irishman said that he admires Mr Rockwell because while he is the loveliest nicest guy Ive worked with so smart and generous and a joy to be around he brings a frisson of danger to his performancesGeorge Clooney seconded this sentiment He gave Mr Rockwell his breakthrough role in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind in which Chuck Barris the creator of The Gong Show claimed to be a CIA assassinSam is easily one of the best actors Ive ever seen Mr Clooney told me His ability to make you root for characters that ordinarily would be despised is uncanny Mr Clooney concluded He makes it all seem so effortless Come to think of it I hate himThomas Kail compared Mr Rockwell to a jazz musician who only makes surprising riffs after he takes every scene and examines it and scrutinizes it and marinates in itThat explains his pitchperfect portrayal of George W Bush in Vice for which he was also nominated for a best supporting actor OscarI became obsessed he said I watched a lot of interviews I listened to him on countless interviews Theres an autobiography that he narrates Then I had my dialect coach break it down He even talked to his shrink about itI began to find him really charming Mr Rockwell said adding that the key to impersonating W was adding a little Elvis a thing in the lip It actually gave me a little bit of a muscle twitch in my chinMs Bibb joked on the red carpet for the Golden Globes about how disturbing she found it when he was playing that role to be sexually attracted to BushMr Rockwell said that the thing he loves about Ms Bibb who sold her place in Los Angeles to move into his East Village apartment is that she makes him laughWhen he first saw her act in a short film he said it seemed as though Jessica Lange and a young Mary Tyler Moore and Carol Burnett all had a baby He added Shes a pistol She definitely gives me a run for my money challenges me Its never boringWhen they met more than a decade ago in the lobby of Chateau Marmont they flirted and he left his number with the maitre d to give to herI was like oh boy Im in for it now She better be a good actress You cant date a bad actor Not long term anywayThey agreed to go on a date but when Ms Bibb suggested a day at the Getty Museum Mr Rockwell rolled his eyes and reluctantly agreed They had such a good time Ms Bibb said Lets get a drink Lets go to El Compadre and get a margaritaBut Mr Rockwell said he had a backup plan because he was very single at the time and he figured first date nothings really going to happen on a museum date And I was you know trying to be a man about town but I was not succeeding at doing that She knew I had a backup plan so I said I just got to get my cigarettes and my coat call my friend and tell him I cant and she knew She still makes fun of me about it And then we went and got a drinkI was never really good at being single You have to stay up late You have to drink when you dont want to drink You have to you know dating is horrible You have to go through all these dates to get with somebody you want to talk toI wondered if he ever tried online datingI never had that swipe thing he said Its dangerous In fact the only stuff he does on his phone is texting and getting UbersHe said that with two actors its tricky You have to take turns being Elvis and Cher You know what I mean Like today Im on doggy dutyI asked if he still doesnt want kidsYeah me and Leslie were not doing the kid thing he said Its not my jam Its not my thing Im more of an uncle typeI wondered if it has to do with his childhood when his parents broke up and he stayed with his father in San Francisco while his bohemian mother moved to New York to pursue her acting career New York magazine once wrote that Mr Rockwell had the air of having been raised by wolves but very considerate wolves who write thankyou notes after theyve eaten all your sheepIt could be but these days everybody comes from a broken home he replied My mom she really is a good mother and she did the best she could I think Im too selfish to be a father I think I know what it takes You know I just dont want to put a kid through  my lifestyle is a little crazy and I think Leslie feels a similar way  and frankly Im too selfish I want to have my life and wake up when I want to wake up Id rather take care of the dog and take care of Leslie and take care of myselfWhat if he was with someone who wanted kids I wonderedIt probably wouldnt have worked out he said with a shrugI noted that not much seems to have changed since his Oscar Hes still in the same East Village padI play jazz in the morning he said This guy Ahmad Jamal I like You know Stan Getz I have a little vinyl Its nice to play in the nighttime Put on some Bill Evans Fleetwood Mac Chet Baker I love Miles and Coltrane With vinyl sometimes you got to put a penny on the needleAnd with that Sam and Sadie shimmied off Leslie Bibb has dinner readyMaureen Dowd winner of the  Pulitzer Prize for

entertainers Call it the paywall of pornDannii Harwood CreditCreditMolly Matalon for The New York TimesSupported byBy Jacob BernsteinEvery day hundreds of men pay Dannii Harwood to enact their sexual fantasies and boost their selfesteem Sometimes her clothes come off Sometimes she dresses up as a nurse or a dominatrix If a guy is a regular customer she likely knows his birthday the names of his children and his pets  even when to call after a surgical procedureHe may pay her to help him achieve an orgasm though she is not a prostitute He may purchase erotic videos from her though she is not a porn starMs Harwood is one of the top earners on OnlyFans where subscribers  mostly male straight gay and beyond  pay models and social media influencers a fee generally  to  a month to view a feed of imagery too racy for Instagram With that access subscribers can also direct message and tip to get pictures or videos created on demand according to their sexual tastesModels who join the site often presume that their subscribers will increase in number if they post more often and make the content more explicit The more often part is true The more explicit part is notAt a time when anyone with a smartphone or small studio can become his or her own pornographer and content is often free the hottest site in the adult entertainment industry is dominated by providers who show fewer sex acts and charge increasing fees depending on how creative the requests get Thats the first paradox at the center of the OnlyFans phenomenonThe most popular OnlyFans personality is Jem Wolfie of Perth AustraliaShe cant help but laugh when people call her a fitness model As she noted in an interview  percent of my fans are men So the bulk of them arent looking for exercise tips although she may provide them for an added fee along with healthy recipes  she used to be a chefAccording to OnlyFans she has  subscribers who pay  a month for access to a feed in which she shows off her Kardashianesque proportions squatting in really tight leggings and squeezing her breasts together strategically covering her nipples Im a thick girl she said matteroffactlyIt doesnt go much further than thatBasically OnlyFans is online gogo dancing said Matthew Camp a yearold model on the mens side who broke into the business a decade ago writhing on platforms around downtown Manhattan for the party promoter Susanne BartschIf the four main quadrants of the gay approval matrix were daddy twink bear and boy next door he seemed to sit smack in the center not falling neatly into any of those categories but appealing to the potential audiences for eachWith a Gstring and a strobe light he could make as much as  on a good night Porn studios like Lucas Entertainment began callingMr Camp was intrigued Having sex for money is appealing he said But  seemed low for something that would sit on the internet and brand him for life as a porn starSo he turned them down and instead used a PG feed on Instagram to build a following of more than half a million About a year ago as the club scene continued its slow death he moved to Hudson NY and signed up for OnlyFansWeeks often went by without him posting a single picture or video He didnt show a full penetrative sex clip for the first nine months yet he still regularly took home more than  a monthTumblr was filled with the most extreme sexual experiences you could see he said And I think a lot of people were turned off by that Its not what theyre looking for They want more intimate experiences They want a boyfriend experience They want to fantasize about someone that they want to have sex with and not feel disgusted by itFrom the late s to the early s dreamers in the porn industry centered in the San Fernando Valley of California openly described their multimilliondollar futures in the business There was actually a history of this happening at least for a small number of models signed to lucrative longterm contracts with studios like Vivid and WickedThey could make north of  a scene and shoot a couple of those each week according to Brian Gross a wellknown industry publicist That income could be supplemented with fivefigure sums doing nightclub appearances around the country on the weekends he saidJenna Jameson  the Julia Roberts of straight porn  even parlayed her notoriety into a memoir released by HarperCollins How to Make Love Like a Porn Star A Cautionary Tale which was a New York Times best seller The title turned out to be eerily prescient As its publisher Judith Regan pointed out Porn went the way of all media It turns out everyone could do it Except that because porn was an industry of people already living on the margins of society the effects for the performers were in many ways worseThe primary culprits were socalled tube sites YouTubelike platforms that aggregated stolen pornographic content disseminated it for free and sucked up revenue from banner and video ads Since porn studios did not have the capital or political connections to sue their most threatening adversaries out of business as the record industry did rates for scene work dropped Fewer scenes were shot overall Eventually the studios began selling themselves to the tube sites at firesale pricesIt was as if the entire music business had been subsumed by NapsterBy  a handful of companies were able to exert monopolistic control over the industry MindGeek is the biggest player of all The crown jewel of its empire is Pornhub perhaps the most popular tube site in the world which is supplied with content from numerous inhouse production companies of the straight Brazzerscom Reality Kings and gay varieties SeanCody MencomMindGeek knows all about porn habits by doing comprehensive data analysis It has shown less of an affinity for the product or the people who appear in itThe MindGeek website makes no reference to the fact that the overwhelming majority of its customers are consumers of hardcore pornography The technocrats who built the company got rich Many of the performers who helped enable their success became prostitutes offering their services on websites like RentMencom and The Erotic Review when scene work ceased to be a viable way to make a living Its a fitting but unfortunate parable in an era of rampant economic inequalityIf you have a known name its much easier to market your services said Dirk Caber a porn star who has filmed close to  scenes for MindGeeks most popular gay site Mencom since  Most of his income comes from his work as an escort because this scene work pays so littleThe whole industry did a  Mr Gross said When I started there were actually websites that would out famous porn stars if they escorted because it was shocking for lack of a better word Now all talent is looked at as if they are escorts and those who arent have to come out and say soOne alternative to escorting is webcamming In England there are even TV stations like Playboy and Babestation on which models talk live with thousands of customers and earn several hundred dollars a day Thats what Ms Harwood did before OnlyFans came alongShe grew up in Wales with a mother who stocked supermarket shelves and a father who was a factory worker It was a typical workingclass household she said recently while on a vacation in New York that included a trip to the  memorial and the taking of many hotel room selfies As a little girl Ms Harwood was a relentless attention seeker the sort who appeared in school plays competed in beauty pageants and studied dance She also had reservoirs of empathy that would serve her well later in lifeShe could spot pain in others and find ways to make them feel better She also was capable of identifying her limitations and finding ways to chart new paths for herself I was raised well she said She studied dance at Laine Theatre Arts a prestigious drama and dance college near London Then I went to audition after audition she said Eventually I realized I wasnt good enough And it was quite hard to accept at firstAround  Ms Harwood posed topless on Page  of The Daily Sport a secondtier British newspaper that she said was popular with day laborers and construction workersThis apparently included the guys her father worked with One morning he went into work and saw the picture of his daughter plastered to his locker On her face his colleagues had drawn his mustache and glasses Thats how he found out she was modeling nude Thats why he warned her about being disownedMs Harwood felt terrible Although she likes taking off her clothes for other people she seems driven less by the desire to transgress than the desire to please If she were reincarnated as a Disney character shed be Jessica Rabbit not Miss Piggy But it wasnt like her father had the money to support her His warning was sort of an empty threat So she kept going with appearances in Playboy and British socalled laddie magazines In  Ms Harwood worked for a softcore site called GlamGirls and became friendly with its owner Tim Stokely an earnest technocrat who looks like Mark Zuckerberg by way of Savile Row Soon after Mr Stokely founded a site called CustomsU which Ms Harwood said lightheartedly may have been her idea and was like OnlyFans in beta The pitch was to offer horny guys the ability to become their own directors ordering specially made videos from their favorite modelsIt sputtered along while Instagram  which is free and doesnt allow full nudity  took off Then Mr Stokely had his light bulb moment Why not find a way for influencers to directly monetize their content The platform  OnlyFans  would be similar to Instagram or Twitter except fans would have to pay a monthly subscription to view influencers content and interact with themIt would therefore be a natural bolton to the influencers existing social media A free feed on Instagram or Twitter could promote and drive traffic to the subscriptiononly feed on OnlyFansEighty percent of the fees collected for each feed would go to the provider Twenty percent would go to OnlyFans although after merchant and processing fees Mr Stokely says its take is around  percent This is roughly the same arrangement Uber has with its drivers except that OnlyFans didnt push performers toward poverty by dictating the prices they could chargeWhen OnlyFans started in  Ms Harwood was one of just  models who sought subscribers She didnt think much would come of it initially Her earnings for the first month were  Then the site added features enabling models to create custom content Ms Harwood got inventiveShe introduced themed days like Mistress Mondays and Dare Dannii Tuesdays when men bid to watch her drive around town in her underwear and order a pizza to her home whereupon she would answer the door naked She also chatted with fans daily learning their habits their sexual predilections and their insecuritiesYou can get porn for free she said Guys dont want to pay for that They want the opportunity to get to know somebody theyve seen in a magazine or on social media Im like their online girlfriendMs Harwood took out her phone and showed evidence of her theoryShe brought home  in August  in September  in October and  in November Although OnlyFans has brilliantly capitalized off the lifes work of exhibitionists it is run by people whose most apparent trait is opacityThats the second paradox at the center of its existence There is no website for Fenix International Limited which is the parent company of OnlyFans It does have a publicist Daniel Blythe who largely helps the men behind it avoid interviewsWhen I first contacted Mr Blythe in November informing him of my intention to write about OnlyFans he was affable as could be for a man with no intention of disclosing the names of his clients much less submitting them to an interviewWhen I did discover Mr Stokelys name and portions of his back story with a little help from someone on Reddit Mr Blythe offered the warmest of congratulations Refreshing to know that investigative journalism isnt dead he saidStill the best he could offer were written responses to questions for Mr Stokely the companys chief executive The answers were maddeningly vague but Mr Stokely did say that he works at Fenix with his father Guy Stokely who before becoming its chairman was an investment banker with Barclays the storied British bank Mr Stokely also confirmed that one of Fenixs directors is Leo Radvinsky a  Northwestern University graduate who went on to start MyFreeCams one of the industrys largest chat sites and who has been a defendant in three lawsuits related to phishing attempts and patent infringement Mr Blythe said he could not comment on the status of those lawsuits because they do not pertain to OnlyFansMr Stokely is eager to take OnlyFans out of the pornography niche and make it a platform for all sorts of influencers and audiences One hurdle is that there is no iPhone app The platform as it exists now likely runs afoul of Apples restrictions on overtly sexual or pornographic material And even if Apple did allow an OnlyFans app the fees   percent  would certainly be a problem Mr Stokely said He would have to pass along those expenses to performers Technical problems on OnlyFans also threaten its longevity and help explain why synonymous sites such as JustForFans have managed to siphon off considerable numbers of performers and revenueStill Chanel Santini a yearold performer who has been with OnlyFans for more than a year and earns at least  a month in subscription revenue cant muster serious complaints Not when she experienced the alternative She grew up in Albuquerque with a single mother who was a hairdresser Ms Santini came out as transgender when she was a teenager That got her thrown out of the house She never finished high school In  Ms Santini moved to Las Vegas and took a job as a clerk at Hollister the clothing chain Even in a city with a fairly low cost of living it wasnt enough So she started doing porn filming scenes that paid as little as  which then led to escorting She worked for a madam who stole her money she said and threatened her with violence With popular feeds on Instagram and Twitter Ms Santinis name got bigger OnlyFans started and she signed up A couple of weeks ago she burst into tears over the phone while recalling her first pornographic shoot There a director had told her that the only way to make a living in porn was to also be a prostituteHe said that straight to my face she said Now I just want to run into him again so I can say Well here I am Im pulling in tens of thousands of dollars every month just posting content online I dont have to escort anymore I dont have to do that Guess you were

sketchy but didnt elaborateCarla knew at  that night that something was wrong Ms Jaime said in an interview Sometimes we justify our intuition But when something is triggered and our body says something is wrong you have to listen to itA week later Ms Stefaniaks brutalized body was found wrapped in plastic and halfburied in a sloping patch of forest near her Airbnb rental The Costa Rican police arrested the propertys security guard in connection with the killingRecent headlines about the deadly violence inflicted on women traveling alone have raised questions about how the world is greeting the documented rise in female solo travelers and about the role of social media in promoting the idea that faroff lands are easily accessible and safeThey have also shined a light on the enduring nature of gender violence worldwide and laid bare how a lone foreign travelers cultural and social expectations do not always comport with local views about a womans place in the world  and whether she should travel at allThousands of women go abroad every year without incident Many women experience catcalls and myriad other forms of harassment while traveling women of color have written about being dismissed or ignored abroad because of their race And while violence against male tourists is just as devastating the harrowing experiences of female solo travelers can still shock the senses In December the bodies of Louisa Vesterager Jespersen  of Denmark and Maren Ueland  of Norway were found with knife wounds in their necks in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco Danish officials called the murders an act of terror That same month the Briton Grace Millane disappeared in Auckland New Zealand on the night before her nd birthday she was found slain days later In  a yearold British backpacker was gangraped by bikers in Thailand In March an Australian man was convicted of kidnapping and raping a Belgian traveler seeking work after keeping her locked up in his pig shed for two daysTheres no question that women face unique risks when traveling solo experts sayWe have evidence that shows that women face risks that men dont face in public spaces at home wherever they may be said Phumzile MlamboNgcuka executive director of UN Women an organization that promotes female equality Increasingly wherever they may be includes alone in foreign countries But she said that violence against female tourists was a thread in the broader fabric of violence against women around the world And violent episodes are just as likely to occur experts note in rich Western nations such as France Italy and Germany as in the developing world The root cause of this kind of violence against women in communities and in public and private spaces has a lot of do with the underlying gender stereotypes social norms entitlement and patriarchy Ms MlamboNgcuka saidSolo travel by women has grown in popularity year after year according to travel industry studiesHostelworld an online hostelbooking platform found in a  study that bookings by solo female travelers increased by  percent from  to  compared with a  percent increase for menSolo travel was once seen as brave and risky for female travelers but a shift of attitude has meant that it is now an adventurous exciting experience that allows them to feel free with no one else to worry about or please the company saidThe

predicting a further rise of  percent in  Solo female travelers also outnumbered their male counterparts by almost two to one the study showedA  global survey by British Airways of  women found that more than  percent had taken a solo vacation with  percent of the women surveyed planning solo trips in the next few years Another ad hoc sign of womens growing interest in hitting the road alone Web searches for solo female travel have also risen drastically in the past five years according to Google TrendsBut even as more women explore the world there is no clear global picture of the scale of violence against female solo travelers making it hard to pin down whether attacks are on the rise or people have wider access to the grim news The reason Most countries do not comprehensively track violence against female travelers Global agencies like the United Nations have traditionally collected data on gender violence as a whole The State Department offers tips for women but does not break down data on violence against travelers by gender a spokesman said A British Foreign Office spokesman said the agency no longer compiled the Helping Britons Abroad report making  the last year for which figures were available when they showed a  percent increase in sexual assaults against Britons abroad from  But the statistics are not genderspecific Experts find the lack of such figures troublingMs MlamboNgcuka of UN Women said that countries had little incentive to collect and publicize information that could be detrimental to their image This would not be seen by many countries as important data to collect she said so you are unable to track the prevalence or patternsWomen have always been explorers on a scale both grand and personal  long before the British trailblazer Freya Stark visited inhospitable areas in Turkey and the Middle East and before the Irish travel writer Dervla Murphy saw the world on a bicycle Today womens increased spending power has given them the means to travel more for leisure and adventure Shifting attitudes in the West about who can travel alone have also added to a growing industry Social media plays a big part offering intimate glimpses

studying abroad in college I feel like it gives me the luxury of seeing the culture in the way I want to and being able to paint my own experience she saidAfter college she traveled to Southeast Asia on her own visiting Thailand in  on a break from teaching English in Vietnam One evening she was walking alone after dinner in Krabi known for its beaches and as a popular hangout for young tourists when a local man offered to guide her back to her hotelShe said she was afraid of getting lost so she followed him But just as she grew increasingly uneasy he attackedFleeing for her life Ms Gavios tumbled from a cliff and fractured her spine The man sexually assaulted her while she lay helpless for  hours In the morning light he left  but surprisingly returned with helpMs Gavios was hospitalized for months first in Thailand and then New York and had to learn to walk again using crutches and custom leg braces Her attacker was eventually arrested and sentenced to five years in prisonThe week Ms Stefaniak vanished her friends and family scrambled to alert Costa Rican authorities They organized a campaign through a Facebook page  Finding Carla The State Department quickly became involved and the FBI pressed local officialsWhen her body was discovered near her villa her relatives were shattered  Ms Jaime her best friend said the local authorities should have done more to publicize the risks to women in the country They have a responsibility to tell tourists of all the risks and they are not doing it she saidMs Stefaniak was the third foreign woman killed in Costa Rica in three months But the country was also grappling with a deeper more systemic problem of brutality against local women ones who did not have the power of an American passport to help galvanize agencies like the State Department or the FBI on their behalf At least  women were killed in genderbased violence in the country from January to August  In September the government declared violence against women a national problemThe National Institute for Women a government ministry pointed to the murders of foreigners last summer in a statement to illustrate the issue We are faced with the fact that beyond the damage it may cause to the image of the country they are clear examples of the serious situation of violence against women which has its most brutal expression in femicideStill Costa Rica is considered one of the safest countries in Central America particularly for tourists with a lower homicide rate than many neighboring nations Officials say they have made strides to combat genderbased violenceMs Jaime said she believed that her friend might have been targeted because she was a Spanish speaker who blended right in and her killer might have thought the police would be lax Maybe because she spoke Spanish he might have felt no one would have looked for her Ms Jaime said But she said the attacker had underestimated the determination of Ms Stefaniaks family Not only are her relatives fighting for justice in Costa Ricas courts they also filed a lawsuit accusing Airbnb of negligence Their lawyer in Costa Rica Joseph Alfonso Rivera Cheves appeared to suggest a callous disregard in the aftermath noting that the same day Ms Stefaniak vanished her Airbnb room was being cleaned and new renters checked inThe family also says that the local host evaded negative reviews by changing the name of the listing and no background check of the security guard was conducted even though he had access to all the rooms on siteAirbnb in a statement said it had removed the villa where Ms Stefaniak had stayed from its platform and had been in contact with the authorities The company also said it had made strides to address womens safety concerns partnering with rights organizations and violenceprevention groups in local communities and creating policies that emphasize womens needs That includes removing any host or guest accused of sexual assault from the platform

Airbnb the host has to have received consistently excellent reviews and achieved superhost status She takes Ubers so that her location is trackedMs Nabongo acknowledged that we tell women what not to do to avoid being attacked instead of telling men not to attack women But she says she dresses conservatively until she can assess whether what she wears matters in the place she is visitingShe would prefer a world where women can just pack up and travel without having to do the extra legwork that solo male travelers dont have to but says thats idealistic Ms Nabongo however like many womens advocates believes that any focus on the way women dress  or the fact that they travel alone at all  provides a convenient scapegoat and does not address the true causes of genderbased violence and rape cultureMost headlines tend to highlight the experiences of young white or Western victims  partly because of a dearth of public data on any violent experiences of women of color who travel alone But Ms Nabongo noted that as a black woman traveling solo she has to deal with a whole other level of safety concerns anxiety and fearIn many European cities that Ive been in  like Barcelona Madrid Rome Milano  women of color are in more danger because a lot of people think we are prostitutes she said My fear is always that if something happens to me in a European city no one will care I could be running down the street screaming in Italy and onlookers wont care because Im blackTo help one another traverse the world safely women have formed their own online communitiesDianelle RiversMitchell founded Black Girls Travel Too which coordinates group travel to serve a growing market On her companys Facebook site thousands of women share tips on where to stay eat and visit and hash out safety concernsWe are each others keeper especially when it comes to travel said Ms RiversMitchell Apps provide another level of support for women traveling alone Free ones like Chirpey RedZone MayDay Tripwhistle and Noonlight let women flag incidents and areas of danger and contact local law enforcementEven with the best preparation trips can go wrongBorn and raised in Moscow Vasilisa Komarova grew up in the s behind the Soviet Iron Curtain She studied law moved to London learned English and became a British citizen But she dreamed of traveling the wider worldIn  at  she embarked on a solo motorcycle journey through the Americas She visited Cuba and spent time in the Atacama Desert and Chilean Patagonia She linked up with motorcyclists and got odd jobs in a bike shop and in fitness training She was living a dream chronicling it all with photos on Instagram and posts on FacebookThen everything changedAt some point maybe because everyone I was meeting was so kind I think I put down my guard a little she said While she was camping in northern Bolivia on June   in an area people had told her was safe three men with machetes dragged her out of her tent They beat her dislocating her arm in three places While two held her down one raped her Then they broke her motorcycle stole her belongings urinated on her tent and left her for deadAfraid that they might come back Ms Komarova lay still all night When the sun rose she used her laptop which her attackers had missed to summon help But what she experienced was a climate of impunity she said The authorities didnt want to take her to a doctor the doctor didnt want to see her because she could not payOnly after the Russian Embassy was involved did the police listen Ms Komarova saidBut the embassy retreated after connecting her with the local authorities saying she was not in immediate danger She felt she was on her ownExperts say such a response isnt unusual Some of these law enforcers are themselves part of the problem and they do not take these crimes as seriously as they need to Ms MlamboNgcuka of UN Women saidBolivian and Russian authorities did not respond to several requests for commentWith the help of the British Embassy Ms Komarova made contact with an advocate who helped her file a criminal complaint and begin the legal fight against her attackersMs Komarova said she knew she had to be her own biggest advocate she couldnt move forward in her journey or return home without getting some form of justice But between the local bureaucracy and the corruption she said it was an arduous fightThe attack the process it broke me down Ms Komarova said But I had to find strength inside myselfA year later she watched as her attackers were sentenced to a combined  years in prisonIn November Ms Komarova rode out of Bolivia on her motorcycle The first night she put her tent up after leaving she was afraid she admitted She is still on the road and wants other women to travel but to be on alert  alwaysMy guard is really high Ms Komarova said by Skype from Ecuador People dont always deserve my skepticism but that is how it is Thats how it has to beAs for Ms Gavios she is still partly paralyzed but since the attack she has become a yoga instructor and has learned Krav Maga Last fall she completed the New York City Marathon  on crutches It hasnt prevented me from moving forward or traveling by myself she said I dont feel defeatedShe says she doesnt want her experience to scare other women away from having the rich eyeopening experience of traveling soloThe more we tell women not to travel alone and the more we send the message that the world is very dangerous in a way we are also supporting that belief Ms Gavios said Rather than horrifying people I want people to go into it with a little more bravery and a little more knowledgeFrom her perspective there are no dangerous countries just dangerous peopleIt sucks but you cant control the world she said adding But you also have to go out and live your life and not let these terrible stories stop youBecause otherwise you let them winFollow NY Times Travel on Twitter Instagram and Facebook Get weekly updates from our

The Pinkertons wanted me to picture myself in a scene of absolute devastation A hurricane just wipes out everything and you need to feed your children Andres Paz Larach said The power grid is down shipments of food are cut off the water is no longer potable  how do you get what you need to survive What risks do you take It was a hot early morning in March and we were driving through a pine forest high in the mountains surrounding Santa Ana Jilotzingo  miles northwest of Mexico City Our Suburban equipped with bulletproof windows and reinforced doors labored slowly over the dirt road which appeared to have been washed out by a recent thunderstormFor much of the previous hour Paz Larach and two other executives from Pinkerton Carlos Manuel Lpez Portillo Maltos and Paul Rakov had been explaining the companys philosophy of risk management Now over  years old having long outlived its reputation as Andrew Carnegies personal militia the agency has evolved into a modern security firm Over the last decade or so Pinkerton began noticing a growing set of anxieties among its corporate clients about distinctly contemporary plagues  active shooters political unrest climate disasters  and in response began offering datadriven risk analysis in addition to what theyre more traditionally known for Dressed in an untucked powder blue oxford and round rimless sunglasses Paz Larach the firms senior vice president in charge of the Americas paused before affecting a look of brutal candor Youre going to turn to desperate measures he said Everybody will The other Pinkertons noddedI was seated in the rear row next to Rakov a marketing officer who at  had recently shifted his career from more traditional PR to Pinkerton He was now fully fluent in the language of tactical response He chimed in to observe that preparing for a disaster can carry its own risks He gave the example of a drought If a client has food and water and all the other stuff he said then they become a target Lpez Portillo and Paz Larach uttered small words of consensus in Spanish while scanning through email on their phones And if and when desperate people discovered that cache of water and food he continued it was the Pinkertons job to protect it at whatever costRead about how Wall Street is hedging against the apocalypseOur destination that morning was a shooting range called Club de Tiro Jarib which Pinkerton sometimes uses for agent and client trainings The idea had been to demonstrate what Pinkerton agents go through before they are deployed to disaster zones Lpez Portillo had also lately fielded several inquiries from corporate clients asking for lessons in tactical skills like evasive driving and extraction from disaster zones both for themselves and sometimes hundreds or more of their employees Someone who works in corporate  say as an attorney or salesperson he said they find it something completely new and usefulAt the range which was made up of seven terraced target areas bulldozed into a steep ridge we were greeted by our instructor Reynold Castro Rman A former Mexican military officer he wore black fatigues with the Pinkerton allseeingeye logo emblazoned on either shoulder A kaffiyeh hid a long scar along his neck During an intel mission  years ago Castro Rman was flying over marijuana fields when the plane went down  from what Castro Rman suspected was narco fire  killing the three others on board Since then he has dedicated himself almost exclusively to privatesector urbancombat training often for PinkertonOver the next three hours Castro Rman worked us steadily through various readiness drills including quickdraw methods accuracy competitions and timed reloading under pressure We shot ninemillimeter pistols and Israeli assault rifles Considering all the firearms the atmosphere was relaxed and sporting Nearby a man grilled chorizo and carne asada A cooler and makeshift bar was stocked with beer wine and mezcalThe scene was a stark contrast to the bigdata wonkery I was pitched in the car ride over But Paz Larach explained that their statistical and tactical approaches were fundamentally connected All businesses exposed themselves to risk which had to be mitigated insured or more relevantly defended against Even if the Pinkertons couldnt predict the specific risks of the future they had a general sense of what it might look like  and what opportunities they might avail themselves of as it materialized According to the World Bank by  some  million people may be displaced by sealevel rise and extreme weather driving escalations in crime political unrest and resource conflict Even if the most conservative predictions about our climate future prove overstated a degree Celsius rise in temperature during the next century will almost certainly provoke chaos in what experts call climate changes threat multiplier Displacement begets desperation begets disorder Reading these projections from the relative comforts of the Csuite it wasnt difficult to see why a company might consider enhancing its security protocolsFor Pinkerton the bet is twofold first that theres no real material difference between climate change and any other conflict  as the world grows more predictably dangerous tactical knowhow will simply be more in demand than ever And second that by adding data analytics Pinkerton stands to compete more directly with traditional consulting firms like Deloitte which offer pre and postdisaster services supplychain monitoring damage documentation etc but which cannot say dispatch a helicopter full of armed guards to Guatemala in an afternoon In theory Pinkerton can do both  a fully militarized managerial class at corporate disposalLater after Paz Larach took his turn on the range  during which he emptied a Galil ACE assault rifle into a humanshaped cardboard cutout then quickly drew his ninemillimeter grouping four shots in the chestcavity bullseye  he offered the example of Hurricane Maria On the day the Category  hurricane made landfall in Puerto Rico in  he received more than  calls from American businesses and multinationals He wouldnt go into detail but explained that many chief executives felt blind to the situation and effectively tendered a blank check if Pinkerton could provide security Over the next few days as the company deployed hundreds of agents to the island some of them Paz Larach claimed reported seeing firearms brandished at gas stations We had to escort the cargo with real agents have cars chase the main truck he said Those who did not have protection were having their cargo hijackedAware that he might end up sounding vampiric Paz Larach hesitated then eventually confessed what hed wanted to say in the first place The future looked pretty good for PinkertonYou could be forgiven for assuming that the Pinkertons were relics of the past Like the stage coaches the company once protected the name Pinkerton summons up sepiatinted images of the American West  blackhatted detectives pursuing train robbers or rooting out labor agitators from coal mines And indeed Allan Pinkerton organized his agency in response to the lawlessness of the frontier When he first began offering his services in the early s a majority of the territories west of the Mississippi remained ungoverned few towns offered policing and fewer still had the means to investigate crimes after the fact Overnight Pinkertons novel methods of crime detection which included infiltrating gangs and developing networks of informants became the standards of investigation and his company became a sort of de facto national police force According to some historians by the late th century the Pinkerton National Detective Agency numbered more men than the United States ArmyIn the intervening years the Pinkertons have survived in no small part because of their ability to adapt to the changing landscapes of crime To differentiate his agency from common bounty hunters Pinkerton worked to professionalize his ranks with formal attire pay and badges and created what probably was the first national criminal database In the following years as railroads opened up the frontier and settlement brought with it the rule of law Pinkerton turned to what he saw as the riotous element growing in company towns Between  and  Pinkertons were dispatched to break up some  labor strikes  either by going undercover to provide intel or through brute forceRead David Leonhardt on the economics of climate changeIt was only after a particularly lethal clash during a strike in Homestead Pa in  that the public began to wonder if the threat of the Pinkertons eclipsed those they supposedly protected against In the years since the frontier closed antitrust sentiment had grown and demand for the Pinkertons lessened  in part because the government was more able to enforce its laws In the aftermath of Homestead Congress and  states passed antiPinkerton acts banning government bodies from hiring mercenaries as strikebreakersIn the decades since the Pinkertons have undertaken several rebrandings each aimed at lowering their public profile though through it all they never gave up the lucrative specter of their name the Pinkerton Agency Pinkertons Inc Pinkerton During the first half of the th century the company protected wartime factories and later began to seek out new markets in parts of the world like India and China where authority could still be outsourced In  the Swedish security giant Securitas AB absorbed the agency buying it for a reported  million and the company underwent rebranding once again this time as a boutique riskmanagement firm It began diversifying into intellectualproperty services and cybersecurity Among their most popular new services is the Pinkerton Dedicated Professional in which agents join a clients company like any other new hire allowing them to provide intel on employees By  the agency said it could count among its clients about  percent of Fortune  companiesThe best outcome for these new datadriven Pinkertons is that this century lapses into the kind of lawlessness and disorder that makes it look more like the th  which many scientists and economists think it could Since  a period that includes all  of the warmest years in recorded history and  of the  most intense hurricane seasons in the satellite era losses in the United States from storms wildfires and droughts topped  trillion  nearly a third of which occurred in just the last five years And this exponential destruction is just the beginning of what David WallaceWells in his book The Uninhabitable Earth calls the Great Dying a worldwide economic decline sharply deteriorated living conditions disruption to basic government functions and widespread hunger Looking deeper still into the future the predictions are even more dire Over the next century  degrees of warming could contribute to an additional  murders and  million burglaries in the United StatesWhatever the exact costs of climate change it is Pinkertons job to read between the numbers looking for the potential for violence If youre suffering only one hurricane every  years or so shelling out  million to Pinkerton isnt such a big deal Paz Larach explained you bake it into your risk But if theres a disaster every year which is happening more and more it makes more sense to have dedicated staff on standby A Pinkerton on standby doesnt mean protection for just your insurable risks but also for the uninsurable risks  business interruptions theft of trade secrets pandemics And with the environment increasingly weaponized against the poor to borrow WallaceWellss phrase the sectors that rely on cheap labor will face more unrest among workers the state will struggle to keep up with crime and in the aftermath of storms with landslides blocking first responders regional offices will be cut offAnd this of course is exactly the sort of environment in which the Pinkertons thriveThe morning after weapons training I found myself once again in the back of an armored Suburban Paz Larach was talking on the phone beside me as we made our way to the Autdromo Hermanos Rodrguez a racetrack where we were scheduled to learn evasive driving Throughout my visit the Pinkertons had insisted on providing me a full security detail which included the armored car and two escorting agents as a way of simulating executive protection The two agents were clad in black suits and earpieces and shadowed me to dinner interviews and an outing to the Templo Mayor Museum rarely during the three days could I get either to chat with me They treated the job however farcical it seemed gravelyLike people companies could become habituated to modernitys relative safety Paz Larach said But it was his job to shock them out of such thinking whether through exercises or data For much of the last century the traditional form of defense for businesses has been insurance compensation  pay a premium up front recover later But one of the many byproducts of this model of subsidized recovery according to economists has been unfettered growth along floodplains hurricaneimpact zones and other highrisk areas After Hurricane Harvey Pinkerton found clients were frustrated and open to alternatives Most clients were not prepared enough Paz Larach said An insurance policy is just a piece of paperRead about new legal strategies to make the worlds biggest polluters pay for climate changePaz Larach rattled off a suite of services that were not strictly speaking covered by that piece of paper armed warehouse defense executive extraction hour surveillance chartered helicopters and planes escorted cargo shipments If you abandon your property youre kind of just blindfolding yourself he said  checking news hoping for the best Were your eyes and ears on the ground During the  hurricane season the Pinkertons chartered half a dozen planes across the Caribbean each of them full of food and under armed escort to the tune of around  each Ordinarily Pinkerton bills on a relatively cheap hourly basis but during a state of emergency the rate soars something Paz Larach compared to Ubers surge pricing By the end of the season after Maria Harvey and Irma Paz Larach told me the company billed tens of millions of dollarsHowever bankable and flashy tactical work is by its nature highly reactive which has left Pinkerton vulnerable to steep fluctuations in revenue At the same time Paz Larach found himself increasingly frustrated by how few businesses took even the simplest of precautions  generators stores of water cameras to prove damage to adjusters But as he brought these ideas to businesses he discovered an unexpected drawback to the Pinkerton name Companies didnt tend to call for advice they called because they needed a guy for a job as Paz Larach put it So over the last five years as the company watched the demand for incident response skyrocket it began to pour resources into building three dataandinformationgathering centers one each in Seattle and The Hague which focus mainly on crunching big data to predict crime trends worldwide and a Global Intelligence Center in Mexico City which is geared more toward the operational response to those trendsThe Mexico City Global Intelligence Center occupies a large wing on the fourth floor of an angular glass building in the neighborhood of Jardines del Pedregal At the entrance through double glass doors I was greeted by an enormous black rendering of the Pinkerton logo and slogan  We never sleep  along with framed prints of documents and photographs from the agencys early days among them one of Allan Pinkerton standing with President Lincoln another the rap sheet for Butch Cassidy The center of the space was dominated by a long white desk at which several employees all in black Pinkerton jackets sat at computers Behind a biometric scanner lay the operational nerve center of the office which appeared surprisingly empty From our conversations Id expected a hive of analysts hunched over intricate software displays But nearly every surface was eerily immaculate free of any visible sign of stress at their computers a handful of analysts browsed Associated Press stories and pecked numbers into Excel CNN was on The whole office felt somehow incomplete as if the company had staged the place in hastePaz Larach and I were met there by David Valenzuela a former Mexican police officer who looked to still be adjusting to corporate life He sported a deep blue fatigue shirt which hed tucked into his slacks Valenzuela was in charge of overseeing the analysts who worked there After scanning into the nerve center he stood by a screen on the wall which flashed up a GPS readout of our location Several separate smaller frames within the larger one then displayed ticking feeds Twitter a news wire Doppler radar quick links to police and fire This was the Pinkerton threat monitor  quite literally a monitorMany of the Pinkertons tools including the threat monitor were originally developed only for internal use  for an agent tracking a CEO through disputed cartel territory or keeping an eye on a tanker in waters known for piracy But over the last few hurricane and wildfire seasons when storms and blazes began to overtake industrial corridors throughout the Eastern Seaboard and California the company found that CEOs wanted access to these tools To sweeten the deal Pinkerton built out packaged services including storehouses of food a threat dashboard for Csuite computers and daily intelligence briefings Excited by the implications the company began rolling out an entire conceptual framework around what it called applied risk scienceListening to Paz Larach pitch the agencys future  all of it rendered in the gauzy language of consulting  I was struck by its relative simplicity which belied in part just how far most companies and governments are from accepting the reality of climate change Even if Pinkertons core competency still lies in tactical response the means of preparation are not exactly the province of big data Put food in a warehouse aggregate news consult the latest opensource modeling Pinkerton doesnt even see this strategy as climaterelated per se The company doesnt have a dedicated climate division nor climate experts from its perspective that would be redundant Pinkerton sells safety or its pretense in the face of catastrophe and the only real differences between the catastrophes of this century and the th on some level will be rate and severity As Jack Zahran the president of Pinkerton put it to me Pinkerton is a yearold startup still pitching the same basic vision You arent prepared enough and the government is too clumsy to save youLater at the racetrack we watched three young men suit up in ski masks to shoot paintballs at our SUV Even among my Pinkerton handlers the theater of exercise seemed to strain the reasonable connections between tactical response and climate change Throughout my visit I wondered whether I had caught Pinkerton in the midst of an awkward organizational transition or if the company stood merely to capitalize on the worlds growing panic  and if the difference really mattered They had after all taken me to fire automatic weapons ostensibly as a training exercise against desperate disasterravaged people It was impossible to experience that and not project it into a future in which in the absence of true climate policy or mitigation capital felt free to protect itself from outside risks  whatever form they may takeDuring one of the long meals that Paz Larach Rakov Lpez Portillo and I shared the novelty of my being there had faded just enough for them to reflect personally on climate change The relentless pragmatism of trying to respond to disasters and analyze their occurrence had seemed to leave the men with little space for the existential dread that marks so much of the modern condition But for whatever reason on this night as we picked at a plate of escamoles  a centralMexican delicacy of ant larvae  they spoke about their anxietiesLpez Portillo who until then had been jovial if diplomatic in answering my questions turned solemn his eyes glancing around the vaulted ceiling He said he worried about his children and what sort of world he might be leaving them But his fear he clarified wasnt exactly that they wouldnt learn to adapt it was that he their father didnt know what adaptation would look like He said that he feared variables he didnt know how to calculate variables he couldnt conceive of yetWhen Lpez Portillo finished Paz Larach admitted that thinking that far out was still difficult for him He was  and just married What the most immediate future held for him was a new home in Miami where he and his wife had just bought an apartment on the water It had always been their dream When I asked him about sealevel rise  something with which Miami is practically synonymous  he paused for a moment then said We know its a risk but we looked at it and decided it was worth it And anyway the apartment wouldnt be ready until  Theyd deal with it thenNoah Gallagher Shannon is a writer from northern Colorado who now lives in New York His last feature for the magazine was about a water war

Santa Cruz Island where invasive Argentine ants were swarming baby birds in their nests interfering with native plant pollination and crowding out native ants To rid the island of these pests without harming other species she designed specialized bait and wanted to do a trial run of the distribution equipment using sand as a standin for the baitAll was going as planned until the truck got stuck Mr Choate and a friend were also at the beach watching ships pass along the shore when they heard the sound of tires spinningMr Choate rode his bike over to help He used a piece of wood as a wedge and was able to steer the truck back onto compacted sand He rode away but returned to suggest that he and Ms Boser exchange numbers in case he said she should ever need his help in the future Ms Boser agreed before it dawned on her that this was a flirtation She had not seen it comingThats not how my brain works Ms Boser said Im sure I was completely flushed and blushingThe next day Mr Choate

curiosity I dont date a lot Ms Boser said so he got interrogated by everybodyMr Choate impressed with her travel said Thats when I found out shed been all over the damn world Afterward strolling along the Ventura pier they kissedBut Mr Choate left town the following week As the captain of a ship that supplied oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico he was often gone for a month at a time and home for only a few weeks before shipping out again This schedule did not allow him much opportunity for a relationship Id been single for quite awhile he saidBut they texted each other and he continued to reach out to Ms Boser whenever he was home on leave I was excited about it he said and very interested in her and getting to know her betterThe time apart allowed Ms Boser the chance to gradually adjust to being with someone but she wondered if it would work longtermOne hes gone for a long portion of the year and two hes younger she said But when they were together she was happy He listens to me he is kind and he is kind to other peopleA scientist even in matters of the heart Ms Boser populated a spreadsheet with data about a hypothetical weddingIm looking at these things and deciding if this is the life I want she said I decided yes because I could see a futureStill they did not move in together as Ms Boser had a sickly cat Two years into the relationship the cat died and she packed her things At the time Mr Choate was working a new job piloting tugboats off the coast of Maine I called him and I said OK Im moving into your house now That same week a heavy rope crushed Mr Choates hand

Patel with his familiarity of the trails at Shelby Bottoms but they got lost in the woods for four hours Ms Patel became frustrated but rather than tell Mr Burbank to take another hike she decided to

opened His next film will air on Netflix What ties his work together Plumbing the depths of black beauty and griefCreditCreditJohn Edmonds for The New York TimesSupported byBy Carvell WallaceI was impressed by how long Tarell Alvin McCraney was willing to sit in silence until I asked him something When I first met him on the campus of Yale University where he is chairman of the playwriting program  one of the most exclusive in the country admitting only three students each year  it struck me that he was if not distant then at the very least aloof Small talk was made and pleasantries exchanged but I couldnt help noticing that there was not much eye contact At first I attributed this to normal selfconsciousness but as the day progressed it occurred to me that it might be a kind of honesty He wouldnt do me or himself the disrespect of offering a charm performance He simply said it was nice to meet me and suggested we get a bite at a nearby Cuban restaurant Once there he looked over the menu for not long at all before ordering the eggplant steak and then as if on impulse an empanada de guayaba and a cafe con leche He would drink the coffee but would have the empanada boxed up to share he said with his studentsThen came the silence It seemed that he might have sat there all day had I let him quietly content thinking about various plays or current events or music or film Instead I started to explain how much the film Moonlight  based on a script McCraney wrote in his early s for which he would ultimately win an Oscar  meant to me I told him that I grew up in circumstances that allowed me to relate to its central character And it was here that McCraney began asking the questions leaning slightly forward over the table regarding me with patient but curious eyes Where were my people from what was their world like how did my father fit in if at all which plays did I perform in during high school what did my mother think of my performances He was a near balance of observer and observed  percent admirer  percent work of artThere were details he would recall and bring up long after this meeting Three weeks later he would make a joke that showed he remembered my birthday This is normally the stuff of politicians  a parlor trick of remembering details of making others feel as if they have your care and attention But with McCraney it does not feel performative He has a way of understanding and respecting the stories of anyone he chooses my story the stories of the characters in his scripts and plays the stories of the graduate students he spends his days teaching He asks questions that draw you into relief against your background and show you not only your own beauty but also his This it seems is one of the ways he has learned to navigate a treacherous world and stay intact or as intact as a queer black man can be in AmericaThe McCraney Literary Universe is a large one He is  and has seen eight plays produced written two screenplays won a MacArthur genius grant and adapted Shakespeare for the Royal Shakespeare Company in London When I asked what made him like theater when he first encountered it he replied I dont necessarily know if I like it now  but the drive to do it is innate If you want to write about this universe you must be comfortable using the word beautiful In McCraneys work the beauty of blackness is a praxis unto itself the method by which larger theories about life are made manifest The full original title of the screenplay that became Moonlight was In the Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue The film which won the Best Picture Oscar in  wasnt just about the beauty of its characters but about the way they fight a losing battle against that beauty  how they try to beat it out of themselves and one another The central conflict is that of a character trying to find harmony between who he is and who he is expected to be a struggle that is for many black men not a theoretical matter but a violent corporeal oneThe same ideas recur in Choir Boy the queer comingofage tale that marked McCraneys Broadway debut when it opened at the Samuel J Friedman Theater in early January This story too sits amid one of the primary contradictions of black American maleness To be black and fully realized is to be beautiful But to be beautiful is to be wanted which in America is to be unsafeMcCraney was raised in a workingclass family in Liberty City a fivesquaremile section of northwest Miami that is home to one of the largest black populations in Florida His mother struggled with drug addiction for the entirety of his upbringing ultimately succumbing to AIDSrelated conditions when McCraney was  His future collaborator Barry Jenkins who directed Moonlight was just a year older raised just a few miles away also by a mother struggling with addictionRead Angela Flournoys profile of Barry Jenkins the director of MoonlightFrom the beginning McCraney says he was obsessed with telling stories He credits his grandfather who was a Baptist minister for deepening his understanding of the spiritual power of narrative Growing up alongside immigrants from Haiti and Cuba also meant McCraney was exposed to the Orishas the pantheon of gods in the Yoruba religion a West African theology that has found expression in the Caribbean and across the African diaspora The stories of the Orishas like those of the Greek gods comprise a veritable soap opera of betrayals heartbreaks love affairs and tragic flaws Their influence on McCraney was meaningful enough that he would one day write a trilogy of dramas The BrotherSister Plays based on Orisha storiesMcCraneys academic potential was recognized early In middle school he found himself tracked into a magnet program that let him focus on literature and performing arts Thus began a long stretch of working in spaces where McCraney was either the only black person present or one of very few  an experience that strikes him as something of a doubtful advantage Youre told Youve got this special gift this thing that will cure you of your blackness he says But then they use that same information to castigate and diminish your people So now youre alone and cant relate to nobody So what do you actually winAs a teenager he became politically active through street theater working on community plays designed to raise awareness of HIV testing and education He carried this political view of theater to DePaul University in Chicago It was in Chicago in the early s that he auditioned for a show by the director and playwright Tina Landau of Steppenwolf Theater who would become his most frequent collaborator By her count theyve done  productions together since they first met He was just this beautiful startling young man with lots of depth and mystery she says Years later when he approached her to direct one of his plays she was struck by the power of his writing His stories she says on the one hand have not been told  because the details the specifics are so of his real life and the lives of his characters  and at the same time they operate on this very fundamental  whats the word Im looking for  on an ur levelAfter DePaul McCraney took a year off during which he traveled to Georgia to bury his mother and worked briefly in Miami theater Then he took his talents to Yale as a student in the same graduate playwriting program he now oversees Part of his application was an early version of the script for Moonlight a largely autobiographical story written around the time of his mothers death It was the overwhelming intensity of his emotions at the time he thinks that created the heightened poetry of the film He was unlikely he told me to write anything quite like that in the future I was  when I wrote that I dont want to be  again I dont want to be in that much pain ever againIf beauty is the pillar at one end of his work pain is at the other McCraney digs unflinchingly into the suffering that pulses at the center of his characters lives I asked him about the concern some black artists and storytellers have  that our work may simply boil down to trading in black pain for rent money If the question for you about peddling black pain is appropriate he replied you also have to think to yourself well why am I in so much pain It doesnt make sense he suggested to demand that an artist produce joy when his or her inner life is still processing grief He then talked about the rapper Lil Wayne who famously suffered a gunshot wound at age  For years he said the gun had gone off by accident only last year did he reveal that the childhood wound was from a suicide attempt He talks about the time that he shot himself because it still haunts him McCraney said He woke up in a pool of blood Hes like engaged in that and going through it Why is it important for us to be like Hey get over that Where are the dandelionsIt was not long after McCraneys graduation from Yale that he mounted his first production at Steppenwolf became the groups rd member and wrote and directed work for the Public Theater Center Theater Group and the Royal Shakespeare Company where he directed interpretations of Hamlet and Antony and Cleopatra The only thing that kept me going he told me of that time thinking of the second play was Ive got to bring this play back to the little Haitian girls who live across the street from me who have never seen themselves as royalty Around this time Barry Jenkins came across Moonlight and asked McCraney for permission to rework it into a shooting script prompting McCraneys first foray into feature film Steven Soderberghs film of McCraneys second feature a basketball drama titled High Flying Bird is scheduled for Netflix release in February  and in addition to the Broadway run of Choir Boy the Oprahled OWN network has ordered a season of McCraneys first television project the semiautobiographical David Makes Man currently filming in OrlandoAllison Davis a writer on David Makes Man remembers walking into the writers room with some nervousness He could have thrown his ego around that room and it would have been justified she told me by phone from Los Angeles Instead she was disarmed when McCraney suggested the staff begin by taking an online quiz to determine which Harry Potter house each person would belong to Then we started talking about what all the houses represented and then we started talking about what in our backgrounds made us answer the way we did and it became this very deep discussion about language and trauma and influences and we were talking about this for like three hoursThis ability to merge the mundane with the profound to draw complex emotions out of many different people and sources is a hallmark of McCraneys work David Makes Man pulls from so many references Davis said The Bible is up in there Yoruba is up in there Miami street culture is up in there ball culture is up in there He weaves it into this wonderful tapestry and he treats them all with equal reverenceI have never  and I mean this  never encountered a script for television with this depth of value says Phylicia Rashad one of the shows stars Because he is bringing cultural influence that to my knowledge has not been seen but existsThere are not many people from Liberty City Miami directing for the Royal Shakespeare Company winning Oscars and administering programs at Yale McCraney is consistently in rarefied air This goes beyond WEB Du Boiss notion of double consciousness To be a black queer man from poverty and enjoy accolades in some of the most exclusory spaces in Western theater doesnt just call for the maintenance of multiple consciousnesses it requires a strategy for keeping them working smoothly together When people say Im tired McCraney told me its not necessarily like Ive been working in a cotton field all day Theres tired like  you just dont know how much prethinking postthinking anxiousness anxiety that one has to toggle in order to deal with the United States Not just white people but the way that the United States is set upHis characters frequently find themselves wrestling with their identities trying desperately to keep their bearings in a world that offers them little reliable support Moonlight tracked a young boy in Liberty City whos abused for being gay before he even knows what gay means he finds temporary solace in a local drug dealer the first person who cares more about taking care of him than about responding to his stilldeveloping orientation In a second chapter the boy now a teenager experiences his first love with another boy after which he meets with even more bullying and violence He is forced to defend himself which means closing parts of himself forever In the third chapter he is a man  isolated reticent guarding his vulnerability with a tool kit composed largely of pushups gold teeth and firearms  when a reunion with his teenage love forces him to make a decision about whether he will live and love as a queer man Part of what makes the film work so exquisitely is the consistent sense of a characters trying to find alignment with his deepest self while surrounded by limitless opportunities to lieIn McCraneys  family drama Head of Passes Phylicia Rashad starred as the matriarch of a New Orleans family who faces a crisis of faith when a terrible secret is revealed As rains pour down causing destruction in the family home she must make peace with a God who would accept such suffering while her three children rant and rage toward their own horrifying ends Comparisons with Shakespeares King Lear are easy to make but for McCraney the plot similarities are not the point the characters are Thats an underutilized population of actors he says of black women entering late middle age There are women her age who dont get to Lear To Lear as a verb means to take over a stage in your later years and expound upon lifes quandaries It is assumed of esteemed white male actors that they will age gracefully into such roles roaring and speechifying and showing their gravity But where is that space for actors like Phylicia Rashad Its annoying McCraney says because who better to Lear than these womenPerhaps by way of reparations McCraney gives the play over to Rashads character in the second act granting her  full minutes alone onstage to rail against an unforgiving God while the heavens swirl It is thrilling to see in part because Rashad is a master of her craft matching the force of the nature she confronts with the force of the nature within  and in part because as in Moonlight we are watching a character do everything she can to hold onto a sliver of self amid a sea of violent forcesThese plays are quite possibly McCraneys own sliver of self While Moonlight Choir Boy and David Makes Man are more strictly autobiographical nearly every work he creates contains elements of his experience His home and neighborhood were destroyed by Hurricane Andrew when he was in middle school and a frequent aspect of his scripts is use of the pathetic fallacy The mood of the heavens insists itself into the plot manifesting the inner lives of his characters His narratives often feel like stories of mortals adrift against a pantheon of gods who are if not capricious deeply flawed and untrustworthyIn Yoruba lore one supreme god is Obatala who typically dresses in white can appear as either male or female and is the default owner of all souls until those souls are claimed by another Orisha Obatala is allpowerful the creator of humankind But in one instance the god was drunk on wine and made some mistakes in creation As a result the experiences of people on earth are sometimes difficult painful and unfair For this reason Obatala looks upon our suffering with extra care and favor Unlike the Christian God whose absolution serves as evidence of his faultlessness Obatala does not grant us charity because we are imperfect Obatala grants us charity because Obatala is imperfectIf the playwright is a creator of worlds he is every bit as forgiving and loving of his subjects as Obatala is There is a kindness in his treatment of character a clear love A major factor in the creation of Head of Passes McCraney told me his voice raising a couple of pitches a smile opening up across his face was that he just loves seeing black women looking at and talking to black women onstage There is nothing betterOn a Saturday morning in December I arrived at a Manhattan Theater Club studio in a building on West rd Street to watch rehearsals for Choir Boy The play tells the story of an openly gay teenage boy Pharus who is the head of the prestigious choir at a stalwart allblack boarding academy called the Charles R Drew Prep School for Boys His sexuality as well as his general boldness and impulsivity puts his relationships  and sometimes his body  at risk and forces his peers to confront their own loves and insecurities The music consists entirely of interpolations of Negro spirituals and folk songs like Rockin Jerusalem and Keep Your Eyes on the Prize delivered in multipart harmony by the nine actors playing students In the scene I watched the cast work on the character of David played by Caleb Eberhardt decides to open his heart to another character which he does by starting off a song Motherless Child The lyrics  sometimes I feel like a motherless childa long way from home  date back to slavery and like the words of most spirituals they have a clear and heavy range of meanings You can interpret them as personal spiritual and political all at onceAll those meanings are at play in the scene The boys of Drew are literally a long way from home They share showers sleep in dorm rooms and can call home only once a week They are left to build themselves out of whatever is in the air tough but fair headmasters a dignified but burdensome black excellence tradition a sky full of forceful and conflicting expectations of black masculinity It is too much and boils overTensions are high among the boys in the locker room who are still buzzing over a recent nearfight David on the way to the shower stops to sing the first stanza of the song alone then to a classmate Then the entire group joins in sending their voices echoing off unforgiving tile It is meant to be heartrendingThe problem this morning was that it wasnt working The director Trip Cullman  he most recently directed Kenneth Lonergans Lobby Hero last year  was gamely trying different ways of transitioning into this fraught moment What if Eberhardt did it from upstage What if he went halfway off and came back What if he started quietly and then builtThe playwright was present wearing a creamcolored cardigan crisp jeans and gleaming offwhite allleather Chuck Taylors seated at a folding table crowded with script binders and roomtemperature coffees So far I had heard him say little But now he asked for the floor The actors took seats I noticed I was nervous for him When the actors are struggling and the director cant seem to find a solution youre forced to ask Could the problem be the scriptBut when McCraney talked he didnt talk about the play or the dialogue Instead he talked about grief Casually as though it were something that just came to his mind He explained what it felt like to lose his mother at  He did not talk about how she died and he hinted only a little at the complexity of their relationship this address was not autobiographical It was to do with emotions McCraney described how grief lives in a persons body how it settles there He explained its halflife the unreliable nature of its decay He talked about the phenomenon when grieving a loved one in which you begin to have memories of times after their death that you think they must have been present for Remember when I won an Academy Award for my movie and you were so proud And then he talked about how things like that make you grieve their absence all over again and how that grief catches you unawares taking over your body when you least expect it It sits in a small reservoir beneath your heart It whispers to you at odd hours and yells at you in quiet onesI teared up just a little bit hearing it My own mother died in my arms almost exactly  years earlier My relationship with her was also complicated My grief also weaves in and out of being with little explanation or predictability McCraney was calling something into the room I might even say invoking it All that was happening was that he was explaining something about grief  something that he at age  knew and that the cast talented black Broadwaylevel actorsdancerssingers ranging in age from maybe  to  may not yet have known but were capable of understandingWhen he was done explaining Eberhadt spoke up I have an idea he said Is it OK if I try something To which McCraney replied Its your show man AbsolutelyBack to places The boys were at their fake lockers wearing fake towels Eberhadt stood upstage fake shower caddy in hand Action He turned downstage thought about singing to one boy decided against it Caught his breath Blinked Called out the first word of the song with a force that seemed centuries old Sometimes It echoed and landed There was silence We felt it in our chests He continued Sometimes I dont know where to go My mother my father wont own me So I try to make heaven my homeNow the chorus joined in It was a youthful mourning a boyish mourning A male and adolescent mourning A black one A harmonious one The song grew the room was filled with it it cascaded outward upward from their bodies in clouds of spirit that if you closed your eyes you could almost see When they finished there was a moment of quiet in the room before the director said simply Yeah Thats itThe moment McCraney lit up the most smiled the widest was when we began to talk about Spike Lee This man can shoot a film he said Nobody captures us in a cinematic moving experience like Spike Lee One of his favorites he told me was Lees sophomore feature School Daze released in  Its fair to say I was as a youth obsessed with this film I had entire scenes memorized I bought a copy of the script and read it late at night by flashlightMcCraneys excitement caused me to revisit it It is just as I remembered it wild unclean slapdash hyperstylized Its a comedy about an uberwoke student at a historically black college  played by a very young Laurence Fishburne  and his battles with a blackandbougie fratboy nemesis Giancarlo Esposito and his girlfriend Tisha Campbell Its just extraordinary McCraney told me If you ever wanted to talk about Spike Lee having a black queer aspect its in School Daze Because even in his endeavor to talk about the binary of colorism he ends up just exploring everything thats in the middleThe scene McCraney told me he most loved was the jazz and RB legend Phyllis Hymans performance at the schools homecoming dance Hyman is an undiluted marvel in all black crowned by a regal headpiece with a shimmering gemstone in the center Lee stops time in the film to admire her matching the cameras movements to her lithe alto and the warm velvet delivery of her lyrics It is a meditation a reminder of all that we as black people possess our history our musicality the art of it and the refinement of it Hyman who was  when School Daze was released was an extraordinary talent who never experienced the fame reached by contemporaries like Anita Baker or Whitney Houston despite being perhaps the better singer When she committed suicide with a cocktail of sleeping pills in her Midtown apartment seven years later she left a note Im tired it said Im tired Not workinginacottonfield tired but prethinking postthinking anxiety and suffering and grief tired Rewatching School Daze made me want to hug and protect every single black person on the screen it made me want to keep Phyllis Hyman alive It made me want to sing along with the choir in the rehearsal studio It reminded me that I am not alone in feeling sometimes like a motherless child a long long way from homeThe emotional stakes for black artists are often so very high It can be overwhelming to be deeply sensitive to love your people so much and still watch daily what is done to them The centuries of pain the unanswered calls for humanity the depth of grief sometimes threaten to become too much too heavy It is no wonder that there are those among us who take into their mouths entire bottles of sleeping pills or put pistols to their yearold chests until there is no more left to feelTo love black people immensely to celebrate our very being as poetry to lose yourself in our stories to search them desperately and perpetually for our beauty  at the rehearsal for Choir Boy what I witnessed was a man who has made himself a connoisseur of grief sharing that expertise with a roomful of younger black artists His power sure is that hes a playwright and that he has through decades of study and training built from the ground up a container for his mastery of feeling Understanding and creating stories has been one survival method But another has been the development of a keen patient and nearly pansophical emotional intelligence He has in a sense cracked the code on how to remain safe as a beautiful black man at least for himself It is of course to focus almost entirely on understanding and showing the beauty of others like youCarvell Wallace is a contributing writer for the magazine

boutiquehotel lobby from Palm Springs to Stockholm to Milan then connected it to a fivestory D printer fully furnished with pendantdome lamps waxy leaves and oldschool hiphop lyrics The output would be a WeWork So much serene lavish and mechanical attention is allocated to every detail the neon and the daybeds and the fiddleleaf figs the wallpaper and the playlists and the typefaces The newest iteration of its everemergent design concept may be indebted to Luis Barragn and Carlo Scarpa but the degree of thought and investment that goes into its terrarium construction is something its busy occupants are expected to register only as background noise WeWorks feel voguish but never threatening comfortable but never shabby rousing but never intemperate detailed but never ostentatiousTheres also free topshelf coffee the sort of minor frill most office workers might take for granted in a way the selfemployed never would One premise of the companys existence is that its good business to provide such minor luxuries to the otherwise unfrilled The coffee  and the draft kombucha which has come to supplement beer as WeWork distances itself from the frattier aspects of entrepreneurship  is at any rate only part of an environment engineered for felicitous exchange This strategy is supported by narrow hallways boxy plateglass enclosures distant bathrooms and centralized fruitwater dispensers but the companys architects never indulged the belief that if they built it people would come The spaces themselves are the staging ground for yoga classes wine tastings makeyourowntrailmix bars and vendor workshops about how to cut cloud costs For what remains of life outside the workplace there are crosspromotional discounts on Flowerscom and Crunch gym membershipsMost of us have serious reasons to worry about the future of work and its easy to object to WeWorks thin consolations on the basis of aesthetic or moral principle Once you get accustomed to the basic product however

flaming scarlet hair and a rockabilly swagger She started as the locations first frontdesk associate and rose quickly to her current role as operational czar personal concierge and oncall therapist she has also been recruited in her capacity as a theatrical jazz pop singer to perform at companywide events She has firstnamebasis relationships with everybody She knows when the printer by the sunglasses and accessories manufacturer is going to run out and when Ulrik the chief executive of the Danish softwareplatform company that is the locations largest tenant is arriving on a redeye and will require earlyhours access She was quick to put together cannedfood and usedclothing drives on the occasions of disasters and encouraged everyone to sign up for a marrowdonor registry Community managers remember peoples birthdays and their preferences in candy or whiskey and their dogs preferences in treatsWeWorks feel voguish but never threatening comfortable but never shabby rousing but never intemperate detailed but never ostentatiousIf Natalie was everyones favorite quasi comptroller it was clear that everyones favorite quasi coworker was a young accountant named Mabel Luna When she was  Mabel moved from the Dominican Republic to the Bronx She put herself through school and worked for three of the Big Four accounting firms until she decided her heart was not in capital markets but in small companies It was the idea of her own office which she selected before the space had a floor that gave her the confidence to start a business  a common sentiment at WeWork and one I heard particularly often from women and people of color  and on movein day she hung up her shingle as a private CPA Though she never advertised she quickly outgrew herself she told me that  percent of her customers have come through WeWork either via hallway runins or through the socialnetworking features of its mobile app She had several clients in the building  including a brewer of natural alcoholic kombucha a soleproprietor attorney and the German sunglasses manufacturer by the printer  and saw herself as much more than an armslength contractor The only real glitch was that her friendclientcolleagues were constantly stopping by to rap on her window with a quick question about cash flow or depreciation or to ask if she could spare an hour for a kombuchatasting panel or some volunteer handmodeling During tax season she felt as though she had to leave WeWork to get any work doneThe relentless sociability inspired by WeWork was always one of the founders aims even as the composition of its membership has changed When the company first opened in  its spaces catered to entrepreneurs The founders soon understood that the increasingly fluid and anxious labor market  its conditions exacerbated by the downturn but likely to exist in perpetuity  presented them with a much larger potential customer base Uber and TaskRabbit and other laborplatform intermediaries positioned themselves to match those who needed something done with those who needed something to do but they based their recruitment drives on a cynical reading of the economic mood The subway I took to WeWork was plastered with toughlove ads from services like Fiverr which made naked appeals to stoic virtues Actually it hasnt all been done before In doers we trust Reading about starting your own business is like reading about having sexThat sort of campaign felt manipulative The platforms emphasis on selfreliance for the economically precarious merely disguised their rentseeking WeWork by contrast just charged rent The company was perceptive enough to realize that disaggregated workers or at least those of a certain class did not want to hear that they should just kill it on their own bro They wanted to hear that nobody ever can What WeWork offered was not just rhetoric  a more sympathetic description of the restless fretful life of the deinstitutionalized worker  but true shelter from a pervasive sense of alienation Where Fiverr issued an invitation to gladiatorial combat WeWork promised a work environment remodeled for solace and dignityThus is the business model of WeWork recently valued at  billion now only facially about commercial subletting All its accessories serve to buttress its real product office culture as a service When people at the company try to explain that culture they invariably resort to talk of positive energy sources and the obligation to heal the social fabric  a vocabulary traditionally associated with utopian architecture s academic communitarianism or ayahuasca experimentation They affirm that all the ostensibly small incremental niceties add up to more than the sum of their parts and on some level I couldnt help agreeing The market certainly seems to As of this January WeWork has  members in  locations in  countries at least  percent of whom are employees of large existing businesses This latter category has helped double that membership in only a year Some of these enterprise customers are merely outsourcing their facilities management the way they outsource manufacturing or payroll others anticipate the revitalization  or even wholesale procurement  of their corporate culture The conviction behind the rapid growth of WeWork is that the office culture of the future is likely to be the culture of the future full stop and that it is WeWorks special vocation to bring it to marketThe idea of corporate culture long before it was identified and cultivated as such emerged as a solution to the problems of the large distributed massindustrial firm Ransom Olds is credited with inventing the concept of the assembly line in  and it was over the following decades that businesses began to feel an imperative to address the question of what work was supposed to mean This was both an internal bottomline matter  employees who toiled in exchange for only a paycheck were difficult to retain and unlikely to prioritize efficiency or innovation  and a social one By midcentury large companies like the car manufacturers had come to represent the predominant institutional affiliation for legions of American men Even if these firms had no explicit philanthropic interest in civic cohesion they certainly had a stake in the preservation of the social order If they could invest piecemeal labor with something like dignity they could neutralize the political and economic threats posed by union solidarityWhat they arrived at was a generic set of strategies applicable at any industrial organization designed to help workers recognize the value of their personal contributions to the final product The classic formulation of this approach was Peter Druckers Concept of the Corporation though its now seen  if not much read  as a foundational text in the study of management it reads like a sober contribution to midcentury sociology The simplest form of recognition is advancement Workers Drucker believed ought to be viewed not as exploitable resources but as human capital to be fostered and thus provided with the training necessary to secure a path upward Programs like project rotations  which exposed otherwise specialized employees to the breadth of company operations  should be put in place even if they seemed in the short term economically irrational in the long term they represented an investment in worker potential Employees unlikely to advance might more gladly accept their place in the corporate scheme when given a holistic perspective on production The maker of a cars door hinge for example might be shown where his discrete repetitive effort fits into the fully realized carThe anthropologist Clifford Geertz defined culture as a collective act of interpretation the stories we tell one another about ourselves in an attempt to make ongoing sense of why we do what we do A car manufacturer could just point to a sensible Oldsmobile something the world selfevidently needed Because cars were public goods corporate culture could easily borrow its energy from civic cultureIt could also borrow civic cultures prevailing norms  and in turn reinforce them The management classic Built to Last describes how Walt Disney for example did not manage a corporation so much as lord over an extended brood of subordinates each of them expected not only to abide by the letter of company decorum but also to embody its founders spirit Hourly themepark workers were held to an imperious standard of personal upkeep for men no facial hair for women no dangly earrings or excessive makeup As one biographer described it When someone did on occasion slip in Walts presence and use a fourletter word in mixed company the result was always immediate dismissal no matter what type of professional inconvenience the firing caused The people making the countrys cars could be forgiven a coarse exclamation the people making the countrys cartoons were held to a loftier codeAs the economy shifted from industrial manufacturing to the service and knowledge sectors it became increasingly necessary for businesses to articulate their core purpose as an organizational and motivational principle  and a way to differentiate their ethereal knowledge work from whatever it was other companies employees did The separation of corporate culture in particular from general civic culture was also encouraged by the ascendancy of freemarket economics Milton Friedman told executives that their sole remit was to tend to their own shareholder garden Shared goals while important ought to be strictly valuesagnosticAn intrinsic and wellelaborated corporate mission was seen as a crucial competitive advantage Built to Last examined as a comparative case study cultural differences in the tobacco sector As the authors put it we saw in Philip Morris an esprit de corps and sense of common purpose that we simply did not see over the last  years at RJ Reynolds Philip Morris executives have appeared far more passionate about their cigarettes than the executives at RJ Reynolds Philip Morris executives express much more defiance in their prosmoking ideology whereas the RJR folks after about  did not seem to care much about the products except as a way to make money  The Philip Morris executives in contrast framed the fight over cigarettes in almost selfrighteous moral overtones We have a right to smoke its a matter of freedom of choice Dont take away our cigarettes Dont tread on me One former employee told them that the company forced upon her and her coworkers boxes of cigarettes to take home with their paychecksImplicit in all this was the acknowledgment that corporate work was not a clearcut transaction but a complicated relationship The difference between a contractor and an employee was that the employee accepted the benefits of security and attention along with the costs of unspecified professional obligations  the sum of which could be called culture This paternalistic ethos in mainstream corporate America has long seemed aesthetically dour economically inefficient and morally retrograde Corporate culture today when it means anything at all no longer encodes a set of values as a miscellany of obligations but instead represents an elevated way to package a miscellany of amenities Given the structure of our current economy most companies understand that its in the best interests of the shareholders to call it even Theyve withdrawn the Disneylike benefits as well as the Disneylike expectations and set their employees freeWeWork has stepped into this breach purporting to offer the best of both worlds On the one hand it speaks the language of autonomy You can choose to sit at a table or a booth or a couch you can come and go as you please and if you rent an actual office you can decorate it like a tiki bar or a nuclear submarine if you fancy it On the other however it speaks the language of belonging awarding freelancers like me the chance to go to office holiday parties to feel as if our lives have been enlivened by the scuttlebutt around the ambiently professional boathouse With a stable corporate culture especially in a unionized shop these two wants arent contradictory Solidarity among colleagues can give strength and definition to any individual employees sense of independence But in the floating economy that WeWork equips theres something uneasy about the companys  la carte promisesCorporate culture today when it means anything at all no longer encodes a set of values as a miscellany of obligations but instead represents an elevated way to package a miscellany of amenitiesThe primary evidence for WeWorks faith in its own corporate calling  to be the universal purveyor of energy and community  is internal The two big collective imprinting events on the company calendar each year are Summer Camp a tent revival and a wintertime Summit a threeday carnival for thousands of employees In January last year the event took place in a cavernous theater underneath Madison Square Garden The ratio of MSG employees to WeWork attendees seemed to be approximately one to one and the two groups faced off with a kind of lookingglass symmetry on the one side union sweatshirts and jackets for the electricians and security guards and on the other young people in Women of WeWork or We of Color or East Region or Created in China team Tshirts and sturdy outerwear over the standardissue grayheather CREATOR undershirts The assembled WeWorkforce  which is for a tech company exceptionally diverse genderbalanced and bizarrely attractive  had a relaxed cool that clashed with the atmosphere of corporate sentimentality In the background an inspirational video invited attendees to imagine something thats greater than any one of us Everyone present was part of a new generation  the We generationOn the first full day of internal talks Miguel McKelvey a founder of the company and its chief culture officer took the stage in a purpleheather We of Color Tshirt A keystone of company lore is that he grew up in a matriarchal collective in Oregon The other founder Adam Neumann grew up in part on a kibbutz today according to recent reports he collects millions of dollars from WeWork as one of its landlords McKelvey explained that thus far the company had been associated with entrepreneurs startups freelancers and thats who we typically think of as the innovative people in our world This was a characteristic WeWork sleight of hand insofar as he was referring both to the employees present and to the current well of members the company has a classic Im not just the president  Im also a member mentality Over the last few years he went on larger companies thought WeWork seems cool We should put our teams into WeWork locationsThis was all prelude to McKelveys announcement that the company was radically expanding its courtship of enterprise customers  offering a suite of space as a service options under the new rubric Powered by We WeWork had contrived its turnkey member culture to make freelancers and entrepreneurs feel as though they worked at Google now WeWork would turn around and help employees at legacy businesses feel as though they worked at WeWork Some companies like Liberty Mutual Boston and Nasdaq New York have simply taken a floor or two in a WeWork location Others like IBM New York have moved into entire buildings WeWorks most enthusiastic customers  UBS Weehawken NJ and Sprint Kansas City are two of the biggest examples  have engaged the companys bespoke services from planning through buildout to managementVeresh Sita an executive in charge of this novel product line appeared onstage and asked us to close our eyes and imagine a workplace  imagine a workplace where you can create a life imagine a workplace thats so much more than an office desks and infrastructure imagine a workplace built on your needs  physically and digitally When we opened our eyes he reminded us that most people did not have that privilege Eightyfive percent of employees at enterprise businesses do not feel engaged todayThe screen behind him flashed a beige sea of barren cubicles Fiftyone percent of employees at enterprise companies are currently looking for a job What these companies needed was a better workplace experience Sita showed beforeandafter slides of one firms transformation The first showed a collection of yellowing chairs scattered desolately around white laminate cafeteria tables the second showed what we were to understand as the same space reborn as an open loft with gales of natural light reflecting off the herringbone parquet and the emerald shoots of their ubiquitous succulents I dont know what you even call the first one he said Death rowFrom an investors perspective WeWorks pivot to culture has been a business necessity The company takes out large commercial leases  initially entire floors later buildings  and subdivides the floor plans into storefront units with the size and flexibility designed to suit startups As plenty of discriminating observers have pointed out this business model is vulnerable to some huge macroeconomic risks On the supply side of commercial leases the company has little control over costs while on the demand side its highly elastic product risks feeling like an easily duplicated commodity And so from the perspective of both investors and customers its paramount that WeWork not be seen as purely a real estate arbitrageur The focus on culture affords it a kind of magical penumbra of workplace retrofuturismIf the companys CultureOS excuses it from the harsh realities of commercial real estate it also affords it an opportunity to differentiate its product from the surveillance capitalism of the pure technology companies It has collected an enormous amount of workplace data and has developed experimental desks that will feature personalized height and temperature settings all of which could easily be exploited by productivityhawk employers but much of its CultureOS is oriented to worklife balance This could be flexibly interpreted The Summit events included a panel with two community managers at enterprise locations One was told by a client company never to plan events on Fridays because people just didnt come in that day But the community manager and her team went ahead and scheduled the sort of social calendar they were used to and she said last Friday at  pm there were people playing Jenga and drinking beer People who would usually leave at  or  were staying later than they ever had Remote employees were now coming in every day one was suddenly around so much that he was asked if hed relocated from the suburbs to the city but the answer was no Even if I have to commute every day for five hours he apparently continued I want to be hereThe community manager was confident that something as casual as weekly happy hours had been revolutionary to their new clients Executives who would otherwise be hiding out in private offices are now being peerpressured to come out and hang with their direct reports We are destroying hierarchyWhen I met McKelvey a few weeks later at WeWorks Manhattan headquarters he made it clear that the longterm plan was not just to make IBM a bit more like Google but something much more grandiose The companys CultureOS was about being supportive to openness and conversation and the obligation we create to each other to be good humans to each other  to share a smile and some warmth Weve learned the hard way from social media he said that alignment along ideological lines is a shallow way of creating a human environment This McKelvey said is what he tells his team Youre not building work space Youre here building a new infrastructure to rebuild social fabric and rebuild up the potential for human connection It was he conceded a big leap But the company existed to give it a shot Who am I going to need in a disaster The person I took a yoga class with versus the person Im in the same Facebook group with The enterprise product could scale up that social infrastructure to unite millions and millions of people On a hardhat tour of WeWorks new West Coast headquarters in San Franciscos Salesforce Tower Adam Neumann told me Assuming we keep up our personal growth as a company as individuals and as a company there is no limit Businesses neighborhoods cities  there are new cities being built around the world and we want the call from those citiesWeWork is not so nave as to think that narrow hallways happy hours Taco Tuesdays and yoga are going to revive the workplace as a locus of societal coherence But it thinks that thousands of Natalies remembering the birthdays of thousands of Mabel Lunas might and its to its sincere credit that  unlike most other technology companies but like most religions  it recognizes that meaning at scale is a hightouch business and it seems prepared to invest in labor costs that even if theyre drawn from the lowwage hospitality sector will grow linearly with expansion When I spoke to representatives of Powered by We customers they were highly appreciative of a partnership that gave their employees at the very least better access to informal common spacesAnd WeWork is right to perceive that it provides its members with a heightened sense of social organization To join WeWork is to feel gently buoyed along in a strange kind of substrate neither fully adrift nor fully anchored loosely bound to others by novel waveforms These ties alternately resemble deals between independent contractors collaborations between colleagues flirtations between strangers and intimacy between friends  and insofar as they muddy the boundaries between these things they ultimately feel like none of them There is a nearimaginable WeWorld in which all human endeavor outsources itself to associations of WeNodes that in an eternal churn arise as spontaneously as they disperse If a very clever combination of architecture technology and hospitality serves as an analgesic for the disaggregated it can just as easily function as a solvent for the institutions that remainThis might not be such a bad thing especially for certain types of creatives and innovators but its hard to see where community will take root and culture will flower WeWorks executives might believe that people are lonely and atomized because our social infrastructure has been degraded but the problem is not that we lack opportunities to brush up against one another They confuse the possibility of interaction with the incentive and desire to interact they confuse their own set decoration for the provision of a common script You cannot put a bunch of random actors on a stage and expect them to fumble their way toward a play When a spirit of community does unfold ex nihilo in one of their spaces the simplest explanation is selection bias When they open locations based on proximity to a Whole Foods or an Apple store they are masking the sorting mechanism theyve used to build their brandWeWork had contrived its turnkey member culture to make freelancers and entrepreneurs feel as though they worked at Google now WeWork would turn around and help employees at legacy businesses feel as though they worked at WeWork As for me I never went to any of those free yoga classes I suppose I cant really speak for Williamsburgs other members but perhaps thats the point I was an extracurricular truant in part because I liked my own yoga classes just fine and in part because the WeWork events I did attend were so networky Also I always had too much work Its tempting to underline the paradox that in my case a WeWork yoga class could very plausibly have counted as work but then again the very same could be said for any of North Fourth Streets accountants or kombucha marketers  not to make allies in anticipation of disaster but to trawl for more clients and contractorsAnd I didnt really care to go to the holiday party either The anarchic thrill of a masquerade is electrifying only insofar as it feels genuinely remissive A harvest ritual only makes sense as a reprieve from the collective sacrifices of the season One thing that executives at Philip Morris and Disney understood was that cultures succeed in the attempt to organize and structure human behavior only when they address both what you are permitted to do and what you are obligated to do Do what you love is only half a culture whats missing is the idea that there might be some deep reward beyond the gratification of selfdiscipline for doing what you have to do even when you dont love it  in other words for doing work An authority that cant compel is not an authority that can protect or inspireWeWorks own precedent puts its employees in an excellent position to understand this dynamic A recent executive mandate declared the company a meatfree organization When I interviewed McKelvey not long after the Summit he had a very fuzzy time trying to explain the meaning of the eight pillars of its CultureOS and the relationships among them But when he noticed that the PR representative happened to be carrying a singleuse plastic water bottle he admonished her to be mindful of her own consumption For all the companys vaulting ambition to build the workplace of the future this was much closer to Walt Disney than Milton FriedmanOver the past year as WeWork has been folded into what is now called the We Company  which encompasses WeGrow its school and WeLive its communal housing projects  its Powered by We product has been refined and formalized Recently I met with Lakshmi Rengarajan its director of workplace connection and a recent recruit from Matchcom and Craig Robinson a veteran of commercial real estate who now served as global head of Powered by We Services along with two PR representatives the companys data show that people prefer small conference rooms to mediumsize ones and the five of us were pressed into intimacy by the vitrine theyd reservedRengarajan and Robinson were careful to italicize the idea that theyre not trying to foist their own strong participatory idiosyncratic culture on anybody elses shop Their services while inspired by and grounded in the companys internal environment begin with WeWorks tailored attempts to understand the clients own organizational structure and needs They did of course have a repertoire of connective practices that seemed to them universally valuable Rengarajan told me that the first step toward someone being seen as a full human was to begin with something as simple as a round of stories about where peoples first names came from she explained that a former boss unable for some reason to pronounce the name Lakshmi had simply called her Sue Robinson who had personally experienced Rengarajans exercise twice said that the activity made it easy to remember Rengarajan because her name meant she was born on a Monday Or maybe it wasnt MondayFriday she said and laughedBut they were not so presumptuous as to expect that Sprint or UBS would have a cafeteria that served no meat I wondered how far they would extend themselves to help a firm help its employees to do what they loved Would they be willing to work with say Philip Morris Everyone tried to sustain simultaneous eye contact with me while they all paused to give it some thoughtThat each repeated in turn with total collective sincerity is a great question They were going to have to talk about itGideon LewisKraus is a writer at large for the magazine He last wrote about research on ancient DNAFeb  Feb  Feb  Feb  Feb  Feb
