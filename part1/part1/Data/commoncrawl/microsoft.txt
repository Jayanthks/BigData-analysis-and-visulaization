Ballmer, who succeeded co-founder Bill Gates as CEO in 2000, has largely been blamed for the tech giant’s poor long-term stock performance and the company’s dearth of innovative products and services.Related: Google Glass is Dead On Arrival – Here's WhyYet Ballmer’s “entry point made it impossible for anyone to really succeed,” says Yahoo! Finance Senior Columnist Mike Santoli. “It was at the very peak of the Internet bubble. Microsoft stock was destined to be a terrible investment at the moment.”Microsoft certainly has had its share of stumbles – the portable music player Zune and most recently its new Surface tablet – but it has also been able to weather the aftermath of the tech crash better than its competitors, namely Cisco (CSCO) and Intel (INTC). Ballmer may have been too focused on defending Microsoft’s turf than creating world-altering devices, but criticism of Ballmer’s tenure has been “a little too convenient and simplistic,” argues Santoli.Related: Do Not Buy the Ballmer Bounce: FahmyAs CEO, Ballmer has grown cash flow and developed successful products like Windows XP and the Xbox 360. He led the charge to buy Internet phone service provider Skype for $8.5 billion in 2011. With less than a year on the job remaining, Ballmer’s main priority will likely be finding his replacement, not an easy task for a company as big and as closely watched by investors and the tech industry. Many insiders would love to see Gates return as CEO but the billionaire has already publicly squashed that idea. The best person for Microsoft may be an outsider, someone who can pivot the company away from PCs, says Santoli.

Microsoft researchers are trying to solve that problem via a tool kit for Unity VR developers to help players with low vision.  Since vision problems vary by individual, the research team at Microsoft decided on a tool kit approach so players can customize their experience.SmarterAnalyst•2 days agoMicrosoft (MSFT) Stock’s Big Rally Should ContinueMicrosoft (NASDSAQ:MSFT) has been on a winning streak given its diversified business portfolio and ability to deliver growth and financial results in a timely manner. Analysts continue to rally around the stock heading into its earnings announcement on April 24, which makes sense given the momentum on the charts, and sustained interest for a variety of Microsoft’s products both for consumers, and within the enterprise as well.The growth narrative tied to Azure Cloud drives much of the upside commentary among analysts despite the growth rate from Azure is expected to decelerate over the next couple-years. MSFT still trades at a fairly reasonable valuation at 31.35x earnings. The company’s current market capitalization is $934 Billion, with psychological resistance at $1 Trillion, or $130.37. Chances are Microsoft can reach $130 within the next couple months, assuming the stock market rally continues, and investors chase stocks at higher valuations.Despite multiple expansion adding to the recent stock price gains, software companies tend to trade at a bit a premium multiple given the defensiveness plus recurring revenue of the business model. Just look at Adobe for example, which trades at 49x earnings right now, despite EPS growth expectations of 20%. Microsoft trades at 30x earnings with consensus expecting 14.1% earnings for FY’19. So, there’s definitely some room for Microsoft to trade at a higher when compared to other software companies in the segment.UBS analyst Jennifer Swanson Lowe remains optimistic on Microsoft heading into Q2’19:> Microsoft shares had a slow start to the year as concerns about slower hardware purchasing from hyperscale providers and tough compares in the transactional portions of the company's weighed on sentiment. However, our checks point to sustained demand for Azure and ongoing Windows upgrade activity as Win7 end of life looms, while a reset in expectations post Q2 should improve the setup into Q3. Stock performance has perked up in recent weeks, but valuation at ~21x EV/CY19 FCF still looks defensive, and MSFT remains one of our favorite names for CY19, offering a balance of top-line growth, margin expansion, and FCF-based valuation support.The analyst has maintained her $125 price target on MSFT, and anticipates commercial cloud revenue growth of 39% in the next quarter:> We forecast Commercial Cloud rev. growth of 39% YoY to $9.6B on the back of 66% growth in Azure and 26% rev growth in Office 365 Commercial. Our checks continue to highlight strong demand for Azure as the platform underpinning digital transformation (growth is partially impacted by relatively mature per-user business while consumption-based business continues to remain healthy. We expect Commercial Cloud gross margin to improve 100 basis points quarter-on-quarter at 63%, based on improvements in Azure partially offset by lower-margin consumption-based services.The stock clearly wants to trend higher, and Microsoft does have a fairly solid track-record of meeting or beating consensus expectations. While Microsoft is a mature growth stock, the current consensus still anticipates the stock to trade at $129 currently, which implies that the stock could reach $1T in market valuation over the next 12-months.Microsoft will need to deliver some pretty solid results and raise financial outlook to get the stock trending up to $130. It seems doable given the stock’s momentum, and the valuation comparisons to some of its other software peers. Despite the catalysts tied to earnings, the summer months should also be interesting, as there’s a number of game software companies riding on this summer’s E3 conference like Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard.At this year’s E3 2019 Conference, Microsoft is expected to announce the Xbox 2, which will launch next year, but the preview announcement could add some excitement to the stock, as it looks to renew interest in its gaming franchise. Microsoft’s gaming business produced $10.35B revenue in FY’18 making it a big enough of a business, for Microsoft to start pouring resources into it. With the opportunity to refresh its console line-up, it would be a big opportunity for Microsoft to announce more exclusive titles developed in-house to regain momentum versus Sony, and also build a larger installed base of Xbox Live subscribers from 57 million, which has grown fairly stagnant in the past four quarters.Bottom Line:Improvements in gaming related announcements along with the announcement of earnings on April 24th will add some positive sentiment to the stock.

Shares of Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), one of the largest U.S.-based video game makers, are up 24% year-to-date, but the industry also has some laggards. Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), one of EA's most direct competitors, sees its shares lower by 2% this year.Globally, the video game industry is a $140 billion business and it is growing."Video game revenue in 2018 reached a new peak of $43.8 billion, up 18 percent from the previous years, surpassing the projected total global box office for the film industry, according to new data released by the Entertainment Software Association and The NPD Group," reports TechCrunch.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe video game industry, while expansive, is also highly fragmented. So while there are a growing number of thematic exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the market today, the number of video game ETFs, as readers will see here, is quite low. In fact, there are just two funds resembling dedicated video game ETFs.  * 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever With that in mind, let's look at some of the funds, including some stretches, that have credibility as video game ETFs. ETFMG Video Game Tech ETF (GAMR)Expense Ratio: 0.75%, or $75 annually per $10,000 investedThe ETFMG Video Game Tech ETF (NYSEARCA:GAMR) turned three years old last month and is the first dedicated video game ETF to list in the U.S. For an ETF focused on a somewhat narrow niche, GAMR has been relatively successful as highlighted by the fund's $100 million in assets under management. Home to almost 80 stocks, this video game ETF tracks the EEFund Video Game Tech Index.GAMR is reflective of the global nature of the video game industry as the fund provides exposure to 14 countries. The video game ETF's largest geographic weights will not surprise seasoned gamers. The U.S., Japan, South Korea and China combine for almost 78% of the fund's weight. GAMR provides exposure to several compelling video game themes, including mobile gaming and digital downloads."The percentage of digitally downloaded video games rose from 31% in 2010 to 74% in 2016," according to ETFMG. "This is expected to climb to nearly 93% by 2021."This video game ETF is up nearly 17% year-to-date. VanEck Vectors Video Gaming and eSports ETF (ESPO)Expense Ratio: 0.55%In the video game ETF realm, the VanEck Vectors Video Gaming and eSports ETF (NYSEARCA:ESPO) is the most direct competitor to the aforementioned GAMR. ESPO, which debuted last October, is not just a video game ETF. The fund is one of the best avenues for exposure to the booming e-sports market.ESPO tracks the Global Video Gaming and esports Index. Many of the dedicated esports companies are not yet publicly traded, so ESPO's 25 holdings run the gamut of video game makers, such as Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts, semiconductor makers and console makers. ESPO's components must derive at least half their sales from video games or esports to be included in the fund.Up 20.28% this year, this video game ETF has recently been hitting new highs, reflecting investors' expectations for the growing esports market.  * 6 Cheap Stocks That Cost Less Than $10 "Competitive video gaming audience expected to reach 454 million people globally in 2019," according to VanEck. "Esports revenue growth has increased almost 40% yearly since 2015, supported by a young, affluent audience." iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)Expense Ratio: 0.47%No, the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) is not a video game ETF, but remember, there are not many video game ETFs and some semiconductor makers are heavily involved in the video game and competitive gaming markets. That includes Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the largest holding in SOXX.Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is also making inroads in the video game space, having recently reported that its chips will power Google's online gaming platform known as Stadia. Shares of Nvidia and AMD combine for about 13% of SOXX's weight.While that is not enough to make this chip fund a video game ETF, it is enough to make SOXX an appropriate option for investors looking for indirect video game exposure via the ETF wrapper. SOXX is higher by 29% this year. First Trust Cloud Computing ETF (SKYY)Expense Ratio: 0.60%Some of the largest companies in the U.S., such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), have significant video game exposure, but because video games are not the primary drivers of those companies' revenue, they do not reside in video game ETFs.While it is not a proper video game ETF, the First Trust Cloud Computing ETF (NASDSAQ:SKYY) has some legitimated video game credibility. Mobile game maker Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) is SKYY's largest holding at a weight of 6.18%. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), a platform for social gaming, represents nearly 5% of SKYY's weight while Amazon and Microsoft combine for nearly 7% of the fund's weight. Additionally, there are myriad cloud applications in the video game universe.  * 10 Dividend Growth Stocks You Can't Miss "On trend with community gaming, the increasing preference for multiplayer gaming is pushing momentum in the cloud gaming industry," according to ETMG. "Cloud gaming allows gamers access to supercomputers that can render high-end games, exceeding the processing power that normal hardware players are capable of." iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV)Expense Ratio: 0.47%As its name implies, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (CBOE:IGV) is a software fund, not a dedicated video game ETF. However, IGV does have ample video game exposure because many companies in this space are software makers.Microsoft is IGV's largest holding at a weight of just over 8% … a relevant point because the company is the maker of the Xbox console. Additionally, a point that gets overlooked because of Microsoft's sprawling businesses, including business software and the cloud, is that the company is actually the fourth-largest video game company in the U.S.Video game makers Activision, Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive Software (NASDAQ:TTWO) combine for nearly 7% of IGV's weight. Global X Social Media ETF (SOCL) Expense Ratio: 0.65%The Global X Social Media ETF (NASDAQ:SOCL) is a valid alternative for a traditional video game ETF for several reasons. China's Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) is SOCL's largest holding at a weight of nearly 13% and that company is a significant footprint in China's growing video game market. In fact, China is the world's largest video game market.Bolstering the case for video game growth in China is that the government there approved nearly 800 games in the first quarter, most of which were not traditional poker or gambling-related board games. SOCL's video game ETF status is boosted by exposure to Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook and Zynga, among others.With so many gamers turning to multi-player games and using these games to interact with friends and make new acquaintances, the intersections of social media and gaming are potentially limitless and highly lucrative for advertisers and game makers. Simply put, SOCL is a social media fund, but its video game ETF credentials have the potential to exponentially grow in the years ahead. Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (XLC)Expense Ratio: 0.13%The Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLC) is the first ETF dedicated to the communication services sector, which debuted last year. As such, this fund features massive exposure to Facebook and the two share classes of Alphabet. Those stocks combine for almost 43% of XLC's weight, giving this fund video game ETF viability.Activision Blizzard is also a top 10 holding in XLC and Electronic Arts and Take-Two also reside in this fund. XLC would see its video game ETF credentials increase if Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), which combine for 10.26% of the fund's weight, bolster their video game exposure.Ultimately, XLC has some video game exposure, but the average market value of its 26 components is $358.69 billion, meaning many of these companies' bottom lines are not going to be materially altered by video game exposure over the near to medium term.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Owing to its operational stability, lack of any prominent headwinds, and robust exposure to secular growth tailwinds in the cloud market, MSFT stock was largely insulated from the late 2018 market sell-off.Until December. Then, markets fell off a cliff. So did MSFT stock. In just a few weeks, it spiraled from $112 to $94.Since then, it's been nothing but up, up and away for MSFT stock. The shares rebounded back above $100 by the end of the year. They cruised past $110 by February and by April, sailed above $120. All together, MSFT stock has rebounded 30% over the past few months to trade at fresh all-time highs today.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Q3 Numbers Will Be Gut CheckThis rally is about to get a gut check. Microsoft reports third quarter numbers next week. Considering how far and how fast Microsoft stock has come over the past few months, the company needs these numbers to be good in order for the stock to hold onto its year-to-date gains.Will the numbers be good? I think so. Everything I'm looking at suggests that Microsoft's cloud business has been on fire over the past few months. Ultimately, that should lead to headline beating numbers which will keep the rally in MSFT stock alive.Bigger picture, continued cloud strength will keep MSFT stock on a longer-term winning trajectory. Until that cloud strength cools, MSFT stock will keep making new highs. Investors Brushed Off Earlier DisappointmentBroadly speaking, Microsoft's upcoming third quarter earnings report is critical because it has the power to either confirm or negate the big year-to-date rally in MSFT stock.  * 10 S&P 500 Stocks to Weather the Earnings Storm To be sure, this isn't the first time we've heard numbers from Microsoft in 2019. Back in late January, the company delivered Q2 numbers that were largely underwhelming. The big negative? Slowing growth. Revenue growth slowed from 18% in Q1 to 12% in Q2, while operating profit lost its mojo, with growth sliding from 28% to 18%. The culprit behind slower top- and bottom-line growth? Slowing cloud expansion, and that wasn't a bullish sign, since the Microsoft growth narrative goes as its cloud businesses go.But, investors largely brushed off those slowing growth concerns, and MSFT stock has rallied ever since. Why? Because investors chalked-up slowing Q2 cloud growth to broadly deteriorating global economic conditions. Those global conditions have meaningfully improved since late 2018, and as such, investors are thinking that maybe the Q2 cloud slowdown at Microsoft was just a blip on the radar. They reason that Q3 numbers should be much better.From this perspective, Microsoft needs to report a solid Q3 in order to satisfy bulls and keep MSFT stock in rally mode. Earnings Will Be GoodFortunately, I think Microsoft will deliver solid third-quarter numbers.Over the past several months, Exxon (NYSE:XOM) has tapped Microsoft as its cloud service provider in what is reportedly the largest cloud computing partnership in the oil industry. Volkswagen struck a similar large cloud deal. Meanwhile, Microsoft has teamed up with Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), VMWare (NYSE:VMW), and Slack in separate landmark partnerships, all of which have only broadened the utility and use cases of Microsoft's enterprise cloud solutions. Microsoft has also been named as one of the finalist for the Pentagon's huge JEDI contract, with the other being Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).In other words, it appears that over the past several months, Microsoft's cloud businesses have re-gained momentum that was lost in late 2018. This momentum will show up through improved Q3 growth rates, which will excite bulls and keep the stock in rally mode.  * 7 High-Risk Stocks With Big Potential Rewards Longer term, this trend should continue to play out in favor of MSFT stock. The global cloud growth narrative is still in its first few innings, and Microsoft has established itself as an entrenched and dominant player in that industry. Thus, as cloud becomes a bigger and bigger piece of the total Microsoft pie, overall growth rates and margins will continue to improve. That will lead to healthy profit growth, which will ultimately keep MSFT stock on a winning trajectory. Bottom Line on MSFT StockThe big picture here is very easy to digest. Cloud is a huge growth industry, and Microsoft is right at the heart of all that growth. Thanks to the company's dominant position in the secular growth cloud industry, MSFT stock has secured a bright future for itself.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long ADBE and AMZN.

Analysts continue to rally around the stock heading into its earnings announcement on April 24, which makes sense given the momentum on the charts, and sustained interest for a variety of Microsoft’s products both for consumers, and within the enterprise as well.The growth narrative tied to Azure Cloud drives much of the upside commentary among analysts despite the growth rate from Azure is expected to decelerate over the next couple-years. MSFT still trades at a fairly reasonable valuation at 31.35x earnings. The company’s current market capitalization is $934 Billion, with psychological resistance at $1 Trillion, or $130.37. Chances are Microsoft can reach $130 within the next couple months, assuming the stock market rally continues, and investors chase stocks at higher valuations.Despite multiple expansion adding to the recent stock price gains, software companies tend to trade at a bit a premium multiple given the defensiveness plus recurring revenue of the business model. Just look at Adobe for example, which trades at 49x earnings right now, despite EPS growth expectations of 20%. Microsoft trades at 30x earnings with consensus expecting 14.1% earnings for FY’19. So, there’s definitely some room for Microsoft to trade at a higher when compared to other software companies in the segment.UBS analyst Jennifer Swanson Lowe remains optimistic on Microsoft heading into Q2’19:> Microsoft shares had a slow start to the year as concerns about slower hardware purchasing from hyperscale providers and tough compares in the transactional portions of the company's weighed on sentiment. However, our checks point to sustained demand for Azure and ongoing Windows upgrade activity as Win7 end of life looms, while a reset in expectations post Q2 should improve the setup into Q3. Stock performance has perked up in recent weeks, but valuation at ~21x EV/CY19 FCF still looks defensive, and MSFT remains one of our favorite names for CY19, offering a balance of top-line growth, margin expansion, and FCF-based valuation support.The analyst has maintained her $125 price target on MSFT, and anticipates commercial cloud revenue growth of 39% in the next quarter:> We forecast Commercial Cloud rev. growth of 39% YoY to $9.6B on the back of 66% growth in Azure and 26% rev growth in Office 365 Commercial. Our checks continue to highlight strong demand for Azure as the platform underpinning digital transformation (growth is partially impacted by relatively mature per-user business while consumption-based business continues to remain healthy. We expect Commercial Cloud gross margin to improve 100 basis points quarter-on-quarter at 63%, based on improvements in Azure partially offset by lower-margin consumption-based services.The stock clearly wants to trend higher, and Microsoft does have a fairly solid track-record of meeting or beating consensus expectations. While Microsoft is a mature growth stock, the current consensus still anticipates the stock to trade at $129 currently, which implies that the stock could reach $1T in market valuation over the next 12-months.Microsoft will need to deliver some pretty solid results and raise financial outlook to get the stock trending up to $130. It seems doable given the stock’s momentum, and the valuation comparisons to some of its other software peers. Despite the catalysts tied to earnings, the summer months should also be interesting, as there’s a number of game software companies riding on this summer’s E3 conference like Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard.At this year’s E3 2019 Conference, Microsoft is expected to announce the Xbox 2, which will launch next year, but the preview announcement could add some excitement to the stock, as it looks to renew interest in its gaming franchise. Microsoft’s gaming business produced $10.35B revenue in FY’18 making it a big enough of a business, for Microsoft to start pouring resources into it. With the opportunity to refresh its console line-up, it would be a big opportunity for Microsoft to announce more exclusive titles developed in-house to regain momentum versus Sony, and also build a larger installed base of Xbox Live subscribers from 57 million, which has grown fairly stagnant in the past four quarters.Bottom Line:Improvements in gaming related announcements along with the announcement of earnings on April 24th will add some positive sentiment to the stock. Analysts seem relatively optimistic on the company and it’s hard to mess up on the announcement of a next-generation console this year, so the buzz generating commentary will keep Microsoft relevant in the minds of consumers this year.

First Trust Cloud Computing ETF (SKYY)Expense Ratio: 0.60%Some of the largest companies in the U.S., such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), have significant video game exposure, but because video games are not the primary drivers of those companies' revenue, they do not reside in video game ETFs.While it is not a proper video game ETF, the First Trust Cloud Computing ETF (NASDSAQ:SKYY) has some legitimated video game credibility. Mobile game maker Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) is SKYY's largest holding at a weight of 6.18%. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), a platform for social gaming, represents nearly 5% of SKYY's weight while Amazon and Microsoft combine for nearly 7% of the fund's weight. Additionally, there are myriad cloud applications in the video game universe.  * 10 Dividend Growth Stocks You Can't Miss "On trend with community gaming, the increasing preference for multiplayer gaming is pushing momentum in the cloud gaming industry," according to ETMG.

However, IGV does have ample video game exposure because many companies in this space are software makers.Microsoft is IGV's largest holding at a weight of just over 8% … a relevant point because the company is the maker of the Xbox console. Additionally, a point that gets overlooked because of Microsoft's sprawling businesses, including business software and the cloud, is that the company is actually the fourth-largest video game company in the U.S.Video game makers Activision, Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive Software (NASDAQ:TTWO) combine for nearly 7% of IGV's weight. Global X Social Media ETF (SOCL) Expense Ratio: 0.65%The Global X Social Media ETF (NASDAQ:SOCL) is a valid alternative for a traditional video game ETF for several reasons. China's Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) is SOCL's largest holding at a weight of nearly 13% and that company is a significant footprint in China's growing video game market. In fact, China is the world's largest video game market.Bolstering the case for video game growth in China is that the government there approved nearly 800 games in the first quarter, most of which were not traditional poker or gambling-related board games. SOCL's video game ETF status is boosted by exposure to Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook and Zynga, among others.With so many gamers turning to multi-player games and using these games to interact with friends and make new acquaintances, the intersections of social media and gaming are potentially limitless and highly lucrative for advertisers and game makers. Simply put, SOCL is a social media fund, but its video game ETF credentials have the potential to exponentially grow in the years ahead. Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (XLC)Expense Ratio: 0.13%The Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLC) is the first ETF dedicated to the communication services sector, which debuted last year. As such, this fund features massive exposure to Facebook and the two share classes of Alphabet. Those stocks combine for almost 43% of XLC's weight, giving this fund video game ETF viability.Activision Blizzard is also a top 10 holding in XLC and Electronic Arts and Take-Two also reside in this fund. XLC would see its video game ETF credentials increase if Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), which combine for 10.26% of the fund's weight, bolster their video game exposure.Ultimately, XLC has some video game exposure, but the average market value of its 26 components is $358.69 billion, meaning many of these companies' bottom lines are not going to be materially altered by video game exposure over the near to medium term.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Owing to its operational stability, lack of any prominent headwinds, and robust exposure to secular growth tailwinds in the cloud market, MSFT stock was largely insulated from the late 2018 market sell-off.Until December. Then, markets fell off a cliff. So did MSFT stock. In just a few weeks, it spiraled from $112 to $94.Since then, it's been nothing but up, up and away for MSFT stock. The shares rebounded back above $100 by the end of the year. They cruised past $110 by February and by April, sailed above $120. All together, MSFT stock has rebounded 30% over the past few months to trade at fresh all-time highs today.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Q3 Numbers Will Be Gut CheckThis rally is about to get a gut check. Microsoft reports third quarter numbers next week. Considering how far and how fast Microsoft stock has come over the past few months, the company needs these numbers to be good in order for the stock to hold onto its year-to-date gains.Will the numbers be good? I think so. Everything I'm looking at suggests that Microsoft's cloud business has been on fire over the past few months. Ultimately, that should lead to headline beating numbers which will keep the rally in MSFT stock alive.Bigger picture, continued cloud strength will keep MSFT stock on a longer-term winning trajectory. Until that cloud strength cools, MSFT stock will keep making new highs. Investors Brushed Off Earlier DisappointmentBroadly speaking, Microsoft's upcoming third quarter earnings report is critical because it has the power to either confirm or negate the big year-to-date rally in MSFT stock.  * 10 S&P 500 Stocks to Weather the Earnings Storm To be sure, this isn't the first time we've heard numbers from Microsoft in 2019. Back in late January, the company delivered Q2 numbers that were largely underwhelming. The big negative? Slowing growth. Revenue growth slowed from 18% in Q1 to 12% in Q2, while operating profit lost its mojo, with growth sliding from 28% to 18%. The culprit behind slower top- and bottom-line growth? Slowing cloud expansion, and that wasn't a bullish sign, since the Microsoft growth narrative goes as its cloud businesses go.But, investors largely brushed off those slowing growth concerns, and MSFT stock has rallied ever since. Why? Because investors chalked-up slowing Q2 cloud growth to broadly deteriorating global economic conditions. Those global conditions have meaningfully improved since late 2018, and as such, investors are thinking that maybe the Q2 cloud slowdown at Microsoft was just a blip on the radar. They reason that Q3 numbers should be much better.From this perspective, Microsoft needs to report a solid Q3 in order to satisfy bulls and keep MSFT stock in rally mode. Earnings Will Be GoodFortunately, I think Microsoft will deliver solid third-quarter numbers.Over the past several months, Exxon (NYSE:XOM) has tapped Microsoft as its cloud service provider in what is reportedly the largest cloud computing partnership in the oil industry. Volkswagen struck a similar large cloud deal. Meanwhile, Microsoft has teamed up with Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), VMWare (NYSE:VMW), and Slack in separate landmark partnerships, all of which have only broadened the utility and use cases of Microsoft's enterprise cloud solutions. Microsoft has also been named as one of the finalist for the Pentagon's huge JEDI contract, with the other being Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).In other words, it appears that over the past several months, Microsoft's cloud businesses have re-gained momentum that was lost in late 2018. This momentum will show up through improved Q3 growth rates, which will excite bulls and keep the stock in rally mode.  * 7 High-Risk Stocks With Big Potential Rewards Longer term, this trend should continue to play out in favor of MSFT stock. The global cloud growth narrative is still in its first few innings, and Microsoft has established itself as an entrenched and dominant player in that industry. Thus, as cloud becomes a bigger and bigger piece of the total Microsoft pie, overall growth rates and margins will continue to improve. That will lead to healthy profit growth, which will ultimately keep MSFT stock on a winning trajectory. Bottom Line on MSFT StockThe big picture here is very easy to digest. Cloud is a huge growth industry, and Microsoft is right at the heart of all that growth. Thanks to the company's dominant position in the secular growth cloud industry, MSFT stock has secured a bright future for itself.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long ADBE and AMZN.

Analysts continue to rally around the stock heading into its earnings announcement on April 24, which makes sense given the momentum on the charts, and sustained interest for a variety of Microsoft’s products both for consumers, and within the enterprise as well.The growth narrative tied to Azure Cloud drives much of the upside commentary among analysts despite the growth rate from Azure is expected to decelerate over the next couple-years. MSFT still trades at a fairly reasonable valuation at 31.35x earnings. The company’s current market capitalization is $934 Billion, with psychological resistance at $1 Trillion, or $130.37. Chances are Microsoft can reach $130 within the next couple months, assuming the stock market rally continues, and investors chase stocks at higher valuations.Despite multiple expansion adding to the recent stock price gains, software companies tend to trade at a bit a premium multiple given the defensiveness plus recurring revenue of the business model. Just look at Adobe for example, which trades at 49x earnings right now, despite EPS growth expectations of 20%. Microsoft trades at 30x earnings with consensus expecting 14.1% earnings for FY’19. So, there’s definitely some room for Microsoft to trade at a higher when compared to other software companies in the segment.UBS analyst Jennifer Swanson Lowe remains optimistic on Microsoft heading into Q2’19:> Microsoft shares had a slow start to the year as concerns about slower hardware purchasing from hyperscale providers and tough compares in the transactional portions of the company's weighed on sentiment. However, our checks point to sustained demand for Azure and ongoing Windows upgrade activity as Win7 end of life looms, while a reset in expectations post Q2 should improve the setup into Q3. Stock performance has perked up in recent weeks, but valuation at ~21x EV/CY19 FCF still looks defensive, and MSFT remains one of our favorite names for CY19, offering a balance of top-line growth, margin expansion, and FCF-based valuation support.The analyst has maintained her $125 price target on MSFT, and anticipates commercial cloud revenue growth of 39% in the next quarter:> We forecast Commercial Cloud rev. growth of 39% YoY to $9.6B on the back of 66% growth in Azure and 26% rev growth in Office 365 Commercial. Our checks continue to highlight strong demand for Azure as the platform underpinning digital transformation (growth is partially impacted by relatively mature per-user business while consumption-based business continues to remain healthy. We expect Commercial Cloud gross margin to improve 100 basis points quarter-on-quarter at 63%, based on improvements in Azure partially offset by lower-margin consumption-based services.The stock clearly wants to trend higher, and Microsoft does have a fairly solid track-record of meeting or beating consensus expectations. While Microsoft is a mature growth stock, the current consensus still anticipates the stock to trade at $129 currently, which implies that the stock could reach $1T in market valuation over the next 12-months.Microsoft will need to deliver some pretty solid results and raise financial outlook to get the stock trending up to $130. It seems doable given the stock’s momentum, and the valuation comparisons to some of its other software peers. Despite the catalysts tied to earnings, the summer months should also be interesting, as there’s a number of game software companies riding on this summer’s E3 conference like Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard.At this year’s E3 2019 Conference, Microsoft is expected to announce the Xbox 2, which will launch next year, but the preview announcement could add some excitement to the stock, as it looks to renew interest in its gaming franchise. Microsoft’s gaming business produced $10.35B revenue in FY’18 making it a big enough of a business, for Microsoft to start pouring resources into it. With the opportunity to refresh its console line-up, it would be a big opportunity for Microsoft to announce more exclusive titles developed in-house to regain momentum versus Sony, and also build a larger installed base of Xbox Live subscribers from 57 million, which has grown fairly stagnant in the past four quarters.Bottom Line:Improvements in gaming related announcements along with the announcement of earnings on April 24th will add some positive sentiment to the stock. Analysts seem relatively optimistic on the company and it’s hard to mess up on the announcement of a next-generation console this year, so the buzz generating commentary will keep Microsoft relevant in the minds of consumers this year.

Shares of Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), one of the largest U.S.-based video game makers, are up 24% year-to-date, but the industry also has some laggards. Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), one of EA's most direct competitors, sees its shares lower by 2% this year.Globally, the video game industry is a $140 billion business and it is growing."Video game revenue in 2018 reached a new peak of $43.8 billion, up 18 percent from the previous years, surpassing the projected total global box office for the film industry, according to new data released by the Entertainment Software Association and The NPD Group," reports TechCrunch.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe video game industry, while expansive, is also highly fragmented. So while there are a growing number of thematic exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the market today, the number of video game ETFs, as readers will see here, is quite low. In fact, there are just two funds resembling dedicated video game ETFs.  * 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever With that in mind, let's look at some of the funds, including some stretches, that have credibility as video game ETFs. ETFMG Video Game Tech ETF (GAMR)Expense Ratio: 0.75%, or $75 annually per $10,000 investedThe ETFMG Video Game Tech ETF (NYSEARCA:GAMR) turned three years old last month and is the first dedicated video game ETF to list in the U.S. For an ETF focused on a somewhat narrow niche, GAMR has been relatively successful as highlighted by the fund's $100 million in assets under management. Home to almost 80 stocks, this video game ETF tracks the EEFund Video Game Tech Index.GAMR is reflective of the global nature of the video game industry as the fund provides exposure to 14 countries. The video game ETF's largest geographic weights will not surprise seasoned gamers. The U.S., Japan, South Korea and China combine for almost 78% of the fund's weight. GAMR provides exposure to several compelling video game themes, including mobile gaming and digital downloads."The percentage of digitally downloaded video games rose from 31% in 2010 to 74% in 2016," according to ETFMG. "This is expected to climb to nearly 93% by 2021."This video game ETF is up nearly 17% year-to-date. VanEck Vectors Video Gaming and eSports ETF (ESPO)Expense Ratio: 0.55%In the video game ETF realm, the VanEck Vectors Video Gaming and eSports ETF (NYSEARCA:ESPO) is the most direct competitor to the aforementioned GAMR. ESPO, which debuted last October, is not just a video game ETF. The fund is one of the best avenues for exposure to the booming e-sports market.ESPO tracks the Global Video Gaming and esports Index. Many of the dedicated esports companies are not yet publicly traded, so ESPO's 25 holdings run the gamut of video game makers, such as Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts, semiconductor makers and console makers. ESPO's components must derive at least half their sales from video games or esports to be included in the fund.Up 20.28% this year, this video game ETF has recently been hitting new highs, reflecting investors' expectations for the growing esports market.  * 6 Cheap Stocks That Cost Less Than $10 "Competitive video gaming audience expected to reach 454 million people globally in 2019," according to VanEck. "Esports revenue growth has increased almost 40% yearly since 2015, supported by a young, affluent audience." iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)Expense Ratio: 0.47%No, the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) is not a video game ETF, but remember, there are not many video game ETFs and some semiconductor makers are heavily involved in the video game and competitive gaming markets. That includes Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the largest holding in SOXX.Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is also making inroads in the video game space, having recently reported that its chips will power Google's online gaming platform known as Stadia. Shares of Nvidia and AMD combine for about 13% of SOXX's weight.While that is not enough to make this chip fund a video game ETF, it is enough to make SOXX an appropriate option for investors looking for indirect video game exposure via the ETF wrapper. SOXX is higher by 29% this year. First Trust Cloud Computing ETF (SKYY)Expense Ratio: 0.60%Some of the largest companies in the U.S., such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), have significant video game exposure, but because video games are not the primary drivers of those companies' revenue, they do not reside in video game ETFs.While it is not a proper video game ETF, the First Trust Cloud Computing ETF (NASDSAQ:SKYY) has some legitimated video game credibility.

Global X Social Media ETF (SOCL) Expense Ratio: 0.65%The Global X Social Media ETF (NASDAQ:SOCL) is a valid alternative for a traditional video game ETF for several reasons. China's Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) is SOCL's largest holding at a weight of nearly 13% and that company is a significant footprint in China's growing video game market. In fact, China is the world's largest video game market.Bolstering the case for video game growth in China is that the government there approved nearly 800 games in the first quarter, most of which were not traditional poker or gambling-related board games.

Then, markets fell off a cliff. So did MSFT stock. In just a few weeks, it spiraled from $112 to $94.Since then, it's been nothing but up, up and away for MSFT stock. The shares rebounded back above $100 by the end of the year. They cruised past $110 by February and by April, sailed above $120. All together, MSFT stock has rebounded 30% over the past few months to trade at fresh all-time highs today.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Q3 Numbers Will Be Gut CheckThis rally is about to get a gut check. Microsoft reports third quarter numbers next week. Considering how far and how fast Microsoft stock has come over the past few months, the company needs these numbers to be good in order for the stock to hold onto its year-to-date gains.Will the numbers be good? I think so. Everything I'm looking at suggests that Microsoft's cloud business has been on fire over the past few months. Ultimately, that should lead to headline beating numbers which will keep the rally in MSFT stock alive.Bigger picture, continued cloud strength will keep MSFT stock on a longer-term winning trajectory. Until that cloud strength cools, MSFT stock will keep making new highs. Investors Brushed Off Earlier DisappointmentBroadly speaking, Microsoft's upcoming third quarter earnings report is critical because it has the power to either confirm or negate the big year-to-date rally in MSFT stock.  * 10 S&P 500 Stocks to Weather the Earnings Storm To be sure, this isn't the first time we've heard numbers from Microsoft in 2019. Back in late January, the company delivered Q2 numbers that were largely underwhelming. The big negative? Slowing growth. Revenue growth slowed from 18% in Q1 to 12% in Q2, while operating profit lost its mojo, with growth sliding from 28% to 18%. The culprit behind slower top- and bottom-line growth? Slowing cloud expansion, and that wasn't a bullish sign, since the Microsoft growth narrative goes as its cloud businesses go.But, investors largely brushed off those slowing growth concerns, and MSFT stock has rallied ever since. Why? Because investors chalked-up slowing Q2 cloud growth to broadly deteriorating global economic conditions. Those global conditions have meaningfully improved since late 2018, and as such, investors are thinking that maybe the Q2 cloud slowdown at Microsoft was just a blip on the radar. They reason that Q3 numbers should be much better.From this perspective, Microsoft needs to report a solid Q3 in order to satisfy bulls and keep MSFT stock in rally mode. Earnings Will Be GoodFortunately, I think Microsoft will deliver solid third-quarter numbers.Over the past several months, Exxon (NYSE:XOM) has tapped Microsoft as its cloud service provider in what is reportedly the largest cloud computing partnership in the oil industry. Volkswagen struck a similar large cloud deal. Meanwhile, Microsoft has teamed up with Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), VMWare (NYSE:VMW), and Slack in separate landmark partnerships, all of which have only broadened the utility and use cases of Microsoft's enterprise cloud solutions. Microsoft has also been named as one of the finalist for the Pentagon's huge JEDI contract, with the other being Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).In other words, it appears that over the past several months, Microsoft's cloud businesses have re-gained momentum that was lost in late 2018. This momentum will show up through improved Q3 growth rates, which will excite bulls and keep the stock in rally mode.  * 7 High-Risk Stocks With Big Potential Rewards Longer term, this trend should continue to play out in favor of MSFT stock. The global cloud growth narrative is still in its first few innings, and Microsoft has established itself as an entrenched and dominant player in that industry. Thus, as cloud becomes a bigger and bigger piece of the total Microsoft pie, overall growth rates and margins will continue to improve. That will lead to healthy profit growth, which will ultimately keep MSFT stock on a winning trajectory. Bottom Line on MSFT StockThe big picture here is very easy to digest. Cloud is a huge growth industry, and Microsoft is right at the heart of all that growth. Thanks to the company's dominant position in the secular growth cloud industry, MSFT stock has secured a bright future for itself.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long ADBE and AMZN.

During this time, some stocks have thrived while others have struggled.GOBankingRates researched historical prices to see what $1,000 invested in your favorite companies in 2008 would be worth 10 years later, as well as what the compound annual growth rate is to give you a sense of what the yearly return for each has been over time.Keep reading to learn about the fastest growing stocks since 2000, and see which companies have produced impressive growth rates during the past decade.SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY): $1,923.47Share Price May 1, 2008: $138.39 Share Price May 1, 2018: $266.24 Compound annual growth rate: 6.76 percentPerhaps the easiest route to investing in stocks is to simply invest in ETFs that track major indices. If you can’t beat the market, and almost everyone can’t, why not join it?In this case, the S&P 500 ETF from SPDR is among the most popular options for ETFs that track the S&P 500, which is generally considered the benchmark by which the performance of most stocks are judged.So, the roughly $2,000 that your $1,000 investment 10 years ago would be worth now is one of the best ways to gauge just how well some of these companies have performed.Apple (AAPL): $7,407.06Share price May 1, 2008: $24.99 Share price May 1, 2018: $185.16 Compound annual growth rate: 22.17 percentApple is one of the most iconic and well-known brands in the world, thanks in part to a few key reinventions and rebranding strategies. A decade ago, Apple was a tech firm less than one year into its release of the iPhone. Today, it’s a consumer goods giant that has ridden the smartphone revolution to its status as the most valuable company in the world, closing in on a valuation of $1 trillion.Netflix (NFLX): $74,394.38Share price May 1, 2008: $4.52 Share price May 1, 2018: $326.26 Compound annual growth rate: 53.87 percentNetflix shares have been prone to large gains and losses as it has grown into a dominant media company. But like Apple, Netflix wasn’t exactly the company it is today 10 years ago. In May of 2008, Netflix was primarily a mail-order DVD rental company that had just rolled out a streaming service that was capped at 10 hours of free viewing a month for the base membership.If you predicted that streaming was the wave of the future — like CEO Reed Hastings did — every $1,000 you invested in Netflix would be worth almost $75,000 today.Alphabet (GOOGL): $3,626.72Share price May 1, 2008: $292.13 Share price May 1, 2018: $1,059.46 Compound annual growth rate: 13.75 percentAlphabet is the holding company for technology giant Google. Over the years, the company has expanded into many different businesses. These range from office productivity products to phones, virtual assistants and entertainment services.Walt Disney Co. (DIS): $3,158.94Share price May 1, 2008: $32.45 Share price May 1, 2018: $102.48 Compound annual growth rate: 12.19 percentWith its TV shows, networks, movies and theme parks, Disney has evolved into a massive media conglomerate. Its share price stagnated in 2016 and 2017, in part due to poor subscriber numbers at subsidiary ESPN. However, plans to launch its own streaming service might help Disney stock recapture its mojo.Coca-Cola Company (KO): $1,438.09Share price May 1, 2008: $29.31 Share price May 1, 2018: $42.14 Compound annual growth rate: 3.70 percentCoke is an iconic brand and one of Warren Buffett’s favorite investments. However, the declining popularity of sugary soda drinks might be eating into the company’s profitability in the long run.Walmart (WMT): $1,468.90Share price May 1, 2008: $58.20 Share price May 1, 2018: $85.47 Compound annual growth rate: 3.92 percentWalmart is the world’s biggest retailer but it suffered a scare from competitors like Amazon in 2015, which, along with internal factors, correlated with a decline in stock value. That put a real damper on its returns for this time period, making this the first stock listed here that underperformed the S&P 500 over the last decade. So, one of the things to avoid at Walmart might actually be its stock.Story continuesTransocean Ltd. (RIG): $83.36Share Price May 1, 2008: $146.95 Share Price May 1, 2018: $12.25 Compound annual growth rate: -22.00 percentIt turns out being associated with one of the most catastrophic oil spills in history can have a negative effect on your shares. Transocean stock was riding high through the first half of 2008, but it went into a free fall when markets crashed later that year. The hits kept coming when, in 2010, the Deepwater Horizon accident occurred. If you failed to pull your $1,000 out of Transocean stock at any point in the last decade, you would be left with less than $100 today.Trex Company, Inc. (TREX): $23,582.58Share Price May 1, 2008: $4.50 Share Price May 1, 2018: $106.14 Compound annual growth rate: 37.17 percentTrex Company makes wood/plastic composites used in making outdoor decks — which, apparently, is a pretty great business to be in as the company has been growing at over 35 percent a year in the last decade. Although growth has been mostly consistent, 2017 was the biggest year for Trex stock: It gained roughly 70 percent last year.Microsoft (MSFT): $3,376.59Share price May 1, 2008: $28.50 Share price May 1, 2018: $96.22 Compound annual growth rate: 12.94 percentMicrosoft’s stock has performed well over the past few years, but it pales in contrast to its performance during the 1990s, when it helped create a number of “Microsoft millionaires.” These days, it’s still considered one of the safest stocks to invest in — especially for first-time investors.Nike (NKE): $4,152.34Share price May 1, 2008: $16.70 Share price May 1, 2018: $69.34 Compound annual growth rate: 15.30 percentNike continues to be an innovator and leader in the sports apparel and equipment industry. By sponsoring a number of high-profile athletes and teams, the Nike symbol is one of the most recognizable around. However, in 2016 the stock hit some headwinds and took a hard tumble that it didn’t fully recover from until the end of 2017.General Electric (GE): $428.76Share price May 1, 2008: $32.80 Share price May 1, 2018: $14.07 Compound annual growth rate: -8.12 percentLike much of the overall market, General Electric’s stock plummeted during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. For GE, the culprit was mainly its financial division, GE Capital. The stock recovered nicely coming out of that period, but major missteps in 2014 and 2017 have turned it into a long-term underperformer. In fact, General Electric stock was even more efficient at losing you money over the last ten years than the S&P 500 was at making it.Don’t Miss: The Classic Brands You Love Are in TroubleAmazon (AMZN): $20,406.42Share price May 1, 2008: $78.40 Share price May 1, 2018: $1,600.14 Compound annual growth rate: 35.20 percentA $1,000 investment in Amazon would have provided a substantial return for the long-term investor. A leader in e-commerce, Amazon consistently adds new products and services for consumer and business customers. This might be the reason many experts say this is one stock you’ll want to hold onto for a very long time.Pfizer (PFE): $1,732.59Share price May 1, 2008: $20.17 Share price May 1, 2018: $34.93 Compound annual growth rate: 5.65 percentThinking about investing in the healthcare sector? Pfizer is a good stock for beginners to try. The company is a major biopharmaceutical company whose stock provides consistent growth. On the downside, it has lagged the performance of both its industry group and the S&P 500 index over multi-year periods.McDonald’s (MCD): $2,771.11Share price May 1, 2008: $59.54 Share price May 1, 2018: $165.00 Compound annual growth rate: 10.73 percentMcDonald’s is in an industry where it must regularly reinvent itself. Faced with changing consumer trends and an onslaught of competitors, the company has responded by retooling its menu, adding all-day breakfast and changing to fresh beef in some of its burgers. Investors are probably hoping it works; McDonald’s stock has beaten the S&P 500 consistently since 2005.Starbucks (SBUX): $7,197.57Share price May 1, 2008: $7.98 Share price May 1, 2018: $57.45 Compound annual growth rate: 21.82 percentStarbucks has taken the way we drink coffee and turned it into a lifestyle, both domestically and internationally. After being hit hard during the financial crisis, the stock rebounded nicely the following years. Starbucks ran into trouble recently, though, after two African-American men were arrested at a Philadelphia location, prompting a wave of negative publicity.Find Out: How to Cut Your Annual Starbucks Bill Without Giving Up Your CoffeeChesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK): $62.70Share Price May 1, 2008: $49.22 Share Price May 1, 2018: $3.13 Compound annual growth rate: -24.19 percentBetween the financial crisis and then the massive drop in oil prices in late 2014, it really hasn’t been a good decade for investors in Oklahoma City-based oil and gas producer Chesapeake Energy Corporation. Chesapeake Energy stock used to trade for nearly $50 a share. Today, you can get a single share for just over $3, leaving you with a paltry $62.70 from a $1,000 investment in May of 2008.FedEx (FDX): $2,542.33Share price May 1, 2008: $95.59 Share price May 1, 2018: $243.12 Compound annual growth rate: 9.78 percentFedEx and other shipping competitors have benefited from the boom in e-commerce retailers such as Amazon, but the company has been hot since well before the rise of Amazon and others. FedEx stock has outperformed the S&P 500 since the start of 2001.Learn: How to Know When to Sell StocksOracle (ORCL): $2,193.15Share Price May 1, 2008: $21.01 Share Price May 1, 2018: $46.07 Compound annual growth rate: 8.17 percentOracle’s returns aren’t terribly impressive when weighed against the S&P 500, but they are still ahead of the index. What’s more, it hit a major milestone in late June of last year when it finally surpassed its all-time high from 2000 prior to a steep sell-off in the midst of the tech bubble bursting, having traded below that level for over 15 years.The Boeing Company (BA): $4,010.52Share Price May 1, 2008: $84.86 Share Price May 1, 2018: $340.43 Compound annual growth rate: 14.90 percentBoeing stock has been one of the stronger performers in the Dow Jones for some time, but much of those gains have been since the start of 2017. The stock has almost doubled since the start of last year.The Mosaic Company (MOS): $228.61Share Price May 1, 2008: $120.56 Share Price May 1, 2018: $27.56 Compound annual growth rate: -13.72 percentThe Mosaic Company is a basic materials company that produces concentrated phosphate and potash fertilizers. Of course, in the last decade, Mosaic Company stock has just been producing a lot of disappointed investors as it dropped to under a fifth of its May 2008 value. Maybe they could take pictures of everyone who lost money and piece them together into one big collage of sorts.Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI): $5,194.05Share Price May 1, 2008: $13.55 Share Price May 1, 2018: $70.37 Compound annual growth rate: 17.91 percentFrom the start of 2010 to the start of 2013, Activision Blizzard stock held painfully steady. The stock opened 2010 at $11.23 a pop and ended 2013 at $18.29 a share. That makes the massive gain over the 10-year period all the more impressive, considering it essentially broke even on the first half of that period. Since the start of 2013, the stock is up a whopping 530 percent.Use These: 6 Best Long-Term InvestmentsEstee Lauder Companies, Inc. (EL): $5,864.41Share Price May 1, 2008: $22.81 Share Price May 1, 2018: $133.79 Compound annual growth rate: 19.35 percentThere’s no need to slap makeup on results like these, Estee Lauder’s nearly 20 percent annual return over the last decade might have investors blushing at how well they’ve done. The company grew at a rapid rate after the 2008 crash, had one hiccup in 2016, only to roar back in 2017, nearly doubling its value from the start of 2017 to March 2018.Salesforce.com, Inc. (CRM): $7,547.69Share Price May 1, 2008: $16.82 Share Price May 1, 2018: $126.97 Compound annual growth rate: 22.40 percentSalesforce.com has been extremely consistent with its impressive growth over the last decade. Aside from losses in 2008, 2011 and 2016, Salesforce stock made gains in every other full year since it went public in 2004.EnviroStar, Inc. (EVI): $37,441.96Share Price May 1, 2008: $1.00 Share Price May 1, 2018: $37.45 Compound annual growth rate: 43.66 percentEnviroStar is the smallest company on this list, with a total valuation of under half a billion dollars. Of course, its admirable growth represents the sort of returns even cryptocurrency investors dream of.

She'd been coding since she was 6.A real life Powerpuff GirlAfter creating the board game, Mehta won the $2,500 second-place prize from Think Tank Learning's Pitchfest in 2016.This caught the notice of some marketeers for Cartoon Network who were looking to profile inspiring young girls as real life "Powerpuff Girls." She was featured in one of their videos, and things took off from there.Samaira Mehta at GoogleMoreSamaira MehtaMehta was featured on some newscasts and started selling her game on Amazon."We've sold 1,000 boxes, so over $35,000, and it's only been on the market for one year," the exuberant and adorable Mehta told Business Insider.It wasn't just happenstance promotion. When she launched the board game, she also came up with a killer marketing plan with the help of her proud father, Rakesh Mehta (an Intel engineer and Oracle and Sun Microsystems alum).Mehta uses the game to conduct coding workshops for school-age kids. And she thinks big.She launched an initiative called Yes, 1 Billion Kids Can Code that allows interested people to donate boxes of the game to schools. She then set up workshops to help kids at those schools learn how to master the game.At the start of this school year, 106 schools were using the game to teach kids to code, Mehta said."In the world there are over 1 billion kids," she said. "There are people who are willing to donate CoderBunnyz boxes to schools and to people in need all over the world who want to learn coding."Aadit MehtaMoreCoderMindzSales of the game have gone so well that Mehta has just launched a sequel: a game for kids that teaches them how to code using artificial intelligence.The new game is called CoderMindz and she's billing it as the first AI board game.With CoderMindz, kids can learn basic AI principals — concepts like training an AI model, inference, and adaptive learning. Eventually, they can use those skills to build robots.Story continuesShe developed it with the help of her brother, Aadit, who is 6, the age she was when her dad started teaching her to code.A young Valley star is bornAs the game took off, Mehta was booked with workshops. She's done over 60 of them in Silicon Valley with over 2,000 kids so far, she said.The workshops included a series held at Google headquarters in Mountain View, California. That's where she met Stacy Sullivan, Google's chief culture officer.Samaira MehtaMoreCoderBunnyz"After my back-to-back workshops at Google headquarters, we talked for an hour," Mehta said. "She told me I was doing great and once I get out of college, I can come work for Google."The plucky young coder told Sullivan that she didn't know if she would want to work for Google. She likes being an entrepreneur.Meanwhile, Sullivan and the folks at Google were so impressed with the kid coder that she was picked as the keynote speaker at a Diversity in Tech conference held in August hosted at Google Launchpad, the company's startup accelerator in San Francisco. But she's done a bunch of other speaking gigs, too, including one at Microsoft and at the Girls' Festival sponsored by World Wide Women earlier this month.Samaira MehtaMoreSamaira MehtaSince the debut of CoderBunnyz she's met a lot of big names.

When you buy a stock, your total return comes from two places - price appreciation and dividends. For the longest time tech stocks were never mentioned hand-in-hand with dividend stocks. Pick up Amazon.com (AMZN) for $300, sell half at a thousand bucks a few years later, and you're sitting on free shares worth $1,600 each a year after that. That's the blueprint!Many tech stocks used to offer share splits as their prices rocketed higher. However many technology companies are maturing, and with breakneck growth in the rear-view mirror, and they need a different way to draw investors. The answer, for many, has been to start delivering dividends, paying investors for owning their shares.To be clear, tech stocks that pay dividends aren't done growing. The increased presence of technology in all aspects of human life means that there's still plenty of upside, even for Wall Street's biggest tech companies. To wit, old-guard blue chip Microsoft (MSFT) has surpassed Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) in market value this year, and it's neck-and-neck with Amazon.Here are 10 tech stocks that offer an ideal combination of dividends and growth potential. They might not be the flashiest names in the sector, but they deserve attention nonetheless.SEE ALSO: 101 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2019 and BeyondAppleGetty ImagesMarket value: $985 billionDividend yield: 1.3%Everybody loves Apple (AAPL, $207.48). Warren Buffett loves Apple. President Donald Trump loves Apple. And a lot of investors made Apple - founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne - America's first $1 trillion company based on market capitalization.However, Apple recently has fallen into a significant funk and given up that $1 trillion price tag. It suffered its worst performance in more than four years on Friday, Nov. 2, in response to a quarterly earnings report that beat expectations, but included disappointing guidance and a revelation that Apple will no longer report unit sales in any of its products.That sparked immediate panic because the assumption is Apple expects less-than-impressive iPhone and other product sales going forward, even if margins continue to improve. That fear was further fueled by flat iPhone sales for the quarter.That said, there are reasons for optimism. For one, it appears Apple will shift its focus on its Services division (iTunes, Apple Pay, etc.), which has been a shining bright spot for the company over the past couple years. And some analysts believe this change in disclosure, while painful in the short-term, will benefit Apple over the long run.Also don't forget that Apple remains a cash-generating machine that, earlier this year, promised to buy back $100 billion stock and tacked on another 16% increase to the dividend. The payout has jumped about 92% since the company resumed regular dividends in 2012. While Apple's current yield is a mere 1.3%, investors who bought in around the time of Apple's first dividend now are earning a 5%-plus yield on their shares.SEE ALSO: The 100 Most Popular Funds for Your 401(k) Retirement SavingsCisco SystemsStory continuesGetty ImagesMarket value: $207.9 billionDividend yield: 2.9%Cisco Systems (CSCO, $45.48), whose networking gear helped build the Internet, is now trying to reinvent itself as a subscription company as its networking technology itself slowly evolves into software.Along the way, Cisco has become a solid dividend stock. Its 33-cent quarterly payout is almost double the 17 cents it delivered in early 2014. The stock has roughly doubled over the same time frame.One primary focus of CEO Chuck Robbins has been computer security. Cisco now has a suite of such products, available by subscription, like other cloud-based software. The company continually adds to it, too, most recently by adding Duo, which offers "two-factor security" that calls users when they try to sign-in to verify their identity. Other security acquisitions made in the last two years include Observable Networks and Skyport Systems.Cisco reported a huge jump in fiscal fourth-quarter earnings in August, from 48 cents per share to 81 cents, translating into a mere 41% dividend payout ratio.Small wonder that most of the 30 analysts following Cisco currently have it on their buy lists.SEE ALSO: The 25 Biggest U.S. IPOs of All TimeEquinixGetty ImagesMarket value: $31.5 billionDividend yield: 2.4%The cloud is one of the biggest tech trends of our time. Cloud computing, delivered by "hyperscale" data centers, have been making investors rich since the combination of cheap hardware, open-source software and virtual operating systems were developed last decade.But connecting clouds can be as profitable as running them. Data centers where the fiber lines of clouds often connect are mostly owned by real estate investment trusts (REITs) - a business structure for property owners/operators that requires most profits to be redistributed as dividends.One of the best-run such REITs is Equinix (EQIX, $392.43). Equinix has more than 190 data centers across 24 countries and is the world's largest colocation data center by market share. But it doesn't just offer infrastructure - it also provides data services, information protection and other solutions that make Equinix more than just a rent collector.Equinix, like Apple, doesn't deliver a particularly high yield, at just 2.4%. But again, like Apple, it's important to consider the company's ability to increase the payout over time. EQIX's payout has grown 35% since 2015, when it reorganized as a REIT, so investors should be encouraged on that front.In its most recent quarter, Equinix grew revenues by 18% year-over-year to 1.26 billion, and its guidance of $1.596-$1.636 billion in adjusted funds from operations (AFFO, an important measure of REIT profitability) would represent roughly 12% improvement from 2017.SEE ALSO: The "Accelerators": 13 Dividend Stocks With Rapidly Growing PayoutsGarminGetty ImagesMarket value: $12.5 billionDividend yield: 3.2%Garmin (GRMN, $66.15) is the house that the Global Positioning System (GPS) built. GPS can tell you where you are, to within a few feet - and Garmin has been utilizing that technology since 1989.Garmin was co-founded by American businessman Gary Burrell, who remains chairman emeritus, and Taiwan-born engineer Min H. Kao, now executive chairman. The company is known for GPS receivers, and moved its incorporation to Switzerland in 2010, although its main office remains outside Kansas City.Garmin only has a float of about 188 million shares, 34% of which are held by corporate insiders. Kao and his family retain the largest single stake in the company, but they have been steadily selling shares in a planned way for tax purposes. This plan minimizes disruption for other shareholders.While you might think a company based around GPS might be dead in the water considering every phone has access to things such as Google Maps, Garmin's still going strong thanks to a renewed focus on wearables (smartwatches and activity trackers), often ruggedized and with satellite phone capability for use in the wilderness.The company raised its earnings guidance in June, expecting to earn $3.30 per share on revenue of $3.3 billion. Garmin made a good stride toward that in its third-quarter results, when it reported profits of $1 per share, up 33% YoY, that were a quarter better than expected. Also encouraging: GRMN snapped years of dividend stagnation this year with a small hike to the June dividend.SEE ALSO: The 25 Best Low-Fee Mutual Funds You Can BuyIntelGetty ImagesMarket value: $215.0 billionDividend yield: 2.6%Intel (INTC, $47.11) looked like it was going to be left behind at one point as the PC industry it had a stranglehold on deteriorated, and as it failed to latch on to the mobile trend. But it has reinvented itself this decade as a supplier of chips and software to cloud data centers.Intel is the home of "Moore's Law," described in a 1965 article by co-founder and (later) President Gordon Moore as the idea that integrated circuits double their density, at the same price, every year. It is this concept, which Intel has made a reality, that created the modern technology world. Everything else - PCs, the Internet, devices and clouds - grew out of this central idea.Intel, once a major growth play, has emerged as a solid dividend stock. It has more than doubled over the past decade to its current 30 cents per share.But INTC isn't exactly done growing, either. The company reported a monster earnings beat for its third quarter - $1.40 per share versus $1.15 per share expected - and topped expectations for Q4 guidance. Things were so good that it upgraded its full-year guidance, too. The growth no longer comes from PCs, but from newer streams such as supplying data centers.All this is happening despite the resignation of CEO Brian Krzanich in June and the fact that Intel has yet to hire a permanent replacement.SEE ALSO: The Kip ETF 20: The 20 Best Cheap ETFs You Can BuyMicrosoftGetty ImagesMarket value: $815.7 billionDividend yield: 1.7%Microsoft (MSFT, $106.26) was nicknamed "Mr. Softee" because of its dominance of PC software in the 1990s and 2000s. But under CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft could easily be called "Mr. Cloud" today, as its Azure cloud (and applications built on it) has become one of the most stable profit centers around.Microsoft pays out $1.84 per share in annual dividends - only good for a yield of 1.7%, but the payout has more than tripled since 2010. It costs Microsoft $13 billion annually to service that dividend at its current rate, which isn't a small thing. But MSFT can easily foot the bill; its net income in 2017 was more than $21 billion, nearly double what it was in 2015.Long-term debt of $76 billion could be paid off at a stroke with $133 billion in cash and long-term investments. Even its capital budget of over $10 billion is manageable.Again, this financial heft is made possible because Nadella shoved Microsoft into the modern era by taking the focus off Windows and Word and instead emphasizing cloud services, big data and other pivotal technological trends.Best of all, Microsoft is once again a growth company. It had revenue of nearly $97 billion for fiscal 2017 and $110 billion for the year ending in June, a growth rate of 14%.SEE ALSO: 49 Companies Amazon Could Destroy (And 1 It Already Has)OracleGetty ImagesMarket value: $185.0 billionDividend yield: 1.6%Oracle (ORCL, $48.83) came into its own as the dominant provider of database management software in the 1990s, and has transformed itself since acquiring Sun Microsystems in 2010, most recently by becoming a cloud player.The tech company also became a dividend stock over the past decade, starting at 5 cents per share, quarterly, in 2009, then escalating that payout to 19 cents quarterly as of this year.Oracle's initial resistance to the cloud, followed by a late conversion, has left it with a lot of catching up to do. Founder and chairman Larry Ellison now says the company's future now hinges on its success in cloud applications and its autonomous cloud database.Oracle's acquisition strategy has also shifted from database applications to cloud services, such as Vocado, which works in financial aid, and Iridize, which helps bring people on to cloud applications. Over the last two years it also brought ZenEdge, a security provider, and Wercker, a middleware company, into its suite of services.Analysts were disappointed by Oracle's cloud revenue in the most recent quarter, but earnings of 59 cents per share were still three times greater than the dividend. Co-CEO Mark Hurd insists it can dramatically grow that revenue with applications. Oracle's dividend growth should buy the stock a little patience.QualcommGetty ImagesMarket value: $93.0 billionDividend yield: 3.9%Qualcomm (QCOM, $63.33) controls the technology in your mobile phone, and the dividend's yield of nearly 3.8% makes it seem like a bargain. But know the full story before you jump in.Qualcomm has been engaged in a multiyear battle with Apple over the patent royalties it demands from phone makers. Apple wanted a discount, given its size, and Qualcomm wants a 5% cut of all iPhone revenue. Now the two companies are engaged in court battle as Apple seeks new suppliers, including Intel. Until the case ends, Apple will not be paying royalties to Qualcomm, which has hit the latter hard. A QCOM lawyer recently said that Apple was $7 billion behind on patent royalties.So, why Qualcomm? Because QCOM is among the stocks that should shine with the arrival of 5G technology. The fifth-generation mobile network will offer far more capacity than what's currently available, as well as higher speeds, and will "redefine a broad range of industries with connected services," to put it in Qualcomm's words. And Qualcomm is one of the companies building the technology that will power this 5G revolution, giving it a realistic shot at a comeback bid.Moreover, QCOM boasts a solid balance sheet of nearly $36 billion in cash and short-term investments versus a little more than $15 billion in long-term debt. And despite its issues with Apple, Qualcomm still saw fit to boost its quarterly payout 9% earlier this year.SEE ALSO: 25 Dividend Stocks That Analysts Love the MostTexas InstrumentsGetty ImagesMarket value: $91.3 billionDividend yield: 3.2%Intel didn't invent the integrated circuit. Texas Instruments (TXN, $95.06) did, along with a company called Fairchild Semiconductor, from which Intel eventually emerged.TI, as it's called, decided to focus on digital signal processors (DSPs), which turn analog inputs, sound and pictures, into digital bit streams computers can process, in the 1980s. Today it may be best known as a leader in adding intelligence to ordinary objects, the so-called Internet of Things.Personal finance expert Matthew Ure, a vice president at Anthony Capital in San Antonio, says, "It is hard to imagine a world wherein Texas Instruments will not become more and more relevant."Texas Instruments also is an incredibly relevant dividend stock. The company's shares have gained more than 120% over the past five years, but in fact have been outpaced by the dividend, which has grown 157% to its current quarterly payout of 77 cents per share. Financial planner Joseph Inskeep says the company's "historic" dividend growth means TXN "should be on everyone's buy list."The company should have no problem affording that dividend going forward. Analysts predict 13% annual profit growth over the next five years.SEE ALSO: 15 Consumer Stocks That Deliver Dividend Growth Like ClockworkWestern DigitalGetty ImagesMarket value: $13.9 billionDividend yield: 4.2%Western Digital (WDC, $47.77) is a maker of hard drives, which are in the process of being replaced by increasingly cost-effective chip memory. How long the replacement process lasts, and how long Western Digital can prosper in that market and pay shareholders for their investments, is the question.Western Digital has tried to get ahead of market changes by packaging drives as "MyCloud" units, turning old PCs into virtual servers. It has also gotten into the chip memory business, buying SanDisk in 2016 and recently committing to invest $4.7 billion over three years to refresh its joint venture with Toshiba, which will keep the chips flowing.But most analysts following the stock still consider it a buy. They point to $2.3 billion in operating cash flow earned in the first six months of fiscal 2018, and over $3.4 billion in fiscal 2017, sustaining about $600 million in dividend payments. The company's third-quarter earnings declined year-over-year and missed expectations, but the resulting handful of analyst downgrades following that put most of the blame on an oversupply in NAND memory that could keep prices low.Western Digital itself remains a good dividend payer whose annual $2 dole is just more than a quarter of this year's expected profits. While that payout isn't rising, it is safe.SEE ALSO: Millionaires in America: All 50 States RankedEDITOR'S PICKS101 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2019 and Beyond25 Dividend Stocks That Analysts Love the MostBest Vanguard Funds for 401(k) Retirement SaversCopyright 2018-2019 The Kiplinger Washington EditorsReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextFoxconn says it remains committed to Wisconsin investment projectReutersAt $1 Trillion, Apple is Bigger Than These ThingsInvestopediaMarijuana Stocks: Let the Writedowns BeginMotley Fool2 Top Stocks You Can Buy on SaleMotley Fool2 Stocks You Can Buy and Hold ForeverMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo Finance5 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy in 2019Motley FoolWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadgetMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance內地熱門城市樓價回升星島日報57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolHere's What Hedge Funds Think About NIO Inc.

But under CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft could easily be called "Mr. Cloud" today, as its Azure cloud (and applications built on it) has become one of the most stable profit centers around.Microsoft pays out $1.84 per share in annual dividends - only good for a yield of 1.7%, but the payout has more than tripled since 2010. It costs Microsoft $13 billion annually to service that dividend at its current rate, which isn't a small thing. But MSFT can easily foot the bill; its net income in 2017 was more than $21 billion, nearly double what it was in 2015.Long-term debt of $76 billion could be paid off at a stroke with $133 billion in cash and long-term investments. Even its capital budget of over $10 billion is manageable.Again, this financial heft is made possible because Nadella shoved Microsoft into the modern era by taking the focus off Windows and Word and instead emphasizing cloud services, big data and other pivotal technological trends.Best of all, Microsoft is once again a growth company. It had revenue of nearly $97 billion for fiscal 2017 and $110 billion for the year ending in June, a growth rate of 14%.SEE ALSO: 49 Companies Amazon Could Destroy (And 1 It Already Has)OracleGetty ImagesMarket value: $185.0 billionDividend yield: 1.6%Oracle (ORCL, $48.83) came into its own as the dominant provider of database management software in the 1990s, and has transformed itself since acquiring Sun Microsystems in 2010, most recently by becoming a cloud player.The tech company also became a dividend stock over the past decade, starting at 5 cents per share, quarterly, in 2009, then escalating that payout to 19 cents quarterly as of this year.Oracle's initial resistance to the cloud, followed by a late conversion, has left it with a lot of catching up to do. Founder and chairman Larry Ellison now says the company's future now hinges on its success in cloud applications and its autonomous cloud database.Oracle's acquisition strategy has also shifted from database applications to cloud services, such as Vocado, which works in financial aid, and Iridize, which helps bring people on to cloud applications. Over the last two years it also brought ZenEdge, a security provider, and Wercker, a middleware company, into its suite of services.Analysts were disappointed by Oracle's cloud revenue in the most recent quarter, but earnings of 59 cents per share were still three times greater than the dividend. Co-CEO Mark Hurd insists it can dramatically grow that revenue with applications. Oracle's dividend growth should buy the stock a little patience.QualcommGetty ImagesMarket value: $93.0 billionDividend yield: 3.9%Qualcomm (QCOM, $63.33) controls the technology in your mobile phone, and the dividend's yield of nearly 3.8% makes it seem like a bargain. But know the full story before you jump in.Qualcomm has been engaged in a multiyear battle with Apple over the patent royalties it demands from phone makers. Apple wanted a discount, given its size, and Qualcomm wants a 5% cut of all iPhone revenue. Now the two companies are engaged in court battle as Apple seeks new suppliers, including Intel. Until the case ends, Apple will not be paying royalties to Qualcomm, which has hit the latter hard. A QCOM lawyer recently said that Apple was $7 billion behind on patent royalties.So, why Qualcomm? Because QCOM is among the stocks that should shine with the arrival of 5G technology. The fifth-generation mobile network will offer far more capacity than what's currently available, as well as higher speeds, and will "redefine a broad range of industries with connected services," to put it in Qualcomm's words. And Qualcomm is one of the companies building the technology that will power this 5G revolution, giving it a realistic shot at a comeback bid.Moreover, QCOM boasts a solid balance sheet of nearly $36 billion in cash and short-term investments versus a little more than $15 billion in long-term debt. And despite its issues with Apple, Qualcomm still saw fit to boost its quarterly payout 9% earlier this year.SEE ALSO: 25 Dividend Stocks That Analysts Love the MostTexas InstrumentsGetty ImagesMarket value: $91.3 billionDividend yield: 3.2%Intel didn't invent the integrated circuit. Texas Instruments (TXN, $95.06) did, along with a company called Fairchild Semiconductor, from which Intel eventually emerged.TI, as it's called, decided to focus on digital signal processors (DSPs), which turn analog inputs, sound and pictures, into digital bit streams computers can process, in the 1980s. Today it may be best known as a leader in adding intelligence to ordinary objects, the so-called Internet of Things.Personal finance expert Matthew Ure, a vice president at Anthony Capital in San Antonio, says, "It is hard to imagine a world wherein Texas Instruments will not become more and more relevant."Texas Instruments also is an incredibly relevant dividend stock. The company's shares have gained more than 120% over the past five years, but in fact have been outpaced by the dividend, which has grown 157% to its current quarterly payout of 77 cents per share. Financial planner Joseph Inskeep says the company's "historic" dividend growth means TXN "should be on everyone's buy list."The company should have no problem affording that dividend going forward. Analysts predict 13% annual profit growth over the next five years.SEE ALSO: 15 Consumer Stocks That Deliver Dividend Growth Like ClockworkWestern DigitalGetty ImagesMarket value: $13.9 billionDividend yield: 4.2%Western Digital (WDC, $47.77) is a maker of hard drives, which are in the process of being replaced by increasingly cost-effective chip memory. How long the replacement process lasts, and how long Western Digital can prosper in that market and pay shareholders for their investments, is the question.Western Digital has tried to get ahead of market changes by packaging drives as "MyCloud" units, turning old PCs into virtual servers. It has also gotten into the chip memory business, buying SanDisk in 2016 and recently committing to invest $4.7 billion over three years to refresh its joint venture with Toshiba, which will keep the chips flowing.But most analysts following the stock still consider it a buy. They point to $2.3 billion in operating cash flow earned in the first six months of fiscal 2018, and over $3.4 billion in fiscal 2017, sustaining about $600 million in dividend payments. The company's third-quarter earnings declined year-over-year and missed expectations, but the resulting handful of analyst downgrades following that put most of the blame on an oversupply in NAND memory that could keep prices low.Western Digital itself remains a good dividend payer whose annual $2 dole is just more than a quarter of this year's expected profits. While that payout isn't rising, it is safe.SEE ALSO: Millionaires in America: All 50 States RankedEDITOR'S PICKS101 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2019 and Beyond25 Dividend Stocks That Analysts Love the MostBest Vanguard Funds for 401(k) Retirement SaversCopyright 2018-2019 The Kiplinger Washington EditorsReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextFoxconn says it remains committed to Wisconsin investment projectReutersAt $1 Trillion, Apple is Bigger Than These ThingsInvestopediaMarijuana Stocks: Let the Writedowns BeginMotley Fool2 Top Stocks You Can Buy on SaleMotley Fool2 Stocks You Can Buy and Hold ForeverMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo Finance5 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy in 2019Motley FoolWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadgetMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance內地熱門城市樓價回升星島日報57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolHere's What Hedge Funds Think About NIO Inc.

Besides, as volatile and unpredictable as the sector can be, technology still is technology - it remains the best growth opportunity that investors will find for the indefinite future.With that as the backdrop, here are a dozen of the best tech stocks to buy for 2019. These companies all should perform better in the new year than they did in 2018. And in a few cases, a solid dividend and strong track record of payout increases bolsters the bullish case.SEE ALSO: 19 Best Stocks to Buy for 2019 (And 5 to Sell)NvidiaGetty ImagesMarket value: $70.4 billionDividend yield: 0.5%Nvidia (NVDA, $115.40) has taken investors on a roughly three-year roller coaster ride. After gaining nearly 800% between the beginning of 2016 and the high hit in October 2018, NVDA shares have been cut nearly in half.The meltdown of the cryptocurrency market was a contributing factor, sure. But investors likely also realized the stock had gotten more than a little ahead of the company's profits.That said, the selloff from the early October peak is just as overdone as the preceding runup was. That translates into opportunity.The average investor largely misunderstands Nvidia's product mix, and therefore its revenue mix. As frenzied as crypto-mania was at its pinnacle, it was never a breadwinner for the organization. For example, during the first quarter of 2018 - shortly after Bitcoin prices reached record highs - Nvidia sold only $289 million worth of graphics processors to crypto-miners. That was less than a tenth of Nvidia's revenue for the quarter, when sales of GPUs to miners were apt to be their strongest.Most of Nvidia's business comes from video gamers looking to upgrade their experiences; they accounted for more than half of the company's third-quarter top line. Its next-best market is datacenters, which includes artificial intelligence applications; that makes up about one-fourth of Nvidia's business. Those two markets aren't going to fade away like cryptocurrency mining did, and both are much bigger.SEE ALSO: 101 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2019 and BeyondWorkdayMarket value: $35.1 billionDividend yield: N/AWorkday (WDAY, $159.56) is anything but a household name, though odds are good that at least one person in most U.S. households is impacted by Workday. The software company has developed cloud-based apps for a variety of human resources and financial industry needs.The organization isn't yet profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, but it does operate in the black. More important, it's growing its top and non-GAAP bottom lines at an impressive clip. Revenue is on pace to improve more than 30% in the current fiscal year, and Wall Street analysts expect 25% sales growth next year. Per-share operating profits, which rolled in at $1.03 last year, are projected to reach $1.27 this year and rise to $1.61 in the coming fiscal year. That's also a reasonably dependable outcome; you can't say that of all technology companies.Story continuesThe key to Workday's consistency is how its software is sold. Its customers subscribe to its cloud-based platform rather than make a one-time purchase of it. This drives reliable recurring revenue, and Workday's customers love the financially flexible arrangement.The previous quarter's subscription revenue of $324 million was nearly a 35% year-over-year improvement, and the subscription revenue backlog now stands at a whopping $5.9 billion. That's 31% better than where it was at this time a year ago.SEE ALSO: 10 Best Value Stocks to Buy NowMicrosoftGetty ImagesMarket value: $770.6 billionDividend yield: 1.8%Workday is hardly the only outfit getting on the recurring revenue bandwagon. Even prolific names such as Microsoft (MSFT, $100.39) are now hyper-focused on selling cloud-based access to applications such as its Office productivity suite and Azure cloud-management platform.And the iconic company has only scratched the surface of the cloud opportunity ahead.Joel Kulina, Wedbush Securities Senior Vice President of Tech, Media and Telecom, says he's "bullish into 2019 as Azure's cloud momentum is still in its early days of playing out with the company's massive installed base." The analyst also feels that Office 365, the cloud-based version of Office, will experience growth tailwinds for the next 12 to 18 months at least. Kulina adds that Microsoft's "unparalleled enterprise customer base" leaves the organization "very well positioned to the transformational cloud trend set to play out over the coming years" in what he refers to as a "cloud arms race."His only concern is a faster-than-expected deceleration in Azure's revenue for fiscal 2019. But this tech stock's lethargy seen during the final quarter of calendar 2018 may have been the market's adjustment for that information.SEE ALSO: 20 Top Stock Picks the Analysts Love for 2019RokuCourtesy Intel Free Press via Wikimedia CommonsMarket value: $3.3 billionDividend yield: N/AMost newly public stocks hand out lots of volatility, and Roku (ROKU, $30.16) has been no exception since its September 2017 IPO. While the big swings have been more up than down, they've nonetheless made some shareholders nauseous and frightened other investors away altogether.The dust is starting to settle, however. And while Roku hasn't yet reached its full potential, it appears to be on its way.Roku is the name behind the popular internet-television tuner of the same name. It stood up against titans such as Apple, Google and Amazon, and beat them all to become the market-share leader within the standalone digital TV-tuner market.That's not the key to its future, however, nor its projected swing to a 2020 profit. Roku has figured out there's also money to be made in licensing its name to television manufacturers who want to build the company's technology into TV sets. Roku also has embraced the idea of selling ads on the main screens seen by users as they navigate their device's menu. This so-called "platform revenue" increased by 74% year-over-year in the company's most recently reported quarter, which, as impressive as the growth rate was, still fell short of analyst estimates.The relative disappointment was the basis for much of Roku's recent weakness. But the formulation of more reasonable expectations in 2019 should make Roku one of the best tech stocks to buy for 2019.SEE ALSO: The 9 Best Stocks of America's Last Bear MarketQualcommGetty ImagesMarket value: $68.9 billionDividend yield: 4.4%As incredible is it may sound, shares of Qualcomm (QCOM, $56.81) haven't made any net progress since mid-2012. Between ongoing legal battles with Apple and revenue that's been waning since 2014, shareholders have simply had little to celebrate.But 2019 could be a turnaround year for this telecom technology maker.Wireless service Verizon will roll out its first 5G service in early 2019, and Samsung will make the industry's first smartphones capable of using this ultra-high-speed connectivity, which is up to 20 times as fast as 4G connections in use now. That device's 5G modem will be made by none other than Qualcomm.Qualcomm has more growth opportunities than 5G modems, however. The company's newest microprocessor, the Snapdragon 855, has been designed from the ground up to make the most of the massive amounts of data 5G connections will be able to handle. The Snapdragon 855 will offer up to three times as much artificial intelligence power as anything available now, and is expected to handle augmented reality and other data-intensive applications with ease. This catalyst might just shake QCOM shares out of their multiyear rut.SEE ALSO: The 25 Best Blue-Chip Stocks for 2019 (According to Hedge Funds)SplunkGetty ImagesMarket value: $15.2 billionDividend yield: N/AThe term "big data" didn't really seem to be in existence until 2005, when O'Reilly Media's Roger Mougalas is credited with its first use. Corporations have been looking for ways to gather massive amounts of data for decades, of course, but it has only been a relatively efficient endeavor since the 1990s, when personal computers became a common business that could manage all that information.But even if an organization has lots of data, that doesn't mean that organization can do something constructive with it. Tools that turn data into actionable information has only recently become an industry in and of itself.Cornelio Ash, Equity Analyst with William O'Neil + Co., believes a company called Splunk (SPLK, $102.79) is one of the best picks within the business."Splunk is a primary beneficiary of the artificial intelligence tailwind, which is impacting and changing virtually every industry," Ash says. "Over the next two years SPLK's revenue and (earnings per share) is expected to increase at a compound average growth rate of 25% and 53%, respectively."The analyst highlights the fact that Splunk is widening its market to serve not just artificial intelligence outfits, but to meet the needs of cybersecurity, Internet of Things and IT operations organizations.SEE ALSO: 19 Best Retirement Stocks to Buy in 2019FireEyeGetty ImagesMarket value: $3.2 billionDividend yield: N/AJust when it looks like computer hacking and cyber-sabotage are under control, another bigger and more damaging data breach surfaces. The problem is never going to go away. Indeed, Gartner estimates that information-security spending will grow 9% in 2019, to $124 billion.Enter FireEye (FEYE, $16.09).FireEye is a relatively young company, founded in 2004 - a time during which cyberthreats were starting to become an inevitable, permanent part of the future. The company didn't go public until 2013, however, and though investors' hopes were high at the time, FireEye wasn't quite the performer early shareholders expected. The cybersecurity outfit spent heavily on acquisitions, leading to increasingly large losses. The stock currently is well below its post-IPO peak.FEYE stock still is trending higher from its early 2017 low, however, as its revenue grows and its losses start to shrink, with profits finally in sight. The company will see its first full-year operating profit with 2018's results, and should be GAAP-profitable sometime around 2021 or 2022.The turning point was the launch of a cloud-based product called Helix, which offers customers subscription-based access to a suite of cybersecurity tools. Morningstar analyst Mark Cash writes, "As FireEye embraces a subscription-based business model, we expect the product subscription business to grow the fastest, more than offsetting long-term declines in the legacy products and support and maintenance divisions. We believe this shift, coupled with new product launches, will allow for material top-line and margin expansion."SEE ALSO: 10 Potential Investing Land Mines to Avoid in 2019TwitterGetty ImagesMarket value: $21.6 billionDividend yield: N/AIt only has a fraction of the size and reach of competing social media site Facebook, and is not nearly as exciting as newcomer Snap (SNAP). But in some regards, being a bit smaller and more off-the-radar than its rivals has quietly let Twitter (TWTR, $28.43) finds its groove and become the growth machine it should have become long ago.Better late than never.Twitter isn't bulletproof, to be clear. One valid criticism is its waning headcount. "The knock on Twitter is that the daily average user growth has been slowing for the last few quarters," says Strategic Wealth Partners president and founder Mark Tepper. He counters, however, by pointing out "that they're really focused on shutting down fake accounts, so I think a number like that is really important for Facebook where people might only log in once a day, but with Twitter it's more about the user engagement."Proof of better user engagement is in the numbers. While the number of active monthly users actually fell by 9 million during Q3, its third-quarter top line was up 29% year-over-year. More of the same is projected for 2019.More important, Twitter has already proven it can turn a profit doing what it's now doing. By providing specific reasons for users to plug into the microblogging platform and giving them specific topics to discuss, the organization has booked a little more than $1 billion worth of net income over the past four quarters.SEE ALSO: The 27 Best Mutual Funds in 401(k) Retirement PlansKeysight TechnologiesGetty ImagesMarket value: $11.3 billionDividend yield: N/AAlthough Verizon (VZ) will be the first wireless telecom name to commercialize 5G connectivity, and Samsung - with the help of Qualcomm - will be the first manufacturer to mainstream 5G smartphones, those organizations wouldn't be able to do what they're about to do had a relatively small company called Keysight Technologies (KEYS, $60.13) not helped pave the way.Keysight makes and markets technological testing equipment. Specifically, it offers solutions for network security developers, connected car designers, cloud-computing solutions providers and more. Most recently it has been leaned on to provide 5G engineers with testing equipment that ensures all the complexity of 5G connections is properly addressed. In fact, both Qualcomm and Samsung have acknowledged they relied on Keysight Technologies in helping make 5G a reality. The company's 5G toolset was even the first to be approved for 5G device-certification purposes. In other words, its wares will serve as the yardstick used to test other 5G technologies.The advent of 5G has already proven to be a boon for Keysight, though the best may be yet to come. Moderate but reliable sales growth is expected to drive per-share profits of $3.78 for all of 2018, up from 2017's $3.24, then lead to income of $4.25 per share in 2019. That's 12% earnings growth for a stock priced at less than 15 times 2019's projected earnings, and from a company that has gotten in the habit of topping earnings estimates.SEE ALSO: 10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy for 2019 and BeyondCisco SystemsGetty ImagesMarket value: $192.3 billionDividend yield: 3.1%In the late 1990s, when the internet was new and changing the way the world worked, Cisco Systems (CSCO, $42.77) was unstoppable. Organizations and even individuals were thrilled with the advantages of networked computers, and Cisco was the go-to name for routers and switches. Few could compete with the king of the networking world.Much has changed in the meantime. Namely, newcomers like Juniper Networks (JNPR), Arista Networks (ANET) and Aruba are supplying real competition, while more established names such as HP (HPQ) and Dell have quietly tiptoed onto some of Cisco's turf.The pros aren't exactly stoked. Nomura recently downgraded CSCO from a "Buy" to "Neutral," suggesting the stock already is overvalued at a time IT spending may well slow down.Cisco has a couple of aces up its sleeve, however, that the pros and amateurs alike are underestimating. One of them is the company's $42.6 billion worth of cash and near-cash assets - versus a market cap of $206 billion - which allows the organization lots of flexibility. What Cisco can't develop to be competitive, it can acquire.The other matter working in Cisco's favor is the relatively recent realization that recurring revenue is the ticket to thriving in the future. Subscription revenue now makes up roughly a third of the company's sales, and a little more than half of its software revenue. That figure is growing, and has plenty more room to grow while Cisco gears up for the coming explosion of 5G.SEE ALSO: The Best Vanguard Funds for 401(k) Retirement SaversSalesforce.comCourtesy Salesforce.comMarket value: $103.0 billionDividend yield: N/ASalesforce.com (CRM, $134.68) won't win any value awards based on backwards-looking or forward-looking results. The stock is priced at nearly 50 times 2019's expected earnings - a hefty cost. But Wedbush Securities' Joel Kulina believes Salesforce.com is "well-positioned to benefit from the continuing secular shift to the cloud" and a worldwide "increased focus on digital transformation."Salesforce provides a suite of cloud-based customer relationship management tools. Although the barriers to entry within the market are low, CRM is able to leverage its well-established name, and enjoys a wide lead on those would-be competitors.Its edge lies in its ability to remain at the forefront of new applications of new technologies. For instance, the company has designed a way to use data created by IoT platforms by automating its delivery to employees that may be working in the field rather than at a centralized data hub. And what it can't develop, it can buy. It acquired MuleSoft in March, giving the company the ability to meld older and newer databases that would otherwise be tough to merge.Kulina adds that with a potential market size in excess of more than $200 billion, Salesforce.com as a "long runway ahead" that could extend well beyond 2019.SEE ALSO: 10 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying (And 6 He's Selling)AdobeGetty ImagesMarket value: $108.9 billionDividend yield: N/AContrary to what many investors might believe, Adobe (ADBE, $223.13) is so much more than PDFs and Photoshop. The software giant has built an entire suite of business-building applications, and organizations are falling in love with them.It's called Experience Cloud, and it can do just about anything a company needs to do with digital data. From advertising to customer profiling to content management, Adobe's Experience Cloud empowers its users to do things with data, online and offline, that were inconceivable just a few years ago. The company's Creative Cloud gives users online access to tools such as Photoshop, Illustrator and more. Subscribers enjoy that software updates are automatically applied, fuss-free.Arguably the most compelling aspect of these cloud-based platforms is, however, the recurring revenue they generate. As of the end of the third quarter, Adobe was producing annualized subscription-based revenue of $6.83 billion, and the company is looking for steady growth of that figure. For perspective, the company's trailing 12-month revenue totals $9.06 billion.The stock plunged following its recent fourth-quarter earnings miss, for the record. Profit projections of $1.88 per share were better than the $1.83 the company managed to produce. But with revenue of $2.46 billion topping estimates of $2.43 billion and a revenue outlook of $11.1 billion for the coming year thanks to the impending purchase of B2B marketing outfit Marketo, that post-earnings weakness may be a buying opportunity.James Brumley was long CSCO and FEYE as of this writing.SEE ALSO: Best Online Brokers, 2018EDITOR'S PICKS19 Best Stocks to Buy for 2019 (And 5 to Sell)7 Low-Volatility ETFs for This Roller-Coaster MarketThe 25 Best Low-Fee Mutual Funds You Can BuyCopyright 2018-2019 The Kiplinger Washington EditorsReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextMarijuana Stocks: Let the Writedowns BeginMotley Fool2 Stocks You Can Buy and Hold ForeverMotley Fool2 Top Stocks You Can Buy on SaleMotley FoolInterested In Walliser Kantonalbank (VTX:WKBN)'s Upcoming CHF3.35 Dividend?

Buying Mojang (makers of Minecraft) makes a ton of sense for Microsoft, despite the possibly inflated price tag. It might end up being one of the smartest and boldest moves Microsoft has ever made.Read more: A Parent’s Guide to Minecraft: 5 Reasons to Stop Worrying and Learn to Love the CubesAll of the following comes with the standard caveat: As Long As Microsoft Doesn’t Screw It Up (ALAMDSIU). But here are a dozen reasons why this is a really smart move:1. Microsoft desperately needs younger users.Few self-respecting adults boast about how awesome their Windows phones are. (Though they actually are kind of awesome.) But kids are fickle and will switch brands in a heartbeat. Like Princess Leia and Obi-Wan Kenobi, the youth market is Windows Phone's only hope.Princess Leia GIFMoreThe smartest thing Microsoft has ever done is make Xbox part of Windows Phone so it would be more appealing to the youth market. (Second smartest thing? Retiring Microsoft Bob.)Sony is trying desperately to copy that with its latest Xperia Z3. Good luck with that, guys.2. Windows Phone has an apps problem.The dumbest thing Microsoft has done: Failing to build compelling apps that would give iPhone fanboys and Android phandroids a reason to consider Windows Phone. “Hey, we have Instagram, too” isn’t gonna cut it. Guess what extremely popular game isn’t on the Windows Phone — yet? We expect that to change in a hurry.3. Minecraft is everywhere (except Windows Phone).Buying Minecraft instantly puts a high-profile Microsoft property on the Sony PlayStation,  Wii,  Mac, and iOS devices. That’s assuming a) the other platforms continue to support Minecraft (most likely) and b) Microsoft doesn’t try to make future versions exclusive to Windows platforms (see ALAMDSIU).Minecraft pirate shipMoreStory continuesMinecraft pirate ship — avast, ye mateys. (JimmyJett/Flickr)4. Minecraft is massively popular. The $7 Pocket Edition is currently the second most popular paid app in the iTunes Store. Overall, Minecraft has clocked more than 50 million downloads in total, including the PC/Mac versions (15 million), Xbox (12 million), and Pocket (21 million). Microsoft, for its part, says the number exceeds 100 million on the PC alone. Whatever. It’s a crapload of fans.5. Minecraft is a rite of passage that never ends. Don’t believe me? Ask an 8-year-old. It’s like The Little Mermaid for gamers, only many of them keep playing long after they’ve outgrown Ariel. There are also Minecraft servers that cater exclusively to adults.6. Minecraft’s fans are insanely passionate. Minecraft’s user base approaches Apple’s for scary, rabid passion. No other Microsoft property, even the Xbox, generates that kind of loyalty. And when kids aren’t playing Minecraft, they’re watching videos of other kids playing Minecraft.7. Minecraft is more of a lifestyle than a game. Unlike with Angry Birds, Draw Something, or other flavor-of-the-month games, Minecraft users make a serious investment of time, building more and more sophisticated landscapes. This is not something they drop after three or six months; it’s a commitment.Minecraft castleMoreAn ancient Babylonian castle rendered in Minecraft. (swiftsampson/Imgur)8. Schools love Minecraft. Apple thoroughly kicked Microsoft’s heinie in the education market by offering schools deep discounts starting in the ’80s. Now Google is going after that market aggressively with Google Apps and Chromebooks. Teachers who “get” Minecraft are over the moon about it. It finally gives Microsoft a chance to get its Keds inside the classroom door.9. Parents also love Minecraft. Once they understand that Minecraft is more about building cool stuff than blowing things up, many parents don’t mind when their kids spend all night on it. Some have set up Minecraft servers for their kids so they can control whom their kids interact with during the game. When’s the last time you heard a parent say they love it when their kids play Halo or Call of Duty?10. Microsoft doesn’t need to turn a profit on Minecraft to be successful. The company has sold more than 100 million Xboxes and has yet to make a dime on any of them. (The same is true for Sony and its PlayStation, FYI.) They do make coin on the games, though. And the company projects that Minecraft will start to break even in 2015. Tweet from Markus “Notch” PerssonMoreMinecraft creator Markus “Notch” Persson said “Show me the money” — and Microsoft did. (Twitter)11. Microsoft has buckets of money to lose. Microsoft currently has about $85 billion in cash reserves, or enough to buy another 34 Minecrafts (or 40 copies of the L.A. Clippers). Even if it’s never a money maker, it’s worth it as an investment in mindshare (not to mention Mineshare).12. Two words: LEGO + Minecraft. The LEGO Minecraft co-build project combines the real and virtual worlds of blocky creativity. Who wouldn’t want a piece of that awesomeness?Editor's note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified Microsoft's mobile platform as Windows Mobile, not Windows Phone.

2 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks That Pay a DividendYahooSearchNo matching results for ''Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsGive feedback on the new search experienceCancelSign inMailFinanceWatchlistsMy PortfolioScreenersMarketsIndustriesVideosNewsPersonal FinanceTechU.S. Markets closedS&P 5002,905.03+4.58(+0.16%)Dow 3026,559.54+110.00(+0.42%)Nasdaq7,998.06+1.98(+0.02%)Russell 20001,565.75-1.85(-0.12%)Crude Oil64.000.00(0.00%)Gold1,277.90+1.90(+0.15%)Silver14.97+0.01(+0.07%)EUR/USD1.12470.0000(-0.0000%)2 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks That Pay a DividendHarsh Chauhan, The Motley FoolMotley FoolJanuary 8, 2019ReblogShareTweetShareArtificial intelligence (AI) couldn't save the tech sector from taking a hit in 2018. Popular AI stocks such as NVIDIA, Alphabet, and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) struggled, but investors shouldn't forget that AI is an emerging opportunity. AI-related revenue is predicted to jump from an estimated $7.35 billion in 2018 to nearly $90 billion in 2025 thanks to the growth of self-driving cars, smart devices, and other verticals.AI stocks that pay a dividend will reward investors with regular payouts while investors wait for the AI opportunity to gain traction. Intel and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) are two dividend-paying AI stocks that investors might want to consider.A businessman holds a tablet projecting a circuit map in the shape of a brainMoreImage source: Getty Images.Intel's big chip opportunityIntel's forward dividend yield of nearly 2.60%, a conservative payout ratio of 36%, and a long dividend payment history make it one of the best dividend stocks in the tech sector. The company has been paying a regular dividend for more than 25 years, and it has consistently increased year after year.Looking ahead, Intel's foray into AI should act as a catalyst for dividend growth. The company sold $1 billion worth of AI chips last year, and is confident of generating $10 billion in AI chip sales by 2022. That shouldn't be a big deal for Chipzilla, as it pegs its AI-related total available market (TAM) in 2022 at $200 billion.So Intel needs to corner just 5% of the TAM to realize its ambition. That doesn't look like a big deal, given its strategy of going after lucrative AI-centric markets such as data centers and self-driving cars.For instance, Intel has made solid advances in the self-driving car space since the Mobileye acquisition. The company is already supplying chips to Alphabet's self-driving subsidiary, Waymo, which is great news as Waymo has begun commercializing its autonomous ride-sharing service in the U.S. What's more, Intel plans to launch a commercial self-driving taxi service in Israel this year, in association with Volkswagen.Intel will retrofit its self-driving solutions into existing Volkswagen cars to deliver Level 4 or 5 autonomy. Success on this front would encourage Intel to equip carmakers across the globe with its self-driving solutions, so they can attack lucrative markets such as self-driving taxis. That's a big AI-driven opportunity for Intel, as the demand for autonomous taxis is expected to go through the roof.TechNavio predicts that the global self-driving taxi market will clock a compound annual growth rate of 167% through 2022, paving the way for Intel to sell more autonomous-driving chips and solutions.An additional $10 billion in AI-related chip revenue by 2022 would increase Intel's top line by a percentage in the mid-teens, given its trailing-12-month revenue of $69 billion. That would eventually help the company boost its bottom line and increase its dividend.In the end, Intel is a solid bet for investors looking for a mix of AI-driven growth, dividend, and value -- it trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 10.Microsoft's cloud playMicrosoft is looking to make AI more accessible through cloud computing. That's a smart thing to do, as AI in the cloud is expected to grow at an annual pace of 50% through 2025, rising from a 1% share of the global cloud computing space (as per the Asia Cloud Computing Association) to 10%.Story continuesThe good news: Microsoft is making the most of this lucrative opportunity through its Azure cloud service. The company's Azure cloud revenue shot up 76% in the last reported quarter, pushing the company's overall commercial cloud business up by 47% to $8.5 billion.Looking ahead, Microsoft's cloud business should gain more traction, as the company is packing more AI-related tools into Azure. The software giant recently added a machine learning service to the Azure cloud that can be used by enterprises to simplify AI deployments, allowing them to reduce the time taken to get AI models functioning. Microsoft customers are already using Azure Machine Learning Service to improve assurance (an agreement in which an insurer covers a certain event, such as death) and predict energy demand.Microsoft's cloud infrastructure is also being tapped by companies developing self-driving cars. This is another big opening for the chipmaker, as the number of cars connecting to the internet will continue to grow.What's more, Azure is driving Microsoft's profitability, pushing up the margin of its commercial cloud business by 4 percentage points last quarter. With the acceleration of its cloud computing business, Microsoft's bottom-line growth should accelerate. That's probably why analysts expect the company to clock stronger earnings growth, which will help it boost the dividend.Microsoft carries a decent forward dividend yield of 1.82%, though its payout ratio is high at nearly 70%. But then, the company has increased its dividend for 14 consecutive years, and it should be able to sustain this growth thanks to the catalysts discussed above.Investors should not forget that AI tech is still young, and it will eventually disrupt our lives in a positive way. That's why betting on the likes of Microsoft and Intel, two companies that have already made a lot of headway in this space and that also pay a dividend, looks like a smart move.

The average fell almost 1,400 points, or nearly 6%.Yet even though the Dow lost ground for the first time in a long while, some of its components posted solid gains. Below, we'll take a look at Merck (NYSE: MRK), Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) to see why they were the best stocks in the Dow in 2018.MRK ChartMoreMRK data by YCharts.Good times for healthcareMerck's and Pfizer's big gains show that healthcare was a key sector for the stock market during 2018. Even though the returns from the two pharmaceutical giants weren't enough to keep the Dow from losing ground for the year, their gains of 36% and 21%, respectively, played their part in minimizing the average's overall losses.For Merck, the big success lately has been Keytruda, a cancer drug that has demonstrated an ability to reduce risks of death when combined with chemotherapy treatments. Sales of the drug doubled during the first three quarters of 2018, and some analysts believe that Keytruda's annual revenue could clear the $10 billion mark within the next few years. Even with potential competition, Merck is optimistic that the drug's future is bright. Moreover, with other key treatments like its Januvia type 2 diabetes drug still generating plenty of sales, Merck has the cash flow to sustain a dividend yielding nearly 3% while also growing its business organically.Person looking at a pill held in a glove, with dozens of other pills on a glass table.MoreImage source: Getty Images.Meanwhile, Pfizer has seen gains stemming largely from decisions to restructure itself internally. The drug giant said in July that it expects to create three business segments, one for innovative medicines, one for established medicines, and the last for consumer healthcare products. Moreover, with Pfizer deciding within the last couple of weeks to work with rival GlaxoSmithKline to combine their consumer healthcare units into a single joint venture, it's possible that shareholders will receive shares of that business in a spinoff transaction. That would make Pfizer's stock a purer play on pharmaceuticals, which has been the higher-growth business for quite a while. A 3.4% dividend yield has also been a positive for Pfizer, especially among defensive investors looking for income to offset the risks of capital losses from their investments.Story continuesMicrosoft keeps moving higherMicrosoft comes in third in this year's list of Dow stocks, but what's particularly impressive about the software giant's appearance on the list is that it also did extremely well in 2017, rising 38%. That puts this year's 19% gain into a different perspective, and the extent to which the stock has held onto its positive returns despite recent market turbulence is encouraging for shareholders.Moreover, Microsoft has been vying for the leadership position in terms of overall market capitalization, upending some of its tech rivals in the process and finishing the year in the top spot for the first time since 2002. The way it's achieved those heights is by reinventing itself as a subscription-based software provider, offering key platforms like its Office productivity software suite to users on a monthly basis rather than solely selling one-time licenses that required users to upgrade at later dates in order to get updated features. Millions of customers have decided that having the latest access to the newest software features is worth what turns out to be higher costs than simply buying a one-time license and hanging onto the software for a long time, and that's sent Microsoft profits soaring. Moreover, by offering key software to users of operating systems other than Windows -- especially iOS -- Microsoft has tapped into a much larger customer base and reaped the rewards accordingly.What's ahead for the Dow in 2019?Among these three stocks, Microsoft has the greatest potential for fast future growth in 2019. Even as some positive trends in the technology industry start to slow down and reverse course, Microsoft has the benefit of providing needed services to enterprise customers and individual consumers. Efforts to move into high-growth areas like cloud computing have also borne fruit and should continue to gain importance for the company.For Merck and Pfizer, a lot depends on regulatory threats that could have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. Many defensive investors turn to healthcare as a stalwart industry during economically troubled times, but these two stocks could give up ground if they can't find new and innovative treatments to keep their pipelines full of candidates likely to become tomorrow's blockbusters.Investors want the Dow to rebound in 2019, and these stocks have a role to play. If the market bounces back, it might well be because these leaders continue to move higher over the next year.

Friday’s 3.43% gain from the S&P 500 was a tough act to follow, but Monday’s 0.7% advance was respectable in its own right.Even more impressive is that the market was able to do it without the help of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and without much help from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). The consumer-tech giant’s shares balked again as investors continue to wonder if the company’s glory days are behind it. Meanwhile, Facebook shares essentially broke even, with traders unable to shrug off doubts about a bright future for the social networking giant.The heavy lifting was done by, amazingly enough, General Electric (NYSE:GE). GE shares gained another 6.3% on the heels of news that it may be close to selling its aircraft-leasing business. Investors are also increasingly believing that Larry Culp may be just the CEO the company needs to dig itself out of trouble.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe proverbial dust is settling, with most stocks starting to do their own thing rather than fall in line with the market’s wild moves. To that end, stock charts of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) and Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) are of the most interest after Monday’s action sets up the beginning of Tuesday’s trading.Medtronic (MDT)3 Big Stock Charts for Tuesday: Microsoft (MSFT), Medtronic (MDT) and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)MoreLast week, Medtronic was named something of a problem child, having slipped back under its critical 200-day moving average line for a second time in just a few weeks after several bearish crosses of moving average lines were put on the books. Though it wasn’t a straight-line move, Monday’s 6.5% setback is the end result of that red flag.  9 A-Rated Safety Stocks for a Grossly Oversold Market  The good news is, the sheer strength of the selling may have set up a nice rebound move. Click to Enlarge • Though a rough ride, Monday’s meltdown took shape on huge volume. This high-volume flushout is often seen at major bottoms.• The good news is, the steep dive was so large and rapid, it took the weekly chart into an oversold condition. It also dragged MDT shares within striking distance of a major support line that has tagged the major lows going back to early 2017.• Though ripe for a rebound, this is a setup that requires a couple of bullish days to confirm the bulls are willing to buy (in earnest) on this dip.Microsoft (MSFT)3 Big Stock Charts for Tuesday: Microsoft (MSFT), Medtronic (MDT) and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)MoreJust because a stock didn’t keep up with the broad market’s rally on one particular day doesn’t necessarily mean that stock is doomed. But, when that stock is a well-loved Microsoft, it certainly raises concerns.Bolstering those concerns is the hesitation buyers demonstrated when the stock approached a couple of crucial moving average lines.Story continues Click to Enlarge• Yes, MSFT shares are fighting to bounce back from late-December lows, as most stocks are. But, Monday’s brush of the blue 20-day moving average line as well as the near-brush of the white 200-day moving average line sent the stock to end the day nearer its low than its high.• Underscoring the bullish case is the fact that trading under the 200-day line is a big deal. Microsoft hasn’t been below that level since the middle of 2016.• Quietly, the biggest red flag of all is the fact that Friday’s and Monday’s volume was anemic. Traders aren’t firm believers.Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)3 Big Stock Charts for Tuesday: Microsoft (MSFT), Medtronic (MDT) and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)MoreFinally, had Nasdaq (NASDAQ:NDAQ) not also fallen so much on the heels of news that Wall Street firms were planning to create a competitor to established exchanges, than the similar setback suffered by shares of Intercontinental Exchange — which owns the NYSE — would have been dismissible. But, that announced paired with the already-struggling chart’s latest situation may well mean shares are at their tipping point.

If you had invested $1,000 in Microsoft on the day of its March 13, 1986 initial public offering, settled in for the long haul, and reinvested your dividends, your stock would be worth roughly $1.5 million today.MSFT Total Return Price ChartMoreMSFT Total Return Price. Data source: YCharts.That's an incredible performance and one few companies will ever come close to replicating -- but three Motley Fool investors have identified stocks with the potential to go on runs that could be reminiscent of Microsoft's. Read on to see why they think that Albermarle (NYSE: ALB), Control4 (NASDAQ: CTRL), and iQiyi (NASDAQ: IQ) could be poised for huge growth. An arrow moving up and to the right as it traces increases in a bar graph.MoreImage source: Getty Images.Ride entertainment momentum in ChinaKeith Noonan (iQiyi): Like Microsoft was in 1986, iQiyi is fresh to the market as a publicly traded company. The streaming-video provider, which had its IPO at the end of March, has sometimes been called "the Netflix of China," though in truth its model is currently closer to Hulu's. The stock has been volatile in its first couple months, but I'm bullish on the long-term prospects.In some ways, iQiyi looks more mature as a company than Microsoft did roughly three decades ago. The streaming-video company operates in a market that has established models to success, generated roughly $2.7 billion in sales last year and counts more than 420 million people as viewers, and was spun off from Chinese search giant Baidu -- meaning it's pretty far removed from scrappy, upstart status. However, while the streaming video service industry is more well defined than the computer business was in 1986, I still think iQiyi has paths to explosive growth and thus I purchased shares shortly after the company's market debut. iQiyi is growing sales at a fast clip, with overall sales up 57% year over year in its March-ended quarter and added-service revenue up 67% compared to the prior-year period. That's plenty impressive, and I think that iQiyi can continue to better monetize and expand the reach of its services.Roughly 40% of China's population has yet to connect to the internet, suggesting that there's still a lot of potential for the company to grow its viewer base. iQiyi is also making progress on getting members on board with premium service offerings, and will likely see continued success on that front as the Chinese middle class undergoes rapid increases in size purchasing power. Story continuesI'm a fan of companies that deal in creating and delivering content, and as tech ramps up and consolidation continues to reshape industries, iQiyi looks to be a promising business at the intersection of trends that can deliver big growth. Grabbing market share in an expanding marketMaxx Chatsko (Albemarle): The world's top lithium producer got rocked when analysts at Morgan Stanley projected that by 2025 the global market would be grossly oversupplied. Albemarle responded with a record first quarter for its lithium segment -- and market projections of its own.For context, Morgan Stanley said the lithium market would be oversupplied by 2025 considering producers are expected to churn out 715,000 metric tons (MT) that year. To balance out the supply with demand, electric vehicles would need to hit an absurd 31% of all passenger vehicles sold that year, according to the investment bank. Albemarle countered by saying the total lithium market would be 800,000 MT by 2025, but that only 12.3% of passenger vehicles would need to wield even a moderate-sized battery to make the numbers work.The wide discrepancy in projections could demonstrate that few really know where the lithium market will be by the middle of the next decade. Or it could show that the world's largest lithium producer has more insight into the market from the customers it supplies than Wall Street analysts.Either way, Albemarle is ramping up its lithium output in two waves. After producing 65,000 MT in 2017, it wants to expand to 165,000 MT by 2021, then to 265,000 MT after that. That's rather impressive. Considering it accounted for 29% of the global market last year, producing 265,000 MT by 2025 would account for 33% of the global market, should it reach the company's projected volume. With selling prices high, sales volumes increasing, and a leading position in an important 21st century market, the astonishing growth could just be getting started for this stock.Profiting from smart homesDaniel Miller (Control4): If finding stocks about to go on the wild ride like Microsoft did over the past decades were that easy, we'd all be rich and retired by now. To find stocks similar to Microsoft, you'll have to look for stocks about to ride a long-term trend, and Control4 has a chance to do just that.For those unaware of the company, Control4 is a leading global provider of automation and networking systems for homes and businesses -- basically it sells systems to run a slew of smart home devices seamlessly. These systems can control up to hundreds of devices and can cost between $1,000 to $50,000, and even more, to install professionally.Currently, Control4 estimates its penetration in the U.S. to be 1.5%, but one upcoming strategy could help the company boost that number. Management unveiled certified showrooms in 140 locations worldwide. The showrooms are designed to usher homeowners and designers in the market for smart home solutions to the right products and install partner. The company believes the showrooms are "WOW-ing" homeowners with interactive storytelling, impressive displays, and hands-on demonstrations.Time will tell if the showrooms dramatically improve sales leads and revenue, but there's no doubt business is already good. During the first-quarter Control4 recorded 17% growth in revenue, compared to the prior year, with its adjusted net income up 53%. It has $77 million in cash and no debt on the balance sheet, and boasts six successful acquisitions. Business is good, and Control4 has the potential to ride a long-term smart home trend that could prove very lucrative for investors.

At the time, the company had just publicly released Windows 1.0, and the billionaire-making juggernaut we know today was nowhere in sight. But early investors could have cashed in some magnificent returns over the years: Microsoft shares have gained a staggering 93,500% so far, and would have returned 141,000% if you reinvested your dividends.Those extreme gains are in the rear view mirror now, but the next Microsoft is surely out there, somewhere. So we asked a handful of your fellow investors here at The Motley Fool to point us toward some less-known companies that could be similar giant winners over the long run.Read on to see why Canopy Growth Corp. (NASDAQOTH: TWMJF) (TSX: WEED), Universal Display (NASDAQ: OLED), and Square (NYSE: SQ) remind our panelists of Microsoft in its early days.A single beam of sunlight enters a dark cave, illuminating a treasure chest brimming with gold and jewelry.MoreImage source: Getty Images.Already one step ahead of RedmondAnders Bylund (Universal Display): In 1986, Microsoft had been around for more than a decade, but Windows was a brand-new product and the company's graphical user interface was playing catch-up to Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) Macintosh. The glory days of game-changing success still lay far ahead, and annual sales came up just short of $200 million.I would argue that Universal Display is better positioned today than Microsoft was then.The display technology researcher was founded way back in 1994, entered the stock market in 1996, and reports annual sales of $294 million today. Universal Display is a solidly profitable cash-generator, and has established long-term contracts with every high-definition screen maker that matters. You can find its patented organic light-emitting diode technology in every major brand of smartphone, including best-sellers like the iPhone X and the Samsung (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) Galaxy S8.Its next major growth market lies in big-screen television sets, where street prices are coming down to mainstream levels in a hurry. After that, OLED elements should start making their way into everyday lighting equipment as manufacturing capacities ramp up and product costs come crashing down.Come back in 30 years, and we expect you'll see that Universal Display invested the windfalls from those early successes into next-generation technologies. No longer a small fish in the huge technology market, you'll be looking at a familiar name whose products are found in every household, every business, every public space.There are no guarantees of course, but Universal Display is poised to follow right in Microsoft's storied footsteps. It's just that the target market looks a little bit different.Get your portfolio higherJeremy Bowman (Canopy Growth Corp.): In 1986, Microsoft had just IPO'ed, and the world was on the cusp of the personal computing revolution. Thanks to some clever maneuvering and a partnership with IBM, MS-DOS had become the leading operating system at the time, and Microsoft would parlay its advantage into a PC empire that included the Windows operating system and its suite of office software. Today, one industry that reminds me of PC's in the 1980s is marijuana. Though it's not a tech product, legal marijuana has the potential to revolutionize broad swaths of American society and culture the way technology has, and some estimates say it could be worth $50 billion by 2026. By comparison, the alcoholic beverage market is worth more than $200 billion. While it's still a controversial political issue, marijuana's eventual legalization seems likely as even a majority of Republican voters now favor it.Story continuesThere are a number of competitors angling for position, but one that has a head start is Canopy Growth Corporation. Based in Canada, it's primed to take advantage of the expected boom when marijuana becomes legal in that country in July. Canopy owns Tweed, the most recognized marijuana production brand in the world that's targeted at the recreational market, as well as medical-grade and international medical brands Bedrocan and Spectrum.  The company has forged a strategic partnership with Constellation Brands (NYSE: STZ), the U.S. importer of Corona and other Modelo beers, which includes exchanging knowledge and potentially developing cannabis-based beverages together. Constellation took a 9.9% stake in Canopy.With a market cap now at more than $5 billion, Canopy's valuation is premised on it gaining a significant piece of the marijuana market, but if it executes effectively, the stock will be worth several times what it is today.The 21st-century payment platformTravis Hoium (Square): Microsoft's success in the 1980s and 1990s was driven in large part by the fact that it was a platform businesses used to improve productivity. Once customers got used to using Microsoft products at work, they brought them home, creating a network effect that drove growth and profitability. Square is doing something similar with its products for small businesses. Square isn't just a payment processor: It provides services like appointment handling, payroll, scheduling, and more. This makes the platform valuable for those who are building a business, and those entrepreneurs have been adopting Square at a rapid rate. SQ Revenue (TTM) ChartMoreSQ Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsYou can see that Square isn't highly profitable, which Microsoft was in 1986, but its margins are beginning to improve as it grows. Look for that to continue as the operating expenses it incurred to build out the platform start to pay off and Square leverages a higher revenue base. What makes me really excited about Square is its Square Cash app, which could act as a money exchange system without the credit card and banking fees that eat away at Square's bottom line. If Square can expand its platform for business, and get more consumers to use the Square Cash app, the company could have Microsoft-like potential for investors.  More From The Motley Fool   3 Growth Stocks at Deep-Value Prices    5 Expected Social Security Changes in 2018    6 Years Later, 6 Charts That Show How Far Apple, Inc.

And that's because cash provides optionality. Companies with large cash (and cash-equivalent) piles can more easily invest in research and development, or give back this money to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks.Therefore, it's preferable investors look for companies with large and growing cash piles on their balance sheets. First, as a shareholder, you're entitled to a pro-rata portion of the company's cash. Second, while not an official generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) figure, free cash flow -- a metric that measures how much cash a company generates in each period -- is more important than traditional earnings metrics. A recent research report in the CFA Institute's Financial Analysts Journal found cash flow is a better indicator of stock returns than net income.Chess pieces and cash on a chess board with king on top of cash.MoreImage Source: Getty ImagesPay attention to how cash is generatedFor investors, it's key to do more than simply find companies with large cash hoards on their balance sheets. There are a variety of ways a company can boost its cash pile. The easiest path is to take out debt.On the balance sheet, an entry would be made to increase cash, an asset, while recording a corresponding increase in bonds payable, a liability. No economic value (equity) is created, and future operations will need to support the debt's interest obligation.Another way to grow cash quickly is to convert an asset via a sale. In this circumstance, the sold asset would be removed from the balance sheet and cash would increase. While there may be an increase in cash greater or less than the asset's value on the balance sheet, increasing the cash pile via issuing debt, or by asset sales, are considered unsustainable. In the long run, cash must be generated through business operations.Too much cash is not always a good thingHaving a large cash pile is not always considered a positive by investors. While it beats the alternative -- not having cash on the balance sheet, especially if a company has obligations -- growing cash piles can signify a potentially lower-growth future. Growth investors sometimes interpret excessive cash piles as an indication management no longer has viable value-creating projects to enter into. Finally, excessive cash can indicate a company has failed to invest in other parts of the business, e.g. research and development (R&D), technology, and employees.A secondary issue of too much cash on the balance sheet is often that large cash piles lead to suboptimal managerial actions, like stock buybacks when the company is overvalued, failed mergers and acquisitions, or spending huge sums on entering into new businesses when an incremental approach would have been preferable. Two major studies confirmed the curse of too much cash. One from Revelation Investment Research found companies with a large amount of cash foreshadowed poor stock returns the following year. Another study from the University of Toronto found that companies with high levels of excess cash underperformed the market in downturns.The key is finding companies with large cash piles, adequate investments in the company, and strong management, which are generating substantial cash from operations.Story continuesTop three companies by cash holdings  Company Cash (in Billions)      Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) $268.90   Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) $138.50   Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) $100.10  Data taken from each company's latest quarterly annual report.Apple's cash pile will continue to growApple's cash pile is the stuff of legends. Currently sitting at $269 billion, the company's cash holdings have shot up tenfold in the past decade as it redefined the smartphone. Critics counter that the company has also grown its combined debt -- long and short term -- from nothing to approximately $116 billion, as the company has returned approximately $234 billion in cash back to investors in the form of share buybacks and dividends.However, it would be folly to assume the company will not continue to grow its cash pile. Apple generated $51 billion in free cash flow in the last fiscal year, more than enough to pay for dividends and other cash usage. In fact, a large reason for Apple's debt spree is due to arcane taxation rules that prohibit the company from repatriating cash without generating hefty taxes.Also, Apple's growing cash pile is not at the expense of research and development. Last fiscal year, the company poured $11.6 billion into R&D;. And it's paying off, as colleague Adam Levine-Weinberg notes that the company's recently released iPhone X -- with its next-gen FaceID technology. As my colleague Evan Niu wrote, Apple would be the biggest beneficiary of the GOP tax bill and will save up to $47 billion in taxes. Although the company's iPhone accounts for the majority of its revenue, Apple's path forward is to focus on growing stickier, subscription-based services to diversify its top-line. Last quarter the company reported year-on-year growth of 34% in its services division. Apple has an ambitious goal of doubling services-based revenue by 2020. If so, this highly scalable, high-margin revenue source should allow the company to continue to grow its cash pile for years to come. Ballpoint pen and financial statementMoreImage Source: Getty ImagesMicrosoft's cloud will lead the company forwardMicrosoft has experienced a resurgence under CEO Satya Nadella. Prior CEO Steve Ballmer wanted to expand Microsoft's presence in hardware, a tough business for anybody not named Apple. Instead, Satya has transitioned the company to next-generation technology, like cloud computing, and expanded the Microsoft Office 365 offering, which brings in sticky subscription-based revenue.One thing Microsoft has always been strong at is generating cash. Software is a high-margin and scalable business, two factors that are great for cash generation. Like Apple, Microsoft generates considerable cash through operations: Over the last 12 months, the company has produced $32.3 million in free cash flow, more than enough to pay its dividend, buy back significant shares, and still grow its cash pile.There are a few red flags with Microsoft's growing cash pile -- the software maker has also grown its debt, with long- and short-term debt totaling more than $86.1 billion combined. Twenty billion dollars of this debt was added to pay for the LinkedIn acquisition. Under Ballmer, Microsoft could have been a case study for poor acquisitions, with aQuantive and Nokia Mobility.Microsoft investors should look to the cloud-computing for future growth, and the company is showing amazing top-line growth throughout the enterprise cloud stack. Last quarter the company reported 90% year-on-year growth for Microsoft's Azure, its infrastructure-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service product, while Dynamics 365, the enterprise-focused customer relationship management software-as-a-service product produced year-on-year growth of 69%. Expect both to continue: In November, Nadella announced the company would triple its cloud-related capacity in China in an attempt to compete with Amazon Web Services and Alibaba's cloud in the country. The opportunity is large in the Middle Kingdom. Morgan Stanley expects the Chinese cloud market to grow from $2 billion this year to $8 billion in 2020, giving Microsoft considerable tailwinds to continue to grow its cash pile. AlphabetIn a recurring theme, the company with the third-largest cash pile is also a tech company: Alphabet. The company's enviable search dominance on both desktop and mobile have led to strong cash flow. Additionally, the company boasts the lion's share of smartphone OS market share, which will continue to pay dividends (figurative) in the years and decades to come.Alphabet's been more selfish with its cash as compared to its counterparts. In the last decade, Alphabet has returned $9 billion in buybacks, but nothing in dividends. As a point of comparison, Apple and Microsoft have paid out $$45.7 billion and $22 billion, respectively, in the last 12 months. The company has also been more judicious with debt, holding less than $4 billion total on its books. Instead, Alphabet has focused on R&D; to create new products. The company has been criticized for its "moonshots" -- long-odds bets that should handsomely reward investors.While these moonshots may add to Alphabet's cash pile in the years to come, so far they have not. Instead, it's the company's Google division that adds to its cash pile. In the short and mid-term, look for that to continue. Advertising market research firm eMarketer expects Alphabet alone will take 42% of total U.S. digital advertising revenue in 2017 with an estimated $35 billion haul. The combination of increased market share and increased digital ad spending will push Alphabet's digital ad revenue to $45.7 billion by 2019, good for 14.3% annualized growth. Cash rules everything around usCash is an important asset, but it's more important for investors to focus on how the company generated the cash and, more importantly, its ability to continue to generate these enviable cash piles. On its own, large cash holding can be a poor reason to invest in a company. However, companies that are growing their cash piles through strong, dependable business operations warrant further investigation from investors. As shown above, Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet have grown their cash through superior business models. Investors looking for companies with large cash piles should start by evaluating these three companies.  More From The Motley Fool   3 Growth Stocks at Deep-Value Prices    5 Expected Social Security Changes in 2018    6 Years Later, 6 Charts That Show How Far Apple, Inc.

Recent volatility notwithstanding, big stock buybacks are a trend that's expected to continue."For the second half of 2018, indications are strong for increased corporate expenditures in both buybacks and dividends, with annual records for both," wrote Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, in a report summing up buyback activity through the first half of the year. "Buybacks appear to be on a roll, supporting stock price via more purchases and increasing earnings per share through lower share counts."Lower corporate tax rates and companies repatriating cash held overseas are helping fuel an acceleration in share repurchase programs, which were already going strong. Indeed, over the past five years, companies in Standard & Poor's 500-stock index bought back a stunning $2.82 trillion of their own stock, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.Although it takes more than share repurchases to support stock prices, they sure do help - and investors generally love them. When it comes to returning cash to shareholders through stock buybacks, these are the most generous companies over the past half-decade.SEE ALSO: The Kiplinger Dividend 15: Our Favorite Dividend-Paying Stocks7. Citigroup Getty ImagesMarket value: $167.3 billionDividend yield: 2.6%Stock buybacks, past five years: $38 billionCitigroup (C, $68.26) has been a major purchaser of its own shares over the past five years as it endeavored to recover from lingering wounds from the financial crisis. Now that the bank is healthy once more, you could say its share repurchases are just getting started.In a nod to the bank's strong capital position, the Federal Reserve in June gave Citigroup a green light to buy back up to another $17.6 billion of its own stock during the four quarters starting in the third quarter of 2018. That would represent a major acceleration in returning cash to shareholders. After all, it took Citigroup five years to buy roughly half the amount of stock the bank expects to pick up over the next year.SEE ALSO: 101 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2019 and Beyond6. Cisco SystemsStory continuesGetty ImagesMarket value: $218.0 billionDividend yield: 2.8%Stock buybacks, past five years: $41.7 billionCisco Systems (CSCO, $47.90) was generous with share repurchases even before corporate tax cuts. Once the federal government made it less expensive to repatriate earnings held overseas, the technology giant opened up the floodgates.In February, the company said it would accelerate its share repurchases, fueled with its more than $70 billion in cash held offshore. Cisco announced a $25 billion increase to its existing program in February. For its full fiscal year ended July 28, Cisco returned $23.6 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends.Cisco has a total authorization of $31 billion in stock buybacks, so investors can expect the repurchases to keep coming.SEE ALSO: 10 Best Value Stocks to Buy Now5. Oracle Getty ImagesMarket value: $190.0 billionDividend yield: 1.5%Stock buybacks, past five years: $44.1 billionOracle (ORCL, $50.26) is another Silicon Valley technology giant that accelerated its share repurchases in response to changes to the corporate tax code. Of the $44.1 billion Oracle has spent on buying back its own stock, nearly $10 billion of that came during the three months ended Aug. 31.There's more to come. In September, Oracle's board of directors raised the company's stock buyback program by $12 billion. The massive returns of cash to shareholders have helped undergird ORCL stock despite U.S. sales not always living up to Wall Street's expectations. The software maker's stock was up 7.8% for the year-to-date ended Nov. 7. The Dow was up 5.5% over the same time frame. SEE ALSO: 10 "Strong Buy" Stock Picks You Shouldn't Overlook4. JPMorgan ChaseGetty ImagesMarket value: $374.7 billionDividend yield: 2.9%Stock buybacks, past five years: $45.5 billionJPMorgan Chase (JPM, $111.48), the nation's largest bank by assets, also has been one of the biggest buyers of its own stock. Like Citigroup, in some ways the financial firm is just getting started.A clean financial bill of health from the Fed allowed JPMorgan in June to announce a windfall of cash returns to shareholders. The bank hiked its quarterly dividend by 43% to 80 cents a share from 56 share. As for stock buybacks, the board authorized repurchases of up to $20.7 billion by June 30, 2019. That would represent a jaw-dropping increase over the $45.5 billion in buybacks that the bank has conducted over the past five years.SEE ALSO: The 7 Best Bank ETFs for American Bulls3. Wells Fargo & Co.Getty ImagesMarket value: $251.3 billionDividend yield: 3.2%Stock buybacks, past five years: $46.8 billionWells Fargo & Co. (WFC, $53.58) has suffered a series of setbacks over the past two years stemming from its phony accounts scandal and other black eyes. If there's a silver lining for shareholders, it's that WFC has been an aggressive buyer of its own stock - presumably at a discount.Wells Fargo repurchased nearly $47 billion of its own stock over the past half-decade, and it's revved up to buy more. With the Fed's blessing, Wells Fargo announced a 10% dividend hike in June and unveiled a stock buyback plan of up to $24.5 billion, to be executed over the four quarters ending June 2019.SEE ALSO: 7 Growth Stocks That Will Pay You Cash, Too2. Microsoft Getty ImagesMarket value: $859.4 billionDividend yield: 1.6%Stock buybacks, past five years: $60.2 billionMicrosoft (MSFT, $111.96) has been a total-return machine over the past five years. The stock is up 196% on a price basis, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Add in the dividend, and the total return to shareholders comes to 235%.MSFT has delivered average annual earnings-per-share growth of 12% over the past five years, according to data from Thomson Reuters, helped by more than $60 billion in stock buybacks. For the three months ended Sept. 30 alone, Microsoft returned $6.1 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, up 27% year-over-year.SEE ALSO: The Best Vanguard Funds for 401(k) Retirement Savers1. AppleGetty ImagesMarket value: $987.8 billionDividend yield: 1.4%Stock buybacks, past five years: $208.6 billionIt should come as no surprise that the runaway buyback champion is Apple (AAPL, $209.95). The iPhone maker has spent a stunning $208.6 billion on its own stock over the past five years, and it's still going strong. In the quarter ended Sept. 29 alone, Apple returned more than $23 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Heck, in the past five years, Apple has bought back more of its own stock than Microsoft, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan and Oracle combined. The company said in May that it would buy back another $100 billion in stock, funded by bringing back home much of the $252 billion held overseas.SEE ALSO: The Best T.

For investors’ notice, the companies will now aim at extending Allscripts’ cloud-based electronic health record (EHR) platforms with new technologies.Since the announcement of the collaboration, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company witnessed a 5.5% increase in its share price to close at $11.02 yesterday.Microsoft Signs MoU With Allscripts’ VeradigmIn a bid to develop an integrated research model through point-of-care technology platforms, Allscripts’ Veradigm has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Microsoft. Notably, Veradigm is the company’s payer and life sciences-focused business unit. Per the deal, both the companies are likely to conduct pilot programs for developing the compliance framework necessary to support research performed within this new operating model.This latest collaboration will enable Allscripts to leverage on Microsoft’s exclusive solutions that are powered by Microsoft Azure and AI. Per management, this will help biopharmaceutical and clinical research organizations better conduct research.More About VeradigmLast November, Allscripts announced Veradigm as the new branding for Allscripts’ Payer & Life Sciences division. Veradigm is an integrated data systems and services business that combines data-driven clinical insights with actionable tools for clinical workflow, research, analytics and media.Since the introduction of Veradigm, share prices of Allscripts increased 11.3% till date. However, the stock has lost 26.9% compared with the industry's 19.4% decline and S&P 500's 7% decrease in a year’s time. A Sneak Peek at Allscripts Flagship EHRsWe believe that the Sunrise and Paragon EHR platforms are Allscripts’ major growth drivers. For investors’ notice, Allscripts Sunrise is a fully integrated EHR platform that connects all clinical and financial aspects of a hospital or health system for inpatient, emergency and outpatient care. Meanwhile, Paragon is an integrated EHR and financial/administrative solution for smaller hospitals serving a single IDN and community facilities. The company’s EHR diagnostic tools, including dbMotion, EPSi, FollowMyHealth and 2bPrecise, have been experiencing an increasing list of clients outside the company’s EHR base.In the third quarter of 2018, Allscripts witnessed a number of contract extensions across both the Sunrise and Paragon customers. For example, the company signed a seven-year extension for Sunrise Clinicals, including the addition of Sunrise Registration and Scheduling modules at the Hospital for Special Care in New Britain, CT.

As The Verge saw in the state's disclosure records, the three giants contributed a significant amount of money to a campaign pushing back against the initiative: Amazon and Microsoft donated $195,000 each, while Uber pitched in a smaller-but-still-noteworthy donation worth $50,000. Google, AT&T, Facebook and Verizon -- four of the first corporations that backed the fight against the initiative -- all plunked down $200,000. Facebook and Verizon eventually withdrew their support, however, with the former doing so after Mark Zuckerberg was hauled in front of Congress to answer questions about the Cambridge Analytica scandal.The California Consumer Privacy Act aims to give California residents the right to know what kind of data companies have on them and to tell those companies not to sell their personal info. Tech companies believe that it could ruin the way they develop their products and do business. A spokesperson for Amazon told The Verge, for instance: "While we share the initiative's overarching goal of protecting consumer privacy, we are concerned by unworkable requirements that would hinder our ability to innovate on behalf of our customers."Committee to Protect California Jobs spokesperson Steven Maviglio echoed that in a statement to Govtech. He said that bill author Alastair Mactaggart didn't consider the "workability" of his proposal and that it's nigh impossible for tech giants to comply with it. "[A]nyone who orders anything from Amazon can request where their information went, and that can not only overwhelm a large company like Amazon but also smaller ones too," the spokesperson explained. Microsoft also released a statement that pretty much said the same thing: "We believe the California measure could have unintended consequences for both businesses and consumers and that there is a better way to give consumers the privacy rights they deserve."So far, the Californians for Consumer Privacy Act has already collected 637,000 signatures. Authorities have to be able to verify 402,468 signatures for the proposal to make it to the November ballot -- we'll know for sure after the California Secretary of State announces the result on June 25th. Even if it does make its way to the ballot, the opposition now has a lot of money to spend on campaigns to fight its approval. The Committee to Protect California Jobs, for one, plans to make sure citizens know about the potential impact it may have on jobs in the state if companies choose to up and leave for another HQ.The Verge, California Secretary of StateThis article originally appeared on Engadget.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextDocuments confirm what Microsoft is building in GoodyearAmerican City Business JournalsWhat to Expect When Alphabet Reports Later This MonthMotley FoolHemp companies are raising capital at a fast clip and cannabis retailers can expect 4/20 sales spikeMarketWatchZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceState defends South Dakota pipeline protest legislationAssociated PressSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBC'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceIn Ukrainian candidate's hometown, a cry for changeAssociated PressAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadgetMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

The partnership means  Amazon customers can use Alexa  to access Cortana's exclusive features such as accessing work calendars, while Microsoft customers can use Cortana to ask Alexa to order products from Amazon or control their smart home devices."Ensuring Cortana is available for our customers everywhere and across any device is a key priority for us," said Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, in a press release Wednesday."Bringing Cortana's knowledge, Office 365 integration, commitments, and reminders to Alexa is a great step toward that goal."Amazon's personal assistant Alexa was first announced in November 2014 alongside the Echo, Amazon's smart speaker. Meanwhile, Cortana was announced by Microsoft in May 2015 and released for its Windows Phone product."There are going to be multiple successful intelligent agents, each with access to different sets of data and with different specialized skill areas. Together, their strengths will complement each other and provide customers with a richer and even more helpful experience," Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon, said in a press release."It's great for Echo owners to get easy access to Cortana."More From CNBC A bitcoin rival that has quietly surged nearly 1,400% this yearBurger King has launched its own version of bitcoin in Russia called ‘WhopperCoin’Samsung launches huge 6.3-inch Note 8 smartphone and hopes to price it under $1,000ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextDocuments confirm what Microsoft is building in GoodyearAmerican City Business JournalsCan Microsoft (MSFT) Keep the Earnings Surprise Streak Alive?ZacksConsole gaming is at a crossroadsEngadgetData Sheet—Why We Should Stop Haranguing Our Kids to Put Down Their PhonesFortuneMicrosoft introduces tools to better VR experience for users with low visionAFP Relax NewsZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceTesla's board is about to get a lot smallerTechCrunchAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergApple may bring Siri Shortcuts and Screen Time to macOSEngadget

Bill Gates Remembers the Moment Co-Founder Paul Allen Created MicrosoftGlenn FleishmanFortuneOctober 16, 2018ReblogShareTweetShareIn a blog entry published Tuesday celebrating his friendship with his co-founder, Paul Allen, who died on Oct. 15 at age 65, Bill Gates remembered the moment Microsoft leapt into being.The memory dates back to 1975. The two men thought they’d already missed the microcomputer revolution, and in fact, they didn’t realize until later how ahead they had been. Gates credits Allen with understanding that far better and far earlier than he did.Allen and Gates both lived in the Boston area, Allen working as a programmer for Honeywell after dropping out of Washington State University, and Gates attending Harvard. Gates recalls Allen finding him and taking him urgently to a newsstand to show him the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics.The cover depicted the Altair 8800, an unimpressive box covered with switches to modern eyes, but which sparked the PC revolution. Gates recalled that Allen said, “This is happening without us!” Neat piece of history: Here's the cover of Popular Electronics that Paul Allen and Bill Gates were geeking out about in Boston, that inspired the founding of Microsoft.https://t.co/ob8ALnEgEE pic.twitter.com/o2VSg3tHQP— John Patrick Pullen (@jppullen) October 16, 2018 Despite the cover calling it a “minicomputer,” the Altair had a powerful microprocessor in it. An editorial inside trumpeted, “The Home Computer Is Here!” For $400 ($1,900 in 2018 dollars), you could purchase and assemble a kit that gave you a shocking amount of computational power—especially when the next fastest device available to consumers and hobbyists was a scientific calculator. Beyond that, only businesses and colleges had minicomputers or mainframes, both expensive, with restricted access, and shared with many other users.On the basis of that magazine cover and Allen’s enthusiasm, Gates left college. The next year the two founded Micro-Soft. (It later lost the hyphen.)Gates’ remembrance of Allen concludes with strong emotion: “Paul deserved more time in life. He would have made the most of it. I will miss him tremendously.”ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read Next3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolDocuments confirm what Microsoft is building in GoodyearAmerican City Business JournalsMicrosoft staff are openly questioning the value of diversityQuartzCan Microsoft (MSFT) Keep the Earnings Surprise Streak Alive?ZacksConsole gaming is at a crossroadsEngadgetZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolNatural Gas Price Prediction – Prices Tumble as Supplies IncreaseFX EmpireSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrude Oil Weekly Price Forecast – Crude oil running into resistanceFX EmpireWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolThe Boeing 737 MAX Is 1 Step Closer to Flying Again -- but Don't Expect to See It SoonMotley Fool8 Happy Easter Images to Post on Facebook, Twitter and InstagramInvestorPlaceRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

With no major news to speak of, let's see why Microsoft stock looks like a strong buy at the moment, especially as the likes of Facebook (FB) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google face heightened scrutiny in Washington.Microsoft MSFT saw its stock price pop over 1% Tuesday morning as it inches toward its all-time high. With no major news to speak of, let’s see why Microsoft stock looks like a strong buy at the moment, especially as the likes of Facebook FB and Alphabet’s GOOGL Google face heightened scrutiny in Washington.Recent NewsMicrosoft announced a few weeks back that it will introduce a subscription service for Xbox that mimics how Apple AAPL treats some of its high-priced iPhones. The software and hardware powerhouse will let consumers bundle an Xbox, an Xbox Live Gold subscription—which allows users to play multiplayer games online and access free games—and the Xbox Game Pass for one monthly cost.Microsoft’s idea here is pretty simple: to create more brand loyalty and more consistent revenue streams. At the end of the two-year period, Microsoft will theoretically be able to offer upgrades on newer models in what MSFT likely hopes is a somewhat limitless cycle. The move also highlights the growing popularity and strength of subscription services, from Netflix NFLX to Spotify SPOT.  Meanwhile, Microsoft has continued to jump deeper into artificial intelligence, IoT, and cloud computing. Microsoft, which grabbed 14% of the cloud market last quarter, is currently the second-largest cloud provider behind Amazon’s AMZN 34%. The firm also comes in well ahead of IBM’s IBM 8%, Google’s 6%, and Alibaba’s BABA 4%.The company has also bolstered its business through acquisitions as well, which includes its June purchase of open source software powerhouse GitHub. Microsoft also announced in July a five-year deal with Walmart WMT that will see the retail giant use MSFT’s cloud and AI tech.Stock Price Shares of Microsoft have climbed roughly 30% since the start of the year, which outpaces its industry’s 11% and the S&P 500’s 8% jump. MSFT stock continued to top the index and its industry over the last six months, even though it has slowed down recently. Investors will also notice that Microsoft stock has been on an impressive run over the last two years. This helps MSFT stock sit right near its new 52-week and all-time high of $112.78 per share. ValuationMoving on, investors need to understand Microsoft’s current valuation picture. MSFT stock is trading at 25.2X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which represents a significant discount compared to its industry’s 32.8X average. It is worth pointing out that Microsoft has traded as low as 22.2X over the last year with a one-year median of 24.4X.Investors will also clearly see that MSFT’s current valuation picture appears stretched compared to where it has traded over the last five years. However, the entire computer software-services industry has climbed steadily as well, and MSFT has always traded at a discount.Story continues OutlookLooking ahead, our current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for Microsoft’s fiscal Q1 revenues to climb by nearly 13.4% to hit $27.83 billion. MSFT’s fiscal 2019 revenues are expected to reach $122.36 billion, which would mark a roughly 11% jump.At the other end of the income statement, Microsoft’s adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to climb by over 14% to hit $0.96 per share, while its full-year EPS figure is expected to expand by over 9.5%.Plus, the firm has earned 10 quarterly earnings estimate revision over the last 60 days, against zero downward changes. MSFT has also earned 15 full-year upward earnings estimate revisions, with 100% agreement to the upside during this same time period.Bottom LineMicrosoft’s impressive earnings estimate revision trends help the company earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Coupled with the firm’s growing strength in cloud computing, along with its overall top and bottom-line outlook, MSFT stock appears to be one that investors should think about buying at the moment.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

Will Microsoft ruling affect campaign contributions?

June  7, 2000
Web posted at:  6:31 PM EDT (2231 GMT)


By Ian Christopher McCaleb

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Some Democratic lawmakers situated in Washington -- most specifically current Vice President and presidential aspirant Al Gore -- shouldn't expect too much in the way of campaign contributions from Microsoft, following Wednesday's federal court ruling that the company be split into two separate entities.





Microsoft officials, including company co-founder and Chairman Bill Gates, are none too pleased with the administration of President Bill Clinton and Vice President Gore, which they hold at least partly responsible for the judge's final ruling.


In April, Gates told a closed-door meeting of the House Republican Conference that the company believed a different administration would likely have treated Microsoft more favorably than did the Clinton-Gore Administration.


This, despite an appearance at the White House by Gates during that very same trip to Washington for the administration's high-profile "New Economy" summit.


On the afternoon of Wednesday, April 5, Gates participated in a discussion panel at the conference. He sat next to the president, and the two appeared to get on well, sharing the occasional private word as others spoke -- belying the bitterness expressed by Gates to Republican majority lawmakers in the House.


Sources on both sides -- administration and Microsoft respectively -- said at the time that the anti-trust case against Microsoft was not discussed at that White House event.


Just a day prior to the beginning of the New Economy summit, a Microsoft source told CNN that Gates would accept Clinton's invitation to attend, saying he would do so "to send a signal" that the sprawling firm remained an economic powerhouse despite the contentious court proceedings.


The White House's invitation to Gates, the source said, "tells us that the White House agrees."


Gates, who until very recently was not known as someone who wore his political leanings on his sleeve, has attempted to match wits with the corporate adversaries whose complaints led to Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's antitrust ruling against the company earlier this year; with Judge Jackson himself; and with the Clinton Justice Department by using the court system to his company's full advantage, and by becoming more politically active.


And what better way to engage in corporate activity than to crack open a few wallets -- including his own.

Cash decline for the Dems, expected boosts for the Republicans

According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Microsoft has contributed $1.1 million dollars in soft money to both major political parties this cycle -- $529,000 to the Democrats, and $607,000 to Republicans.


The software giant gave another $700,000 to individual candidates -- and it is those numbers that tell the story behind the company's newfound political activism.


The Center for Responsive Politics looked at how much Microsoft employees gave to the two presidential candidates -- Gore, and Republican Texas Gov. George W. Bush.


According to the non-partisan political contribution watchdog's database, Gore received $20,000 in contributions from Microsoft employees from Jan. 1, 1999 to Jan. 1, 2000, while Bush received just a shade under $35,000 in the same time period.


The watchdog's latest archived donation information was first made available by the Federal Election Commission on March 1.


Granted, Gore received his money months before Jackson issued his premier antitrust ruling against Microsoft in April of this year, and his popularity with Microsoft insiders is difficult to gauge based on numbers this old.


But consider this: In the same time period, former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's Democratic rival during the primary season who posted no victories before withdrawing in March, received $30,050 in donations from Microsoft employees.


Since that time, Microsoft's lobbying operations have kicked into gear in Washington, and their hardest work appears to center on Bush's campaign efforts.


Gore says the nation's anti-monopoly laws are critical to fostering competition -- something Gates and company may not want to hear in the long run.


But Bush has taken a position that appears to be more sympathetic to Microsoft.
                                              
"You know the fundamental question is, is Microsoft an innovative entity that is providing jobs; are they disrupting an economy that is changing so rapidly? I think the great fear is that Microsoft will be broken up," Bush said recently.
                                        
The Texas governor won't talk about the Microsoft case  now -- at least until it is resolved. But if it is still in the appeals court by the Clinton administration's end, the next president might well be able to influence its outcome.
                                        
"If the case is in play, then the next administration, if it wanted to could try to settle with Microsoft on more generous terms than what this administration has pursued," speculated Bob Litan of the Brookings Institute.


A spokesman for Microsoft says Gates and the company are not even looking for a political solution -- that it is a legal matter, and they'll fight it in court.


But their money is talking all the same.


In May, Microsoft participated in a high-profile Washington fund-raiser for Bush. Lobbyists for the firm sat on the 90-member host committee for the event, which, at $1,000 a head, aimed to raise some $350,000 to $400,000.


Indications are that Microsoft's giving will continue, and the next donation numbers released by the Federal Election Commission will be telling.


Republican lawmakers are beginning to fall in behind Microsoft.  Following Wednesday's ruling, Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles (R-Oklahoma), said, "Today may be a good day for the Clinton administration legislation-by-litigation agenda, but it is a sad day for the American consumer."


It is important to note that the Redmond, Washington-based firm hasn't turned Republican just because of the efforts of the Clinton administration's Justice Department.


Microsoft realizes there are many friendly Democrats out there, and donated some $67,000 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in the first three months of this year.

Gates, who until very recently was not known as someone who wore his political leanings on his sleeve, has attempted to match wits with the corporate adversaries whose complaints led to Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's antitrust ruling against the company earlier this year; with Judge Jackson himself; and with the Clinton Justice Department by using the court system to his company's full advantage, and by becoming more politically active.


And what better way to engage in corporate activity than to crack open a few wallets -- including his own.

Cash decline for the Dems, expected boosts for the Republicans

According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Microsoft has contributed $1.1 million dollars in soft money to both major political parties this cycle -- $529,000 to the Democrats, and $607,000 to Republicans.


The software giant gave another $700,000 to individual candidates -- and it is those numbers that tell the story behind the company's newfound political activism.


The Center for Responsive Politics looked at how much Microsoft employees gave to the two presidential candidates -- Gore, and Republican Texas Gov. George W. Bush.


According to the non-partisan political contribution watchdog's database, Gore received $20,000 in contributions from Microsoft employees from Jan. 1, 1999 to Jan. 1, 2000, while Bush received just a shade under $35,000 in the same time period.


The watchdog's latest archived donation information was first made available by the Federal Election Commission on March 1.


Granted, Gore received his money months before Jackson issued his premier antitrust ruling against Microsoft in April of this year, and his popularity with Microsoft insiders is difficult to gauge based on numbers this old.


But consider this: In the same time period, former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's Democratic rival during the primary season who posted no victories before withdrawing in March, received $30,050 in donations from Microsoft employees.


Since that time, Microsoft's lobbying operations have kicked into gear in Washington, and their hardest work appears to center on Bush's campaign efforts.


Gore says the nation's anti-monopoly laws are critical to fostering competition -- something Gates and company may not want to hear in the long run.


But Bush has taken a position that appears to be more sympathetic to Microsoft.
                                              
"You know the fundamental question is, is Microsoft an innovative entity that is providing jobs; are they disrupting an economy that is changing so rapidly? I think the great fear is that Microsoft will be broken up," Bush said recently.
                                        
The Texas governor won't talk about the Microsoft case  now -- at least until it is resolved. But if it is still in the appeals court by the Clinton administration's end, the next president might well be able to influence its outcome.
                                        
"If the case is in play, then the next administration, if it wanted to could try to settle with Microsoft on more generous terms than what this administration has pursued," speculated Bob Litan of the Brookings Institute.


A spokesman for Microsoft says Gates and the company are not even looking for a political solution -- that it is a legal matter, and they'll fight it in court.


But their money is talking all the same.


In May, Microsoft participated in a high-profile Washington fund-raiser for Bush. Lobbyists for the firm sat on the 90-member host committee for the event, which, at $1,000 a head, aimed to raise some $350,000 to $400,000.


Indications are that Microsoft's giving will continue, and the next donation numbers released by the Federal Election Commission will be telling.


Republican lawmakers are beginning to fall in behind Microsoft.  Following Wednesday's ruling, Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles (R-Oklahoma), said, "Today may be a good day for the Clinton administration legislation-by-litigation agenda, but it is a sad day for the American consumer."


It is important to note that the Redmond, Washington-based firm hasn't turned Republican just because of the efforts of the Clinton administration's Justice Department.


Microsoft realizes there are many friendly Democrats out there, and donated some $67,000 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in the first three months of this year.

Microsoft to offer Linux software?




















   Story Tools














SEATTLE, Washington (Reuters) -- In a major strategy shift, Microsoft Corp. will introduce software based on the Linux  open source operating system in 2004 for Web services and server software, market researcher META Group predicted on Monday.


Microsoft, which denied that it had any plans to develop software for Linux, is facing a growing threat from the open source software standard as it gains share in the corporate server market used to manage networks and data.


META Group predicted that Linux will be used on nearly half of new servers by 2007, up from its current share of 15 to 20 percent, making it difficult for Microsoft to ignore Linux as a platform for its database, Web hosting and e-mail server applications.


"We believe that, beginning in late 2004, Microsoft (and its partners) will begin moving some of its (to-date) proprietary application enablers (e.g., .Net components) to the Linux environment; this will gradually include the major Microsoft back-office products, such as SQL Server, IIS, and Exchange," META Group said.

Group: Microsoft will lower prices

In a further shift, META Group said that Microsoft will also re-price or separate its Windows server operating system "so that it can be favorably compared against 'free' Linux."


"I'm unaware of any efforts at this time to move any products onto Linux," said Peter Houston, senior director at Microsoft's server group, adding that there were no plans to detach or re-price its Windows server operating system.


"We have made a bet on Windows, and we believe that customers are getting value from the bet we made," said Houston, "and we're going to continue doing what we've been doing for customers."


Linux advocates argue that Linux offers better security, flexibility and innovation because its underlying code, or blueprint, for programs remains open to evaluation and scrutiny.


Microsoft, which has grown into the world's largest software maker by selling proprietary software that cannot be copied or modified freely, said it is not opposed to open-source software, and points out that its source code is available to approved partners and educational institutions on a limited basis.


Microsoft faced a similar situation a decade ago when its nascent server software was competing head-to-head with market leader Sun Microsystems Inc. , but Microsoft did not choose at the time to write software for Sun's proprietary version of Unix.

Linux use grows

Now Linux, essentially a free version of Unix, is eating away at Sun's share of the business server market.


Sun, a hardware and software maker, is now selling computers running Linux, a strategy that was also embraced by International Business Machines Corp.


Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft has toned down its criticism of Linux recently, after an internal strategy document said that some of its arguments against open source software has "backfired."


Instead, Microsoft has stressed that its software is more affordable when considering the total cost of using Linux, including ongoing personnel and administration costs.

Microsoft fights back

A recent Microsoft-sponsored study by researcher IDC concluded that servers based on Microsoft's Windows 2000 were cheaper to own and operate when used for networking, storing and sharing files, printing and security, while Linux servers were cheaper to operate when used for Web hosting.


"The IDC study shows that the upfront cost is a small part of the total cost to the customer," said Microsoft's Houston.


META Group's report also came to the same conclusion, saying that Linux's total costs of ownership were likely to be higher for mainstream server applications.


"IT organizations must evaluate platform costs from a total-cost-of-ownership perspective," META Group's report said.

Microsoft offers free tool for security checks






 From...































By Matt  Berger
 (IDG) -- DEEP IN THE midst of an effort to beef up the security of its software, Microsoft Monday made available a free tool designed to search out security vulnerabilities hiding in Windows-based computers.
Called the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA), the tool is intended to provide users with an easy way to check their systems for common problems that arise when computers are configured incorrectly or when users fail to install suggested patches, Microsoft said.

After scanning a system with the tool, users receive a security report card that lists all the holes and vulnerabilities found during the scan. The MBSA does not actually download and install fixes but provides instructions how to do so.
It can be installed on Windows 2000 desktop and server operating systems as well as the Home and Professional Editions of Windows XP, Microsoft said. Users must also have version 5.1 or higher of Internet Explorer.
The MBSA can also be used to scan for security holes on the following software: Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Internet Information Server 4.0 and 5.0, SQL Server 7.0 and 2000, Internet Explorer 5.01 and later, and Office 2000 and XP.

Developed with the help of Shavlik Technologies in St. Paul, Minnesota, Microsoft first detailed the tool at the RSA Security Conference in February.

   Microsoft aiming to recover lost ground in mobileStory Highlights Windows Mobile exec: Microsoft strategy shift will soon pay dividends  New approach focuses on services that help connect the phone to the PC and Web  Windows Mobile was created for handheld computers that didn't connect to a network  New strategy will be announced at a mobile tech conference in Barcelona next month Next Article in Technology »   By Ina Fried 



 


 

 
 (CNET) -- Microsoft has made some stumbles in the mobile world, but a strategy shift made more than a year ago will soon pay dividends, the company's top Windows Mobile executive said in an interview with CNET News. 
Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer discusses his Windows Mobile offerings earlier this month at CES in Las Vegas. 
 Andy Lees, the executive brought over from the server unit a year ago, said that Microsoft's efforts to make sure that its mobile software could run on a wide range of phones resulted in an operating system that failed to take advantage of advances in hardware. "We aimed to go for a lower common denominator," Lees said. Microsoft was also limited by the origins of Windows Mobile, which was developed to power handheld computers that neither connected to a network nor handled voice. "We started out when we were in PDAs (personal digital assistants) and then a phone got strapped to the back of the PDA," Lees said. The company also failed to recognize that phones--even those that were used for business--were still as much personal as they were professional. Meanwhile, Apple and Google have joined the fray with operating systems designed from the ground up to take advantage of the latest in phone technology. But Lees said that Microsoft embarked on a new strategy some time ago that will come to fruition over the next 18 months. The first steps in that strategy, he said, will be announced at the Mobile World Congress conference that takes place in Barcelona in the middle of next month.

 "You are going to see a bunch of announcements at Mobile World Congress but also it is going to be the beginning of a 12-, 18-month period where you are going to see a whole bunch of different stuff," Lees said. Part of Microsoft's new strategy, Lees said, is not relying on operating system upgrades to improve its products. The new approach, while still making money by selling a mobile operating system, places considerable focus on services that help connect the phone to the PC and Web as well as devices such as the Xbox. Microsoft has two separate teams at work on the services piece. One is Microsoft's Windows Live group, while the other is a rather secretive group headed by former Mac unit head Roz Ho--a group that also includes the team Microsoft acquired when it bought Danger. Lees declined to say specifically what Ho is up to, however. But Lees acknowledged the company also needs to improve that core operating system, which is widely seen as lagging that of most of its rivals. For some time now, Microsoft has been working on a significant overhaul of its operating system, known as Windows Mobile 7. However, that project has hit delays, prompting Microsoft to push forward with an interim update, Windows Mobile 6.5, which the company is widely expected to detail next month. Lees declined to comment specifically on either version of the operating system, but promised the company would have more to say on the OS front in Barcelona. Lees also promised that Microsoft would start working more closely with hardware makers. He pointed to deals late last year with LG and Samsung. He noted that the power of the kinds of phones that come out next year will be incredible, well beyond even today's devices. Phones next year will have dual-core processors, super-fast data connections, and graphics power rivaling that of the original Xbox. "That's a phenomenal thing on a phone," he said. The phones of the future will also have location information beyond just GPS sensors. "It will know where it is pointing, it will know which angle it is being held at." Web browsing has been another weak spot for Microsoft. The company made up some ground late last year with a pocket browser that essentially crams the desktop Internet Explorer 6 into a Windows Mobile phone. But it lacks the kind of easy zooming and gesture recognition present on the iPhone or in Palm's Pre. Lees promised that Microsoft would surpass those interfaces by the end of the year. Lees would not confirm details of a rumored rival to Apple's App Store, reportedly known as SkyMarket. "There is some question whether we can more directly connect the developer and the end user," he said. "We're looking at that." Apple dismissed the notion that Microsoft and others are catching up to the iPhone, however. On a conference call with analysts last week, Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer dismissed the growing competition from rivals saying Apple remained "years ahead" in the phone business. "Our competitors are scrambling to try and copy our success," he said.

   Microsoft readies smartphone assault on AppleStory Highlights Microsoft is getting ready to launch an online marketplace akin to Apple's App Store  Microsoft is also readying an upgraded version of its mobile operating system  Announcement expected next week at the Mobile World Congress trade show  Developments were first reported in the Wall Street Journal Next Article in Technology »   By Marguerite Reardon 



 


 

 
 (CNET) -- Microsoft is gearing up to take on rival Apple in the smartphone market. 
Microsoft and CEO Steve Ballmer will launch an online store for smartphone applications, a report says. 
 The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that Microsoft is getting ready to launch an online marketplace akin to Apple's App Store. Microsoft is also readying a more sophisticated version of its mobile operating system called Windows Mobile 6.5, the Journal reported. Smartphones are sophisticated mobile phones that offer users access to the Web and e-mail, as well as, provide phone calling and all kinds of other messaging options. This category of device is the hottest thing going in the mobile market and is seen as the biggest growth engine for mobile devices over the next few years. Microsoft, which only makes the operating software for these devices, holds third place in terms of worldwide market share, according to research firm IDC. Symbian, which powers Nokia's smartphones, is by far the leader, followed by Research In Motion with its BlackBerry devices.  Even though Apple seems to be the most talked about smartphone on the market these days, it's only in fifth place in terms of overall market share for 2008, IDC said. But Apple is quickly gobbling up market share and has become a serious threat to Microsoft and every other company competing in the smartphone market. With the release of the iPhone 3G last summer, Apple has tripled its market share from 3 percent in 2007 to 9 percent in 2008, according to IDC.

 Meanwhile, Microsoft only grew from 11 percent market share in 2007 to 12.3 percent in 2008. Microsoft is facing several challenges as it tries to catch Apple's growth rate. For one, the company's business model is based primarily on licensing software to hardware vendors. While this business model worked fine just a couple of years ago, it's difficult to justify now given that device makers can get free software from Symbian, Google Android, and Linux. The second problem that Microsoft faces is that the company has been almost exclusively focused on business customers. Over the past year, smartphone users have gravitated toward more consumer applications. In addition, to their work e-mail, they want multimedia functionality and social-networking applications on their phones. "Microsoft is in a really tough spot," said Ryan Reith, an analyst with IDC. "It has to change its value proposition. And a big part of that is refreshing its user interface and making the device more consumer-friendly." Reith believes this is why it's critical for Microsoft to develop an application marketplace that can compete with Apple's App Store. The App Store went live last summer and offers thousands of applications for the iPhone and iPod Touch music player. The store has been very successful with users downloading thousands of free and fee-based applications. Microsoft already has a developer community creating applications for Windows Mobile devices. But the problem is that many of these applications have been geared toward business users. And there is not a single destination that makes it easy for users to discover and download different applications. "Clearly smartphones are not just for business users anymore," Reith said. "Microsoft needs to work with the developer community to get more consumer applications out there." Microsoft's executives have gotten the message that consumer functionality is hot. And Andy Lees, head of Microsoft's mobile business unit, told the Journal that the company is about to put more emphasis on multimedia and other consumer functions like music and photos. Microsoft is expected to unveil its new offerings next week at the Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona, Spain. Chief Executive Steve Ballmer will be delivering a keynote speech there on February 16. I will be there next week covering the news from the show, as will my CNET Reviews colleagues Bonnie Cha and Kent German. But even with these enhancements, Microsoft has a tough road ahead of it. Competition in the smartphone market is increasing. And several competitors, including Android and RIM, are launching their own version of an application store. On the handset and operating system side, new devices are coming to market that could provide stiff competition for Windows Mobile devices. For example, smartphone pioneer Palm is coming out with new mobile software and a device called Pre later this year. And even though critics have been writing the company's obituary for the last year, the new device, which was unveiled last month at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, has been getting a lot of buzz. But Microsoft thinks it has the right enhancements lined up to take on these competitors, especially Apple. The Journal also reported that Microsoft is talking about a new synchronized data storage service called My Phone. This new service is supposed to make it easier for people to back up their mobile contacts, calendar appointments, photos and text messages, to a Web site. The service is similar to a service that Apple calls MobileMe. The biggest difference will be that Microsoft will offer My Phone for free whereas Apple charges $99 a year for MobileMe. It's too soon to know how Microsoft's new software and application store will stack up against Apple's offering. But one thing is certain, Apple isn't sitting still either. And if Microsoft or any other competitors want to hasten Apple's rise in this market, they'll have to leap-frog Apple with something truly revolutionary.

  Microsoft apologizes for gaffe in online ad Story Highlights Microsoft apologizes for a gaffe in an ad on its Polish Web site  Ad was altered to replace a black businessman's head with that of a white man  "We are looking into how it happened," says a Microsoft spokesman Next Article in Technology »   By  Patrick Oppmann  CNN  



 


 

  SEATTLE, Washington (CNN)  -- Software giant Microsoft apologized Wednesday for the apparent bad judgment that led to the head of a black model being swapped for that of a white model in an online advertisement. 
A black man in an online Microsoft ad was replaced with a white man, bottom, on the company's Polish Web site. 
 The ad -- which showed three business people, one Asian, one white and one black -- was altered on Microsoft's Web site for Poland to place the head of a white man on a black man's body. "We apologized, fixed the error and we are looking into how it happened," said Lou Gellos, a Microsoft spokesman.  He said that because the company was still reviewing how the swap occurred he could not comment further.   On Microsoft's official page on the social network site Twitter, a posting calls the swap "a marketing mistake" and offers "sincere apologies." The episode drew widespread criticism on the Internet after Engadget, an influential tech blog, published news of the gaffe Tuesday.   The business Web site CNET.com wrote that the change in models may have been made with the "racially homogeneous" Polish market in mind. CNET is a CNN.com content partner.

  Microsoft, Google expand search-engine toolsStory Highlights Microsoft and Google released new search products this week  Microsoft Bing's "visual search" features images instead of text  Google's Fast Flip aims to replicate the magazine reading experience online  Products are evidence that search-engine market is diversifying Next Article in Technology »  Read VIDEO  By  John D. Sutter and Brandon Griggs CNN 



 


 

  (CNN) -- Say you're buying a dog. You know the breed you want; you can picture it in your head. But what was the name? A bull terrier? A pit bull? A bull mastiff? 

Bing's "visual search" and Google's Fast Flip produce search results as images. 


 Or what if you're in the market for a new camera? You saw a friend with a credit-card-thin model at a party last weekend. But was that a Canon? A Nikon? A brand you've never heard of? If you're like many people, you'd turn to the Internet for answers. But you type in "dog breeds" or "digital cameras" into Google and punch enter, and a big list of blue links comes up. You don't see the dog you want. You don't find the camera, either -- at least not quickly.    Such quandaries are the driving force behind Bing's new "visual search" function, which lets Web users troll through image catalogues instead of Web pages when they know what something looks like but can't put their finger on the name. The examples are also evidence that the search engine market, once dominated by simple rectangular search bars and the lists of Web pages that follow, is diversifying. People who once were happy with a one-search-fits-all model are finding exceptions, and a number of niche search products are trying to respond to these increasingly diverse needs.   Also this week, Google introduced a test product called Fast Flip, which takes a retro look at Web design by making online news look like something magazine readers will find familiar.

The future of libraries, with or without books


 The company has other news products -- namely Google Reader and Google News -- but is looking for ways to make news content more visual and to share some of the revenue. The new products come as Microsoft's Bing continues to elbow for more room in an online search market that Google has dominated for years. In June, 65 percent of all Internet searchers were done through Google sites, according to comScore. Microsoft caught only 8.4 percent of searchers in the same period. Fast Flip, an experimental feature of Google Labs, is a Web application that allows users to scan news articles from 39 print and online publishers, including The New York Times, Newsweek, TechCrunch and Us magazine. Users can "flip" through a horizontal stream of screen grabs of articles as they appear on the partners' Web sites, with layout, design and images intact. You can click once on a story to enlarge the page; a second click takes you to the partner's site. Users also can browse popular topics (the economy, Taylor Swift) or search for others of their choosing. Google says the idea behind the new service is to make online news-browsing faster and replicate the reading experience of flipping through a magazine or newspaper.  Unlike Google News, which emphasizes breaking news articles from the past 24 hours, Fast Flip "is more for stories with a longer shelf life," Google spokesman Chris Gaither said. "We think there's a lot of room for innovation in how people consume news articles on the Web," Gaither said. "The easier it is for people to browse articles quickly, the more they'll read."   Loren Baker, editor of Search Engine Journal, says that increases in bandwidth make "visual search" functions more successful today than in previous years, when images would load more slowly. Baker believes that Google Fast Flip could make it easier for people to scan news articles on their netbooks, tablets or even smartphones. "I don't have to sift through my bookmarks. I don't even have to leave Google," he said. "It's almost like a virtual newsstand on my handheld." But not everyone is excited about Google's new product.   "If this is the future of news, I think news is kind of screwed," said Frederic Lardinois, a writer at ReadWriteWeb, a technology blog. Lardinois said the interface is backward-thinking and is hard to use. Fast Flip is in a test phase and will incorporate feedback from users, Gaither said. Google also is seeking to expand the roster of Fast Flip partners, he said. Some tech observers say Bing's hyper-visual search function gives it a new leg up on Google in terms of functionality.  Nova Spivack, a search expert and founder of Twine, said the most important thing about Bing's visual search is that users can sort the images into categories.  By creating different kinds of searches and making them sortable, Bing is catering to high-end Internet users -- which, soon, will be everyone, he said. "I think Bing has realized that everybody is becoming a search geek," he said.  On the dog-breed search example, users can filter the images to include only terriers, or hypoallergenic dogs or toy dogs, or dogs that need a medium level of exercise, so they don't have to scroll through hundreds of photos to find the dog they're searching for.   Mary Jo Foley, editor of the All About Microsoft blog at ZDNet, said she personally finds Bing's visual search useless because she's not a visually minded person. But she said it's an example of search engines diversifying, and that's a good thing for everyone. "I think the idea for Microsoft and Google and Yahoo is to present things in new ways and say, 'What if you could do this? Would you want to do it this way?' " She added: "Not all people search in the same way, and not all people want to get their results in the same way." There are about 50 galleries of images in the new Bing visual search bin, but more will be added, and eventually the idea will be integrated into the main search site, said Stefan Weitz, director of Bing. Right now, users have to go to a separate page to find the visual searches. 





 David Coursey, a blogger at PCWorld.com, said the search works like a "visual dictionary." "I think Bing is onto something," he said. "And if they can figure out how to extend Bing's visual search, it could be very helpful for people who know what something looks like but don't know what to call it."

   $250K Microsoft bounty to catch worm creatorStory Highlights Software giant Microsoft offers $250,000 bounty to catch Conficker author  Industry analysts say is one of the most serious infections they have ever seen  The worm exploits a bug in Microsoft's ubiquitous Windows software  Virus could allow its creators to hijack entire networks Next Article in Technology »   By  Barry Neild  CNN 



 


 

  (CNN) -- Software giant Microsoft is offering a $250,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of hackers behind a powerful computer virus that could lead to millions of PCs being hijacked. 
Experts say a single infected laptop could expose an entire network to the worm. 
 Experts have so far been baffled by the true purpose of the Conficker or Downadup virus, but have described its spread as one of the most serious infections ever seen. The worm exploits a bug in Microsoft Windows to infect mainly corporate networks, then -- although it has yet to cause any harm -- it opens a link back to its point of origin, meaning it can receive further orders to wreak havoc.   Microsoft has issued a patch to fix the bug, however if a single machine is infected in a large network, it will spread unchecked -- often reinfecting machines that have been disinfected. The threat from the virus prompted Microsoft in collaboration with other technology industry names to this week announce a $250,000 reward for information to track down those behind Conficker.

Virus exposes PCs to hijack


 "As part of Microsoft's ongoing security efforts, we constantly look for ways to use a diverse set of tools and develop methodologies to protect our customers," said George Stathakopoulos, of Microsoft's Trustworthy Computing Group. Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at anti-virus firm F-Secure says the true scope of the virus is not known, but in the past 24 hours his company monitored Conficker signals from two million Internet protocol addresses. "That's a lot," he told CNN. "And one IP address here does not mean one infected computer, it means at least one infected computer.  "Many of those IP addresses are obviously company proxies or firewalls, hiding hundreds of more infections behind it. Unfortunately this also makes it impossible to estimate the total count of infected systems.  "So it's still big. Very big."  Microsoft has previously paid out similar rewards to informants who helped identify the creator of Sasser, another notorious worm let loose in 2004. The perpetrator was tracked to Germany, where he was sentenced a year later.

 Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Can you throw a party on a tweet? That's just what Microsoft did Thursday night, inviting people on a scavenger hunt to join them for a concert in Atlanta. The event promoted the launch of its new phone, the Kin, which has social media at its heart. The inconspicuous concert in a roller derby hall was headlined by hip-hop icon Big Boi from Outkast and drew more than 1,000 people in less than three hours. Microsoft product manager Jeremiah Glodoveza said the experiment exemplified the power of social media to mobilize an audience -- an idea that is the core concept behind the company's new phone, he said. "We believe in social media," Glodoveza said. "We believe in social networking. The Kin is a phone that was purposefully built for people who are navigating their social lives." The concert, which also featured Southern rapper Jay Electronica and Alabama sensation YelaWolf, was the last of seven secret shows held across the country. The idea was showcased May 8 in San Francisco, California, in an auto body shop. The entourage has since popped up in Chicago, Illinois, and New York, throwing free concerts with A-list performances and local artists, all hosted at the most unexpected locations. "We don't disclose the venue until a couple hours before the show, so people are glued to social networks. They're refreshing their screens non-stop," Glodoveza said.  "It's about bringing people together with their passions and having a great moment ... offline," he added. "It's been excellent, actually," Big Boi said. "It started out by dropping clues, just word of mouth and using Facebook and Twitter and things like that to get the word out, and man, it just blew up." Big Boi, who added that he likes keeping in touch with his fans, said he's recently been releasing singles from his solo debut, "Sir Luscious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty," out July 6, to give his fans something to hold on to. "It's caught on like wildfire," he added. Big Boi is certainly not the first entertainer to use social media to create a flash mob of fans.  His good friend, comedian Dave Chappelle -- best known for his sketch-comedy program "Chappelle's Show," which ended in 2005 -- has held similar events for more than a year.  In July, thousands of people showed up in the middle of the night in downtown Portland, Oregon, to watch Chappelle perform. They learned about the show through text message, Twitter and word of mouth. "It works, man. It definitely works," Big Boi said. Microsoft's Glodoveza says the company -- whose new phone combines the users social networks on its home screen to encourage "natural communication" -- hopes to promote more impulsive and spontaneous events like the one held in Atlanta on Thursday night. "It's not purpose-built to be an iPhone competitor. We built a phone from the ground up with social networking," Glodoveza said. "Our motto is, share life as you're living it."

 Microsoft's Skinput turns hands, arms into buttonsBy  John D. Sutter, CNN   Your body as a touchscreenSTORY HIGHLIGHTS Microsoft and Carnegie Mellon University develop a prototype called Skinput  The system turns a person's arm and hand into a virtual keyboard  Users tap their fingers together and touch their forearm to send messages to gadgets  The prototype won't be commercially available for two to seven years

Consumer Electronics

Carnegie Mellon University

Microsoft Corporation

 Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- In Chris Harrison's ideal world, mobile phones would be the size of matchbooks. They'd have full-size keyboards. They'd browse the Web. They'd play videos. And, most importantly, you'd never have to touch them. Sound like too much to ask? Maybe not.  Harrison, a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University and a former intern at Microsoft Research, has developed a working prototype of a system called Skinput that does just that, essentially by turning a person's hand and forearm into a keyboard and screen. "People don't love the iPhone keyboard. They use them. But they don't love them," Harrison said in a interview at the recent Computer-Human Interaction conference. "If you could make the iPhone keyboard as big as an arm -- that would be huge." Using Skinput, a person could tap their thumb and middle finger together to answer a call; touch their forearm to go to the next track on a music player; or flick the center of their palm to select a menu item. All of these sign-language-like movements, which are customizable, would control a gadget in a person's pocket through a Bluetooth connection. When fitted with a pico-projector, the Skinput system could display an image of a digital keyboard on a person's forearm. So, using Skinput, someone could send text messages by tapping his or her arm in certain places -- without pulling the phone out of a pocket or purse.  "You could pretty much do a lot of what you do on your iPhone," said Harrison, who says Skinput "is [like having] your iPhone on your palm."  The system, which has been under development for eight months, won't be commercially available for two to seven years, said Dan Morris, a Microsoft researcher who is working with Harrison on Skinput. Before that can happen, Skinput's sensors need to get more accurate, he said. In a 13-person trial in Seattle, Washington, Skinput was found to be 96 percent accurate. But that test only used five buttons. The system would have to improve for people to make use of a full keyboard, which would be the "holy grail," Morris said. "The accuracy is good, but it's not quite consumer-level yet," he said. Skinput is one of a number of prototypes, ideas and near-products aiming to make computing more natural.  These devices seek to move beyond the mouse and physical keyboard, letting people communicate with their gadgets by gesturing, using sign language or, in the case of Skinput, tapping on their hands, fingers and forearms. The arm as an instrument Understanding how Skinput works makes it seem all the more futuristic. The system turns a person's arm and hand into a wiggling, pulsating instrument, full of vibrations that can be picked up and translated. Skinput users wear an armband -- the prototype version is made of an elbow brace -- that's lined with 10 sensors. These sensors look like tiny diving boards with dumbbells on one end, and they pick up inaudible sounds that range in frequency from 25 to 78 hertz.  When a Skinput user taps a thumb and middle finger together, the impact sends ripples down the skin and through the bones in the person's arm. "They sort of start resonating -- like guitar strings," Harrison said. The diving-board receivers read the sound waves to figure out what gesture the person made, and then relay that information to a phone. Skinput can tell whether a person tapped a middle finger or an index finger, because the two moves sound slightly different to the springy receivers. The system takes one or two minutes to learn the sounds of a particular person's arm, Morris said, and then it can be used however the user likes. Trial and error When they started working on Skinput, Morris and Harrison weren't sure if it would be possible to turn the human arm into a virtual keypad. The pair tried clipping sensors to the ends of peoples' fingers and other strange configurations that made users feel like cyborgs. "We spent a lot of nights in the lab tapping on our arms and wondering if this would ever happen," Harrison said. But the most profound achievement of Skinput is proving that the human body can be used as a sensor, he said. Morris believes Skinput will make computing accessible to people in a way that never would have been possible before. With Skinput, "literally, computing is always available," he said. A person might walk toward their home, Harrison said, tap their palm to unlock the door and then tap some virtual buttons on their arms to turn on the TV and start flipping through channels. "It's almost like magic," he said.

 Microsoft revamps Hotmail, takes on Google and YahooBy  Doug Gross, CNN    The updates to Hotmail are expected to roll out in the next few weeks. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Hotmail service will get a major overhaul, Microsoft announces  The service is world's most popular e-mail, but it has lagged in innovation  The update eliminates clutter, lets users easily choose which messages to look at  It also will let people use programs like PowerPoint without ever leaving e-mail

Email Software

Internet

 (CNN) -- Hotmail, the world's most widely used e-mail service, is getting a major overhaul from Microsoft in a bid to fend off competitors like Google's Gmail. Microsoft says the planned update to Windows Live Hotmail is designed to remove clutter and let users interact with other sites and applications while checking their mail. In the blog post, Microsoft program manager Dick Craddock said the company studied e-mail usage for a year while considering the changes. "People made it clear to us that the No. 1 thing they wanted their e-mail service to address -- whether it was Hotmail or any other e-mail service -- was to help them manage the clutter in their inbox; not just the spam, but all the mail they get that's clogging their inboxes," he wrote. A key feature to the new Hotmail, which will be rolled out over the next few weeks, will be a "sweep" feature that allows users to clean out their inbox in one fell swoop. The single-click feature lets the user select a single e-mail sender, or multiple senders, and automatically delete every message from that sender. Another single click will let users decide which e-mails they want to look at -- from people on their contacts list, from their social networking sites or otherwise. Microsoft's study showed that only about 25 percent of e-mail people get is from members of their contacts list. The rest tends to be business related, from social networks, tracking of purchases they've made online and spam, the post says. Despite the growing popularity of social networks like Facebook as a way to communicate, Craddock wrote that people are getting more e-mail than ever. While it remains on top of the global e-mail market with roughly 350 million users, the decade-and-a-half old Hotmail has been a largely stagnant service compared to third-place Gmail, which has been steadily picking up users. Yahoo is also more widely used in the United States than Hotmail. Gmail has always offered ways to link up with Google's expansive list of internet offerings, most recently its foray into the world of social networking, Google Buzz. By comparison, Hotmail and Yahoo have offered more-basic mail to their users. Hotmail's proposed changes follow some of what Gmail has done. For example, with the new Hotmail, people will be able to open and edit PowerPoint documents in their e-mail accounts, whether they have PowerPoint installed on their computer or not. Hotmail Active View will give people an automatic preview of their incoming mail, including a look at photos they've received -- both attachments and links to photo sites like Flickr. They'll be able to watch YouTube videos, check social networks and perform other outside tasks without ever leaving e-mail. Gmail has similar features. The proposed changes got mostly positive feedback early Tuesday from the tech community -- where Hotmail's vanilla setup hadn't garnered many fans before. "It'll be hard to steal users away from Gmail -- which still has dozens of minor features that Hotmail doesn't (just check the Labs) -- but Hotmail will most likely be a worthy competitor after the new version is launched this summer," Stan Schroeder of social media blog Mashable, wrote on Tuesday. Harry McCracken of PC World wrote that the new Hotmail could be preferable to Gmail in some ways and pick up new users, particularly from flailing AOL. "Hotmail also feels less densely packaged with stuff," he wrote. "I could see some folks preferring it to Gmail, which is beginning to flirt with bloat."

 Microsoft demos 'Milo' game at TED GlobalBy  Rich Galant, CNN | Filed under: Gaming & Gadgets     Peter Molyneux demonstrates a prototypical Microsoft game called "Milo" at the TED Global conference. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Microsoft demos a prototypical game called "Milo" at the TED Global conference  "Milo" on Microsoft's forthcoming Kinect gaming add-on for the Xbox 360  TED is a group dedicated to "ideas worth spreading"

Editor's Note: CNN partners with TED to feature a talk, with added content, on CNN.com every Tuesday.  Oxford, England (CNN) -- "This talk is a little bit insane," confided Peter Molyneux, the head of the European games division of Microsoft, as he prepared to demo a game called "Milo" at the TED Global conference in Oxford on Tuesday.  He asked audience members to cross their fingers as they waited to see if the live demo would work. "Milo" is a story-telling game about a little boy who's unhappy because his family has moved from London to New England and his parents are too busy to listen to what's on his mind. Molyneux said his goal with the game, which is still under development, is to recreate the feeling he had as a 4-year-old child when his father told him a story about a robot. The idea, he said, is to create a real, living boy in a computer. "Most of it is just a trick, but a trick that works," he said, and the demo seemed to work as well. The Kinect camera, which Molyneux said Microsoft is going to introduce in November, is a device somewhat like Wii, but which controls a game relying on the movement of the player's body, with no controller. In the demo, a player on stage interacted with Milo, showing him where to find snails in his backyard, suggesting that he squash a snail, skimming stones in a lake, and cleaning up the boy's room. Molyneux is the founder of Lionhead Studios, which made the role-playing game "Fable" and which was taken over by Microsoft in 2006.  TED Global is a conference run by the nonprofit TED, which is devoted to "Ideas Worth Spreading." It began as a conference focusing on three subjects -- technology, entertainment and design -- but has expanded its scope and now makes more than 700 talks from its conferences available at ted.com.  Molyneux said Milo will get smarter as millions of people play the game. "As a game developer, the only relationship I have with you is through your thumbs," he said, "and that's pretty limiting."  "Milo" aims to help change that relationship.

 First impressions: Microsoft's Kinect gaming systemBy Larry Frum, Special to CNN | Filed under: Gaming & Gadgets   Microsoft's new controller for the Xbox 360 uses physical movements from the players to control action on the screen. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Kinect introduces a gaming system where there is nothing to hold and no buttons to push  Three camera sensors and four mics help Kinect recognize who is standing in front of it  Microsoft says 30,000 North American retailers will have Kinect available on Thursday (CNN) -- With Kinect, the new controller-free system for its Xbox 360 gaming console, Microsoft isn't just trying to revolutionize video gaming. The company wants to change how people interact with all their entertainment choices. Kinect, which goes on sale Thursday, allows players' physical movements to control action on the screen. Unlike the similar Nintendo Wii or Sony Move, there is nothing to hold and no buttons to push.  Three camera sensors and four microphones help Kinect recognize who is standing in front of it. The system recognizes voice commands and reads a player's full range of movements -- not just swings of the arm -- translating them into an avatar's actions within a game. Alex Kipman, director of incubation for Kinect, said Microsoft is trying to break down technological barriers and make game interaction more natural. "We wanted to transform entertainment where technology understands you," Kipman said during a Kinect demo in Washington. "It was our goal to merge really amazing tech with a really amazing experience." 



XBOX Kinect unleashed


Kipman explained that the specific components used to create Kinect have been around for years. He said the real breakthrough was in the proprietary software used to make it all work together. Cloud profiles, featuring information accessed from the Web on an as-needed basis instead of from a local hard drive, help the Kinect and Xbox 360 learn about users and what types of entertainment they might be interested in. Kinect also will help live-stream music, movies and more in real time.

The much-anticipated system, first unveiled more than a year ago, is Microsoft's entry in the growing era of motion-controlled gaming pioneered by the Wii in 2006. Sony launched Move, a motion-sensing game controller for its PlayStation 3 console, in September. A Microsoft spokesperson said 30,000 North American retailers would have Kinect available Thursday, with 7,000 of those planning to open at midnight. She would not say how many units would be available on launch day. The system will launch with at least 17 games. I spent four days testing out Kinect, which should appeal to casual gamers and families more than hardcore action gamers. Here are my impressions: Getting started Out of the box, the Kinect sensor is 11 inches long and 3 inches high, including the motorized stand it sits on. Connecting to the Xbox is easy. For the new Xbox 360 Slim consoles, it is plug-and-play -- no additional wires. To use on the original Xbox 360 consoles, you will need a power source for the device. After some software downloads, the Kinect calibrates itself to the room automatically. It is actuated by specific gestures (waving your hand at the Kinect) or by using a specific key word for voice commands ("Xbox"). "It is technology that understands you," Kipman said. "Kinect looks at 48 points on the body to figure out what it should do. It always knows who is in charge." The Kinect should go at or as near eye level as possible so it can read all your movements. Also, it requires a clear space to play so nothing impedes its view of the player and nothing gets bumped or knocked over. Someone playing alone will need to be at least 6 feet back, while two players should be about eight feet from the screen. Kinect comes bundled with "Kinect Adventures," an introductory game that teaches you how to use the device. Hovering your hand over game menu options activates those choices. Five different adventures require the player to move and react to different scenarios. "Rallyball" will get you reacting to things being thrown at you. "River Rush" and "Reflex Ridge" get you dodging and steering. "Space Pop" requires using your arms to propel you in a weightless situation. "20,000 Leaks" will stretch you out as you try to stop water from rushing in through cracked glass. All of these adventures teach players how to use their movements to control the action on the screen. The gestures will come in handy for other Kinect games. Fun with wild animals "Kinectimals" was demonstrated at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles in June, where it received high marks for its cuteness factor -- and lower marks for being, well, a little bizarre. In the game, players get to adopt a virtual pet. Among the 40 choices are a Bengal tiger, lion, panther, cheetah or leopard cub. By using voice commands and body gestures, kids can teach their cub to do tricks, feed and brush their baby animal, or just play games with it. It is definitely a game geared toward younger players. I play a lot of first-person shooter games, but I'll admit there is something neat to rubbing a tiger cub on its belly -- even if it is virtual. Full-body sports "Kinect Sports" cranks up the action with six different games at four different skill levels. From the outdoors to the table top, different sports challenge players to really get involved with the action. Full body movements mimic those that would be needed to really play the sport. Want to score a goal in soccer? Kick the ball. Want to knock out your opponent in boxing? Throw a punch. "The only skill you need is life skill," Kipman said. "If you know how to bowl, you can bowl in our game." The action and movements are lifelike and will get players moving. For example, while you won't actually have a javelin in your hand, you will need to run in place up to the line and throw. The escalating skill levels make it easy for players to learn what to do and master those actions before moving up to more challenging opponents. Wheel-free racing "Kinect Joy Ride" offers different game modes that let you race cars, do stunts or even crash into objects -- and each other. But it doesn't feel quite right because, with Kinect, there is nothing to feel. You control your car by grabbing an imaginary steering wheel. There is no accelerator or brake; the game does that for you automatically. Turning your hands left or right steers the car, but there is no tactile feedback to give you the sensation of running off the road or colliding with a light pole. This isn't a "Grand Turismo" title by any stretch of the imagination. But a racing game should have a feel to it -- this one just leaves you grasping for air. Get your body moving Two other initial titles, "Your Shape: Fitness Evolved" and "Dance Central" are where Kinect really shines. "Your Shape: Fitness Evolved" features workouts created by Men's Health and Women's Health magazines. Players are scored on how well they match the movements of instructors who demonstrate exercises.  There are Zen exercises for relaxation, or cardio boxing if you want to blow off steam in a different way. There are also personalized exercise plans to help lose weight, tone the body or get more energy. The game offers a good workout. Kinect helps correct postures and actions so users can get the most benefits out of the exercises being done. In this way, it really does work well. "Dance Central," made by the creators of "Rock Band," aims to get you moving to the beat, but realizes we all aren't ready to strut our stuff on the dance floor. The game combines today's dance hits performed by pop stars with moves that seem clunky at first but get more involved and intense as the difficulty ratchets up. Like "Guitar Hero," you have to match your movements to those on the screen to get a perfect score. Beyond games Because it has cameras, Kinect also offers the ability to connect via video with other Kinect users -- or those who use Microsoft's Live Messenger program on their PCs. It also works with the other entertainment features for the Xbox 360, such as on-demand ESPN, music from Zune.com and movies from Netflix. "It is all about your choice, your content when you want it," Kipman said. The bottom line I didn't get to test out the 11 other games that Microsoft says will use the new controller. But my experience with the initial six titles shows where Kinect will shine and where it will stumble. Games that feature full-body movement make best use of what Kinect can offer. Syncing up your movements with the movements on the screen is a lot easier and more natural with Kinect than with a normal controller. It's also hard to compare the Kinect to Sony's Move -- the two systems are like apples and oranges. I was pleasantly surprised and amused by Kinect's ability to record video while you are playing. While I was doing hurdles in "Kinect Sports'" track and field, my kitten decided to join the fun and began jumping as I jumped. Needless to say, the resulting video of us provided many laughs after the game. But games that would be better enhanced with a physical device in hand feel flat. On Kinect, they're just not up to the demands that players make from those types of games. You will probably not enjoy racing games and first-person shooter games as much with Kinect that you do with regular controllers. Right now, the Kinect can understand languages from the United States, United Kingdom, Mexico, Japan and Canada -- with more to roll out in the near future. Kipman said they will be constantly refining voice-recognition software to help the system recognize dialects in each language. Prices range from $399 for a 250GB Xbox 360 Kinect bundle to $299 for the 4GB bundle and $149 for the Kinect box by itself, without the console. Is it worth it? That may depend on whether you have kids -- and what kind of gamer you are.

 Microsoft gives up on the Kin, eyes Windows Phone 7By  Doug Gross, CNN | Filed under: Mobile   The Kin phones are geared to a younger audience, but sales have been sluggish. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Microsoft won't introduce its Kin smartphones in Europe  Company pulls plug on the teen-friendly phones amid bad sales, despite big ad campaign  Focus will shift to series of Windows 7 phones, due out by the holidays

Microsoft Windows 7

 (CNN) -- Less than two months after rolling out its Kin smartphones, Microsoft is giving up on the teen-friendly devices amid reportedly sluggish sales. The decision, even as the company was hitting TV hard with ads promoting the phones, will allow Microsoft to shift resources from the Kin team to the upcoming Windows Phone 7 series. "Microsoft has made the decision to focus on the Windows Phone 7 launch and will not ship KIN in Europe this fall as planned," said a written statement from a Microsoft spokesman.  Teaming Kin staffers with Phone 7 staffers will allow "incorporating valuable ideas and technologies from KIN into future Windows Phone releases," the statement said. "We will continue to work with Verizon in the U.S. to sell current KIN phones." Just this weekend, Verizon -- the Kin's wireless provider -- slashed prices on the two version of the phone, dropping the lower-end Kin One to $29 and the Kin Two from $99 to $49. The move demonstrates the challenges Microsoft faces in gaining traction in the rapidly growing smartphone market. While Microsoft still dominates the PC software industry, it has watched rivals Apple and Google leap ahead in the mobile category with their popular iPhone and Android operating systems. Announced on April 12, the Kin phones were designed for a "social generation." They feature a touchscreen, a built-in Zune music player, integration with social media sites like Twitter and a visual time line that lets users view social media updates from their friends on multiple sites. Content created on the phones is automatically saved and available, through cloud computing, on any Web browser. Complaints about the phone centered on the cost of its mobile contract, which rivals that of more advanced devices like the iPhone and Android. Microsoft is not releasing sales figures for the Kin, but multiple reports have said they were anemic, possibly falling short of 10,000. The iPhone 4, by contrast, sold 1.7 million units in its first three days. Microsoft's series of phones for the Windows 7 operating systems is expected out by this year's holiday season. Phones running the system will be made by companies like Qualcomm, Samsung, LG, HTC, HP, Dell, Sony Ericsson Toshiba, and Garmin-Asus, Microsoft has said.

Consumer Electronics

 (CNN) -- Microsoft's new smartphone, the Kin, is shooting for a place in the hearts -- and pockets -- of a plugged-in "social generation," the company announced Monday. From the ability to easily download photos from the Windows phone to a home screen that's constantly updated with feeds from services like Facebook and Twitter, Kin is clearly designed for young users for whom social networking is a way of life. "Self-expression is super important to them," said Robert Bach, president of Microsoft's entertainment and devices division. "What they are, what they're doing, they want to share the journey every day. It's like constantly publishing a magazine about their life." The Kin name, Bach said, is for a phone "that knits together a tight community of kindred spirits whose lives are shared and who broadcast all the time." Two phones, the Kin One and Kin Two, will be available next month in Verizon stores. Verizon will be the exclusive wireless provider in the United States, and Vodafone will be the provider internationally. No prices for the phones were announced at Microsoft's rollout event in Redmond, Washington, on Monday afternoon. The Kin One is compact with a roughly square shape, designed to fit easily in a pocket. The Kin Two has a more traditional rectangular shape and is equipped with additional features, like more memory, a high-resolution camera and the ability to shoot high-definition video. The Kin One has 4 gigabytes of memory, while Kin Two has 8. The camera is 5 megapixels in the Kin One and 8 megapixels in the Kin Two. Kin One has a 2.1-inch screen, while Kin Two's is 3.5 inches. Both phones are designed by Sharp Corp. and come with both touchscreen capability and a slide-out keyboard.  The Kins will not run the Windows Phone 7 operating system rolled out by Microsoft in February. But they will share some features, including programs to integrate search engine Bing and music-and-video site Zune. The phones, unlike Apple's iPhone, Android phones and others, will not run applications designed by outside developers. In addition to regular social-network feeds, the Kin will allow users to select "best friends" and give higher priority to any posts by the people on that list. Videos, photos, text messages and links to Web pages can be shared by clicking and dragging them to what Microsoft is calling "The Kin Spot." Their photos, videos and social-network posts will be compiled into a digital timeline, letting the user scroll back and view their posts in chronological order. And content created on the phone will be automatically saved and available, through cloud computing, an any Web browser -- making photos, videos and other content easier to save and share, according to Microsoft. Setting the tone for a product geared toward teens and 20-somethings, Microsoft began its announcement with a video featuring a rock soundtrack, quick-cut editing and a litany of hip young subjects talking about their smartphone needs.

 Microsoft Launches Outlook Facebook Integration 

By Ben Parr, Mashable.com | Filed under: Social Media   Microsoft's Outlook Social Connector syncs social networking feeds with your Outlook contacts. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Outlook Social Connector syncs social networking feeds with your Outlook contacts  New Facebook status updates will pop up in realtime within Outlook  Outlook will only pull data from e-mails connected to Facebook accounts

Computer Technology

LinkedIn Corporation

Microsoft Corporation

Microsoft Windows Live Messenger

MySpace Inc.

 (Mashable.com) -- Microsoft is announcing today that it has integrated Facebook and Windows Live Messenger into Outlook, bringing the streams of millions of Facebook users into inboxes across the world. Last year, Microsoft launched Outlook Social Connector, a plugin that syncs social networking feeds with your Outlook contacts, giving you immediate data on what they are doing and thinking. It started last year with LinkedIn integration, but soon the company announced MySpace and Facebook were coming. Today, Outlook completes the cycle with not only Facebook integration, but support for Windows Live Messenger as well. Not only that, but the company is releasing the plugin for Outlook 2003 and 2007 users as well, bringing Facebook, MySpace, LinkedIn and Windows Live Messenger to millions of business and personal inboxes worldwide. Last week, we got a sneak peek at the new Outlook at Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Washington. Here's what you can expect from the new Facebook integration, as well some features that you can expect in the near future: Facebook + Outlook = Realtime Contact Data Facebook and Microsoft worked together to get the launch of Facebook's integration in Outlook Social Connector right. Facebook's Strategic Partner Manager Rick Armbrust told us that they worked closely with the Office team to make the experience more social. One of the things he immediately highlighted was the pulling of Facebook profile pictures into Outlook. The entire experience is a step above the Outlook-LinkedIn integration, which itself was pretty strong. Not only does it pull Facebook profile photos so that you can associate a name to a face, but it pulls the news feeds of your contacts into your inbox. When you're looking at someone's e-mail, you'll also get a glance at their status updates, picture uploads and wall posts, among other activities. When you combine that with LinkedIn, MySpace, Windows Live Messenger, and Outlook data, you get a very detailed history of your interaction with your contacts, as well as an at-a-glance look at their activities and interests. Knowing that a potential client just returned from a trip to Hawaii can be all that you need to have the upper hand against your competition. Microsoft Group Product Manager Paco Contreras told us that there's another new feature to the Facebook integration: realtime updates. Thanks to a new update to the social connector platform, also being released today, updates from your contacts will automatically be pushed to your inbox. There's no need to refresh anything: new Facebook status updates will pop up in realtime within Outlook. The Facebook integration does have limitations, though: except for friend requests, Outlook can only pull data from Facebook. There is no "liking" posts or updating your status via Outlook, at least right now. Microsoft says that the next step is to provide a richer social experience by integrating the ability to push data to other social networks, improving the look and feel of Outlook Social Connector, and adding other social networks from other regions. The Social Inbox Microsoft has known for a while that social technologies are going to dominate the web. That was made evident by its $240 million stake in Facebook and its many partnerships and attempts at social media (some of which have bombed). However, Outlook Social Connector has always felt like one of the company's smarter social media plays. Facebook's Rich Armbrust probably put it best: "What's unique is that it's bringing social elements and context from Facebook form your colleagues and your friends into the Outlook experience, which is pretty unique given that there are so many that use Outlook as their primary communiction tool." E-mail isn't inherently a "social" experience (it's not a one-to-many platform), and attempts at integrating social into the inbox (think Google Buzz) have mostly fallen flat. However, social data can be incredibly useful in the business world, especially when you need to understand what your client or colleague is thinking or doing right now. While we'd still love to see Twitter integration in Outlook, Facebook is far larger and, in most cases, has far more useful information. Microsoft's also learned a few lessons from the privacy fiascos Facebook and Google have undergone in recent months. Outlook will only pull data from e-mails connected to Facebook accounts. If your business e-mail isn't linked to your Facebook, your data stream won't appear in Outlook Social Connector. It gives users a choice, although most people do choose to add their work e-mails to Facebook in order to join their company's Facebook network. If you want to learn more about the announcement, Microsoft has also released a short video articulating Outlook's new features.© 2013 MASHABLE.com. All rights reserved.

 Microsoft co-founder pledges to donate majority of fortuneBy  the CNN Wire Staff | Filed under: Web  STORY HIGHLIGHTSPaul Allen will give most of his estate to charityHe is worth an estimated $13.5 billionAllen has donated more than $1 billion over the past 20 years (CNN) -- Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen has pledged to give away most of his fortune to charity. "[M]y philanthropic efforts will continue after my lifetime," Allen said in a statement Thursday.  "I've planned for many years now that the majority of my estate will be left to philanthropy." Allen's commitment comes as two of America's richest men, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, have invited fellow billionaires to give half their wealth to charity. The unusual initiative is being promoted through the website, "The Giving Pledge," and is aimed at members of the Forbes 400 -- a list of the richest Americans. Philanthropist Eli Broad, worth an estimated $6 billion, was the first to make the promise. During his lifetime, Allen has donated more than a billion dollars through personal giving and his foundation. The 57-year-old billionaire was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in November 2009, more than 25 years after he was treated for Hodgkin's disease, a spokesman at his company Vulcan Inc. said at the time. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, like the less-common Hodgkin's disease, is a cancer of the lymphatic system. Hodgkin's lymphoma is distinguished from the other by the presence of a certain type of cell. Allen, who co-founded Microsoft with Bill Gates in the mid-1970s, was that company's chief technologist until he left in 1983, the year he was treated for Hodgkin's lymphoma, according to the website for his Paul G. Allen Family Foundations. In March, Allen ranked 37th on the Forbes list of the world's billionaires. His net worth was $13.5 billion, according to the magazine. Among Allen's business interests are the professional sports teams he owns, the NFL's Seattle Seahawks and the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers. He also is part owner of Major League Soccer's Seattle Sounders FC.

Navy taps into Microsoft's popular Flight Simulator product




January 26, 2000
 Web posted at: 10:24 a.m. EST (1524 GMT)


by Bob Brewin


 From...


 (IDG) -- Armchair jet jockeys play Microsoft Corp.'s Flight Simulator on their PCs to capture a bit of the thrill of the real thing, which replicates an actual flight experience closely enough that the Navy is making its customized version of Flight Simulator standard issue for all student naval aviators.

The Navy built a software shell that enabled it to configure Flight Simulator for its T-34C training aircraft. The new CD-ROM-based Naval Micro-Simulator Training Aid features the instrument panel from the T-34C as well as a display, which includes scenery from areas surrounding naval aviation training bases in Corpus Christi, Texas, and Pensacola, Fla. Cadets who used the Navy version of Flight Simulator in a test run this summer "had significantly higher flight scores...and fewer below average unsatisfactory flight scores," according to Scott Dunlap, head of the Assessment Project Office for the Chief of Naval Education and Training. Dunlap emphasized that the Navy views the PC-based simulator as an adjunct to, not a replacement for, more complex full-motion flight simulators. Besides student aviators, the Navy plans to issue the CD-ROM to students at the 69 colleges and universities that host Navy Reserve Officer Training Corps units. The Navy micro-simulator CD-ROM also includes a simulation of a nuclear attack submarine distributed by Electronic Arts Inc. that Dunlap said would provide submarine junior officers the ability "to think about the ship as a whole, as part of a total weapons system" rather than focusing on the narrow concerns of their specific specialties or assignments.

Microsoft issues fixes for Win2000 security holes




February 1, 2000
 Web posted at: 8:58 a.m. EST (1358 GMT)

by Douglas F. Gray


 From...



 (IDG) -- Microsoft managed to beat itself to the punch last week, issuing the first patches to fix security holes in the much delayed Windows 2000 operating system -- several weeks before its official release date.  Two security bugs were detected in Microsoft Index Server, search engine software found in both Windows NT and Windows 2000. The first could allow a malicious user to view, but not change, add or delete, files from a Web server, while the second could reveal the physical location of Web directories on the server, according to a security bulletin issued by Microsoft last week. The bulletin also said that the two glitches were unrelated except for the fact that they both were found in the Index Server.





  MESSAGE BOARD





Windows 2000



 


Windows 2000, Microsoft's new operating system for corporate users, is scheduled to be officially released on Feb. 17. Index Server is a tool designed to allow users to perform full-text, online searches via a Web browser. It was designed to search Word, PowerPoint and Excel documents as well as standard HTML (hypertext markup language) documents, according to information from Microsoft's Web site.

First Windows 2000 virus detected



 The first bug, or the Malformed Hit-Highlighting Argument "vulnerability," as Microsoft calls it, allows users to request information beyond their security access via a specific type of malformed request.  "It's highly possible that someone could take advantage of the vulnerability," said David Litchfield, security analyst at U.K.-based Cerberus Information Security, who originally spotted the bug. "But it depends on what the ultimate end of the attacker is," he noted. "If he's trying to look for sensitive files on the Web server. . . or view the source of active server pages, he can do that."  Microsoft's patch, which he has installed on his system, does eliminate the problem, Litchfield said.  More information regarding both security bugs, including the patches, can be found at Microsoft's homepage.

Microsoft issues fixes for Win2000 security holes




February 1, 2000
 Web posted at: 8:58 a.m. EST (1358 GMT)

by Douglas F. Gray


 From...



 (IDG) -- Microsoft managed to beat itself to the punch last week, issuing the first patches to fix security holes in the much delayed Windows 2000 operating system -- several weeks before its official release date.  Two security bugs were detected in Microsoft Index Server, search engine software found in both Windows NT and Windows 2000. The first could allow a malicious user to view, but not change, add or delete, files from a Web server, while the second could reveal the physical location of Web directories on the server, according to a security bulletin issued by Microsoft last week. The bulletin also said that the two glitches were unrelated except for the fact that they both were found in the Index Server.





  MESSAGE BOARD





Windows 2000



 


Windows 2000, Microsoft's new operating system for corporate users, is scheduled to be officially released on Feb. 17. Index Server is a tool designed to allow users to perform full-text, online searches via a Web browser. It was designed to search Word, PowerPoint and Excel documents as well as standard HTML (hypertext markup language) documents, according to information from Microsoft's Web site.

 The first bug, or the Malformed Hit-Highlighting Argument "vulnerability," as Microsoft calls it, allows users to request information beyond their security access via a specific type of malformed request.  "It's highly possible that someone could take advantage of the vulnerability," said David Litchfield, security analyst at U.K.-based Cerberus Information Security, who originally spotted the bug. "But it depends on what the ultimate end of the attacker is," he noted. "If he's trying to look for sensitive files on the Web server. . . or view the source of active server pages, he can do that."  Microsoft's patch, which he has installed on his system, does eliminate the problem, Litchfield said.  More information regarding both security bugs, including the patches, can be found at Microsoft's homepage.

Microsoft's fortune rides on Windows 2000, analysts say





February 8, 2000
 Web posted at: 8:43 a.m. EST (1343 GMT)

by James Niccolai
 (IDG) -- With the launch of its Windows 2000 operating system on Feb. 17, Microsoft will try to move up the software food chain by beginning its assault on the lucrative midrange server business. At stake for the company will be its ability to keep growing at the fairytale rate it has enjoyed for the past half decade, industry analysts said. The new OS will also play a key role in determining whether Microsoft retains its dominant role in the computing industry in the years to come, analysts said. As the focus of IT computing shifts from local networks to the Internet, Microsoft will try to hawk Windows 2000 as a reliable platform on which companies can build e-commerce sites and other types of Web-based applications and services.

Computerworld Minute


"Windows 2000 is an operating system that is so critical for the overall success of Microsoft that it is hard to state it strongly enough," said Daniel Kusnetzky, a program director with research firm International Data Corp. (IDC) in Framingham, Mass., echoing an opinion expressed by several analysts. Since it launched Windows NT 4.0 in 1996, Microsoft has bulldozed aside competitors in the departmental server business -- most notably Novell and IBM -- to help it report financial results that have wowed investors and sent its stock price soaring. The software vendor shipped more than 2 million copies of Windows NT in 1999, up almost 400,000 from 1998, to give it the lion's share of new server OS unit shipments, according to recent figures from IDC.  But its rate of growth in the server OS market, while still strong, is tapering out, analysts said. Because Microsoft already owns such a large slice of the market for file, print and other low-end types of server, achieving the giant percentage gains it has enjoyed in previous years has become almost impossible.  "Microsoft has gotten to a size where it's almost impossible to outgrow the market," Kusnetzky said. "The surprising 60 to 70 percent growth period is over." Microsoft could reverse that trend by selling its new OS in the type of midrange servers used to manage thousands of PC clients, run massive databases and serve up busy e-commerce Web sites. Currently dominated by Unix vendors like Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard, the midrange market promises higher returns on sales and is one that Microsoft has long coveted. Issues of scalability, however, not to mention highly-publicized concerns over the stability of Windows NT, have kept the software vendor for the most part locked out. With Windows 2000 Microsoft hopes to change that. The company claims that the millions of dollars and years of work hours it has invested in the product have produced an OS that is reliable, scalable, manageable and secure enough for demanding enterprise applications. It points to success stories like Dell -- a close ally of Microsoft -- which uses Windows NT to conduct millions of dollars' worth of business through its online store, as proof that its software is reliable. Microsoft is already using Windows 2000 on 300 servers that run its heavily trafficked Web site, as are a few early adopters like Barnes & Noble. Analysts said feedback from Windows 2000 beta testers has been favorable, once they became accustomed to its differences from NT. "Windows 2000 brings a lot of technology to the table. It looks a lot more stable and reliable than Windows NT, and that's the biggest thing Microsoft has going for it," said Al Gillen, a research manager with IDC. "After six years of development it ought to be ready by now," said Laura DiDio, a senior analyst with Giga Information Group. The experiences of beta testers may tell only part of the story, however. Winning in the data center will require Microsoft to create software that performs at its best heterogeneous environments, and that means high levels of interoperability -- something the company hasn't exactly excelled at, analysts said. And where Windows software dominated many LAN environments, Microsoft will need to accept a diminished role if it wants to play in the enterprise computing room.  "Their challenge is to become a good corporate citizen, which means not always being the star of the show but being a supporting player," IDC's Kusnetzky said. "That might mean sometimes standing under the spotlight; at other times it means taking a seat in the orchestra pit." Delivering products in a timely fashion will be another factor. Microsoft originally said it would deliver Windows 2000, formerly called Windows NT 5.0, back in 1997. The version of Windows 2000 aimed at higher-performance servers, called Windows 2000 DataCenter, isn't due to ship until mid-year. This month three versions of the OS will debut: Windows 2000 Professional, the desktop client; Windows 2000 Server; and Windows 2000 Advanced Server. The company has hyped its operating system so much that expectations are sky high, and after numerous delays Microsoft may get only one chance to prove itself, analysts said. IT managers responsible for choosing the critical server environments that keep their businesses up and running won't look kindly on teething problems, and a string of early, publicized failures could cause a major setback. "Unless Microsoft can prove that Windows 2000 is all of those things -- highly interoperable, consistent and reliable -- they can damage themselves and lock themselves out of the computer room for the next decade," Kusnetzky said. Continuing Microsoft's financial success isn't the only thing that makes Windows 2000 a vital release for the company. In a computing environment that has changed rapidly since the release of NT, in which the Internet, electronic commerce and Web-based services look set to predominate, Windows 2000 will be key to helping Microsoft expand its sphere of influence and remain a dominant player in IT computing, analysts said.  Microsoft last month unveiled an initiative called Next Generation Windows Services. Along with Windows DNA 2000, NGWS aims to provide software and tools that allow companies to build new types of services for e-commerce and accessing information and services over the Web. Microsoft hasn't provided specifics about NGWS, but technologies in Windows 2000 are likely to be wedded closely to the new initiative, said Larry Perlstein, a research director with Dataquest in San Jose, Calif.  New members in Microsoft's BackOffice family due later this year, including SQL Server 2000 and Exchange 2000, are also closely tied to features in Windows 2000, in particular a new directory services feature called Active Directory. Such close ties between Windows 2000 and other products in the pipeline intensify the pressure to make Windows 2000 a success, said Carl Howe, a senior analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., who sees Windows 2000 as "the future of the company." Microsoft could have picked a quieter year to release its new OS. It will face several distractions over the next 12 months, including its ongoing Java lawsuit with Sun, not to mention any fall-out it may incur from the U.S. government's antitrust action. At the same time, while it tries to break new ground at the high end of the market, it faces a potential rival at the low end in the form of Linux. Analysts interviewed for this story were unanimous that Microsoft's position isn't likely to be eroded in the near term. While customers won't jump to its new operating system overnight, many expect to upgrade their desktop and server NT environments quickly starting at the end of the year, and demand for the company's software at the departmental level will continue to grow at a healthy clip, Giga's DiDio said. "The anticipation and the pent up demand for this product is tremendous," she said. The jury is still out, however, on its ambitions at the high end of the market and its efforts to become a leader in providing software and services for new types of Web-based applications. Microsoft has deep pockets and a giant pool of programming talent and has shown a deft ability in the past for identifying new markets and moving into them, Dataquest's Perlstein noted. IDC's Kusnetzky was more cautious. "Microsoft has presented a grand vision that is so all-encompassing it will be very hard for any software product to live up to it," he said. "It's going to be a significant challenge."

Microsoft CEO says Internet is backward


 From...



March 16, 2000
 Web posted at: 8:07 a.m. EST (1307 GMT)

by Michael Vizard
 (IDG) -- Returning to the venue where he launched his Microsoft career 21 years ago, company president and CEO Steve Ballmer on Tuesday told a gathering of industry executives that the Internet is 100 percent backward from the way it will be 10 years from now. 


  MESSAGE BOARD





Microsoft



 


 Speaking at the PC Forum conference, Ballmer said the Internet now is in the control of Web site producers, rather than in the control of end-users. To change that paradigm, Microsoft will evolve as a company to deliver client software that is tightly integrated with Web services.
"Web sites and clients will integrate with intelligence in both places," Ballmer said.

 This level of integration, he said, will raise new questions about what the definition of an operating system is when Web services need to span clients and servers.   "It's not clear where the business boundaries are in the new economy," Ballmer said. "But at the end of the day it has to be about making sure there are opportunities for us and our partners."   Microsoft will spend more than $4 billion on research and development this year, much of which will be focused on developing "megaservices" that will make it easier for end users to control exactly what content they want to access from any number of Web sites.   "The goal here is to make it easy for users to create their own 'myWorld' on the Internet," Ballmer said. "There is huge change yet to come and there is still a lot of hard R&D work that needs to be done."

Report: Microsoft hack a U.S. security risk


 From...






by Dan Verton 

(IDG) -- Although Microsoft Corp. has denied that the hacker who penetrated its network in October gained access to any of the company's source code, a recent report by a Washington-based think tank is warning that the compromise may hold grave national security implications. 


In a report released this month titled "Cyber Threats and Information Security: Meeting the 21st Century Challenge," the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) concluded that the government and the private sector should be concerned about the "trustworthiness" of future Microsoft products in the aftermath of the hack into the company's network. Former Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre, a longtime cybersecurity proponent in the defense and intelligence communities, heads the CSIS.




  MESSAGE BOARD





Security on the Net



 




"It is doubtful that the millions (sometimes billions) of lines of code required to power Microsoft's products could readily be sanitized," the CSIS report states. "With most military and government systems powered by Microsoft software and more generally reliant on [commercial, off-the-shelf systems], this recent development can pose grave national-security-related concerns," the 73-page report concludes. 


Microsoft, however, strongly disagrees with the analysis.

"The CSIS quote sensationalizes the incident and misstates the facts in a number of important ways," a Microsoft spokesman said. "Most important, Microsoft has repeatedly stated that after tracking the intruders and investigating their activities, there is no evidence and no basis to believe that they had any access at all to Windows or Office source code. That is, we have no reason to believe that the intruders were able to see Windows or Office source code, much less modify it. Microsoft's current and future products remain intact and secure, and customers can use them with confidence."


Microsoft security personnel discovered the hack in October when they noticed that passwords were being remotely sent to an e-mail account in Russia. The hackers then posed as Microsoft employees working off-site rather than at the company's Redmond, Wash., headquarters to gain access to sensitive areas within Microsoft's internal network (see "Microsoft stung by hack attack," link below).


Government systems aren't the only ones at risk, according to CSIS. "Whoever stole proprietary secrets at the heart of the ubiquitous Windows program can hack into any PC in the world that uses it and is connected to the Internet," the report states. Such security concerns could hold serious implications for the dozens of private-sector companies that own and operate the nation's critical infrastructure.


Although initial reports alluded to the possibility that the hacker may have gained access to the source code of some of the company's future products, including Windows Me, Windows 2000 and Office, a Microsoft spokeswoman said that no source code was compromised or stolen and that every possible step has been taken to ensure the integrity of the code for future users.

Microsoft delays deadline for new licensing program




 From...




July 6, 2001
 Web posted at: 4:50 p.m. EDT (2050 GMT)
























By John Fontana

 (IDG) -- After howls of protests and threats of platform defections from user organizations, Microsoft has pushed back the deadlines for enrollment to its new licensing program by five months so enterprises can build the cost of the program into next year's budget cycles.


The news will come as a welcome relief to IT executives who were scrambling to figure out how to pay for the new program, called Software Assurance, which will replace all of Microsoft's upgrade options.



The original Oct. 1 deadline for enrollment in Software Assurance will now be extended to February 28, 2002.



However, the move does not mean Microsoft is abandoning the new licensing model, which has been criticized as a vehicle to resuscitate flat revenues over the past year in the Redmond giant's desktop application division and provide a buffer as more applications move to the Web.



"Microsoft is saying 'we made a mistake,'" says Chris LeTocq, principal analyst with Guernsey Research. "They listened to IT executives."



Those executives were saying they could not afford the new licensing model this year.

Some enterprises were looking at as much as a $5 million fee to get all their software in line with the program, which will still officially kick-off on Oct. 1.



Under the program, enterprises don't need to actually deploy the software, but they must have the license.



"Never in my career have I seen the customer base so angry at Microsoft," says Rob Enderle, an analyst with the Giga Information Group. "They were calling Microsoft things you wouldn't want your family to hear." Now, Enderle says, "users won't have to do anything draconian" under the pressure of Software Assurance. "There is less of a panic, but I suspect that customers won't soon forget this."



Microsoft admitted it heard IT executives loud and clear. The decision comes just a week after the company responded to industry complaints and pulled its Smart Tags feature from the upcoming version of Windows XP.



"There has been a lot of interest in Software Assurance, but customers have said they want more time to plan and budget," says Simon Hughes, program manager for worldwide licensing and pricing at Microsoft. "Our response has been to extend the transition period."



Microsoft intended to formally announce the news last Thursday, but the ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals in the company's antitrust trial scrubbed that effort.



Under the new deadlines, Open and Select volume-licensing customers can get their non-current licenses in line with Software Assurance by purchasing Upgrade Advantage before March 1, 2002. If companies make that move before October 1, 2001, they can get up to two years additional coverage under Upgrade Advantage.



Upgrade Advantage, the upgrade option for Open and Select customers that Software Assurance replaces, gives enterprises the rights to the current version of software. That is important because users must be on current versions of Microsoft software to be eligible for Software Assurance.



For example, a user on a version of Office older than Office XP gets the rights to Office XP and up to two years of upgrade coverage and a path to move into Software Assurance.



At the end of the Upgrade Advantage cycle, however, enterprises still have to buy into Software Assurance, which is priced at 29 percent of the full-retail price of the licensed software. For example, a $368 Office license would carry nearly a $107 fee for Software Assurance.



Those same Open and Select customers can enroll their current licenses, such as Windows 2000 Professional, Office XP and .Net Enterprise Servers, for the same 29% fee in Software Assurance between October 1 and February 28, 2002. The original deadline was January 31, 2002.



In addition, Enterprise Agreement and Subscription options for customers with more than 250 PCs will be available from October 1 and include Software Assurance.



The protests over Software Assurance arose because the program and the 2001 deadline to enroll were announced after enterprises had set budgets for this year. That meant enterprises likely had to either raid existing budgets or trim workforce to enroll.



For example, enterprises contemplating an upgrade after the October 1 deadline to the recently released Office XP faced the prospect of spending as much as $300 more per user to purchase new licenses for the suite of software. Those costs were about double the fee it would cost the same user to upgrade before the October 1 deadline.



Software Assurance was announced in May and requires enterprises to maintain current licenses for software.



Critics say the program is a response to customers that have not been upgrading to new versions of software, most notably Office, and a way for Microsoft to rectify that loss in licensing revenue. Microsoft has reported nearly $7 billion in revenue in the past three quarters this year for its desktop applications division, roughly equal to the same three quarters last year. The revenue accounts for 37 percent of its business, so that means 37 percent of Microsoft revenue has not grown over the past year.



Microsoft contends the changes are being made to simplify the alphabet soup of upgrade options. The company claims that organizations that upgrade on cycles of three years or less will see a reduction or no change in licensing costs.



A study by Guernsey Research shows that enterprises on a two-year upgrade cycle will save 19 percent in licensing costs, but that enterprises on a three-year cycle will see a 40 percent increase in costs.

SAN FRANCISCO, California (Reuters) -- Computer security experts say the recent "SQL Slammer" worm, the worst in more than a year, is evidence that Microsoft's year-old security push is not working.


"Trustworthy Computing is failing," Russ Cooper of TruSecure Corp. said of the Microsoft initiative. "I gave it a 'D-minus' at the beginning of the year, and now I'd give it an 'F."'


The worm, which exploited a known vulnerability in Microsoft's SQL Server database software, spread through network connections beginning January 25, crashing servers and clogging the Internet.

Public reminded of risks

It hit a year and one week after Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates sent a company-wide e-mail saying Microsoft would make boosting security of its software a top priority.


Microsoft placed responsibility on computer users who failed to install a patch that had been available since at least last June.


"The single largest message is: keep your system up to date with patches," Microsoft Chief Security Officer Scott Charney said.


But the philosophy of patching is fundamentally flawed and leaves people vulnerable, Cooper said. For example, Microsoft didn't follow its own advice as executives confirmed that an internal network was hit by the worm.


"Microsoft was completely hosed (from Slammer). It took them two days to get out from under it," said Bruce Schneier, chief technology officer of Counterpane Internet Security, a network monitoring service provider. "It's as hypocritical as you can get."

Fix could have nullified problems

"We should have done a better job" in protecting the company's own network, Mike Nash, corporate vice president of Microsoft's security business unit, said. "We understood some things customers were facing and it, in some ways, helped us. It was a learning course."


There was another misstep on Microsoft's part that illustrates the problems with patches, Cooper said.


In October Microsoft released a fix for a different SQL Server problem that if installed in the expected manner would have made patched systems vulnerable again, he said. "If I followed their advice I'd have been vulnerable."


Microsoft spokesman Rick Miller said administrators were given the option with the fix to install it so the patch was intact. He also said he knew of no customers who installed the fix and were still hit by the worm.

Implementing fix proves complex

But, most people installing the fix would not necessarily have known how to install it in a safe way, Cooper countered.


Microsoft released a service pack that would have fixed the problems the week before Slammer hit. But not only are there too many patches to keep up with, people are reluctant to install them for fear they will interfere with their systems.


Microsoft admits making a mistake with the SQL fix and has "egg on our face" over being hit by the worm, Miller said.


"What this demonstrates and what we readily acknowledge is the patch management process is too complex," he said. "Microsoft is committed to reorganizing our patch system and delivering high-quality patches in a streamlined way."

Demanding better products

Nash defended the Trustworthy Computing initiative, saying the company's security process and culture have changed. For instance, all Windows developers have received special security training, he said.


However, the fruits of that may not show up until future versions of products are released, said Richard M. Smith, a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based computer security consultant. "I'd rather they focus on the problems we have today."


"The problem is the whole patch regime has lots and lots of problems," he said. "It would be much better if the software shipped from Microsoft with fewer problems to begin with."


The solution: install patches, along with firewalls and other security software and services, as well as demand better products from Microsoft, the experts said.

Thinking of switching

In the meantime, Schneier said he was thinking of switching from Windows to the Macintosh platform because of all the security issues. "My wife has a Mac and she doesn't worry about viruses, trojans, leaks..., " he said.


A Consumer Reports survey last year found that virus infection rates on Macs are half what they are on Windows, noted Smith. "Is that because Macs are safer? I think the answer is yeah."

  Google vs. Microsoft: What you need to knowStory Highlights The escalating Google vs. Micosoft battle is mostly over who'll be King of Tech  Top execs at each company dream of ways to steal the others' pots of gold  Chrome OS will compete with Windows, while Office 10 will include free online versions  Here's how the two tech giants stack up in four key areas of competition Next Article in Technology »   By Ryan Singel 



 


 

  (WIRED) -- In less than a week, Google announced an operating system to compete with Windows, while Microsoft announced that Office 10 will include free, online versions of its four most popular software programs -- a shot at Google's suite of web-based office applications. 
The fight between Microsoft and Google is over who'll be seen as the world's most important tech company. 
 And not more than a month and a half ago, Microsoft unveiled its new search engine Bing, which it hopes will steal market share from Google and finally make it real money online. From the news of it, it's a full-blown tech battle, complete with behind-the-scenes machinations to sic government regulators on each other. It is, however, not a death match -- it's more of an fight to see who will be the King of Technology, since both companies pull in their billions through completely different siphons and are unlikely to severely wound one another any time soon. Google pulled in $22 billion in revenue in 2008, 97 percent of which came tiny text ads bought by the keyword and placed next to search results or on pages around the web. Google makes a negligible amount of money bundling its online apps for businesses, charging $50 a head annually -- but mostly it just gives its online text editor, email and spreadsheet programs away. By contrast, Microsoft sold $14.3 billion worth of Microsoft Word and PowerPoint and other business applications over the last nine months, making a profit of $9.3 billion. It made a further $16 billion in revenue in 2008 through sales of its operating systems, which range from XP installations on netbooks, to Vista, to Windows Mobile to its server software. Google now plans its own range of operating systems, starting with Android, an open-source OS for small devices like smartphones, and Chrome OS, a browser-focused, open-source OS that will run on notebooks and desktops.

 Clearly top executives at each company look over at the others' pots of gold and dream of ways to steal them, or at least make it harder for the other guy to make money. In fact, they even dislike each other enough to spend money to make the other one lose revenue -- take for example, Microsoft's behind-the-scenes campaign to scuttle last year's proposed Google-Yahoo advertising deal or its ongoing attempts to derail the Google Book Search settlement. But in reality, the competition is really about creating universes or ecosystems that it hopes consumers will want to live their technology lives inside. And it's about ego -- a fight to be recognized as the world's most important technology company. Microsoft would love for everyone in the world to be using its Internet Explorer browser to search through Bing to find a story from its MSN portal to email via Hotmail or Outlook to a friend. Add in a smartphone running Windows Mobile and an Xbox in the living room for the kids, and you have a Microsoft family. And though it is much joked about, Microsoft is the dominant platform for software developers of all types, whether they are making small business software, massive online role-playing games or photo-editing utilities. Google's ecosystem looks different. It starts with a Google Chrome browser (oddly running only on Windows) with a default homepage set to Google News or a customized Google homepage. From there you might go to Gmail and then click on a Word document sent to you as an attachment which Google will quickly -- and safely -- open for you in its online word processor. But most importantly, Google wants you to search and travel around the web, hitting web pages that run Google-served ads and Google tracking cookies. You might think that Google is a really cool company to give away all this free technology, while never thinking about the persistent and silent data collection Google is undertaking to profile you in order to deliver you to advertisers for a premium. So how do the two stack up in four key areas of competition? Browsers: Internet Explorer in all its variations still retains close to 70 percent of the market (depending on who is counting and how). That dominance remains, even though Microsoft's latest offering IE8 lags behind all the other major browsers in features and advanced web capabilities. Firefox, Opera, and Apple's Safari have all driven browser innovation over the last five years, but most people have not been convinced to leave IE behind, despite other alternatives being safer and more advanced. Why does it matter? Well, IE installations come with a default home page, don't they? Google's Chrome browser, on the other hand, is a handsome, whiz-kid of a browser. It's sleek and nimble, and it revolutionizes how tabs are handled. The address bar is the search box (Google as default, naturally). Each website opened runs as its own browser instance and has very low permissions to read and write to files. The sandboxing of tabs means that if a single website hangs or crashes, the rest are unaffected. Meanwhile, lower permissions make it harder for a hacker to bust into your computer through your browser. Chrome also has less than 2 percent of the browser market share. Online Search: Google's name now means search to most users. Google's search engine means money to Google. In June, it delivered 78.5 percent of search results pages delivered to U.S. web users. In the first three months of 2009, Google pulled in $5.2 billion in revenue, a majority of which came from AdWords, an auction-based service that triggers ads based on the keywords in a search query. Microsoft recently debuted Bing, a new search engine it hoped would fare well in comparison to Google. It's got some fine innovations, and shows the company is thinking very hard about better ways to present information to users by finding ways to synthesize data, rather than just retrieving links. Still, despite these improvements, a $100 million ad campaign, and generous press coverage that treats Bing like an underdog, Bing gained only a point in June to get Microsoft 8.2 percent of all searches. Operating Systems: Microsoft has been making operating systems since 1979 and has spent 28 years perfecting MS-DOS and Windows NT, the frameworks that Windows have been built around. Microsoft is estimated to run on about 90 percent of all laptops and desktops in the world. By copying its competitors' best features, leveraging questionable licensing arrangements and using its base of accustomed users to buy it time against innovators, Microsoft has held on to its lead in the OS market for almost 30 years. That's despite challenges from Digital Research, Apple and IBM. Microsoft's newest version, Windows 7, will be available in the fall. Early reviews say the OS boots quickly and sleeps fast, and avoids much of the confusing interface decisions that have made many dislike Vista, the successor to Windows XP. Microsoft also dominates in the business world, where nearly every medium to large company standardizes around Microsoft Office. Microsoft is also at work on version 6 of its operating system for handheld devices, which it first launched in 2000. Its OS advantages are immense. It has millions of users who know nothing else and who like Windows. There are millions who are attached to games or the thousands of desktop apps that are only available on Windows. Thousands of devices just plug in and work on its hardware. And familiarity with Microsoft software is a requirement for a huge number of office jobs. By contrast, Google first stepped into the OS game in 2007 when it announced its Android operating system for small devices. Google estimates that some 18 phone models will be running its system by the end of the year. Last week, Google announced, but did not show off, a new OS to compete with Windows, dubbing it Chrome OS. That name signifies that Google's OS will be for the web and browser-based. It hopes to convince developers to write software that runs inside a browser, instead of on top of the OS as developers for Windows and Apples' OS X do. It will also let web developers extend the power of their websites by expanding the capabilities of the browser, allowing websites to lean on the browser for storage and processing help. Advertising: Google is largely powered by its innovative auction-based text ads on its own site, but then expanded into serving ads on other people's sites with the Adsense program. It bought the ad-serving and behavioral-profiling giant Doubleclick in 2007 for more than $3 billion, and has ventured into mobile, print, radio and television ads. Microsoft has struggled to replicate Google's online advertising success. Despite owning MSN.com -- a portal that is second only to Yahoo as a destination -- Microsoft has not made money on the internet. To turbocharge its ad-delivery technology, it paid more than $6 billion in cash in 2007 for aQuantive, a full-service online advertising concern. Instead, Microsoft's online ad business lost $1.2 billion in 2008, double what it lost in 2007. The company expects 2009 revenues to be higher than the $3.2 billion it took in last year, but has not said it would make a profit. Contrary to what some might have you believe, the benefits of the Google-Microsoft competition are immense. Microsoft had largely grown complacent until Google came along to shake up categories. Gmail's massive online storage capability and fancy programming made Microsoft hustle to upgrade its popular, though not user-friendly, web e-mail service. Google Maps led to Microsoft's Live Maps, which now bests Google's efforts in some ways. Google has been winning the fight for the last few years, showing that it is still nimbler than the software giant from the Northwest. But the pendulum may be slowing, or even poised to swing the other way. With the innovations in Bing and the promise that Microsoft's online Office offerings will be free and more fully featured than the Google equivalent, Microsoft is taking on Google where it matters for users: on the field of innovation. And that will make for an interesting race, no matter which horse you prefer to ride.

Analysis: Microsoft wants some of Google's good thing - CNN.com 



















 

  





  













  Analysis: Microsoft wants some of Google's good thingStory Highlights Deal with Yahoo gives Microsoft a greater share of search market  Combined, Microsoft and Yahoo are better poised to take on Google   Yahoo has effectively outsourced its search operation   Google also is challenging Microsoft on its own turf: operating systemsNext Article in Technology »  Read VIDEO  By Steve Mollman For CNN 



 


 

  (CNN) -- Microsoft knows a good thing when it sees it. And what Google has going on with its search advertising business is a good thing -- which, of course, is why Microsoft wants a bigger piece of it. 
Combined, Microsoft and Yahoo will try to erode Google's dominance in search. 
 To that end, it struck a deal Wednesday to power the searches on Yahoo's various properties. The deal will increase the market share of Microsoft's search platform, Bing. The boost will help. In June, according to estimates from comScore, Microsoft's share in the U.S. search engine market was 8.4 percent, and Yahoo's was 19.6 percent, compared to 65 percent for Google.   So Bing will soon have close to a 30 percent market share, making it a stronger alternative to Google, and Microsoft will move closer to enjoying the "self-reinforcing, positive feedback loop" that has powered Google's rise to dominance.  Watch more on search engines » That loop, as described by Gartner analyst Neil MacDonald, is essentially what the software giant is after. It works like this: the more people use the search service, the more advertisers are willing to pay because more people are using it. And the more paying advertisers there are using the service, the better and more relevant the ads that come up.   Plus, the more the search engine is used, the better it becomes, thanks to contextual learning algorithms. Business 360: Contending Google's throne As for Yahoo, its stock took a hit after the announcement and many observers predicted the deal was the beginning of the end for the firm.

Microsoft, Yahoo strike deal to take on Google


Google eyes Microsoft's stronghold


   Jason Calacanis, CEO of the human-powered search engine Mahalo, wrote a blog posting entitled "Yahoo committed seppuku today." "The once proud warrior of the Internet space laid down its sword, knelt at the feet of Microsoft and gutted itself today," wrote Calacanis. But not everyone sees it that way. MacDonald sees a "very focused, smart deal" on both sides. Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz was astute, he says, in realizing that the company was about a "collection of media properties and the experience the user has," and that "you don't have to own search to make that experience compelling."   Yahoo will not receive an up front payment from Microsoft as part of the deal. Instead, it will receive 88 percent of search revenue generated via its sites during the first five years of agreement, according to yesterday's announcement. The company estimates that the agreement will add about $275 million annually to its operating cash flow and that it will be able to save about $200 million by basically outsourcing search. Search data will be shared between the two companies. They will continue to compete in other areas, including e-mail, instant messaging, and display advertising ("coopetition" like this is fairly common in both media and technology fields, notes MacDonald). Google isn't sitting still while Microsoft moves in on its territory. It's working on a Chrome operating system, slated to come out next year, that will compete with Microsoft's Windows. And its suite of online applications already puts up a fight against the Office juggernaut. Of course that's a feeble fight at the moment, but then so is Microsoft's fight in the search arena. One or both of these fights might become less lopsided over time, but we'll have to wait and see. For now Google and Microsoft have seemingly insurmountable leads in their respective strongholds. Not addressed in the deal is the challenge presented by the growth of real-time search -- Twitter being a perfect example -- which can make both Google and Bing look downright outdated in certain cases. For instance by typing #Bing into Twitter you can see what people around the world have been saying and sharing about this deal in the past 5 seconds. Meanwhile the ever growing juggernaut of Facebook also challenges the central place held by Google -- and by Bing, if Microsoft has its way. These search engines use impersonal algorithms to draw an atlas of the Web, but Facebook wants users to get their information about the world through their filter of friends and colleagues -- just as in real life. When a Facebook user taps his or her "social graph" to find the best dentist, they never leave the world of Facebook -- and Google and Bing are left out in the cold. And Facebook has far more details on its users, who use their real names. 





 Microsoft, at least, is an investor in Facebook, thanks to a deal struck a few years ago. Google, much to its chagrin, is not. But it is, clearly, right in Microsoft's sights.

  Microsoft researcher converts his brain into 'e-memory'Story Highlights Microsoft researcher Gordon Bell argues we will soon have searchable memories  Bell details his ideas in a new co-authored book called "Total Recall"  Bell has been recording almost every detail of his life digitally for a decadeNext Article in Technology »   By  John D. Sutter CNN 



 


 

  (CNN) -- For the past decade, Microsoft researcher Gordon Bell has been moving the data from his brain onto computers -- where he knows it will be safe. 

Gordon Bell wearing a SenseCam, which automatically records photos throughout the day. 


 Sure, you could say all of us do this to some extent. We save digital pictures from family events and keep tons of e-mail.    But Bell, who is 75 years old, takes the idea of digital memory to a sci-fi-esque extreme. He carries around video equipment, cameras and audio recorders to capture his conversations, commutes, trips and experiences. Microsoft is working on a SenseCam that would hang around a person's neck and automatically capture every detail of life in photo form. Bell has given that a whirl. He also saves everything -- from restaurant receipts (he takes pictures of them) to correspondence, bills and medical records. He makes PDF files out of every Web page he views. In sum, this mountain of data -- more than 350 gigabytes worth, not including the streaming audio and video -- is a replica of Bell's biological memory. It's actually better, he says, because, if you back up your data in enough places, this digitized "e-memory" never forgets. It's like having a multimedia transcript of your life. By about 2020, he says, our entire life histories will be online and searchable. Location-aware smartphones and inexpensive digital memory storage in the "cloud" of the Internet make the transition possible and inevitable. No one will have to fret about storing the details of their lives in their heads anymore. We'll have computers for that. And this revolution will "change what it means to be human," he writes.

'Total Recall' site


Microsoft's SenseCam


   Bell, who, along with fellow researcher Jim Gemmell, is the author of a new book called "Total Recall," talked with CNN about the advantages and drawbacks of recording one's life in painstaking digital detail. The following is an edited transcript. CNN: What have you learned about yourself through this process? That's been a really hard question to answer. ... The main driver of the recall turns out to be a [computer] screensaver or something where I go looking for [a digital memory] and I find something else. I guess it's the rich set of connections and people that I've been involved with. CNN: What do you use to record your memories? In a way, most of what happens during the day is sort of routine -- what you've done before. So I carry the SenseCam only when I think there's an episode or a sequence or a certain set of events that I want to capture and have automatically photographed. But I tend to always carry a camera with me. I live next to a fire station and I've got lots of photos of the hook and ladder coming out of the house. And I like food so I tend to photograph wonderfully presented food all the time. To me those are very pleasant memories.  CNN: If we rely on computers instead of our brains, will humans become mentally sluggish? That's certainly one of the concerns. I tend to counter that theory. To me, I feel a lot freer. In a way I feel like I still remember all that stuff, but I generally remember that [the computer is] remembering something for me so I can find it.  People have no memory of phone numbers now because of the cell phone -- their address book is in a cell phone. So I don't think they're getting any worse or any less facile about that. What an e-memory does, to me, is gives me a really wonderful free feeling.  CNN: If we all record audio of our lives, do you think conversations will become stilted and fake? I think there will be a lot of court cases and lawyering around all of that. I'm personally less hung up about that. Certainly, people my age and Baby Boomers are. But the current X-Generation, [they think] this is pretty natural. CNN: Are you on Facebook and Twitter? Yeah, I'm on Facebook and Twitter and occasionally I will tweet something. Somehow my problem is that I don't think I have anything interesting to tweet about. CNN: Should all of our memories and observations be public? Absolutely not. Our own memories are our own private thing, and how much you choose to have on Facebook or blogs, that's your thing. CNN: What does your family think about your effort to record everything? Gradually, everybody is getting this idea. ... Think of it: You are a librarian for your life. Somebody has to be the family librarian. CNN: Are you worried about losing your memory? ... Forgetting is not a feature, it's a flaw. I don't think forgetting is an important feature of human memory. I think it's important to be able to remember things accurately. CNN: Are there any memories you deleted? No. When we were scanning stuff I had written a memo about a company, an unpleasant company -- probably the only company I was ever ashamed to be a part of. ...  I put a note on that file that said, "Don't ever scan or copy this!" My assistant who was doing the scanning ran across this and said, "What do you want me to do with this?" And I said, "Well, gee. This is my life." I said, "It's OK, just go ahead." So it's all there. CNN: Do you think it's possible for people to turn away from new technologies? Or are advances like "Total Recall" inevitable?  I think it's inevitable because so much content is being created. Virtually everything is coming in digitally -- everything from your photos to your videos to your music. ... I will love that day when the world is just bits. It's the ultimate in green, by the way.

 A vision of computing from Microsoft's future thinkerBy  Kevin Voigt, CNN   The future of computersSTORY HIGHLIGHTSCraig Mundie, Chief Research and Strategy Officer for Microsoft has an ambitious vision for computing Suggests that in a few years computers will be at least 50 times as powerful as today Told CNN that in the next decade more natural interface with computers will be commonplaceCloud computing will allow wider range of computing possibilities   Singapore (CNN) -- In the next 10 years, the way people interact with computers will wildly change. Hand gestures will be as common as the click of a keyboard, and an assortment of documents will be selected not with a mouse, but with a scan of the eye.   "Today, most people's interaction is through a screen -- whether they touch it, type it, point or click, it's still just graphical user interface," says Craig Mundie, chief research and strategy officer of Microsoft.  "While that's very powerful and has a lot of applicability, I think it will be supplemented in dramatic ways by what we call a natural user interface," Mundie said in an interview with CNN on the sidelines of November's Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation CEO summit in Singapore.  Mundie sat with CNN to discuss his vision of what computing will look and feel like in the decade to come. Much like Nintendo's Wii and Sony Playstation 3 are adding physical interactivity to game play, Mundie believes the next decade will see a revolution in the way people physically use computers. "This will be the ultimate aggregation of the ability of the computer to emulate human senses of sight, hearing, speech, touch, gesture and couple them together in a different way for people to interact with a machine."  



Video: The future of computers


Few people in the world are more influential in creating that future than Mundie, who took over the reins as head of the world's largest computer science research department when Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates announced his transition away from day-to-day work at the company he founded.  As such, Mundie keeps his eyes fixed toward the future of computing. With an annual budget of $9.5 billion, Microsoft spends more than any other company on research, Mundie said. His department's budget wasn't cut during the downturn. "I tell people my time horizon is between three and 20 years in the future," he said. What will fuel the increase in interactivity is powerful new multiprocessor computers which are expected to be widely on the market by 2012.  "With that we should get a significant performance gain, in some cases more than a factor of 100," he said.  "So what you ask yourself then is, what do you do with a machine that is 50 to 100 times faster? To me, you start to move the basic model of how people interact with computers," Mundie said.  
You might sit there and look at a catalogue of movies to watch and just flip your hand like you were turning pages in a book and they would flip on the screen.--Craig Mundie

The first major commercial application of that technology is expected next year, when Microsoft is scheduled to release a new line of its Xbox consoles that eliminates the need for hand-controllers altogether -- essentially, the players become the controllers.  "Sometime next year the Xbox team will announce this new type of camera which allows you to sit on that sofa along with up to three of your friends, or stand and move around, and have the Xbox system calculate in real time the angular position of the 22 major joints in your body," Mundie said.  "You might play games that way. You might sit there and look at a catalogue of movies to watch and just flip your hand like you were turning pages in a book and they would flip on the screen and point at the one you want to play," he said.  Moving into 'the cloud' Also adding to the firepower of computers in the next decade, Mundie believes, is the evolution of "cloud computing" -- the move of computing power from home PCs and laptops and onto the Web.  "I think of 'The Cloud' as taking the publishing abilities of the Internet and adding programmability to it," he said. "And so these high scale things -- coupled with these new devices, which are smarter, perhaps more anticipatory in how they interact with you -- this will create a new computing platform which will allow us to attack a new range of problems that in the past have really eluded us."  Mundie envisages a day in the near future where you have a discussion on how to lower your carbon footprint -- with your house.  "You want to be able to make a contract with your house that says, look, this is the policy I want with my family about how green I want to be. I don't like to be super uncomfortable but you can mess around with the air conditioning a little bit," he said.  "And if I bought an electric car, make sure you charge it up to meet my driving requirements but don't charge in the expensive part of the day.  "You should be able to describe the problem or the policy you want and the computer should be able to somehow implement that," he said.  "It sounds a bit Star Trek-ish to some people but I really think we're within a few years of starting to see the introduction of these kind of things -- largely as a function of the increase in computing power both locally and in terms of the backbone of the Internet in the cloud."  On a broader level, he believes environmental computing will be able to give policy makers real-time analysis of carbon emissions and its global impact on the environment. Creation of 3-D science work stations and healthcare applications are considered strong business opportunities in the next decade, he added.  Mundie has applied his vision of a high-tech living to his own home, which he completed 18 months ago is tricked out with state-of-the-art computer controls, communication and automation with screens of various size dotted in every room.  "There is a uniform graphical interface that allows you to control almost anything in the house," he said. "You can control the drapes, lights, the fireplaces and audio systems."  His wife's request?  "Her specification is I had to deliver one-button television," he said. "And so I did that."

 Blogging from the Olympics on Microsoft's dimeBy  Doug Gross, CNN    Blogger Amber Johnson shows off tickets to watch her son's namesake, skier Bode Miller, compete. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Pair of bloggers are covering the Winter Olympics like pros after winning Microsoft contest  Amber Johnson, "Crazy Bloggin' Canuck," counts Bode Miller medal win among highlights  Student Dylan Derryberry says chance to see international reporters work was 'amazing'  Microsoft hooked bloggers up with credentials, laptops, smartphones and Office 2010

2010 Winter Olympics

Blogs and Blogging

 (CNN) -- Forgive Amber Johnson if she knocked you over while sprinting through the Olympic Village near Vancouver, Canada, last week. She was on her way to blog about skier Bode Miller winning a medal. And as someone who named her 3-year-old son Bode, she didn't want to miss it. "I'm literally sprinting," said Johnson, who had shown up at the wrong media center for Miller's press conference. "I have these clogs on. I was a disaster, running through the Whistler village yelling at people to get out of the way." Johnson, a Denver, Colorado, writer and native of Canada whose Crazy Bloggin' Canuck blog focuses on life as a mom of two, was one of two bloggers who have covered the Winter Games in person after winning a contest hosted by Microsoft. The Olympic Blogathlete contest was designed to showcase Microsoft's Office 2010, currently in beta format, which adds blogging, photo and video tools to the program's traditional spreadsheet and other workplace functions. But Anthony Sprauve, spokesman for Microsoft Office, said it was also a chance to highlight what he called a different kind of Olympics. "This is really probably the first real digital Olympics," he said. "A lot of people are obviously still watching on television. But they're watching on the Internet, webcasts, they're following athletes' blogs and Twitter updates. "They're staying on top of what's going on in real time." For Dylan Derryberry, the other blogger and a sophomore journalism student at Colorado Mountain College, the trip to Vancouver has been an interesting look at how international journalism works. "Obviously, this entire experience is an amazing opportunity," he said. "Journalism is constantly moving forward, especially in technology ... and all of this is great for a college student, especially in journalism." Derryberry, whose CMC Mountain Times blog focuses on student life, and Johnson received full media credentials and tickets to several events at the Vancouver Games. The contest required active and established bloggers to submit writing samples and essays on why they'd like to cover the Games. A panel of judges, including gold medal-winning skater Bonnie Blair, selected five students and five "mom bloggers" as finalists and those 10 campaigned for online votes for the top spot. Microsoft hooked them up with Olympic-branded Acer Aspire laptops, loaded with Office 2010 and Windows 7, of course, and Windows 6.5 smartphones they used to post to Twitter and their blogs. Johnson is a Winter Games diehard whose parents met at a curling center in Canada.  Her Olympic highlights have included spending time with Blair as the speedskater watched Apolo Anton Ohno -- who would break her U.S. record for most Winter Olympic medals. She also met the cast of NBC's "Today" show, even though, as she wrote on her blog, "Matt Lauer ruined my moment in the spotlight" by standing in front of her during live shots. Then there was Wayne Gretzky.  A big hockey fan (who cheers for most U.S. athletes, but is still broken up over Canada's loss to the United States) Johnson was taken off guard when introduced to the hockey legend. "Did I tell The Great One I still remember when the Oilers beat the Islanders to win the Stanley Cup, their first of five in seven years? Of course not," she wrote in a blog post titled "Tutorial on what not to say when meeting Wayne Gretzky." "I instead blurted out, 'I have to confess to you I'm a Calgary Flames fan" -- a nod to the Oilers' arch-rival. The Olympic-torch lighter's response? A forgiving, "That's OK." Johnson is already back in Denver. Derryberry, whose early highlights include being one of only two U.S. fans watching the aforementioned hockey match in a bar full of rabid Canadians, arrived this week and will be in Vancouver through Sunday's closing ceremonies.

 Microsoft has been more than coy about its upcoming motion control hardware, known at the moment as Project Natal. Some members of the press, more fortunate than we are, have seen it, although their coverage could only include images of the writers, not the hardware or the game itself. In some demos last year Peter Molyneux helped the reporters play with the creepy virtual boy, Milo, who could name the color of the writer's shirt, among other parlor tricks. In other words, there just isn't much information or hands-on impressions to be had with Project Natal, and the main challenge Microsoft faces at this year's E3 is not only to make the hardware real for the press and the readers at home, but to convince readers that this is something they need to buy this holiday season. That may be a bigger challenge than everyone assumes. Sony had the right idea at GDC At an invite-only press event during this year's Game Developers Conference, Sony gave a short presentation on the power of the PlayStation Move with a few gameplay videos and demonstrations, and then set the press free in a large, warehouse-like space next door in order to simply play with the hardware. There were no smoke and mirrors here; we just played games, chatted up Sony representatives, and held what seemed to be final or near-final hardware in our hands. The next day even more games were shown in the Sony lounge, where drinks flowed like water and everyone was able to play as much as they wanted. It was a party-like atmosphere, which was perfect for the more lighthearted games on display. We were given a private demo of the newest SOCOM title, played with the PlayStation Move. Our time with the hardware left us with some things we liked and some things we didn't, but it was clear that the technology was ready to go. What Microsoft has planned Microsoft is demanding a lot of our time at E3 this year. On Sunday, June 13, there will be a Project Natal demonstration featuring Cirque du Soleil. That should certainly be interesting, but how much of the hardware and games we'll see is an open question. Microsoft's press conference takes place that Monday morning, and then there is yet another Natal event Monday evening. The company certainly has plenty of time to show off its newest hardware to the press, and we're expecting Natal to launch this holiday season. An event as big as E3 in June means that we should be given the whole suite of details: price, release date, and games that will launch alongside the hardware. The early tech demos sound promising. Gizmodo wrote this last June: "But turning my air steering wheel, I felt completely in control. A lot of that was the software-it registered even the smallest pivots of my elbows that sent my forearms right or left-but the way it responded exactly how I expected it to is what made it feel so natural. Which is the real key here. It feels natural." Engadget had similar praise: "As soon as we stepped into line in front of the box, the avatar immediately took on our stance and movements. And we mean really took them on-little gestures with our arms, the posture we had, front and back movements-it tracked with complete accuracy. We did notice a bit of stutter during some finer movements, but overall the effect was impressive (and more than a little eerie)." The groundwork is there, but Microsoft runs the risk of having hardware that looks good and promising, but without a single game that will cause gamers to reach for their wallets. Microsoft is clearly planning a Natal onslaught at E3-but we know next to nothing about the hardware and the launch could be mere months away. Microsoft has quite the challenge: make the hardware real, show that it can work well outside of the perfectly controlled settings where previous demos had taken place, and announce a game-or even more ideally, games-that will make gamers feel like they need one now. It may sound simple, but it's a tall order for such ambitious hardware. We'll be at E3, taking in the full range of Microsoft events, so keep your eyes here for coverage. Until then, the speculation will continue.COPYRIGHT 2011 ARSTECHNICA.COM

 Microsoft game lets kids tickle tigersBy  John D. Sutter, CNN | Filed under: Gaming & Gadgets  Game lets you 'pet' wild animalsSTORY HIGHLIGHTSMicrosoft unveiled first games for its remote-control-free video game system"Kinectimals" lets uses interact with virtual animalsIn demo, a little girl tickles Skittles, a baby tigerOnline reaction already strong to Kinectimals (CNN) -- Microsoft on Monday unveiled the first games for its remote-control-free video game system, Kinect for Xbox 360. Several of the titles were pretty generic: a dancing game, a race car game, an adventure game and a fitness game. And then there was "Kinectimals." A demo of this bizarre but cuddly game showed a little girl tickling and playing with "Skittles," a virtual tiger cub. She threw sticks for the tiger to fetch and called it to the screen, where it licked the television and wagged its tail for her. "Come here Skittles!" she called to her virtual friend. The game features 40 wild animals and 30 types of interactions, according to Microsoft. Kids just wave their hands and talk to the TV to interact with these virtual pets. Microsoft Kinect, an add-on for the Xbox 360 that goes on sale on November 4, has a camera that watches their movements and a microphone to listen to their voices. Video gaming 'history' to be made this week at E3 The game has caused a bit of an uproar online, with some bloggers saying it's the start of a new era of kid interaction with video games and others saying the idea of a kid playing with a tiger, virtual or not, is just a little too strange. "Technically, this game is incredibly impressive. The AI [artificial intelligence] seems extremely reactive and the Kinect set-up works seamlessly as far as we can see," writes Robert Evans in a post on i4unews.com. "That doesn't stop the weird cat-animal thing onscreen from being creepy as hell, though. Hopefully the other Kinectanimals [sic] have less disturbing faces."

Chad Concelmo, from the site destructoid.com, wrote that he was initially skeptical of the game. But then the girl who giving the Kinectimals demo told her pet tiger, "I love you Skittles," and Concelmo writes that his "heart melted." "That little girl completly [sic] sold me on it," he writes. "I want to tickle a tiger. I WANT TO TICKLE A TIGER!" He continued: "The game is obviously adorable, but it looks to work pretty well! The interaction with the baby tiger seemed accurate and, most importantly, a lot of fun! I am actually looking forward to trying Kinectimals out on the show floor now! Thanks, cute little girl!" On gameinformer.com, Tim Turi writes that some of the tiger's moves were "disgustingly cute." "When she jumped, the tiger mimicked her, often to disgustingly cute results," he wrote. "Fetch, jump rope, and playing dead were also among the critter's repertoire. When the two were done playing, surrogate hands appeared on the beast as the girl gave her furry friends a rub down. The tiger responded realistically, folding its ears back, closing its eyes, and moving contentedly." Here's how Microsoft describes the game in a news release:  "A wide-eyed Bengal Tiger cub cocks its head to the side and playfully peers at you. Memories of your first trip to the zoo come rushing back. 'Kinectimals' invites children, their parents and animal lovers of all ages to build lasting friendships with some of the world's most exotic creatures. "Just like real pets, your 'Kinectimals' will come running when they hear your voice, respond to commands like 'jump,' 'roll-over' and 'play dead,' and purr with joy when you scratch them behind the ears." The "Kinectimals" debut also sparked conversation on Twitter. One user, @ActiveNick, posted, "My future kid's first word's probably won't be 'mommy' or 'dada', it'll be 'Xbox, start Kinectimals' :)" Another user, apparently unable to contain his reaction with words, simply posted a photo of his amused-yet-terrified face during the "Kinectimals" demo.  Take a look at the video demo at the top of this post and let us know what you think. Is "Kinectimals" creepy or cool? Would you let your kid play?

 How Microsoft crowdsourced Office 2010 

By  Brian X. Chen | Filed under: Innovation    STORY HIGHLIGHTS Microsoft used crowdsourcing to fine-tune its latest productivity suite, Office 2010  About 9 million people downloaded beta version of Office before it was released  The beta featured "Send a Smile," a way for users to send feedback, questions  Early reviews haven't all been good, but Windows says new Office is still a work in progress

Personal Computers

 (Wired) -- For several years, Denise Carlevato has studied millions of mouse clicks and keystrokes made by anonymous computer users from all over the world. Her objective: to make Microsoft Office better fit the way millions of people work. Months before Microsoft rolled out the latest version of its productivity suite, Office 2010, 9 million people downloaded its beta version to test the software and provide feedback.  As part of the program, Microsoft collected 2 million comments from beta testers. An additional 600 people participated in Microsoft's Virtual Research Lab, where Carlevato and her colleagues could observe how people were using new features. In a sense, it was a massive, controlled crowdsourcing project. That's just what you have to do to cater to as broad an audience as possible, says Carlevato, who has worked as a Microsoft usability engineer for 10 years. "We do our darnedest to make sure the features we put into our product are the things people ask for," Carlevato told Wired.com. "We know from watching them work that they really need it." Though some tech observers have predicted Microsoft's downfall after falling behind in the smartphone game and being one-upped by Apple in market capitalization, many agree that reports of the software titan's inevitable demise are greatly exaggerated.  Microsoft as a whole remains hugely profitable, and Office has consistently been the most lucrative part of Microsoft's business, raking in billions of dollars each quarter, even exceeding sales of Windows. And although Google offers a competitive productivity suite, Google Docs, for free, Microsoft still has a major advantage: 67 percent of U.S. online consumers regularly use Office, while only 4 percent use Google Docs, according to Forrester Research. "In some ways, the 'Office versus Google Docs' debate doesn't merit a lot of consideration -- it's still no competition," said J.P. Gownder, a Forrester analyst. "In terms of usage and penetration, Google Docs remains a failure --- so far, anyway." But staying in the lead with productivity software isn't easy, and to retain the loyalty of millions, Microsoft goes to great lengths to determine what customers want.  For Office 2010 beta, Microsoft included a feature called "Send a Smile," a comment box for testers to submit feedback and suggestions for improvement.  Of the 2 million Send a Smile comments, 81,000 included the senders' e-mail addresses so the engineers working to improve Office could follow up with them. To analyze the Send a Smile feedback, Microsoft built a database and programmed algorithms to classify and tag comments under certain categories, while filtering out biased feedback and useless drivel. From that point, researchers manually read every single comment to determine necessary tweaks and additions to Office. A major new feature birthed from customer feedback was an online broadcasting tool for users to share PowerPoint 2010 presentations by simply sending around a URL, according to P.J. Hough, corporate vice president of Office Program Management. "We were making many decisions not based on what others were doing, but on what customers wanted us to do," Hough said. "We did research on customers that led us to the path." Microsoft also invites select users to participate in its Virtual Lab, where they are instructed to perform specific tasks such as formatting a section of a Word document, or changing the background color of a PowerPoint presentation. After lab participants completed each task, Carlevato and her colleagues analyzed their history to observe the actions they took. The Virtual Research Lab is especially useful when users struggle to finish a task, because researchers can examine why they are becoming confused or taking too long and work to resolve the problem. This is what usability researchers call "unarticulated needs," said Carlevato. Going beyond virtual testing, Microsoft engineers also worked one-on-one with human subjects at the University of Washington to create the brand-new Office web apps suite released in mid-June. A group of 26 students testing an early version ofOffice web apps met with engineers every two weeks to discuss features they wanted or didn't like in the web-based suite. Microsoft's product planner Char Popp helped lead the field trial, and she said it was crucial to work in a human environment with live feedback, because this was the very first version of Office web apps. "While the team was building it and giving insights and information, it was still all like a big jigsaw puzzle," she said. "Toward the end when this all came together I had the opportunity to go out and see how the web apps were actually going to live with real people." Early reviews of the Office web apps (including Wired's) weren't stellar, citing some missing key features and elements, but Microsoft stressed that this was a version-one product, and it would continue to collect feedback to improve the service. "With any release as big as Office you can't do everything all at once," said Hough, who added that any unaddressed shortcomings are "part of our engineering road map." Fortunately for Microsoft, there are360 million Windows Live users with access to the Office web apps who can help crowdsource the solutions.Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT!
