inMailFinanceWatchlistsMy PortfolioScreenersMarketsIndustriesVideosNewsPersonal FinanceTechUS Markets closedSP Dow NasdaqRussell Crude OilGoldSilverEURUSD Stocks That Look Just Like Google in Chris Neiger Neha Chamaria and Chuck Saletta The Motley FoolMotley FoolFebruary  ReblogShareTweetShareBack in  when it went public Google was far from being the massive technology conglomerate that Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL is today but it was still a leader in the search engine space and it was clear that it knew exactly what it was doing and could execute on its plansAt any given time there will always be companies in the stock market poised for similarly impressive growth So we asked a few Motley Fool contributors to name some businesses they think have potential that resembles that of the Google of yore They came back with ADT Inc NYSE ADT Shopify NYSE SHOP and Netflix NASDAQ NFLXImage of a tower viewer overlooking a mountain landscapeMoreImage source Getty ImagesYou just cant ignore this ecommerce playNeha Chamaria Shopify Google was already profitable when it IPOed in  But the numbers that stood out in its books quarter after quarter were on the top line Its revenue was growing at a torrid pace That combined with Googles potential to become a tech juggernaut caught investors attention and went on to make it one of the most successful stocks ever I see similar potential in Shopify  an ecommerce powerhouse in the making thats already turning heads with its differentiated product offerings and strong revenue growthUnlike Amazoncom which operates its own marketplace Shopify offers a cloudbased ecommerce platform that makes it easy for small and mediumsized businesses to create and run their own online stores Shopify earns monthly fees subscription solutions revenue from the merchants that use its platform as well as a percentage of transactions made on its portal merchant solutions revenueShopify generated a record  billion in gross merchandise volume in the last quarter even as its merchant base crossed  Its revenue surged  in  One strong factor appears to be working for Shopify Access to entrepreneurs and smaller businesses to its technologically advanced ecommerce platform Just to give you an idea about what Shopify is doing on the tech front the company recently partnered with none other than Apple to bring augmented reality to its platformWhile Shopify isnt profitable yet because its spending heavily to grow and market its business investors are likely to be richly rewarded in the long run given the profitable niche its carving for itself in the ecommerce spaceYou can invest in this security leader againChuck Saletta ADT By the time it went public Google was already recognized as an internet search leader Home and business security company ADTis similarly a leader in its industry in the US and Canada After about two years as a privately held company it rejoined the public market last month and is actually trading below its IPO price That gives investors the opportunity to buy in for less than those lucky enough to get a piece of its offeringHome and business security monitoring like internet search is a business where scale matters a great deal With alarm systems central monitoring sites handle the response and dispatch duties The more customers a company has the more widely it can spread its overhead costs As the largest player in its industry ADT is thus best able to cover the costs of providing its serviceADTs shares arent just trading below their IPO price theyre downright reasonable compared to the companys prospects Theyre valued at less than  times its expected forward earnings and the company is expected to be able to grow earnings at a healthy clip over the next five or so yearsStory continuesIf theres one risk with ADT its that its balance sheet has been levered up by its former private equity owner Its debttoequity ratio is a rather high  Given its scale and relatively assetlight operating model it will likely be able to generate enough cash to comfortably service its debt Still thats something to watch especially if its growth doesnt materialize to the expected degreeThe streaming video giant Chris Neiger NFLX Netflix is a powerhouse in its niche of video streaming just like Google was and is with Internet search The two companies similarly focused their attentions on building amazing products and neither has looked back since But the difference is that Netflix is only beginning to tap its international market potentialNetflix ended  with about  million total subscribers and more than  of them are international customers It would therefore be logical to assume that the majority of its sales and earnings come from outside the US  but they dont International subscribers generate about  of revenue and have a contribution margin which is sales minus variable costs of just  compared to a  margin for Netflixs domestic customers What all of this means is that Netflix has a huge opportunity to raise rates for its international customers in the coming years just as it has done in the US and drastically increase its margins in other marketsNetflix had its first full year of internationalcontribution profits in  and more than doubled its global operating income as wellConservative estimates forecast its international subscriber numbers will exceed  million just two years from now which would require about  growth That doesnt even include domestic customer growth over that same time periodEven if Netflix rolls out price increases more slowly for its international customers than it has domestically those customers will still add significantly to the companys profitsStrong subscription and sales growth both at home and abroad have of course pushed up the Netflixs share price and valuation Shares are trading at  times forward earnings estimates right nowBut Netflix isnt anywhere near finished growing  and its international profits are just getting started More From The Motley Fool    Growth Stocks at DeepValue Prices     Expected Social Security Changes in      Years Later  Charts That Show How Far Apple

cancer drugs are evaluated in trials enrolling patients with one type of cancer such as lung cancer However thats not the case with JTX ICOS is expressed on effector cells across a number of cancer indications so its trial is evaluating it in six different solid tumor indications including lung cancer JTX is additionally intriguing because it may help PD drugs work in patients who wouldnt typically respond to them PD drugs are among the worlds bestselling cancer drugs so the potential for JTX to be used alongside them is significantAssuming that JTXs trial data is good its possible that regulators will consider giving it an accelerated or conditional OK especially for use in advanced cancer patients with limited treatment options If so then JTX has a good shot at hitting the ground running becauseJounce hasinked a cocommercialization deal with the biotech Goliath Celgene NASDAQ CELGAdmittedly theres no guarantee that JTXs data will be good and that makes this a highrisk

 ways apple maps can improve to compete with google
Apple Maps needs to get betterYahooSearchNo matching results for Tip Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsGive feedback on the new search experienceCancelSign inMailFinanceWatchlistsMy PortfolioScreenersMarketsIndustriesVideosNewsPersonal FinanceTechUS Markets closedSP Dow NasdaqRussell Crude OilGoldSilverEURUSD ways Apple maps can improve to compete with GoogleRob PegoraroContributing Editor Yahoo FinanceJuly  ReblogShareTweetShareApple is redesigning maps but it has a long way to goMoreEven Apple AAPL is tired of Apple Maps looking lost so its now rebuilding that apps cartographical foundationone street and one crowdsourced data point at a timeThe Cupertino California company revealed the existence of this Apple Maps reboot now four years in in a report by TechCrunchs Matthew Panzarino By gathering information from mapping vehicles and anonymized snippets of route data from individual iPhones Apple aims to provide users with a more comprehensive current guide to the worldbeginning this fall for iOS  users across northern California That would be a decent start to redeeming Apple Maps from a legacy of errant routing But if Apple wants to overcome the enormous lead of Google GOOG GOOGL more accurate lines and dots can only be the startTransit navigation in more placesSix years after Apple Maps launchedwithout public transit information it matches Google featureforfeature in major cities like New York and Washingtonit tells you which exit to take out of a subway station and even knows about singlepurpose routes like the express bus from Metro to Dulles International Airport But outside of such cities Apples transit support remains woefully behind leaving Google Maps unchallenged for bus guidance in smaller places like Burlington Vermont and Missoula MontanaBeyond the US Apple Maps is a joke for transit advice It has no help for subways and buses in Bangkok Barcelona Brussels and Buenos Aires and its just as bad across the rest of the alphabet of global cities I dont know whats made adding transit navigation such a bespoke artisanal process at Apple but it has to stop Because Google and to a lesser extent Microsoft MSFT have been able to incorporate transit agencies schedules and routes In fact theres been a standard format for that since without the work looking like cartographic trench warfareNot all lanes are the sameIf you drive to work your commute can go by faster if youre willing to payor if you have enough other passengers in the car But both Apple and Google have been slow to recognize the advent of carpool lanes that charge single drivers a toll but let highoccupancy vehicles typically from two to three people per vehicle roll by for freeGoogle is still way ahead of Apples mapping softwareMoreGoogles Waze app added support for these surchargepossible lanes at the end of November in the form of a switch that lets people selfdesignate as HOV drivers to see the fastest cheapest routes availableApple Maps should follow suit But first it will need to mark out carpool lanes clearlywhich it does not do on the Virginia side of the Capital Beltway more than five years after the debut of those Express LanesApple would also do well to roll out this feature worldwide faster than usual Carolina Milanesi an analyst with Creative Strategies complained in an email that Apple took years to add lanespecific guidance on European highways It seems that California is their best implementation of Maps when it comes to the granularity of info she wroteSafe walking directionsBoth Google and Apple could do better when guiding people on foot I saw this firsthand last November at the Web Summit conference in Lisbon when Google Maps suggested a seemingly optimum walking route from a restaurant back to my hotel But it had found one of the least pedestrianfriendly routes in that walkable city and sent me alongside a fourlane highway mostly absent of sidewalks Google still offers the same defective routing as does Apple Maps And complaints of unsafe walking directions continue to pop up This could be a chance for Apple to do better The amount of data its vans collect TechCrunchs Panzarino counted eight cameras and four LiDAR sensors on one should allow it better insight over what makes a safe path for a pedestrian Story continuesBikes belong tooand so do scootersIf you get around on two wheels Google Maps remains unchallenged eight years after Google added bicycling directions even as bikesharing services have revolutionized getting around citiesAt a minimum Apple should show cyclists the way as well as Google doesand it looks like Apple might do just that In a Twitter thread following up on his story Panzarino noted that Apple is already recording the speed at which people cross parksan obvious indicator of cycling versus walking But why not do better To the extent that bikesharing services allow public access to their availability data a navigation app should be able to tell you which ones have bikes open near yousomething thirdparty services like Transit Screen already do The same goes for the electric bike and electric scooter sharing services that let people get a little farther across town without breaking a sweatAlloftheabove routingBoth Apple and Googles maps show their age when they list driving and transit as separate categoriesbut theres no reason to do that when you can start a trip on a shared bike take a train and then let Lyft or Uber complete your journeyId like all apps including Google to do multimodallike take transit here and then hop on Capital Bikeshare from there or Uber to transit or the like commented David Alpert founder of the transitanddevelopmentpolicy site Greater Greater Washington Now it assumes you are using one modeAn onlyApple situationLooking at all the things Apple Maps botches today it can be tempting to tell people to stop waiting on Cupertino and use Google Maps already But Apple doesnt let iPhone users designate another map app as the default for navigation If you use an Apple Watch you cant have Google call out turns on your wrist And until iOS  ships you cant use Google Maps or Waze on the CarPlay screen of a suitably equipped vehicleApple has essentially said I alone can fix this So it had better do thatMore from RobApples Safari has dropped the

make free speakerphone calls to actual phone numbers although the Googles call quality is awfulThere are however a few differences to noteIn this corner The Google Home MiniThe sound is much better Neither assistant pod will be mistaken for a concert hall But theres no question that Googles builtin speaker is richer than AmazonsIt talks to Chromecasts and Android TVs If you spring  for a Chromecast a little receiver stick that plugs into a modern TVs USB jack or if you have a TV that runs Android TV you can perform a nifty trick You can say Ok Google show me a video about how to remove contact lenses or Show me funny cat videos or Show me the trailer for the new Avengers movie and it appears on your TV instantly As you can see in the video above its quite magicalIt will someday have a taptotalk feature The top of the Mini is supposed to be touch sensitive As designed you could tap it to issue a command instead of saying OK Google or tap it to pause music But just as the Home Mini was shipping a reviewer discovered a bug in which that button thought that it was being pressed all the time transmitting everything anyone said in the room to Googles servers So Google responded by shutting off that top buttons features altogetherGoogle will presumably restore the tapthetop feature once they get their act togetherMoreAnd now in this corner The Amazon Echo DotWorks with more homeautomation products like internetcontrolled thermostats lights security cameras and so on Its a huge list Googles improving on this front but Amazons had a severalyear head startIt has an audio output jack Lots of people love plugging in their nice speakers or sound systems to an Echo Dot thanks to the standard miniplug on the side the Google offers nothing similar That makes it easy to control your music by voiceone of the most luxurious features everIts much easier and more reliable to adjustthe Echo Dots volume left by turning its ring instead of tappingthe sidesMoreYou can see feedback across the room The Dots LED ring glows in different colors and patterns to communicate different thingsfor example it glows when its transmitting sound back to Amazon You can see it from the side and therefore from across the room The Googles four LEDs are visible only when youre looking down on the device which isnt nearly as usefulYou can order stuff Of course this is exactly what Amazon hopes youll do but its still cool Alexaorder more paper towelsIf youre a Google Play subscriber maybe the convenience of speaking your desires for music tips the balance for you toward the Google Home Mini The argument about Buy a Google Home if you keep your calendar in Google Calendar doesnt really hold water since the Echo can consult or add events to the calendar systems of Google or Apple AAPLor Microsoft MSFTOtherwise though the Echo Dot is still the better microassistant Especially when its on sale for for example on the typical Black Friday which is in a couple of weeksThere will be a lot ofpeople unwrapping these little guys this holiday seasonMoreBoth of these devices are delicious enhancements to almost anyones home Over time youll find more and more ways

ReblogShareTweetShareHelm email serverMoreHelmHelm a  device with a  yearly subscription plan lets you operate an email server out of your own homeYour email and data is stored on the device in your home and its encrypted before traveling through Helms serversHelm claims to collect very little information from its users  just the necessary payment information and device diagnostics While no server is completely secure this could provide peace of mind to people who dont trust large tech companies to protect their dataIts not hard to get the impression that big tech companies cant effectively keep our data safeJust in the past few weeks Google disclosed a security bug that exposed hundreds of thousands of private accounts on the Google social network Facebook admitted that  million users had private information stolen Its easy to decide to quit using social media sites but nearly everyone needs or uses an email service Email is the backbone of every internet account  you almost cant get by in life these days without an email addressOne solution is to run your own inhouse email server as plenty of companies and techsavvy individuals doThis means that a private entity is in control of the email server and all of the information stored there Theres no need to place your trust in a tech company that has proven itself to be vulnerable to security bugs or breachesBut if youre not an IT pro the idea of setting up an email server can be pretty intimidating Thats where Helm comes inHelm wants to make that a reality for the everyday email user  someone who probably wouldnt know how to set up an email server from scratch Helms  device is an inhome email server meaning all of your data and emails are stored on the device right in your home Helm doesnt collect much information about its users besides the necessary details like payment information and device diagnostics and any communication or data are encrypted when they leave the Helm deviceWith traditional email services like Gmail or Yahoo your data and emails are stored on a server controlled by the email provider You dont have much control over what that company does with your dataHelm stores your emails and data in your home but that doesnt mean its completely safe Any server can be attacked regardless of where its located However youre paying for the control over your emails and the ability to be free from a tech company storing your data Helm also says it hires hackers to try to locate vulnerabilities in the device or its software and it plans to release improvements and boost security through future software updatesYou can choose to store a backup of your emails on Helms servers but those backups are encrypted and require your security key in order to be decryptedHelm features a standard GB of storage but that can be increased to up to TB with additional hardware The device also comes with physical encryption keys for encrypting data locally on the machine and offline for a

about the companys onceambitious plan to blanket the country with superfast fiber internet She said that Fibers pace of rollout has been paused until the company find a way to make the service x better Dont expect Google Fiber to start announcing new target cities any time soonAlphabets GOOGL onceambitious plan to blanket the country with superfast internet service has been on hold of late and it was up to Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat on Monday to field questions about the units futureAt the Morgan Stanley Technology Conference where Porat was speaking an analyst asked about Fibers change in strategy and the companys new milestones Porat said that Fibers rollout has been paused until the company finds a way to make the service  times betterAs we were looking at our rollouts going back to   our view was that we had not done enough Porat said She said that Fiber hadnt achieved its x moment which is Googlespeak for getting a fold improvement over existing technologyIts been a tough couple of years for Fiber Launched in  with the promise of bringing fast and affordable internet service to municipalities across the country the initiative has endured costcutting measures layoffs and two CEO resignations since becoming part of the Alphabet unit AccessPorat said that Alphabet was holding off on pushing Fiber into new markets until it could find a better way to bring technology to bear in a meaningful way She said that the company wont start accelerating the rollout again until it can prove that it has a valuable new deployment and delivery methodAccess acquired the home broadband company Webpass in  to help it work on new delivery methods but Webpass recently stopped accepting new customers in Boston Access hired a new CEO earlier this month  a Time Warner Cable executive who Porat described as having a really strong history in the industryFiber is one of only three Other Bets businesses consistently highlighted during Alphabets earnings calls for bringing in any revenue alongside healthcare company Verily and Nest  which just got rolled back into GoogleAlphabet cut its Other Bets capital expenditures from  billion in  to  million in  because of a reduced investment in FiberThe pause on Fiber has had other ramifications Ahead of a potential rollout in Portland Oregon Google convinced the state to provide a tax exemption Google paused its Fiber plans and the tax break went to Comcast CMCSA owner of NBC Universal the parent of CNBC and Frontier which may have cost local governments and school districts more than  million according to a recent report in The Oregonian The one thing that has not changed about Fibers strategy is our view that there is a real need for quality service Porat saidIts just not clear if Alphabet will ever be the one providing itHere is Porats full responseThe one thing that has not changed is our view that there is a real need for quality service As we were looking at our rollouts going back to   our view was that we had not done enough  we were appropriately selfcritical  to use technology to fundamentally change the implementation approach whether on the deployment or delivery of service to the homes of users There wasnt kind of that breakthrough x moment And as a result of that we concluded that we would pause the pace of rollout Were still implementing and executing in the cities that we announced but weve slowed the pace of rollout so that we could spend time on how do we really bring technology to bear in a more meaningful way And its really specifically focused on deployment and delivery When you ask about milestones in our view when we have something that is substantive enough of value to justify accelerating the rollout again thats how were looking at it Were delighted to have brought in a new CEO Dinni Jain who has a really strong history in the industry so we are continuing to forge aheadMore From CNBC Apple is launching medical

sales and a change in accounting for investments in startups sending its shares up about  percent after hoursThe results eased concerns that investment in new ventures beyond its core search business was undermining Alphabets outlook There also were no immediate signs that rising global privacy concerns would affect profitsThe strong economy has companies spending more on advertising and we have an ongoing migration from traditional types of media advertising to greater online and social mediabased advertising said analyst Ivan Feinseth from Tigress Financial Partners Google continues to dominate both mobile and desktop search he addedWorldwide sales increased to  billion above the average analysts estimate of  billion according to Thomson Reuters IBES Still operating income margins

despite spending cuts on an unprofitable set of ancillary initiatives known as other betsOverall quarterly profit of  billion or  per share exceeded estimates of  billion or  per share according to

British data analysis firm Cambridge Analytica was able to acquire data on unwitting Facebook usersGoogle was later excused But analysts who follow the company have said Google may not escape European Union regulators which plan to begin enforcing a new data privacy law next month It could prompt more users to reject receiving personalized ads online costing Google a few billion dollars in annual sales said Brian Wieser a senior analyst at Pivotal ResearchAdvertisers also may limit adbuying this year while sorting out their own compliance with the new European policy known as General Data Protection Regulation he saidStill any pullback would be temporary because of the effectiveness of Internet advertising compared with declining media such as print and broadcast analysts say Alphabets

fix Androids biggest weaknessRob PegoraroContributing Editor Yahoo FinanceMay  ReblogShareTweetShareMOUNTAIN VIEW CALIFThe next version of Android doesnt have a name yet only a letter But Android Owhich should get a dessertbased moniker when it ships later this summerdoes have a set of features that Google GOOG GOOGL pitched over the first day of its IO developer conference hereAs in earlier updates Android O brings a grabbag of features Some address lingering pain points in this mobile operating system while others borrow from features Apple AAPL added to iOS Another represents an overdue remedy for a problem thats afflicted Android since its debut almost nine years ago the zombielike persistence of obsolete versions And of course theres better emoji supportProject Treble easing updates we can only hopeThe most important part of Oa rebuilding of Androids foundation to remove an obstacle to timely software updatesbarely got a mention in the almosttwohour keynote from Google CEO Sundar Pichai and other Googlers that opened IO at the Shoreline Amphitheatre WednesdayBut theres no missing the reason for its existence in the embarrassing pie chart on Googles Androiddevelopment site showing the versions of Android in useAs of May  the current Nougat release that debuted last August runs on  of all devices that had connected to the Play Store in the prior seven days The most widely used Android release was the twoyearold Marshmallow on  of devices At Apple meanwhile  of iOS devices that visited the App Store on Feb  ran the current iOS  releaseProject Treble announced in a blog post last week aims to free chipset vendors from having to tweak the code that keeps their circuitry talking to the rest of Android Treble will add a layer of translation code between that proprietary software and the rest of Androidthe equivalent of putting a standardsize joint atop some intricate plumbing in the basement A hardware vendor can write Treblecompliant circuitspecific code once for a device and know that future versions of Android will understand it without further rewritesThat wont end all Androidupdate holdups As this post from Ron Amadeo at Ars Technica explains Treble wont stop phone vendors from shipping weird Android interfaces hello Samsung that demand their own revisions But its an important step in an operating system that now runs on more than  billion active devicesSecurity and privacyThe afterlife of abandoned versions of Android remains the biggest problem in Android security but many users worry instead that theyll pick up malware in the Play Store In reality thats a vanishingly small risk compared to the odds of getting hacked after downloading an app from elsewhere thanks to a variety of malware scans that happen in the backgroundAndroid O will add more layers of security hardening but will also make these appsafety checks visible in a Google Play Protect feature showing their status Its literally security theatre As Stephanie Saad Cuthbertson productmanagement director for Android said in the keynote Most Android users dont know these services come built into Android devices with Play But if it gets people to trust the Play Store over lesssecure sources itll be a worthwhile productionThis update will guard against a different device threata runaway app killing your battery lifeby imposing limits on how often apps running in the background can ask for a devices location or make other requests of the system If that sounds like an overdue move it probably isIn the area of privacy Android O will randomly assign different device IDs to appsa small but significant change that will make it harder for a developer of multiple apps to correlate your use among them Notifications pictureinpicture and other interface tweaksStory continuesAndroid O will require apps to group their notificationsthe little nags that pop down from the top of the screeninto channels that you can turn on or off Its meant to stop apps from being too needy in practice having yet another option to set may not yield much difference Youll also be able to snooze notifications which may help avoid losing sight of yet another message from a friend coming in on yet another messaging app These changes should certainly help Androids notifications experience stay ahead of the same in iOS where you cant even clear all notifications unless you use a device with Apples Touch ID pressuresensitive controlApp icons will be able to show a different sort of notice colored notification dots at the top right corner of each that indicate somethings changed That seems a pretty clear case of Google following Apples lead not that theres anything wrong with thatA pictureinpicture option will pick up on the examples of some Android vendors by letting you watch a video clip or chat in one corner while taking notes or checking your calendarThe interface change Im most likely to appreciate Smart Text Selection in which Android will automatically select all of a street address phone number or other significant block of text once you start trying to pick it up This wont work out of the box as I saw in a demo phone because Android will use ondevice intelligence to build a phonespecific model of the kinds of data you often copy and paste By not syncing this personal data to the cloudas Cuthbertson boasted without any data leaving the deviceGoogle borrows yet again from its neighbors at Apple The interface tweak everybody may notice first A new EmojiCompat feature that should end the stigma of an iOS user

SandovalBusiness InsiderOctober  ReblogShareTweetSharevic gundotra google plusMoreNicholas CarlsonA former Google web designer recently described his experiences while working briefly at Google the companys recently shuttered social network Morgan Knutson who worked at Google for eight months before resigning in May  described a lack of vision for the service and wasted resources while detailing ways Vic Gundotra the overall leader of Google wielded his massive power within the companyKnutsons narrative written like a Twitter serial sheds light on the troubled Google one of the companys most noteworthy and expensive failuresIf youre interested in technology then one of the most fascinating longer reads available about Silicon Valley culture is the Twitter serial posted last week by Morgan Knutson a former Google web designerKnutson wrote  tweets over a period of five days about his brief tenure at Google the longtroubled nowdefunct social networkKnutson began writing a day after The Wall Street Journal revealed that Google had not disclosed for seven months that a security lapse had enabled thirdparty developers to see private information belonging to as many as  Google usersA few hours after the story was published Google announced it had shuttered Google which was created to challenge Facebook but never came closeVideoGoogle Shuts Down Google For ConsumersFor morenews videosvisitYahoo ViewApparently the situation prompted Knutson to reveal information he had bottled up for six yearsNow that Google has been shuttered I should air my dirty laundry on how awful the project and exec team wasIm still pissed about the bait and switch they pulled by telling me Id be working on Chrome then putting me on this god forsaken piece of shit on day one Part of what makes Knutsons tweets so fascinating is the idea that a former Googler has anything bad to say about the company Google has a reputation for being one of the most employeefriendly places in tech chock full of perks and benefits Its rare that a former staffer complains publiclyThe other reason Knutsons story is so compelling is due to the titillating details about the dysfunction he said reigned at the Google of Knutson who resigned for a job at Dropbox in  after only eight months at Google describes a service that lacked an overall vision often wasted resources and was propelled and shielded internally by Vic Gundotra the powerful former Google executive who led the Google effortHe also said contrary to his prior beliefs or the image that Google sells that not all employees were at the top of their fieldThought this was the pros Never wouldve imagined that I was joining a team of  designers where a bunch of them had never designed before And I was evaluated at about their level These werent interns these were designers in their very first roles everat Google Its important to remember as Knutson acknowledges that he was one employee working on one project during a brief periodTo say Knutson sounds disgruntled is an understatement To his credit he acknowledges that he chaffed at receiving criticism and disliked it when he believed he didnt get enough creditHe also had good things to say about some of his managers and about most of the people he came in contact with at GoogleThe common thread between  of the people that I interacted with at Google is that they were ethical highly intelligent and hard working I had a lot of admiration and respect for many of them and wish more of them had stayed in touch With all of Googles success and money as well as its sheer size more than  employees now its easy to think of the company as something otherworldlyWhat Knutson does  with his descriptions of bruised egos turf wars and politically minded bosses  is remind us that Google isnt all that different from anywhere else humans are employedCorrection This story incorrectly stated the number of tweets that Knutson posted to tell his story The correct number is NOW

in favor of the European Unions revamped copyright directiveCritics say the law could block internet users from being able to post content like memes and links to articlesThe copyright battle pits media companies and musicians against tech over the widespread availability of their content onlineEuropean parliamentarians have passed a controversial overhaul of copyright law that could force tech giants to install filters that prevent copyrightprotected content from being uploadedLawmakers in Strasbourg France  voted on Wednesday in favor of the European Unions revamped directive  which is aimed at bringing the blocs rules on copyright into the st centuryThe copyright reform was passed with  votes in favor  against and  abstentionsBut critics say such a law would normalize censorship and restrict internet freedom preventing users from being able to post content ranging from memes to links to articles from news outletsThe controversy mainly surrounds two sections of the law  Articles  and Article  would grant press publications copyright over the sharing of their content online meaning they would be able to charge services like Google News for aggregating their stories Critics have dubbed this as an effective link tax but proponents say hyperlinks will be exemptMeanwhile Article  calls for effective content recognition technology to filter out copyrightprotected content Detractors hold that this part of the law could threaten social media users ability to share anything from internet memes to snippets of music and filmReacting to the result of the vote Julia Reda a German Pirate Party lawmaker said it was catastrophic that the parliament voted in favor of the most controversial pieces of the legislationFinal vote for Parliament position on the copyright directive with UploadFilters and LinkTax adopted she wrote in a tweet Parliament has failed to listen to citizens and experts concernsTweetOpponents of the directive have been using the hashtag SaveYourInternet on social mediaThe legislation is now better balanced answering many of the concerns of journalists publishers and musicians whose work was being shared freely online without stifling innovation or fundamentally changing the nature of the internet Sajjad Karim a British Conservative lawmaker said in a statement following the voteIt also takes into account the rights of users ensuring that materials used for teaching and research and by cultural and heritage organizations are not encumbered by unnecessary restrictionsWhats nextWednesdays vote wont be the last youve heard about the EUs copyright reformsLawmakers had initially voted to delay the vote rejecting the version of the directive that had been agreed by a committee at that timeNow that politicians in Strasbourg have come to an agreement the next stage for the law will be whats known as trilogue which consists of talks between European Parliament EU executive body the European Commission and a collective of the leaders of EU member states known as the European CouncilAnd even once the directive goes through this process it will still require each individual EU nation to decide on how they will implement the new rulesThe EU copyright battle pits media companies and musicians against tech giants over the widespread availability of their content online Supporters of the law argue that people and companies in the creative industries are being starved of revenues lost to the sharing of their intellectual property on digital platformsIt could particularly impact platforms like Facebook FB and Googles GOOGL YouTube which rely on usergenerated content Google has been accused of lobbying aggressively to prevent the directive from being passed into lawThe issue has drawn attention from notable

briefing are no strangers to the spate of recent activity in the cypto market UCLA Laws James Park tried synthesizing industry events in a recent academic paper to highlight just when an offering

something that developed quickly and normalized while trying not to be seen as stomping entrepreneurship That also raises the question of whether securities laws quash innovation potentialHere are a few notable snippets from my  with Park edited for length and clarityQ Your paper digs into the SEC deeming Ether a security then changing its status Whats the ramifications of such a status change on other initial coin offeringsIt at least raises the possibility that you could get to the point that you could start out as a security and evolve into something else To some extent I think that having a clear path towards that outcome could be sort of a plus for your ICO If you could proceed in a way if youre initially a security and youre selling through private placement methods where you dont need registration you could hopefully build it up to a point where you could distribute tokens more widelyEven with Ether though theres still some questions with centralization Etherium is actively working to make Ether better And then the question becomes well isnt that centralized management in a sense and thus potentially a securityWhat thornier issues can arise from bouncing in and out of security statusOne is maybe you fall out and back in to status You could imagine a point where you are decentralized but people arent active on your community so it might get to the point where you decide to become more centralized The other is to what extent do you have to be functional I think it has to be you achieve some sort of use by individuals of your platforms not by the promise of speculative returns but because youve got a good idea I think thats what will distinguish projects that can evolve out of security status and those that failWhat do you make of the SECs pace of enforcement actionThe Nov  enforcement actionsif they had not brought those Id say they werent moving fast enough I think the fact they were working on this it sort of signals they are treating the ICO registration requirements seriously But I have two worries about the amount of time Number one if you dont have a presence in enforcing the law people dont know what the law is and go forward with ICOs Secondly youre getting more retail investors who are now potentially trading real dollars in these bitcoins when early on it was people who had invested in bitcoin when it was a dollar and are now reinvesting the proceeds Youre getting someone whos buying for  and reinvestingI think those are the people were most worried aboutYou note that if a handful of working viable projects ensue the SEC should relax its regulation How would theyI think they could expand the amount you could raise without registration through crowdfunding Now you could raise about  million Maybe you could modestly raise some of those thresholds so you could more easily get substantial amounts without registering as a security And so getting more options in reaching the general public that might balance the need for investor protections with the needs of entrepreneurship But the burden is really on the tech industry to show these are some projects that are good and work and are worthwhile Takeaway Recent

ensuing MDL they deem little more than a broadside against Facebooks business model In a November motion to dismiss Gibson Dunns Orin Snyder repping the social media company wrote that plaintiffs have been going on a limb to find a viable cause of action against Facebook putting forth a  page complaint that includes a kitchen sinklike lobbing of  claimsall in the hopes that something anything sticks A hearing for the dismissal motion is set for Jan  and plaintiffs attorneys are charging ahead writing in their opposition that Cambridge Analytica represents only the tip of the iceberg with respect to Facebooks willful pursuit of generating revenue at the expense of its users  Google CEO Sundar PichaiCongress Calls Google on Its Privacy ProblemSundar Pichai got an earful in a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee Tuesday that touched upon Googles increasingly controversial practices around data collection political bias and the alleged launch of a censored search engine in ChinaSeem like a highlight of the companys controversies from the past year It essentially was and Congress went a step further probing Pichai over the companys attempt to educate users on their privacy policy which Rep Martha Roby described as  pages long and changing multiple times a year And likely for a good reason as Rep Bob Goodlatte put it Google is able to collect an amount of information about its users that would even make the NSA blushIts interesting to consider how little consumers understand the data being collected on them The NY Times recently found that at least  companies receive anonymous precise location data from apps whose users enable location services to get local news and weather or other information Whats more Google is facing suits for surreptitious data collection practiceWhether Congress is taking a cue and brushing up on data collection  however is a different question Iowa Republican Rep Steve King FWIW got on Pichai about problems with an iPhone But according to Caroline Spiezio Lawcoms inhouse reporter covering Congressional and EU hearings over tech companies behindthe scenes practices the fact that hearings over data collection and use keep happening shows its important even if Congress doesnt realize why its importantYet Congress seems to peg Pichai as evasive When Rep Ted Poe asked if Google tracked his whereabouts via his phone when he crossed the room the Google CEO wouldnt give a yay or nay the Times reportedYou make  million a year Poe said You should be able to answer that question Im shocked you dont know I think Google obviously does Looking Ahead Its tough to say what sort of impact hearings will have on practices by companies like Google though they do show that people are waking up to how their data is

now reinvesting the proceeds Youre getting someone whos buying for  and reinvestingI think those are the people were most worried aboutYou note that if a handful of working viable projects ensue the SEC should relax its regulation How would theyI think they could expand the amount you could raise without registration through crowdfunding Now you could raise about  million Maybe you could modestly raise some of those thresholds so you could more easily get substantial amounts without registering as a security And so getting more options in reaching the general public that might balance the need for investor protections with the needs of entrepreneurship But the burden is really on the tech industry to show these are some projects that are good and work and are worthwhile Takeaway Recent regulatory activity suggests a paced approach by the SEC in tackling crypto registration to both protect consumers and at least avoid looking like its hindering entrepreneurshipStory continuesOn the

ensuing MDL they deem little more than a broadside against Facebooks business model In a November motion to dismiss Gibson Dunns Orin Snyder repping the social media company wrote that plaintiffs have

respect to Facebooks willful pursuit of generating revenue at the expense of its users  Google CEO Sundar PichaiCongress Calls Google on Its Privacy ProblemSundar Pichai got an earful in a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee Tuesday that touched upon Googles increasingly controversial practices around data collection political bias and the alleged launch of a censored search engine in ChinaSeem like a highlight of the companys controversies from the past year It essentially was and Congress went a step further probing Pichai over the companys attempt to educate users on their privacy policy which Rep Martha Roby described as  pages long and changing multiple times a year And likely for a good reason as Rep Bob Goodlatte put it Google is able to collect an amount of information about its users that would even make the NSA blushIts interesting to consider how little consumers understand the data being collected on them The NY Times recently found that at least  companies receive anonymous precise location data from apps whose users enable location services to get local news and weather or other information Whats more Google is facing suits for surreptitious data collection practiceWhether Congress is taking a cue and brushing up on data collection  however is a different question Iowa Republican Rep Steve King FWIW got on Pichai about problems with an iPhone But according to Caroline Spiezio Lawcoms inhouse reporter covering Congressional and EU hearings over tech companies behindthe scenes practices the fact that hearings over data collection and use keep happening shows its important even if Congress doesnt realize why its importantYet Congress seems to peg Pichai as evasive When Rep Ted Poe asked if Google tracked his whereabouts via his phone when he crossed the room the Google CEO wouldnt give a yay or nay the Times reportedYou make  million a year Poe said You should be able to answer that question Im shocked you dont know I think Google obviously does Looking Ahead Its tough to say what sort of impact hearings will have on practices by companies like Google though they do show that people are waking up to how their data is

Is Skyrocketing HigherDanny Vena The Motley FoolMotley FoolAugust  ReblogShareTweetShareThere was an abundance of things to like when The Trade Desk NASDAQ TTD reported its secondquarter financial results on Aug  The company reported record revenue of  million up  year over year and adjusted earnings per share of  which climbed  That was driven by tripledigit yearoveryear growth in a number of the companys channels including audio mobile video and mobile inapp which all grew more than  Connected TV growth soared more than doubling sequentially  on top of the more than  yearoveryear growth it produced just last quarterInvestors got all the financial data they were looking for But in the conference call to discuss the results with analysts there was a wealth of additional information about the companys explosive growth and the expanding opportunity The Trade Desk identified three significant developments that it sees as catalysts for future growth Read on to see why management is excited about the changing television landscape the launching of GDPR in the European Union and consumer privacy changes at Google a subsidiary of AlphabetTwo hands touching a digital rendering of a globe surrounded by icons representing various consumer advertising mediaMoreImage source Getty ImagesBig media marriagesOne of the biggest opportunities ahead for the company is the result of massive mergers that are happening in the television space The Trade Desk founder and CEO Jeff Green specifically addressed Disneys acquisition of TwentyFirst Century Fox and ATTs recent coupling with Time Warner as indicators of the opportunities aheadThe worldwide advertising market is currently at  billion and moving toward  trillion over the next  years Green said The biggest part of that market is television which  is nearly  billion this year He pointed to the generational shift with the global convergence of the Internet and televisionHe also sees the combination of digitally delivered content from services like Hulu skinny cable bundles like Sling TV and direct relationships with providers like Discovery as opening up a wealth of additional opportunities for programmatic advertisingThe GDPR phenomenonThe recent and farreaching new dataprivacy regulations that went into effect in the European Union  known as the General Data Protection Regulation GDPR  address the privacy rights and data protections afforded to EU citizens But the GDPR had an unforeseen consequence for advertisers When the new rules went into effect in late May many publishers found they were not in complianceThis provided a big opportunity for The Trade Desk Our engineering and partnerships team put in a huge effort working with publishers and their SSPs supplyside platforms who in some cases were not ready to ensure the technology was in place to secure the required consents This helped deliver record spend in all four of our European offices the UK Spain Germany and France Green said this was a result of the trust the company has fostered with its client baseBig changes at GoogleIn addition to the significant runway the company already had recent changes at Google increased the prospects for The Trade Desk Green detailed how Google announced in April that they would stop sharing DoubleClick IDs with clients  this makes comparative reporting go away so this is a very big dealStory continuesGreen said that this was likely related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal and that Google is now reducing the risk that personally identifiable consumer data will be maliciously used Since The Trade Desk doesnt collect any of this data theres no chance it could be breached giving the company a strategic advantage against Google in the programmatic advertising space The Trade Desk enables advertisers to compare every destination on their media plan to every other destination objectivelyGroup of people shown only from the neck down using mobile phonesMoreImage source Getty ImagesThe big pictureThe common thread running through each of these discussions is the large and growing opportunity in the programmatic advertising realm Green said Let me remind you that programmatic is growing at  while our growth was nearly two and a half times thatHe also said that programmatic was at just over  of the entire advertising market  Programmatic is the fastestgrowing segment of advertising and The Trade Desk is growing faster than anyone in programmaticThat sounds like the investment thesis in a nutshell More From The Motley Fool    Best Stocks to Buy Today

hurt themselves by leaving Apples App StoreDaniel HowleyTechnology Editor Yahoo FinanceAugust  ReblogShareTweetShareLeaving Apples App store or Googles Play Store could end up hurting developers more than Apple or Google Marcio Jose SanchezAPMoreApple AAPL and Google GOOG GOOGL have made billions of dollars by charging developers to sell their apps on the tech giants respective app stores But now some of those app developers and their parent companies are starting to push back against the socalled appstore tax which is often up to  of the amount consumers payEpic Games developer of the overwhelmingly successful Fortnite has cut Googles Play Store out of the app equation entirely by having Android users download the game to their phones from its own website More recently Netflix NFLX began testing a way to get around paying Apple a cut of its customer subscription fees by having users sign up for the service outside of the App Store in  countries not including the USThe move follows a similar decision by Netflix to move its subscription signup process off of Googles Play Store Even Spotify SPOT has moved the subscription process away from Apples Store However these measures could backfire on app developers for one reason  Consumers are lazyWhenever you add a step conversion declines explained Gene Munster of Loup Ventures referring to a customer whos being converted to a regular subscriber It could be one or two or three steps to leave the platform get redirected and sign up And thats the experiment that these companies are doing You are going to lose some conversionWhy leave app storesAccording to a study by SensorTower Apple earned  billion in revenue through the App Store in  while Google pulled in  billion Those would be enormous sums for standalone companies But for Apple this is just a portion of its total services revenue which made up  billion of the companys  billion in total revenue in Q For every app purchase made through Apples App Store or Googles Play Store the companies take a  cut leaving developers with  of the revenue from their own apps For subscription services like Netflix Apple and Google start off by taking  of the purchase for the first year but cut that back to  after  monthsFor a company like Epic Games which offers Fortnite for free but earns money on inapp purchases each  taken by Apple or Google hits its bottom line Apple makes it difficult for developers to offer their apps outside of the App Store so Epic had to stay with Apple when it launched Fortnite for iOS But Googles Android lets users download and install apps from outside of the Play Store which is why Epic can skirt that companys storefrontImportantly for companies like Netflix and especially Spotify Apple and Google have become both distributors and direct competitors for their products With Apple and Google poised to release even more of their own original content the tech giants are homing in on Netflixs business Spotify has already had to deal with Googles Play Music on Android phones and now with Apple Music preinstalled on every iPhone sold the Swedish streaming service has even more competition in its spaceSo not only do such companies have to pay Apple and Google to host their apps they also have to compete with themThe problem with leavingTo be clear Netflix and Spotify arent taking their apps off of Apples or Googles app stores Instead they are making customers who want to sign up for subscriptions called conversions move over to the services own websites But consumers are fickle and theyre less likely to sign up for a service if you throw more roadblocks in their pathAccording to Munster consumers would rather simply sign up for and pay for their subscriptions through Apple and Googles app stores because its a faster more seamless processMy guess is that theyd be giving up more than theyd be gaining because of the increased hassle Munster saidSome players like Netflix  may be a different animal where they are so good people are willing to say Thats fine Im okay with jumping over this very low hurdle but most people are lazy Munster explainedApple and Google will be fine either wayWhile Netflix and Spotify could muscle consumers into signing up for their services because they are already so ubiquitous other app developers and service providers are likely to have a much more difficult timeStory continuesI think the bottom line is that for most companies its not worth giving up the incremental user to give up  of app revenue Munster said Its kind of like someone selling on Amazon Amazons average takerate is  and as a seller you put up with it because you generate a lot of users from itNetflix says its move to test moving user subscriptions off the Apple App Store is one of many it does to improve the user experience for consumers meaning it may never be fully implemented as a permanent solutionThats not true for the Google Play Store for which Netflix stopped supporting subscription sign ups back in May If you already signed up youll still be billed through Google But if youre a new user or try to resubscribe youll be directed offsite Similarly Spotify doesnt allow for new subscribers to sign up through the Apple App StoreDespite that the moves are unlikely to impact either tech company in such a way that they would eliminate such fees or reduce them by a significant amount Both Apple and Google previously cut their fees for subscription services from the standard  to the current  after one year in  and  respectively But that  still stands for onetime purchasesMunster says the chances of Apple and Google being impacted by a handful of app developers moving away from the App Store is low In fact he believes that over time they will move back to the App StoresIf Im wrong and there ends up being a sea change where people just get comfortable to redirect to mobile websites to sign up  this is going to be a real stinger for Apples services growth If I was going to put a probability on it I would say a  chance its a low probability Munster saidMore from DanFacebooks latest scandal will leave it unscathedNew technology could

apple google samsung who steals the most ideas
Apple Google Samsung have similar ideasYahooSearchNo matching results for Tip Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsGive feedback on the new search experienceCancelSign inMailFinanceWatchlistsMy PortfolioScreenersMarketsIndustriesVideosNewsPersonal FinanceTechUS Markets closedSP Dow NasdaqRussell Crude OilGoldSilverEURUSDApple Google Samsung Who steals the most ideasDavid PogueTech CriticYahoo FinanceJune  ReblogShareTweetShareYou think people get riled up about politics and religion Try insulting someones phoneApparently a lot of people hang their identities on what phones they carry An iPhone person might feel personally affronted when a Samsung Galaxy gets a great review and vice versaThese days since all smartphones have pretty much the same features it seems to be searingly important to remember which brand had those features first Android must be better because it had a quicksettings panel before Apple did The iPhone must be better because it had Find My Phone first And so onIt seems very important to identify which phone had a feature firstMoreNow thenAccording to the law you cant copyright an idea only the expression of that idea Apple found that out the hard way when in  it filed a lawsuit accusing Microsoft of copying the Macs interface mouse windows menusand lost From that day onward blatantly ripping off other companies ideas became part of doing business Google steals Samsung steals Microsoft Facebook and Amazon steal And yes Apple stealsOn one hand why should we care Whats wrong with bringing great ideas to as many people as possibleOn the other hand I can understand the phone cultists pain Seems like a company should get credit for inventing an idea Instead it gets only a few months of exclusivity before its rivals catch upThe late Apple cofounder Steve Jobscertainly cared about idea theft Our lawsuit is saying Google you fking ripped off the iPhone wholesale ripped us off Jobs told biographer Walter Isaacson Im going to destroy Android because its a stolen product Im willing to go to thermonuclear war on this They are scared to death because they know they are guiltySo I thought After all these decades of consumers pointing the finger maybe we should settle this once and for all Which company is the biggest copycatWhat if someone with too much time on his hands were to dive into the hundreds of features that make a phone a phone and track down which company first introduced each oneYeah thatd mean months of tedious effort But think of the payoff For the first time ever wed know Wed see which company should hang its head in ripoff shameYou can probably see where this is going Thats how I spent my springThe methodologyFirst I made up a list of every major feature thats standard on smartphones today Pinchtozoom Autorotating screen Slowmo video Word suggestions above the keyboard A quick settings panel Voice assistant Voice calling Private browsing And on and onSecond I hunted down the first appearance of every feature by poring through old user manuals Wikipedia tech reviews and howto books With help from my assistant Jan Carpenter we eventually filled in a spreadsheet which you can see hereI turned the data over to David Foster infographics lead for Oath Studios who designed the timelines you see below Each one shows clearly not just which company wins each horse race but how long it took its rivals to copy each feature The timeline bars also provide a fascinating look at how smartphones have evolved since the iPhones debut in Now a few notes on this projects limitationsIve restricted the game to three players Apple Samsung and Google Some features may have appeared first in phones by smaller companies but most of the you stole that accusations involve the Big Three Especially when it comes to software features Apples iOS vs Googles Android and hardware features Apples iPhone vs Samsungs Galaxy S seriesNot all features get stolen Nobody ever copied Apples Force Touch screen idea detects how hard youre pressing or its Emergency SOS siren to use when youre being mugged Similarly to this day only Android offers desktop widgets and multiple user accounts on the phone And Samsung through the years has introduced dozens of features that nobody chose to imitate builtin heartrate sensor autoscrolling based on your head tilt This story is about features that have become universal so those features dont appear hereAlso not included Features that existed before the smartphone era like downloadable ringtones They werent Apples Samsungs or Googles ideas in the first placeEven with all of this research and documentation Im sure there will be much to argue about Does Samsungs easily fooled face recognition get credit for being first when Apples later implementation which uses depth cameras that cant be fooled by a photo is far better Should a company get credit for being the leader when the feature it introduced seems obvious and inevitable say an onscreen keyboard Should a feature be listed if two companies introduced it more or less simultaneouslyStory continuesIn all three cases Ive answered yes as I built this study As long as its an even playing fieldthe same rules apply to all three companiesthe sheer number of examples should average out any cases where one company gets the benefit of the doubtAll right ready for the results Scroll onOS FeaturesApple invented the touchscreen phone as we know it The original  iPhone brought us multitouch pinch to zoom an onscreen keyboard autorotate lists that scroll as though with momentum and the appsonaHomepage design that we all use to this dayNot surprisingly then Apple wins this category having introduced  ideas compared to Androids  and Samsungs ScreenThe screen is the first thing you notice when you turn on a phonehow big bright and gorgeous it isSamsung has spent years pushing the size envelope Its screens were the first to reach  inches then  inches then  inches diagonal Steve Jobs always favored tiny phones but eventually Apple had to admit that the public wanted bigger screens even if it meant bigger phones Samsung has led the way with OLED screens tooApple finally adopted this stunning screen technology in the iPhone XEven so Apple barely wins this category  to Text  VoiceSmartphones dont have physical keyboards So how can you quickly and accurately enter textOver the years Apple and Google have introduced one new feature after another to address this problem That includes Apples introduction of Siri even though Apple didnt create Siri inhouse and Googles introduction of a handsfree voicetriggered assistant OK Googlewhats the weatherGoogle wins this one Android  Apple CameraWhy do we even call these things phones Making calls is the last thing many people use them for The first of course is taking photos and videosBelieve it or not the first smartphones didnt have a flash didnt have a frontfacing camera and couldnt even record video How did we liveThis time the innovation rate is nearly tied Apple  Android  and Samsung PhoneNo surprise that the rate of new ideas in phone calling has slowed down recently for many of us texting and even video calling are our comms of choiceThe callingtexting score a tie Android  Apple Hardware FeaturesThe first smartphones didnt have stereo speakers GPS chips and wireless charging and werent water resistant all of that came later Kudos to Samsung for figuring out how to waterproof its phones without losing the headphone jackThe score Apple  Android  Samsung InternetThese days the internet is the whole point isnt it We expect our phones to show us websites and emails exactly as theyd appear on our laptops and desktops full of formatting photos and videos All of the features listed here are standard on smartphonesbut somebody originally dreamed each of them upThe winner Apple with  inventions Android had SecuritySecurity means protection for both the physical phonewhen you leave it somewhere or when it gets stolenand for its contents Activation lockthe iOS feature that makes it impossible to erase a stolen phone without the owners Apple ID credentialswas singlehandedly responsible for plummeting iPhone thefts around the world Why bother stealing a phone if you cant erase it and resell itThe tally here Apple brought forth three out of four of these breakthroughsWirelessLittle by little cables and cords are going away Look at the list of things that once required cables and can now happen wirelessly sending video playback from the phone to the TV listening to headphones printing sending files to other phones and computers paying at a cashier terminal and lately even chargingAndroid and iOS tie for the greatest number of cable eliminations with  apieceThe ResultsWhen the dust settles whos the winner Who innovates the most phone ideas and who steals the mostApple leads the invention category with  innovations according to our calculations Googles Android comes in second with  And Samsung brings up the rear with  innovationsNow if you count the number of times each company is listed as aFollower in the spreadsheet you discover that Apple also seems to havestolen the most ideas In part thats because Im pitting Apple against GoogleSamsung its phones use Googles software As a result no feature ever listsGoogle and Samsung as innovatorfollower or vice versa theyre always a single teamThis setup gives Apple an advantage because it has two companies to steal frombut also a disadvantage since its twoononeOf course in the end none of this tabulation really matters The real conclusion of thismassive research exercise is this whoever makes your favorite phone steals ideas They all doalways have always will Its how thebusiness runsI still hope that each time some engineering team swipes a great idea from a competitor they feel a hot little spike of shame Well hey they do it is not a satisfying reason for copying someone elses idea And Keeping Up with the Joneses is not the recipe for creating an original differentiated phone that reflects your companys philosophy and valuesIf youre among those who grow indignant when the phone you despise shows up with a feature copied from the one you love maybe its time to accept the marketplace reality that everybody rips off ideasIf nothing else youll have a lot

Quality Trails Sonos One and Google Home MaxJonathan VanianFortuneFebruary  ReblogShareTweetShareThe HomePods sound quality is very good but not as good as competing smart speakers like the Sonos One and the Home MaxThats the finding by Consumer Reports which published on Friday the early results of a comprehensive review of Apples Internetconnected speaker which costs  The speaker went on sale on Feb A number of other reviewers have praised the HomePodss sound quality compared with similar speakers like the Echo and the Google Home Fortunes Don Reisinger noted in his review that the HomePods sound was better than the Echo and Home but he conceded that the sound quality isnt something that can justify its lofty price tagIn announcing the HomePod in June Apple highlighted its sound quality in its sales pitch It was a different sales strategy than Apples rivals which instead promoted how well their respective speakers work with voiceactivated digital assistants like Amazons Alexa People use these digital assistants for things like changing the volume and to play specific songsNow that the HomePod is finally for sale newer versions of smart speakers sold by Google and Sonos are also offering better sound quality compared to older models noted Consumer Reports That puts increased pressure on Apple and its claim about the superiority of its HomePods soundThe Google Home Max which costs  and the Sonos One which costs  manages to slightly exceed the HomePods sound quality according to Consumer ReportsOverall the sound of the HomePod was a bit muddy compared with what the Sonos One and Google Home Max delivered the review said The review also noted that while the HomePod would serve many music fans well there were some flaws like the way it projects bass sounds which were a bit boomy and overemphasizedLast week Sonos cofounder and former CEO John MacFarlane briefly reviewed the HomePod via Twitter by praising the speaker and saying it handily beats a Sonos One However he said two Sonos One speakers provide better sound than one Apple HomePod of course hes hardly objective Got my HomePod First impressionsGood packaging easy setupGreat sound No clipping at volumeA little heavy on the bass Jimmy Iovine effect Handily beats a single Sonos One at full acoustically Two Sonos Ones in pair do a superior job Great start by Apple  John MacFarlane JohnLMacFarlane

SAN FRANCISCO California Reuters  Google Inc which dominates the market for Web search is developing a service that could dramatically extend the reach of its lucrative keywordbased advertising by linking such ads to email people familiar with the matter said on Friday


Privately held Google which is expected to go public later this year faces rising competition in its core search business from email providers including Yahoo Inc and MSN Microsoft Corps Internet unit


Adding an email service would provide a potential boost to Google as its technology lead in the search market seems destined to narrow and it prepares to answer to growthhungry shareholders analysts said


The Mountain View California company which has recently made several email related acquisitions is working on a way to serve advertising to an email at the moment it is opened people close to the company said


Im sure Google is getting more and more concerned about locking in users It wouldnt surprise me if they did something very sophisticated with email said Danny Sullivan editor of SearchEngineWatchcom who tracks the industry


By moving into email  the Webs mostused program  Google would open up a huge new market for its lucrative sponsored links advertising business that delivers ads tied to keywords in Web searches or on content pages analysts said


Offering its own branded email  whether for free or with enhanced services like spam filtering  would also enable Google to tie users more closely to its search site and to steal customers from rivals they said


In an email response to questions from Reuters spokesman David Krane said Google has a number of projects in the works to test monetization in various scenarios


In fact Googles AdSense contextual ads are already used in a number of email newsletters he said

Going portal

Google has for years said it would not turn its site into a fullservice Internet portal like Yahoo or MSN However since it opened in  Google has added portalstyle discussion groups and is testing a comparison shopping site called Froogle as well as a news site


Google late last year purchased rival Sprinks which had technology to deliver ads to email as the messages were opened Such realtime ad serving is important because it keeps ads fresh and insures that Google will not be giving away free ads or delivering ads nobody will see industry participants said


Kanoodle a small privately held search company in the coming weeks will roll out its own email advertising product as part of its deal with CBS MarketWatchcom said Lance Podell Kanoodles president of search and content


Under that deal sponsored link ads will be served to MarketWatchs optin subscriber emails including newsletters

Experience with sponsored links

Google already knows how to deliver its sponsored link ads  which are in the form of Web links and appear on the perimeter of Web pages  to email newsletters and content sites


Furthermore Google last year purchased an email management software maker and in  registered the domain name googlemailcom


Some in Silicon Valley also believe Google could be preparing to launch free email to compete with offerings from Yahoo and MSNs Hotmail


If they were to go the email route theyd have to provide an offering that competes with free email Antispam is one form of strong differentiation said Jim Pitkow chief executive of Moreover Technologies whose personalized search company Outride was acquired by Google in

  BEIJING China CNN  If you cant beat em join em 
Google and music companies are giving Chinese Internet users free downloads 
 Thats the idea behind Googles latest move to allow users to download free music in China Google has partnered with a Chinese company Topcn to make it happen About  music labels have joined in including the Big Four  EMI Group Sony Music Entertainment Warner Music Group and Universal Music Most Chinese users get their music for free anyway thanks to rampant online piracy Google and its partners hope the new business model will generate revenue from advertising that all will share More importantly Google wants to increase traffic and catch up to its competitor Baidu   We will provide free highquality legal downloads Google China President Li Kaifu told CNET News Not providing music was a strategic mistake on our part  Watch how Google intends to curb piracy  Baidu offers a popular search feature which despite lawsuits from many labels enables users to download music through thirdparty sites The company commands  percent of Chinas market compared with Googles  percent according to research firm Analysys International

 Will Googles move pay off Well users are already streaming songs  million times per day So far Chinese music is topping the list of most popular downloads including top artists Jolin Tsai and Liang Lin But Western music isnt far behind Favorites are My Life Would Suck Without You by Kelly Clarkson the Backstreet Boys hit I Want It That Way and Sarah Brightmans rendition of Scarborough Fair Brightman who coperformed the theme song at the opening ceremony of the  Olympics in Beijing is a longtime favorite among Chinese fans Google offers about  free songs but says more than  million will be available soon The company also provides userfriendly searching and song lyrics and recommends music based on a listeners preference Several students at a cafe in Beijing say they have tried the service I think it will bring convenience one girl said Baidu has some disadvantages and sometimes they do not have highquality music I think Google will provide a large quantity of highquality music Its no surprise that Chinas gregarious Internet community is having a heated discussion I cant find any songs I like on it one blogger wrote Its good quality but there arent enough songs another blogger said Its better than buying it though Some rushed to Googles defense You cant really compare Google with other sites because all of their music is legitimate one blogger said They pay those music labels for every download Baidu and others all use pirated music Will Baidu make the next move Actually Baidu may be threatened now said Internet analyst Duncan Clark 





 If the Chinese search site doesnt cooperate with music companies it could be seen as basically aiding and abetting pirates he added But if there is a better service offered by Google  then Google will threaten Baidu and Baidu will have to respond Clark said

   Google tries out offline Gmail featureStory Highlights Google is testing a feature that would allow users to access Gmail offline  Users could read write and search messages while not connected to the network  Google offline Gmail is almost identical to the experience you get online  Gmail works by downloading a copy of a users archive to their personal computer Next Article in Technology    By Stephen Shankland 



 


 

 
 CNET  Significantly increasing the utility and competitiveness of its Webbased email service Google is enabling an experimental ability to read write and search Gmail messages even while not connected to the network 
Google wants to allow users to access its Gmail service while not connected to the network 
 Google believes almost religiously in cloud computing the idea that computer applications and data live on the Internet rather than on PCs But there are times when the network is inaccessible and generally Webbased applications like todays Gmail effectively seize up under those circumstances Offline sidesteps that problem the classic example being a busy executive traveling on a plane And offline Gmail access begins a new chapter for Googles ambition to appeal to business customers for services such as Google Apps of which Gmail is a component This is a feature weve heard loud and clear the enterprise wants said Todd Jackson Gmails product manager Trying to sign up business customers generally means wooing them away from the dominant email products Microsofts Exchange server software and Outlook PC software Google and Microsoft began in separate spheres but are evercloser competitive rivals each with a strong cashgenerating business that can be used to subsidize forays into other markets Theres more too Google Apps customers will get another major offline option soon too Google Calendar access though not initially the ability to create new entries If the organizations administrator enables the New Features option each person within that organization will get access to the calendar Google said

 New features help make Gmail more compelling for business customers but for many a bigger problem is the fact that Gmail still sports its beta tag said Gartner analyst David Smith Thats one of the biggest stumbling blocks for businesses Smith said Youre hardpressed to find any businesses who decide to go into production with anything that a vendor calls beta no matter how good it is Google promises customers will get  percent availability through a service level agreement for Google Apps which includes Gmail Google Calendar and Google Docs Cloud vs PC  And Microsoft while not turning on a dime isnt counting on a future that consists exclusively of PCbased Office It already has a product Office Live Workspace that lets users share and viewbut not editOffice documents online and the next version of Office will run in a browser Philosophically though Microsoft remains firmly tethered to the PC while Google wants to move as fast as possible to Webbased applications We think the browser is the ideal platform for deploying all kinds of applications Thats where Google is placing its bet Jackson said But people are traditionally limited by the speed and connectivity of the Internet We want to fill in those gaps Google already developed opensource technology called Gears that helps further this cloud computing agenda by storing Web data on PC and Gmail used by millions could help coax more people to install Gears That in turn could help solve the chickenandegg problem that currently means its not worthwhile for most Web application programmers to build in Gears support Greater Gears support could help other cloudcomputing companies including Zoho which already has offline access for its Webbased email application Its not as if offline Gmail were completely impossible People can set up software such as Outlook or Thunderbird to read and write emails for example But offline Gmail means people wont have to learn a new interface Offline Gmail has been in testing for months though Jackson wouldnt share specifics about exactly how long What can offline Gmail do  We wanted the user experience to be almost identical to the experience you get when youre online Jackson said Offline Gmail stores a copy of a users inbox on a personal computer Most people will have to install it a process Google walks you through but its built into Googles Chrome browser Once Gears is installed and offline access is enabled the software automatically detects when a persons network connection is working If the network is good Gmail works as usual If its bad it goes into offline mode sending unsent messages and retrieving new ones when the connection is restored And if the network is dodgy a person can use the intermediate flaky connection mode which for example queues a message to be sent immediately by storing it to the hard drive then actually sends it as soon as it can Google positions this as useful for coffee shops and poaching a neighbors weaksignal wireless network but I think of this as tech conference mode When enabled offline Gmail begins by downloading in the background a copy of a users archive to the users personal computer But the software stores about  emails so heavy users wont get a complete archive Gmail automatically updates the local cache of messages with new and recently read items and with messages associated with a particular label on which a person has clicked Jackson said Imperfect  Not everything works though One big missing piece is the ability to add attachments to new messages though attachments are visible with existing messages Another is the contacts tab so forget about managing email lists or adding new addresses while offline The autocomplete option works though so theres no need to start remembering email addresses Englishspeaking Gmail users will be able to enable offline access as Google gradually adds the ability over the next couple of days said Gmail engineer Andy Palay in a blog post Offline Gmail is still an early experimental feature so dont be surprised if you run into some kinks that havent been completely ironed out yet Palay said What kinds of problems occur Weve seen issues with the local cache getting out of sync You have to refresh the browser and that gets you going again Jackson said In some rare circumstance it has to be fully flushed so we ask to disable and reenable the feature But these should be unusual problems he said Its been in testing for awhile on all  Googlers so its gotten some good testing

   Why the ocean matters    to GoogleStory Highlights Imaging the ocean depths via the new Google Earth  is a smart move for Google  It adds to the overall utility of the software which in the long run keeps it relevant  Ocean researchers attended Googles launch and are eager to display their data  Eventually Google wants to provide data on every single location on Earth  Next Article in Technology    By Stephen Shankland 



 


 

 
 SAN FRANCISCO California CNET  The fact that you now can explore the ocean through Google Earth isnt going to make Google much money directly But the move is nonetheless smart 
The new Google Earth  software allows users to explore the ocean depths from their computers 
 Google generated earlystage goodwill from being the best answer to the online search problem But the company is large and getting larger especially as it shows a better ability to withstand the recession than rivals and that goodwill wont last forever Google Earth though gives the company a new way to bring its brand to the world notably with students for whom the software will help supplant atlases and encyclopedias  And in the long run as Google Earth and Maps  either as standalone software or used through a browser  will likely become a widely used virtual window on the real world Google will control the technology and commercialization of that portal Will the visibility of the ocean depths on Google Earth make money directly Not likely But it adds incrementally to the overall utility of the software which in the long run keeps it relevant The nearterm opportunity is in local search for example people looking for restaurants or hotels said John Hanke director of Google Earth and Maps in an interview

 Google has begun experimenting with advertisements on Google Maps and Google Earth added Peter Birch product manager of Google Earth at the launch event  Since people often need to discover information about a place before going there Google Earth and Maps could prove a lucrative endeavor It may take years to get there and itll cost Google dearly in server hardware and network bandwidth but Google has shown patience in subsidizing longterm projects Though Hanke wouldnt reveal the expense of Googles geographic services some of the economics are in the companys favor Just as Googles search engine takes advantage of innumerable information that others put on the Internet Google Earth is a platform that houses information supplied by outsiders that Google doesnt have to pay Its the Internets usergenerated content story but this time its data that can be overlaid on a map of the Earth And in the case of the ocean work there are prestigious users generating highquality content Many ocean researchers gathered at the Google Earth  launch and several showed theres pentup demand for a way to conveniently display their data somewhere And its not just to share sea surface temperature data with fellow PhDs but also to try to educate the public Ken Peterson communications director for the Monterey Bay Aquarium was excited about his layer in Google Earth that shows the location of various types of fish  along with ratings for people about whether they should eat those varieties or substitute others  Barbara Block of Stanford University and Patrick Halpin of Duke University were eager to show the tracks of shark travels recorded by radio transmission to satellites Ross Swick of the University of ColoradoBoulder showed a Google Earth animation of the gradually shrinking Arctic ice cap over the last  years  And Philip Renaud of the Living Oceans Foundation has supplied underwater video of the Red Sea as part of the foundations mission to chronicle the state of coral reefs Hanke envisions much broader information though including consumeroriented material such as the best dive spots and kitesurfing areas Ultimately he wants every single location on Earth land or sea to have information Were trying to encourage our users to annotate all the places in the world Part of what were doing is seeding that ecosystem of spatial information Hanke said  That creates an opportunity for Google to provide location services on phones mobile devices in cars in the future to guide people to the best places Being a valued guide the goto source of information about the best places to go  that will be a powerful and valuable thing for Google Think of it as a second Internet in a way only instead of using abstract names to locate information you can use actual locations to locate information Some refer to the idea as the geographic Web The clearest illustration of the indirect benefits Google Earth can bring is the fact that the company could persuade former Vice President Al Gore whose climate change documentary won him an Oscar and a Nobel Peace Prize to bear the Google Earth standard In effect he provided an ecohalo that can offset the more downtoearth capitalistic realities of Googles operation Google seems to share the altruistic educational motivations of many researchers But its also got business in mind with Google Earth We try to create products people love to use Birch said We create value then think of appropriate ways of monetization

 CNET  Just because the Internet has broken down geographic barriers dont assume that Google doesnt care about geography 
With Googles new Latitude software cell phone users can share their locations with others 
 The company plans to launch software called Latitude on Wednesday that lets mobile phone users share their location with close contacts Google hopes it will help people find each other while out and about and to keep track of loved ones What Google Latitude does is allow you to share that location with friends and family members and likewise be able to see friends and family members locations said Steve Lee product manager for Google Latitude For example a girlfriend could use it to see if her boyfriend has arrived at a restaurant and if not how far away he is To protect privacy Google specifically requires people to sign up for the service People can share their precise location the city theyre in or nothing at all What we found in testing is that the most common scenario is a symmetrical arrangement where both people are sharing with each other Lee said

 The software spotlights Googles fixation with mapping and location technology Location is an important part of navigating the real world and Google clearly sees its geographic services as a way to establish a more personal connection with customers who today use Google chiefly for the virtual realm of the Internet  And of course money is involved too Google hopes its mapping technology will lead to locationbased advertising revenue Googles power is firmly lodged in search and search advertising but the company is trying to expand to broader online services too That includes online documents and various aspects of social networking which are much more personal services and ones that put Google into more direct competition with rivals such as Microsoft Facebook and Yahoo Like using Google profiles to contact information with select contacts using Google Latitude tells Google whos who in your social graph How it works  Latitude is part of Google Maps for Mobile the companys mapping software for mobile phones but also can be used through a gadget loaded onto its iGoogle customized home page Itll work in  countries at launch Google said Initially it will work on most colorscreen BlackBerry phones most phones with Windows Mobile  or later and most Symbianbased devices such as Nokia smartphones An update to the Google Android operating system now being distributed to the TMobile G phone also enables it and iPhone and iPod Touch users will get the option very soon Lee said Latitude uses Googles technology to judge a users location not just by GPS satellite but also by proximity to mobile phone towers and wireless networks Thats a much more automated approach than the manual checkin process used by Dodgeball a service that Google decided in January to shut down Other competitors exist though BrightKite and Loopt offer mechanisms for people to find each other by mobile phone for example Then theres MobiFriends Tripit and Dopplr And Googles clearest competitor Yahoo offers some competition with Fire Eagle That service doesnt provide location information but it does provide a mechanism to centralize peoples geographic privacy choices in effect taking care of some of the social graph management when it comes to location information To use the service you need a Google account to record who has permission to see your location For choosing who gets to see your location you can use contacts stored with Gmail or Picasa Google said The white lie  With the service you can hide from specific people or disappear altogether And you can manually set a specific location if for example your phone cant show it with sufficient precision or if you wish to tell someone a white lie about whether you really arent going to go to the candy store Google envisions two broad classes of people with whom you might want to share location information First is a small closeknit circle of friends and family with whom youre willing to share your exact spot Second is a larger group with whom youre happy to share citylevel detail convenient for finding out when somebodys in town but not much more When somebody is close the software lets you contact the person various waysby calling or sending an email or text message for example It also lets you hide from that specific person Privacy is of course a significant concern when it comes to sharing this sort of information If you want to use Latitude you must specifically enable the service Meeting your pals at a bar is an obvious example of the softwares possibilities but there are softer cases I see as useful too   Lee pointed to a case where a friends girlfriend though far away in Seattle will virtually place herself next to him That sounds a little sappy for my tastes but I can still relate My wife is on the other side of the country right now and it would be heartwarming to see just where iReportcom Share your thoughts on Google Latitude There are a lot of occasions where technology is better for maintaining relationships than it is for establishing them and this looks like one to me

 CNET  Universal Music Group and Google are now partners in the musicvideo business 
YouTube and Universal Music Group are joining to create Vevo a new music video site set to launch later this year 
 The largest of the four top recording companies and YouTubes parent company announced on Thursday that they are working together on Vevo a new music and video entertainment service set to launch later this year YouTube will handle the technology while Universal Music supplies the content The two companies will share ad revenue The companies said and at this point it appears that Universals content and artists will be the only label represented on the site However Doug Morris Universal Musics chief executive said in a conference call with the media that he is in negotiations with other top record labels and is confident they will join Google CEO Eric Schmidt said on the same conference call that YouTube and Universal Music have renewed their existing licensing agreement YouTube will continue to be licensed to allow visitors to use songs from Universal Music Professionally made videos from the label will only appear on Vevo the companies said This is the first time that YouTube has launched a satellite Web site Schmidt said but he added that he hopes there will be more

 For Universal Music the move means that Morris has obtained the standalone musicvideo service that he has long wished for Ever since MTV became a cultural force and huge financial success by offering music videos on TV the record industry realized that it goofed in thinking of music videos as a promotional tool Morris has said that in this era of declining revenue in the sector he doesnt see anything as promotional and argues that music videos are worth cash In September CNET reported that Morris was looking for a way to build his own video site It appears now that Morris already had the partner he needed in Google Sources close to Universal Music said last year that Morris wanted his artists videos to be given a higher profile and presented to viewers with higherquality video than what YouTube offered But where could he go to find an audience as gigantic as YouTubes Vevo undoubtedly will have what Morris wanted For Google which acquired YouTube in  the agreement continues the companys streak of signing partnerships with top entertainment companies For the past year YouTube has been steadily shedding its rogue reputation among music film and TV companies On Monday CNET reported that Sony Pictures is in talks about licensing some fulllength films to YouTube When it comes to challenges the new joint venture faces plenty While Universal Musics YouTube is by far the largest on the site with nearly  billion views nobody knows for sure whether a standalone musicvideo site can attract a big audience or ad revenue The question is whether Universal Musics content is attracting viewers to YouTube or whether visitors stumble on to the videos while they are already on YouTube Either way the companies say they are confident that the site wont have any trouble drawing fans We believe that at launch Vevo will already have more traffic than any other music video site in the United States and in the world Morris said in a statement presumably referring to the traffic Universal sees at its YouTube channel And this traffic represents the most sought after demographic for advertisers especially as advertising dollars continue their shift from old media to new

  New search engines aspire to supplement GoogleStory Highlights New search engines try to make searches faster smarter more personal  Wolfram Alpha which launches this month acts as a powerful calculator  Others are trying to make searches more visual instead of textbased Next Article in Technology   Read VIDEOTIMELINE  By  John D Sutter CNN 



 


 

  CNN  We may be coming upon a new era for the Internet search 
Google dominates the search world but some sites are trying to expand the possibilities 
 And despite what you may think Google is not the only player New search engines that are popping up across the Web strive to make searches faster smarter more personal and more visually interesting         Some sites like Twine and hakia will try to personalize searches separating out results you would find interesting based on your Web use Others like Searchme offer iTuneslike interfaces that let users shuffle through photos and images instead of the standard list of hyperlinks Kosmix bundles information by type  from Twitter from Facebook from blogs from the government  to make it easier to consume Wolfram Alpha set to launch Monday is more of an enormous calculator than a search It crunches data to come up with query answers that may not exist online until you search for them And sites like Twitter are trying to capitalize on the warpspeed pace of online news today by offering realtime searches of online chatter  something Googles computers have yet to replicate Google of course remains the search king Recent efforts to revolutionize Web searching have failed to unseat the dominant California company which captures nearly  percent of US online searches according to comScore Tech startups like Cuil which billed itself as more powerful than Google and Wikia which relied on a community to rank search results rather than a math formula have largely faded away after some initial buzz  Timeline the history of searching for data  The general trend has been relatively clear and consistent for the past five years Google is growing its market share at the expense of every other engine said Graham Mudd vice president for search and social media at comScore a company that tracks industry trends

 The new class of search engines and data calculators enters the fray with those failures in mind though Instead of trying to be Google killers these sites have more humble aspirations to be alternatives to the industry giants  Realtime searches offer the most promise Mudd said If you search Google news the results will be recent but not live Thats where Twitters search comes in It searches the sites microblog posts by the second allowing users to see whats buzzing on the Web at any instant Facebook and FriendFeed also are experimenting with realtime searches according to news reports But each of these searches operates only within its own social network Scoopler is another realtime site thats trying to aggregate info from all of these sites     And all of these are seeing more competition as two new sites  TweetMeme and OneRiot  launched new or updated realtime searches on Tuesday Nova Spivack a technology developer who writes about search engines said sites that forecast trendy topics will become more prominent Knowing what will be trendy tomorrow is becoming valuable to more people he said Search trend predictions will be valuable to people interested in news in much the same way as stock forecasts are valuable to financial industry workers The topography of the Web is shifting much faster Instead of happening kind of glacially youre on the beach right where the water is coming in and its constantly changing the way the sand is laid out he said Other search sites are just trying to get smarter with some acting as giant data crunchers   The muchtalked about Wolfram Alpha or Alpha for short harnesses massive computing power to answer users questions even if theyre never been answered on the Web before  Watch a Wired editor discuss the site  Its not a new Google Its not supposed to be Its a new thing Its very complementary in a way to what search engines do said Theodore Gray cofounder of Wolfram Research which created Alpha People need to get away from the idea that every inchlong search bar online acts just like Google and Yahoo he said If you ask Google a question the search engines computers scan the Web for matching search terms and come up with answers that make the most sense statistically Alpha by contrast pulls information from existing data sets that have been approved by the sites mathminded staff The site then computes an answer to your question An example will help this make sense   Say you wanted to find out nutritional information for your favorite recipe On Google you would have to search each ingredient individually and then add the calories and fat grams together yourself With Alpha you can type in the full recipe and the site produces a completed graphic that looks like it came right off the side of a cereal box Read about a CNN test of Alpha Some search sites are trying to get better at understanding what their users want Twine a social site created by Spivack soon will start incorporating information about its users into a search function he said Some of the information comes through a users search history The site also will ask users to rank search results by their relevance to your interests Right now one of the problems with search is that its really onesizefitsall Its not very personalized Spivack said The fact is when Im searching for certain kinds of things the way that the results should be ranked might quite be different than if someone with a very different background or interests was searching for those same things So if youre someone who is into heavy science a search about evolution might yield more academic papers If youre a person whose Web interests lean more toward pop culture an evolution search might turn up photos and more basic information Helping computers understand the information thats online is the next step in making searches more personal Spivack said Its unclear which companies if any will be able to accomplish this but Google appears to be working on that problem as well as others At an event on Tuesday Google announced a new show options feature as part of its search Users can use the function to see new ways search results are linked such as through timelines or a Wonder Wheel which displays visual relationships between search terms   And in a staff letter published last week on Googles blog company cofounder Sergey Brin wrote about making searches more intelligent  





 Perfect search requires humanlevel artificial intelligence which many of us believe is still quite distant he wrote However I think it will soon be possible to have a search engine that understands more of the queries and documents than we do today  Others claim to have accomplished this and Googles systems have more smarts behind the curtains than may be apparent from the outside but the field as a whole is still shy of where I would have expected it to be

  Microsoft Google expand searchengine toolsStory Highlights Microsoft and Google released new search products this week  Microsoft Bings visual search features images instead of text  Googles Fast Flip aims to replicate the magazine reading experience online  Products are evidence that searchengine market is diversifying Next Article in Technology   Read VIDEO  By  John D Sutter and Brandon Griggs CNN 



 


 

  CNN  Say youre buying a dog You know the breed you want you can picture it in your head But what was the name A bull terrier A pit bull A bull mastiff 

Bings visual search and Googles Fast Flip produce search results as images 


 Or what if youre in the market for a new camera You saw a friend with a creditcardthin model at a party last weekend But was that a Canon A Nikon A brand youve never heard of If youre like many people youd turn to the Internet for answers But you type in dog breeds or digital cameras into Google and punch enter and a big list of blue links comes up You dont see the dog you want You dont find the camera either  at least not quickly    Such quandaries are the driving force behind Bings new visual search function which lets Web users troll through image catalogues instead of Web pages when they know what something looks like but cant put their finger on the name The examples are also evidence that the search engine market once dominated by simple rectangular search bars and the lists of Web pages that follow is diversifying People who once were happy with a onesearchfitsall model are finding exceptions and a number of niche search products are trying to respond to these increasingly diverse needs   Also this week Google introduced a test product called Fast Flip which takes a retro look at Web design by making online news look like something magazine readers will find familiar

 The company has other news products  namely Google Reader and Google News  but is looking for ways to make news content more visual and to share some of the revenue The new products come as Microsofts Bing continues to elbow for more room in an online search market that Google has dominated for years In June  percent of all Internet searchers were done through Google sites according to comScore Microsoft caught only  percent of searchers in the same period Fast Flip an experimental feature of Google Labs is a Web application that allows users to scan news articles from  print and online publishers including The New York Times Newsweek TechCrunch and Us magazine Users can flip through a horizontal stream of screen grabs of articles as they appear on the partners Web sites with layout design and images intact You can click once on a story to enlarge the page a second click takes you to the partners site Users also can browse popular topics the economy Taylor Swift or search for others of their choosing Google says the idea behind the new service is to make online newsbrowsing faster and replicate the reading experience of flipping through a magazine or newspaper  Unlike Google News which emphasizes breaking news articles from the past  hours Fast Flip is more for stories with a longer shelf life Google spokesman Chris Gaither said We think theres a lot of room for innovation in how people consume news articles on the Web Gaither said The easier it is for people to browse articles quickly the more theyll read   Loren Baker editor of Search Engine Journal says that increases in bandwidth make visual search functions more successful today than in previous years when images would load more slowly Baker believes that Google Fast Flip could make it easier for people to scan news articles on their netbooks tablets or even smartphones I dont have to sift through my bookmarks I dont even have to leave Google he said Its almost like a virtual newsstand on my handheld But not everyone is excited about Googles new product   If this is the future of news I think news is kind of screwed said Frederic Lardinois a writer at ReadWriteWeb a technology blog Lardinois said the interface is backwardthinking and is hard to use Fast Flip is in a test phase and will incorporate feedback from users Gaither said Google also is seeking to expand the roster of Fast Flip partners he said Some tech observers say Bings hypervisual search function gives it a new leg up on Google in terms of functionality  Nova Spivack a search expert and founder of Twine said the most important thing about Bings visual search is that users can sort the images into categories  By creating different kinds of searches and making them sortable Bing is catering to highend Internet users  which soon will be everyone he said I think Bing has realized that everybody is becoming a search geek he said  On the dogbreed search example users can filter the images to include only terriers or hypoallergenic dogs or toy dogs or dogs that need a medium level of exercise so they dont have to scroll through hundreds of photos to find the dog theyre searching for   Mary Jo Foley editor of the All About Microsoft blog at ZDNet said she personally finds Bings visual search useless because shes not a visually minded person But she said its an example of search engines diversifying and thats a good thing for everyone I think the idea for Microsoft and Google and Yahoo is to present things in new ways and say What if you could do this Would you want to do it this way  She added Not all people search in the same way and not all people want to get their results in the same way There are about  galleries of images in the new Bing visual search bin but more will be added and eventually the idea will be integrated into the main search site said Stefan Weitz director of Bing Right now users have to go to a separate page to find the visual searches 





 David Coursey a blogger at PCWorldcom said the search works like a visual dictionary I think Bing is onto something he said And if they can figure out how to extend Bings visual search it could be very helpful for people who know what something looks like but dont know what to call it

The Google incident is just an individual action taken by one company  I cant see its impact on SinoUS relations unless someone wants to politicize it said Qin Gang ministry spokesperson I cannot see its impact on Chinas international image unless someone wants to make an issue of it Qin added It is not China that has undermined its image but rather it is the Google company itself The government wouldnt comment whether Googles actions were legal or if the government planned further action The next move may be for China to block access to Googlecn  as it has done for Web sites like Facebook YouTube and Twitter Google quits censoring search in China We very much hope that the Chinese government respects our decision though we are well aware that it could at any time block access to our services David Drummond Googles chief legal officer wrote in a statement posted on the companys official blog As of  pm ET Google users in China could still access Googlecn but results on politically sensitive search terms such as Tiananmen Square massacre or the outlawed religious group Falun Gong were being blocked when searched from Beijing  suggesting that although Google is no longer self censoring China state censors of the Great Firewall may be GoogleChina move hurts businesses academics A similar search in Hong Kong however successfully loads searches for controversial terms Google indicated yesterday in a blog post that using the Hong Kong site could be patchy or slow due to so much traffic being redirected to its servers there Google made the announcement on its Web site at  am local Beijing time  pm ET China Daily a staterun media organization responded with a story four hours later quoting an unnamed official from the Internet bureau under the State Council Information Office Google has violated its written promise it made when entering the Chinese market by stopping filtering its searching service and blaming China in insinuation for alleged hacker attacks said the official This is totally wrong Were uncompromisingly opposed to the politicization of commercial issues and express our discontent and indignation to Google for its unreasonable accusations and conducts the official said Instead of shuttering its operations in China Google plans to continue operating there We intend to continue RD work in China and also to maintain a sales presence there though the size of the sales team will obviously be partially dependent on the ability of mainland Chinese users to access Googlecomhk wrote Drummond of Google The company on Monday also launched a dashboard page which it promises to update regularly each day that will show which Google services are available in China According to the page YouTube Google Sites and Googles Blogger apps were blocked with some others partially blocked such as PicasaKevin Voigt reported from Hong Kong and Lara Farrar reported from Beijing

 Waiting game in GoogleChina sagaBy  Lara Farrar for CNN    The spat between Google and Beijing may soon come to a close as the search giant awaits word whether its license to operate there will be renewed STORY HIGHLIGHTSGoogle is awaiting a decision on renewal of its license in ChinaGoogleChina spat began in January over cyber attacks on the firmSince March googlecn redirected users to its Hong Kong siteIf the license is not renewed googlecn will go dark Beijing China CNN  The saga for Googles operations in China continues as the search giant awaits a decision from Beijing on whether its operating license will be renewed Guxiang the company that runs Googles websites in China has submitted its renewal application to the government pledging to abide by Chinese law the staterun Xinhua news agency reported The application was due Wednesday for the license A quick reply is expected soon and Google was late in submitting the documents Xinhua reported citing an unnamed official from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology which issues the licenses In a blog post published Monday night David Drummond Googles chief legal officer said Google would stop redirecting users to its Hong Kong search engine instead taking them to a googlecn landing page that contains a link to googlecomhk  a technical step seen as a move to placate Beijings concerns In January Google said it no longer wanted to cooperate with Chinas Web filtering following attacks from hackers that the company said it traced to China On March  it announced it would redirect users to its uncensored Hong Kong search site

While googlecn has remained accessible from the mainland government filters have blocked sensitive queries made on the site On Thursday there were reports that the Google suggest search feature was not available to Chinese users The feature offers possible search results as users type queries Its clear from conversations we have had with Chinese government officials that they find the redirect unacceptable  and that if we continue redirecting users our Internet Content Provider license will not be renewed Drummond wrote This approach ensures we stay true to our commitment not to censor our results on googlecn and gives users access to all of our services from one page Without an ICP license we cant operate a commercial website like googlecn  so Google would effectively go dark in China Drummond said Yet whether Googles move to effectively relaunch googlecn will be enough to appease government regulators who were unimpressed by the March  redirect is unclear Google was not included on a list of companies released Wednesday by the State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping that Beijing plans to approve to provide online mapping services in the country More than  companies were on the list including Baidu Chinas largest search provider At a press conference Thursday Qin Gang a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said all internet companies in China including international companies should abide by Chinese laws Whether googlecn will continue to operate in China is hard to say at this point said Edward Yu head of Analysys International a Beijingbased research firm The Chinese government often makes their decisions basically in a way that is not transparent It is very hard to judge at this point What Google can do is wait for the process and they need to further understand how consumers react Yu said So far we think it is a negative blow to Google China Google which has been operating in China since  had built up a  percent share of ad revenues in China and around a  percent share of users according to Analysys While those shares dropped slightly after Googles January announcement they have stabilized in the second quarter Yu said We need to see what kind of damage they are looking at and how this damage will effect their revenue he said

Editors note Fareed Zakaria is an author and foreign affairs analyst who hosts Fareed Zakaria GPS on CNN US on Sundays at  and  pm ET and CNN International  pm and  pm CET   pm Abu Dhabi   pm HK  New York CNN  Googles threat to shut down its operations in China might seem like just a dispute between a private company and a government but the implications are huge for the worlds fastestgrowing economy for the United States and for global relations says analyst Fareed Zakaria With the dispute in the background Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Thursday the US is committed to freedom of speech online and to freedom from the fear of cyberattacks  The GoogleChina dispute surfaced January  when the search engine company said it and other companies were the target of cyberattacks originating in China aimed at gaining access to the email of Chinese advocates for human rights Google announced that it is no longer willing to comply with Chinas requirements that it censor the results of searches in that country The State Department has told China it is concerned about the issue Zakaria author and host of CNNs Fareed Zakaria GPS spoke to CNN Wednesday CNN Whats the dispute between Google and China all about Fareed Zakaria At one level the dispute is about one company and the difficulty its having doing business in China but its really a much broader issue Its about two things really The first is the tension between Chinas drive for modernity and its attempt to control information China has very successfully modernized over the last few decades but it places unique limits on information Eric Schmidt the CEO of Google told me that China is the only country in the world where they had to basically sign up for a censorship regime The second issue Is China turning inward Is it beginning to believe it needs the world less than it has in the past few decades That would have very profound consequences both for ChinaUS relations and for the world CNN What gives you the feeling that China might be turning inward Zakaria Its not just the problems theyve had with Google Over the last few years theres been the rise in China of what the Chinese call The new right a group of people fairly influential in the establishment who argue that China should be more aggressive toward the West more aggressive toward America that it doesnt need the US as much as it did There is also the reality that Chinas economy as it has grown is becoming large enough that China doesnt depend as much on the rest of the world for exports It has accumulated huge surpluses of capital All of this is producing a China that is more parochial more inwardlooking and potentially more adversarial in its relationships with the West If you look at the way it handled the Copenhagen summit its really quite striking The Chinese are usually protocolobsessed And here they had a situation where Obama wanted to meet with Wen Jiabao the Chinese leader who was there Now Obama technically outranks Wen Jiabao because he is a head of state Wen Jiabao is the premier the prime minister Ordinarily that would mean that Wen Jiabao would go to see Obama The reverse happened and Obama attended the meetings Chinese officials scolded him All of this is very unusual CNN In a sense Google is raising a broader issue than the immediate issue they uncovered They uncovered evidence that there was hacking of their sites and those of other American companies But rather than deal with the hacking issue they brought up the whole issue of having to have a filtered search engine in China Theyre saying theyre no longer willing to do that So whats their real motivation Zakaria Having spoken to Eric Schmidt for years about this they were always uncomfortable with the system of censorship they had to sign up to in China But they believed at the end of the day that it was a huge market and they could do well and it could help open up information in China  I think they came to the conclusion that China has such an elaborate apparatus of censorship but also an elaborate apparatus of cyberwarfare or cyberattack They were really not able to have that broader beneficial effect Lets remember that China doesnt only have whats called the great firewall of China the filtering and censoring system They also have a very aggressive system of cyberspying and cyberattack probably the most sophisticated in the world I should point out there are people who say Google did this because they werent doing well in China that they had lost market share to Baidu a local Web search engine Baidu is definitely the leader but it doesnt make any sense to quit a market because youre not the market leader By the way Google is not dominant in other countries and they still participate I take them at face value that this was a decision prompted by values You wouldnt give up whatever percent of the worlds fastestgrowing market for no rhyme or reason They clearly were uncomfortable with this tension between their mission  which they see as widening access to information everywhere all the time  and Chinas very elaborate set of constraints on information By the way theres a national security component for this for the United States and other countries Cyberspying is clearly an effort by the Chinese to move into the information age and adopt a kind of asymmetrical warfare China is not matching the US military ship for ship but if it develops a very sophisticated capability to destroy command and control systems computer systems thats a very potent weapon in any kind of conflict military or otherwise CNN Getting back to Googles motivation you do take their Dont be evil motto at face value Zakaria I dont know if I take it in all places and at all times but I do believe in this case they were motivated largely by the sense that they were undermining their values and their mission I recognize that were this to have been churning out billions of dollars in revenue they might not have done it But I dont think you can make the case that there was a business motivation for this This will clearly cost them revenue it may not cost them a huge amount of revenue but it will cost them CNN How do we know that the hacking is being done by the Chinese government rather than by individual hackers on their own Zakaria We dont know that for sure In fact Eric Schmidt was clear to me about that The nature of the hacking the coordinated elements of it the targets all suggest that it is something that is being done at the very least with the acquiescence or encouragement of the state There are very few experts Ive talked to who doubt that much of this has the backing of the Chinese government but to be clear its very difficult to tell and theres no conclusive proof CNN All of this suggests that the US government has a lot at stake and yet they dont seem to have been on the frontlines of this issue Its a private company dealing with the Chinese government not a governmenttogovernment issue Zakaria Thats right Washington is treading very cautiously into this and I think correctly because this is really a dispute between China and a private company in America The US government should watch it with great interest and concern and they should come out in favor of certain broad principles but I dont think the US government should be out there trying to open up the market for Google CNN On the national security side should the government be more active Zakaria Its trying to figure out how to respond to this kind of attack but I gather there is a fairly sustained effort now in the government Obama has made this a top priority CNN Whats at stake for other American businesses that want to serve the Chinese market Zakaria I think a lot is at stake because what were basically talking about is Chinas orientation Chinas belief that it has to accept a global system and an open global economy that it benefits from having foreign companies participate on an equal footing The more China turns inward the more difficult it will be for American companies to find equal footing in China The Chinese are making it increasingly clear they want to have national champions Avatar opened in China to great success and two weeks later they basically shut it down except for D showings and said that the movie theaters had to make way for a biopic about Confucius and more importantly keep theaters free for Chinesemade movies CNN So what can the United States do about it Zakaria Washington should try to have a really sustained strategic dialogue with China but also with our other allies with the European countries with Japan and create a kind of common front for openness and greater engagement with the global system One of the things that has helped the global system enormously is that it had two hegemons two global superpowers  first Britain and then the United States  that were very outwardoriented and shared universal values and similar conceptions of a global system open liberal values an open economy a common understanding of what would make for a good global system If China as the great rising power turns out to be much more insular parochial in its orientation that would mean a much less stable much less open world order Think about the period of American isolationism when the United States was the rising power and it turned inward in the s and s It was not good for the world CNN Can the Chinese government continue to limit expression of political views as its economy grows and the Web becomes an ever more important medium of communication worldwide Zakaria Thats the trilliondollar question So far China has been remarkably successful at maintaining a system that has embraced markets but also maintained a very controlled political system My own view is that that cannot last forever but that China is still in the early stages of modernization and it is quite possible that it will be able to continue doing this for several decades But I think its very difficult to imagine China being a truly innovative country at the cutting edge of the information age of global economics if it has all these constraints on information all this political control on humantohuman contact which is what the next wave of the information age is all about Ultimately the question is Can China be a world leader that is admired imitated and that shapes the global system and global values There I have my doubts that an insular inwardlooking China that maintains tight political control over information and human contact will end up being the country that becomes the model for the world

Editors note Christopher Wolf is a lawyer specializing in privacy and Internet law at Hogan  Hartson and is chair of the Internet Task Force of the AntiDefamation League  Washington CNN  The Internet is awash with hate It is the favorite tool of racists antiSemites homophobes and other bigots They host Web sites upload videos and post comments intended to propagate the lies of prejudice to recruit likeminded haters to mislead children and to hurt minorities Online culture has made it acceptable for even nice people to do hateful things which is why we have an epidemic of cyberbullying And the platforms of Google an Internet giant serve as a major transport vehicle for hate speech of all kinds But does that mean that Google executives deserve a jail sentence for what online haters post through its services Absolutely not Unfortunately an Italian judge found otherwise last week and has convicted three Google executives for violating Italys privacy code The offense A misguided user of a Google video service  a predecessor to YouTube  uploaded a video showing the bullying of a disabled youth When Google received a formal complaint about the video from Italian police it took the video down within hours But the judge in Milan found that under Italian law Google had a legal duty to prevent the posting of the video that invaded the victims privacy and dignity and he imposed a suspended jail sentence and fines on them and their company Google plans to appeal Such a conviction is unimaginable in the United States The First Amendment prevents the criminalization of even the most repugnant speech except in very limited circumstances Moreover early in the Internet era Congress passed a law immunizing Web companies for the content posted by third parties other than copyrighted material That law has allowed blogs and video uploads to flourish empowering individuals to become publishers It is fair to say that the culture of free speech in the United States has allowed the Internet to become the powerful tool of communication education and entertainment that it is today If legal constraints such as the Italian prosecution of Google become the online norm companies will be forced to restrict how people use the tools of the Internet The threat of liability not just fines but jail time will create too much risk And the Internet will be the poorer for it Moreover it may be technologically impossible to monitor and filter the thousands of videos posted to YouTube every hour At the same time hatemongers will find a way to stay online while ordinary users are thwarted Time after time we have seen how the enforcement of speech codes in Europe against hate sites has resulted in the temporary takedown of offending content  and its subsequent reappearance from hosting sites in the United States But that does not mean we should throw up our hands and simply accept online hate as something that will always infect the Internet There is a role for Internet users for Internet companies and for educators We should speak up when we see hate sites explain to our kids what they are seeing and counter the vicious lies Those offering Internet services with terms of use that prohibit hate speech should enforce those terms and remove offending content That is exactly what Google did in the Italian case The same US law that provides Internet companies with immunity from liability for the posting of thirdparty content allows those companies to edit and remove offensive speech  even speech that might have First Amendment protection but which the company deems to be repugnant because it is hatefilled It is also time for Internet education to be required in all schools to teach kids how to filter what they are seeing and to reject hate online The epidemic of cyberbullying alone should inspire such attention to kids use of the Internet The Italian conviction in the Google case may have a silver lining It has shined attention on the often overlooked problem of hate on the Internet and spurred those of us concerned with how the Internet evolves to work even harder to fight the scourge of online hate speech The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Christopher Wolf

 Google vs China Free speech finances or bothBy  Doug Gross CNN    A man walks past the Google Chinese logo at the companys office in Shanghai China on Wednesday STORY HIGHLIGHTS Activists applaud Googles demand for free access to information in China Google threatens to leave China after it was victim of highly sophisticated hacking Google trails in Chinese market while its filtered operation there hurt its Dont be evil image China says Chinese Web users will be the victims if Google leaves  CNN  Googles announcement that China should either stop censoring Internet searches or risk a pullout by the searchengine giant rocked the online world Wednesday leaving observers to break down the meaning of the provocative move By standing up to the communist regime Google fashioned itself a champion of free speech  a mantle the Californiabased company has wrapped itself in even as its decision to allow only limited results in China drew criticism But while many applauded Googles bold stance others questioned whether finances may have had as much to do with its move as freedoms Google said Tuesday that the company and at least  others were victims of a highly sophisticated and targeted attack originating in China in midDecember evidently to gain access to the email accounts of Chinese human rights activists  A Google spokesman said intellectual property was stolen in the attack while declining specifically to say what kind But the company said the attacker or attackers gained access to the header  or subjectline information  from the emails of two human rights activists through the Google network  Do you think Google should leave China

The contents of the emails were not accessed the spokesman said  As a result the company said it is no longer willing to abide by the filters that the Chinese government demanded on certain searches before allowing Google to operate in the country Wed like to talk to the government about the ability to operate an unfiltered search engine in China and that would be our preferred outcome Google chief legal officer David Drummond said in an interview Tuesday with CNN  However if thats not possible then well have to consider other alternatives which could include shutting down the local site or even closing down our offices entirely Google officials acknowledge that since it started operating in China in  thousands of search terms have been censored there Within hours of Tuesday nights announcement Googlecn was retrieving results for sensitive topics including the  crackdown at Tiananmen Square the Dalai Lama and the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement in China Advocates of Internet freedom cheered the move Googles decision to filter itself in China in the first place was likely the most controversial in the history of the searchengine leader  whose stock in trade is unfettered access to information and whose unofficial slogan is Dont be evil Its a move that in the past has been highly criticized said Rhea Drysdale who handles searchengine issues for Internet marketing company Outspoken Media As a search marketer myself its not something that weve really agreed with Google has argued that moving into China allowed Chinese users at least limited access to information Workarounds by savvy Chinese users particularly political dissidents have at times found loopholes in the sites filters Weve always had a strong value of free expression and free access to information Drummond said And we decided to go into China a few years ago because we thought our being there could help to open things up there and to help open access to information  But what I think weve seen is that the environment in China on the Internet has gotten more restrictive not less restrictive 
We just no longer in good conscience can continue to censor our results Google legal officer David Drummond

Standing up to China Drysdale said buys Google lots of goodwill in the online community The company had taken some heat online after CEO Eric Schmidt in an interview with CNBC defended Googles practices of gathering information in the wake of complaints about privacy When Eric made that comment it shook a lot of confidence in Google Drysdale said Now actually coming out and saying that theyre not going to allow censorship to happen anymore in Chinese search results is a very strong stance And I think it restores a lot of faith Others were wondering if there wasnt more to the story though Kit Eaton a digital technology columnist for business magazine Fast Company wrote Wednesday that finances almost certainly played a role in the allornothing gambit Everything seems to be extremely positive  everyone is waving their hands in the air and saying Go Google Its a blow for human rights  Eaton told CNN But no one has really analyzed why For one thing Google has not managed to dominate the searchengine market in China as it has in the rest of the world Beijingbased Baidu was claiming it had  percent of the market share in that country in the third quarter of last year according to Fortune magazine with Google pulling about  percent Analysts said less than  percent of Googles revenue comes from China Best known for its search engine Google also provides other computer services including email online mapping social networking and operating systems for mobile phones I think wed be daft to think that someone or other some finance guys havent sat down and looked at the financial situation in China and said You know what This isnt going to work out  Eaton said By reacting to the Chinese hacking incident  which Google says it has tightened security to prevent  the company can save face while doing something it was considering anyway he said Pulling out of China may be a way to score a huge PR hit Eaton said It looks good if Google say looks for some sort of government regulation approval inside the States in the future But Danny Sullivan editor in chief of the Search Engine Land blog said that Google was making good money in China and was steadily growing its share of the market He called suggestions that Google is considering pulling out of China because of money cynical saying that the mobile phone market was opening up for its Android operating system and that studies show Google has been earning more per search than Baidu I think they were more successful than people are giving them credit for Sullivan said They were not such losers that they decided We better get out and heres a good excuse  For its part the Chinese government said Wednesday that it welcomes foreign Webbased enterprises and is working to promote sound development of the Internet  The Internet in China is open said Xi Yanchun a Chinese Embassy spokesman It is illegal to assault the Internet China welcomes foreign Internet enterprises to do business legally in China In the Englishlanguage version of the staterun Xinhua news a Chinese official highlighted the  Chinese jobs that would be lost if Google pulled out  Xinhua quoted Guo Ke a communications professor at Shanghai International Studies University saying it would be almost impossible for Google to quit China and that the government would never back down on censorship It will not make any difference to the government if Google quits China however Google will suffer a huge economic loss from leaving the Chinese market Guo said according to Xinhua Chinese Internet users are the real victims if Google quits China I think Google is just playing cat and mouse and trying to use netizens anger or disappointment as leverage The final result Drummond told CNN will be up to the Chinese We just no longer in good conscience can continue to censor our results he said And so its kind of up to the Chinese government as to whether they want to work with us in a way that will allow us to be there on that basis That stance Sullivan said is the sort of brash approach that industry analysts have come to expect That actually felt very Googlelike he said Its the kind of thing they would do CNNs Manav Tanneeru contributed to this report

 Five lesson for Google from Nexus Ones sluggish startBy  Priya Ganapati 

      STORY HIGHLIGHTS Four months after its release Googles support for Nexus One phone seems to be waning  Phone has sold  units in same time Droid and iPhone sold over  million  Analyst says outing still not a failure taught Google about marketing  Google says plan has always been for Nexus One to be first of many phones

 Wired  Barely four months after the launch of its first smartphone the HTCbuilt Nexus One Googles commitment to the device seems to be on the wane Google is now pointing customers interested in buying a Verizon version of the Nexus One to the newly launched HTC Droid Incredible phone The Incredible which has garnered rave reviews is on par with the Nexus One in terms of processing power and its vivid OLED display but packs a more powerful camera Google has also said that it is no longer working on further engineering improvements to the G reception on its Nexus Some people are taking that as a sign that the search company might not be in the handset business for the long haul In Silicon Valley Nexus Ones are remarkably easy to get hold of thanks to a generous developer program liberal press review program and other handouts Google is literally giving them away which is never a sign of a hot product IndeedNexus One sales are barely a blip on the marketshare charts Google sold only  units in its first  days compared to  million iPhones and  million Droids in those phones first  days But that doesnt mean the Nexus One is a failure Far from it In fact its a sort of inspired experiment a laboratory for Google to get a taste of the mobilehandset business up close and personal For instance who could have realized the extent to which the lack of a telephone support line would make Googleloving customers unhappy The Nexus One gives Google directsales experience and customer contact that they dont get as the developer of the Android OS which is used on many phones from other manufacturers Indeed competing with those manufacturers may be the last thing Google wants It wasnt about Google becoming a phone company wrote telecom analyst Jack Gold in a recent email newsletter It was about Google getting a significant number of devices out there to form a big reference platform testingpilot environment where they could model test and tune their ecosystem based on the reallife use of the early adopters who would buy NexusOne When we asked Google for a comment a company spokesperson said Weve said from the beginning that Nexus One is the first of many Googlebranded Android handsets Todays announcement steering Nexus One customers to the HTC Incredible on Verizon doesnt mean any change on that front Google may not be saying much but heres our takeaway on the lessons Google has learned  or should have learned  from the Nexus One  You cant sell phones like computers  At first Googles strategy to offer a phone just through its website bypassing traditional wirelesscarrier stores may have seemed innovative and clever After all consumers buy almost all their major electronics products online including computers storage devices digital media players and even TVs But when it comes to cellphones users want to touch and play with the product And they want instore customer support for these devices Fundamentally Googles contention that mobile phones will increasingly be purchased more like other consumer electronics  online and without subsidy  has so far been proven wrong or at least premature said Charles Golvin an analyst with Forrester Research Very few US consumers will spend  for a phone and even fewer will do so without at least the opportunity to paw the hardware even if they eventually buy online said Colvin Even those who purchased the device through Googles online store faced problems Nexus One was plagued by consumer complaints including spotty G connectivity a high early termination fee and poor customer support from Google Weeks after the devices launch Google finally introduced a phone support line Until then customers with problems could only email Google and had to wait for hours for a response Googles technical support for the device has been derided both online and in the media deservedly said Golvin In the intensely competitive world of mobile handsets that just doesnt cut it  Marketing matters  All those iPhone and Droid commercials on TV may seem like ego trips for Apple and Motorola But marketing plays a big role in phone sales Smartphones are not just for gadgetheads so if handset makers want to reach an audience beyond the early adopters they have to advertise and sell their product through traditional media channels Google didnt capitalize on the initial buzz around the first Googlephone The company never ran a focused marketing campaign that would try to impress on potential customers why the Nexus One was worth considering The result has been that few potential customers have had a chance to hear why the phone may be special Google also limited itself by offering the device only on TMobile Last month it extended it to ATT but ATT customers will not get a subsidy on the device and will have to pay the full price    for the unlocked version of the phone  In mobile phones Google is a startup The search giants web products draw in millions of users which means even halfbaked ideas like Google Wave get a full workout from people eager to try the companys latest new thing But in the world of consumer electronics Google is a rookie and the company will have to fight hard for its place It has to build the retail relationships that companies such as Research In Motion and Motorola have created over the years While Apple can use its own retail stores to let customers play with the iPhone Motorolas Droid is available at Best Buy When it comes to selling mobile handsets Google needs to find the right spot for its devices Google also has to build relationships with cellphone carriers In the mobile world carriers are extremely powerful and for good reason Without a good cellular data network using even the most highend phone becomes an exercise in frustration A typical consumers choice between a Nexus One and a Droid may come down to which carrier offers it Google needs to craft its retail strategy with that in mind  The mobile phone ecosystem is complex  With Android Google is trying to do with mobile phones what Microsoft did with Windows on PCs Instead of having a proprietary operating system tied to hardware made by the same company Google wants to separate the two Handset makers such as Motorola and HTC are buying into the strategy But to help them give up their older operating systems and use Android Google needs to understand how phones are designed developed priced and sold It also needs to understand how customers use these products and the challenges they face Listening to its hardware partners talk about this with PowerPoint presentations is one way Getting your hands dirty to do it yourself is another and thats what Google did with Nexus One At K to K or so devices deployed think of all the feedback they can get on real world operations and user requirements said Gold Its a massive number of test subjects With Nexus One customers Google not only gets to test and tune the devices OS but also the app store and delivery ecosystem he said It gives Google the kind of insight that the company could use to create the next versions of the Android OS If you call this type of an advanced ability to garner realworld customer data and hone your ecosystem a flop then so be it said Gold I see it as a pretty positive effort on Googles part If Google never makes a dime in the hardware market with its own Androidbased products it will still be a success  Earning developer goodwill is the key  The success of Apples app store has spurred rivals to launch their own versions But with the exception of Android few other app stores  including the BlackBerry World and the Palm app store  have come close to becoming a viable competitor to iPhones App Store One reason is that Google has been generous with seeding the developer community with the Nexus One A significant portion of the Nexus One sales went to programmers and thats not by accident Google has also been handing them out Google got these devices into the hands of early adopters who are generally unlikely to be silent about any issues they may uncover said Gold These are the kinds of debuggers you want working with your device in the early stages and giving you lots of feedback Having its own Android device helped Google take control of this feedback without having to rely on the HTCs and the Motorolas of the world to do it For Google the handset experiment isnt over Andy Rubin Googles vice president of engineering and Android czar has said that the company plans to come out with a series of Google phones Make no mistake there will be another Google handset But it will not likely repeat the mistakes of the Nexus One and future Googlephones phones will get better Just dont expect a stunning blockbuster phone from Google because Google understands its not in the business of just selling a phoneWireds Dylan Tweney contributed to the reporting on this storySubscribe to WIRED magazine for less than  an issue and

Editors note Pete Cashmore is founder and CEO of Mashable a popular blog about social media He writes a weekly column about social networking and technology for CNNcom   London England CNN  Facebook dropped a bombshell on the tech industry last week in the form of a Webwide Like button and the launch of the Open Graph Using this new platform Web sites can drive Web traffic from Facebook by including Like buttons on their pages every Like posts an update to that users Facebook page  Whats more any Web site can customize its experience for you if youre logged into Facebook Suddenly CNNcom stories can be ranked not just by an editor but by your friends too  Likes replace links  Facebook announced Likes as a form of social links  better than a link because its related to a specific user If Like buttons take off thats really bad news for Google since its algorithm uses links between sites to determine their order in search results  Facebook seeks to replace this open system of links between pages with the social links or Likes that it controls Google and other search engines wont have full access to all these Likes so the company best positioned to rank the Web will be Facebook No wonder the open Web advocates are sounding the alarm concerned that a single company will stockpile all of our personal information and preferences  Already there are calls to create an OpenLike standard thats accessible to all reports Facebook watcher Nick ONeill  Facebook optimization  Can the measurement of an industry affect the output of that industry If an Academy Award is the ultimate measure of a movie do directors set out to create great films or Oscarwinning ones  Appearing on the first page of Google results for your chosen search term is perhaps the online equivalent of an Oscar win  As Google rose to become the barometer of all thats worthy on the Web publishers rushed to change their sites to appease the Google god Search Engine Optimization became a massive industry a multitude of SEO consultants sprung up offering to tweak your Web site to better fit Googles measure of the Web  What if Facebook Likes take off Or to use the proper jargon What if the Open Graph becomes the measure of the Web Will publishers change their sites to appease our new overlord  Im already seeing it Thousands of sites are adding Facebooks version of semantic data in preference to the open standards as Facebook becomes the new kingmaker In the week since launch more than  Web sites have added Facebooks social plugins All of which will make it blissfully easy for Facebook to organize the Web  Facebook Optimization may be the new SEO  Open Web advocates have reason to be concerned Privacy experts are also raising red flags No doubt theyll find an ally in Google Without access to the stitches that bind Web pages together the search engine could falter

Editors note Pete Cashmore is founder and CEO of Mashable a popular blog about social media He writes a weekly column about social networking and technology for CNNcom   London England CNN  Facebook dropped a bombshell on the tech industry last week in the form of a Webwide Like button and the launch of the Open Graph Using this new platform Web sites can drive Web traffic from Facebook by including Like buttons on their pages every Like posts an update to that users Facebook page  Whats more any Web site can customize its experience for you if youre logged into Facebook Suddenly CNNcom stories can be ranked not just by an editor but by your friends too  Likes replace links  Facebook announced Likes as a form of social links  better than a link because its related to a specific user If Like buttons take off thats really bad news for Google since its algorithm uses links between sites to determine their order in search results  Facebook seeks to replace this open system of links between pages with the social links or Likes that it controls Google and other search engines wont have full access to all these Likes so the company best positioned to rank the Web will be Facebook No wonder the open Web advocates are sounding the alarm concerned that a single company will stockpile all of our personal information and preferences  Already there are calls to create an OpenLike standard thats accessible to all reports Facebook watcher Nick ONeill  Facebook optimization  Can the measurement of an industry affect the output of that industry If an Academy Award is the ultimate measure of a movie do directors set out to create great films or Oscarwinning ones  Appearing on the first page of Google results for your chosen search term is perhaps the online equivalent of an Oscar win  As Google rose to become the barometer of all thats worthy on the Web publishers rushed to change their sites to appease the Google god Search Engine Optimization became a massive industry a multitude of SEO consultants sprung up offering to tweak your Web site to better fit Googles measure of the Web  What if Facebook Likes take off Or to use the proper jargon What if the Open Graph becomes the measure of the Web Will publishers change their sites to appease our new overlord  Im already seeing it Thousands of sites are adding Facebooks version of semantic data in preference to the open standards as Facebook becomes the new kingmaker In the week since launch more than  Web sites have added Facebooks social plugins All of which will make it blissfully easy for Facebook to organize the Web  Facebook Optimization may be the new SEO  Open Web advocates have reason to be concerned Privacy experts are also raising red flags No doubt theyll find an ally in Google Without access to the stitches that bind Web pages together the search engine could falter

 Microsoft revamps Hotmail takes on Google and YahooBy  Doug Gross CNN    The updates to Hotmail are expected to roll out in the next few weeks STORY HIGHLIGHTS Hotmail service will get a major overhaul Microsoft announces  The service is worlds most popular email but it has lagged in innovation  The update eliminates clutter lets users easily choose which messages to look at  It also will let people use programs like PowerPoint without ever leaving email

 CNN  Hotmail the worlds most widely used email service is getting a major overhaul from Microsoft in a bid to fend off competitors like Googles Gmail Microsoft says the planned update to Windows Live Hotmail is designed to remove clutter and let users interact with other sites and applications while checking their mail In the blog post Microsoft program manager Dick Craddock said the company studied email usage for a year while considering the changes People made it clear to us that the No  thing they wanted their email service to address  whether it was Hotmail or any other email service  was to help them manage the clutter in their inbox not just the spam but all the mail they get thats clogging their inboxes he wrote A key feature to the new Hotmail which will be rolled out over the next few weeks will be a sweep feature that allows users to clean out their inbox in one fell swoop The singleclick feature lets the user select a single email sender or multiple senders and automatically delete every message from that sender Another single click will let users decide which emails they want to look at  from people on their contacts list from their social networking sites or otherwise Microsofts study showed that only about  percent of email people get is from members of their contacts list The rest tends to be business related from social networks tracking of purchases theyve made online and spam the post says Despite the growing popularity of social networks like Facebook as a way to communicate Craddock wrote that people are getting more email than ever While it remains on top of the global email market with roughly  million users the decadeandahalf old Hotmail has been a largely stagnant service compared to thirdplace Gmail which has been steadily picking up users Yahoo is also more widely used in the United States than Hotmail Gmail has always offered ways to link up with Googles expansive list of internet offerings most recently its foray into the world of social networking Google Buzz By comparison Hotmail and Yahoo have offered morebasic mail to their users Hotmails proposed changes follow some of what Gmail has done For example with the new Hotmail people will be able to open and edit PowerPoint documents in their email accounts whether they have PowerPoint installed on their computer or not Hotmail Active View will give people an automatic preview of their incoming mail including a look at photos theyve received  both attachments and links to photo sites like Flickr Theyll be able to watch YouTube videos check social networks and perform other outside tasks without ever leaving email Gmail has similar features The proposed changes got mostly positive feedback early Tuesday from the tech community  where Hotmails vanilla setup hadnt garnered many fans before Itll be hard to steal users away from Gmail  which still has dozens of minor features that Hotmail doesnt just check the Labs  but Hotmail will most likely be a worthy competitor after the new version is launched this summer Stan Schroeder of social media blog Mashable wrote on Tuesday Harry McCracken of PC World wrote that the new Hotmail could be preferable to Gmail in some ways and pick up new users particularly from flailing AOL Hotmail also feels less densely packaged with stuff he wrote I could see some folks preferring it to Gmail which is beginning to flirt with bloat

 CNN  Its not uncommon these days for people to know how to build websites and create blogs Thats largely because sites like WordPress Blogger and Tumblr have simplified the process so you dont have to be a code wonk to publish Now Google is trying to make smartphone app creation easy too On Monday the company announced a program called App Inventor which claims to make app development easy enough for schoolkids App Inventor requires NO programming knowledge Google says on its new website for the program This is because instead of writing code you visually design the way the app looks and use blocks to specify the apps behavior News sites have compared App Inventor to building with Lego blocks  Google says it tested the program with kids For the past year weve been testing App Inventor in classrooms around the United States and weve found that it opens up the world of computer programming to students in new and powerful ways the company says on its official blog The program is an extension of research and product development done by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology  MITs Lifelong Kindergarten Group created a buildingblocks version of code programming for kids called Scratch which Google says was one inspiration for its new app creator The schools Scheller Teacher Education Program also gave Google some code to make the project possible Eric Klopfer an associate professor at MIT and director of that program said he hopes App Inventor gets young people  particularly those in middle school and high school  more interested in how phones and computers operate Its not as easy as using a word processor which is pretty close to what blogs have gotten to Its not as easy as that he said of App Inventor but its a big leap forward The new program is an apparent attempt by Google to both democratize app development and increase the number of apps that are available for smartphones that run Googles Android operating system The number of Android apps has been growing in recent months but there are only about half as many apps available for download on the Android Market as there are from Apples popular App Store which services the iPhone and iPad Fortune The coming Android app explosion Some tech bloggers criticized Google on Monday for looking to up the number of Android apps instead of improving their quality Others questioned whether nontechie developers could create apps that are worth using They have to hope it doesnt backfire and simply flood the Android Market with more junk apps than already exist writes MG Siegler on the blog TechCrunch On the blog Mashable which is a CNN Tech partner site Pete Cashmore writes that App Inventor may lead to a number of cookie cutter apps that are fairly useless but it also may have longterm positive effects for Google If App Inventor is so simple that schoolchildren can make apps some of those same children will soon become coders themselves  and perhaps choose to develop Android apps rather than iPhone Cashmore writes The blog The Next Web says app quality may suffer but that wont hurt the overall usefulness of Googles Android Market for apps Will it negatively impact the Android Market Its not likely writes Brad McCarty Lets face it even though were approaching  applications in the Market the good ones rise to the top very quickly There are literally thousands of useless trashdirected applications but they tend to get buried in a hurry Google is not the first company to try to make app development simple Nokia tried a similar program this year according to Engadget but Google may be the first company that is big enough to popularize the idea Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment To learn more about the program go to Googles App Inventor information page To download the program you have to fill out a form telling Google why you would like access to it Watch a video preview of the program If you give it a try let us know what you think of it in the comments below Is app development really easy enough for anyone  even young kids  on this program

 CNN  Apple began carrying Googles free voice app for iPhone on Tuesday after the application hung in limbo for more than a year The Google Voice app interfaces with the Web service by the same name Voice lets users register a new phone number where calls can be forwarded and organizes voice mail text messages and call logs in a central inbox Google submitted its iPhone app in June  Six weeks later Google said its app still hadnt been approved At the time Apple carried a handful of thirdparty apps that hooked into Googles voice service Not long after the US Federal Communications Commission inquired into this public dispute Apple took down all apps that interface with Google Voice including one called GV Mobile In Apples response to the FCC the company expressed concern that these applications replace key functions of the phone and may cause confusion Apple tests all apps for bugs  as well as compliance with the companys contentious and somewhat ambiguous rules  before they are admitted to its online App Store Google has other apps for the iPhone including one for its search engine that allows users to input text voice or pictures from the phones camera But with no way to get the Google Voice app past Apples guards Google created a mobileoptimized website for iPhone and other smartphone owners to use with Voice However websites cannot achieve features that apps can such as system notifications and integration with a phones address book But then Apple suddenly began approving thirdparty voice apps a couple of months ago They were mainly payperdownload programs Google declined to comment at that time instead pointing people to the Web version On Tuesday Googles free software appeared in the App Store Google already has voice apps for its own Android mobile operating system and for Research in Motions BlackBerry devices Those apps work more seamlessly with those phones than the iPhone version But in our testing we found Google Voice for iPhone to be well designed While calls made through Gmail on a computer are connected over the internet through a technology called VoIP the iPhone app routes calls through traditional cellular telephony protocols Google Voice allows for cheaper calls to other countries compared to the rates telecoms like ATT charge and free text messages It can also transcribe voice mails into text although that technology is far from perfect Apple has taken verbal beatings this week at the Web  Summit a conference in San Francisco California frequented by hightech executives Google CEO Eric Schmidt painted Apples system as closed which clashes with his company philosophy he said in his fireside chat on Monday The Android model is very different from Apples on just about every point he said Apple CEO Steve Jobs said in his most recent earnings call that Schmidts argument is a sort of smoke and mirrors and called Android fragmented Jobs took shots at RIM in that call So RIM coCEO Jim Balsillie joined the fight on Tuesday at the Web  Summit echoing Schmidts sentiment about Apples policies He also appeared to express some contempt for Jobs sit back and say things attitude But with the Voice app finally available Apple may be lowering the barrier on the types of software it will allow in its store and at the same time smoothing its competitive relationship with Google

Editors note Pete Cashmore is founder and CEO of Mashable a popular blog about social media He writes a weekly column about social networking and tech for CNNcom   CNN  Google is working on a social service to rival Facebook if Web rumors are to be believed  And while Googles socialnetworking efforts have so far fallen flat even satisfied Facebook users should hope that the search engines efforts bear fruit First to the rumor A nowdeleted Tweet last weekend from entrepreneur Kevin Rose claimed that Google is working on a Facebook competitor called Google Me That claim gained credence as former Facebook CTO Adam DAngelo weighed in Posting a response on the questionandanswer service Quora DAngelo wrote This is not a rumor This is a real project There are a large number of people working on it I am completely confident about this  Google he added is threatened by Facebooks rise to prominence and feels the need to build a social network of its own  The Facebook threat The search giant has legitimate cause for concern As I wrote in this column two months ago Facebook is gathering masses of data through its recently launched Likes feature which lets Web visitors express interest in a piece of content  More than  websites implemented this Like button in the week after it launched providing Facebook with a treasure trove of data about the preferences of Web users This data could form the basis of a powerful search engine ranking Web pages by Likes rather than the links that Google relies upon  Whats more Facebook could serve up different search results to each user based on the preferences of his or her friends It gets worse for Google Facebooks mountain of personal data could also provide the backbone of an ad network many times more targeted than Googles keywordbased advertising If Facebook were to launch both a search engine and ad network it could put a significant dent in Googles more than  billion in annual revenue  But Google shouldnt be the only party concerned about Facebooks rapid ascent  the lack of a Facebook alternative is a threat to consumer choice providing no escape route when things turn sour  No real alternative Facebooks privacy issues over recent months have opened our eyes to a grim reality There is no real alternative While dissatisfied MySpace users hopped over to Facebook there is no truly competitive social network to which disgruntled Facebook users can elope  The demand for a legitimate alternative is so great that a project called Diaspora was able to raise more than  from Web users to develop its privacy aware personally controlled doitall open source social network  Until such a rival emerges Facebook has little incentive to maintain user trust  the only option available to unhappy Facebookers is to delete their accounts and lose contact with their friends  Googles social stumbles  Alas Google has a dismal track record when it comes to social networks Orkut an early socialnetworking effort has seen success in Brazil but in the US its virtually unheard of Google Friend Connect a possible rival to the recently renamed Facebook Connect went nowhere  Open Social a challenge to Facebook Apps has been forgotten And Google Buzz a recent attempt to add Twitterlike status updates to Gmail flopped  and generated a regrettable privacy backlash for the company  Google the narrative goes is exquisitely talented at solving problems with algorithms But when it comes to the touchyfeely stuff  like human interaction  it falls flat  Getting behind Google So while its definitely a long shot its time to rally behind Google If the search giant is able to pull off a halfdecent Facebook rival the fastgrowing social network will finally have a competitor to keep its power in check  That would be a win not just for Google but for the Web as a whole  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Pete Cashmore

 CNN  Web search engines make our lives easier They connect us with what were searching for in a matter of seconds and sometimes they bring us to places we didnt even know we were looking for But they can also teach us a lot about ourselves as more than half of adult internet users already know About  percent of adult internet users in the United States said they have entered their name into a search engine to assess their digital reputation according to a new Pew Research Center study Reputation Management and Social Media Thats a significant increase since  when only  percent of adult internet users said they had looked their name up on a search engine The findings show reputation management has now become a defining feature of online life the study says This probably doesnt come as a surprise to many considering a new story about Facebooks privacy settings surfacing each day And the concern about peoples digital reputations will most likely continue to grow as posting and sharing information over the internet becomes more and more widespread The study also found that young adults are more apt to restrict what they share and manage their online reputations more closely than older internet users This is contrary to the popular perception that younger users embrace a laissezfaire attitude about their online reputations wrote Mary Madden a senior research specialist The Pew Research Center study which took place by phone between August  and September  sampled  adults  and older The margin of error is  percentage points Have you ever Googled yourself Were you surprised by what you found Join the CNN iReport names project

 Analysis Google and China agree on a fiction 

By  Ryan Singel  Filed under Web     Writer says China agreed to a fiction in order to allow Google save face STORY HIGHLIGHTS Googles application to work in China for another year was unexpectedly renewed  Compromise lets Chinese users click box go to unfiltered Hong Kongbased search  The compromise doesnt tear down Chinese firewall but it does create a hole writer says

 Wired  Google got its Chinese visa extended Friday but that doesnt mean the company is having a good trip or that Chinas censorship has gone away Googles application to run Googlecn for another year looked like it was going to be denied by the Chinese government who decided that simply redirecting all Googlecn users to an unfiltered search site in Hong Kong wasnt acceptable Perhaps they found it a bit too clever and easy for Google  Now Google has replaced the search box on Googlecn with a picture of a search box which when clicked on takes the user to Googlehkcom  adding another click between a Chinese citizen and unfiltered search results That seems to have satisfied the Chinese authorities  and saved them some face  at least for the time being Its a testament to the power of Google that it can get away with what is really a shameless charade The problem is neither side is totally committed to their stated positions The whole thing started when Google got hacked letting an intruder get to source code and information on Chinese human rights activists  Out of anger and embarrassment  and perhaps to change the subject   Google blamed China for the hacking and said that it was no longer willing to censor its search results on Googlecn as it had been since  Of course Google could have tested the limits of its quasigovernmental power by simply shutting down Googlecn  But the Chinese market is the largest in the world and while Google may have the worlds best search technology thats not likely enough to break the spine of Chinas authoritarian rulers  On the surface it seems like Chinas government is in a perilous position trying to run a freemarket economy within a regime dedicated to censoring negative information But the strategy is working well enough clocking nearly  percent growth in GDP even in the midst of one of the worst global recessions But clearly Google is loved by enough powerful people  especially the growing middle and upper classes in China  that China is willing to make some concessions so long as they arent perceived as kowtowing to a powerful US corporation Google also gets to continue keeping an engineering office in China running an ad business and offering a product and music search engine on Googlecn  all ways to keep themselves from being exiled from a market that is destined to become a huge profitmaker for some search engine  The new compromise does however hobble the companys ability to serve as the default search engine for online portals Chinese web browsers and mobile phones  which in the West has helped drive Google to its undeniable spot as the king of search engines So the fake image of a search box oddly makes for a logical if temporary impasse Thats not tearing the Great Chinese firewall down but its actually a pretty big hole even if both Google and China decide not to call it a hole This kind of odd compromise is hardly unprecedented with the Chinese Taiwan and China avoid war by both claiming to be the legitimate rulers of mainland China a fiction that has persisted for more than  years even as Taiwan is in nearly all respects its own country  But if Taiwan ever does decide to publicly say it is its own country thats ground for a Chinese invasion So now we have a new fiction to add to that one Google doesnt run an unfiltered search engine in China even though Chinese users can use an unfiltered Google search engine by going to Googlecn and clicking a facsimile of a search box Depending on where you stand thats either a good thing for net freedom or a capitulation by Google But thats the fiction thats been agreed uponSubscribe to WIRED magazine for less than  an issue and get a FREE GIFT Click here

 For all its might Google is no productkiller 

By Dan Frommer Business Insider  Filed under Web     Despite its growth into many sectors of technology Google rarely launches products that become market leaders STORY HIGHLIGHTS Despite its growth into many sectors of technology Google rarely launches killer products  Most Google products survive as middleofthepack offerings or get spiked altogether  One recent big failure was Googles Nexus One mobile phone store which closed this week  Arguably the closest Google has come to a successful social site is YouTube

 Business Insider  Google has invested billions of dollars building dozens of different products across a wide swath of the technology industry from productivity tools to mobile phones to ecommerce As a result many tech companies large and small have to think about a Google plan  what to do if Google suddenly gets into their line of business Its the same way companies used to worry about Microsoft during the last tech boom But its surprisingly rare that any of these Google products actually end up as a killer or the market leader In fact since its inception Google has only really developed one major killer product Its original search engine which blew past Yahoo years ago and currently dominates in the industry Most other Google products wind up surviving as middleofthepack offerings or get spiked by Google altogether One recent big failure was Googles Nexus One mobile phone store which it launched in January to much fanfare and closed this week The idea was that Google was going to sell mobile phones  based on its Google Android operating system  on its website This was supposed to compete with and disrupt wireless companies local retail stores where most people buy their cellphones But it didnt work Google sold very few phones in part because they were so expensive and in part because people still want to try phones out in person before committing to them for two years Also because Google refused to advertise the Nexus One store on TV one important place where people learn about mobile phones Google recognizing this failure announced its plans to close the Nexus One store in May and this week Google ran out of phones The company has similarly struggled to do anything involving social networking Over the years numerous Google attempts to buy or build social services have either flopped or fizzled These include  Dodgeball an early version of Foursquare created by one of the Foursquare cofounders which Google acquired in  and shut down in   Jaiku a Twitterlike service that Google bought in  and stopped caring about in   Orkut a Friendsterlike service that Google commissioned which was only a success in some markets like Brazil and India  Lively a Second Lifelike virtual world that Google launched in  and killed a few months later  Latitude a mobilelocationbased social networking service that most people dont use and have never heard of  Google Buzz a poorly executed attempt earlier this year designed to turn Gmail into a social network which also hasnt been much of a success Google is now supposedly working on yet another social networking tool called Google Me which is reportedly some sort of Facebook competitor Will it be a hit Google certainly has the engineering talent money brand and user base to make social networking work in theory But in practice it appears that social just isnt in Googles DNA  it cant seem to make a service thats fun or useful enough for everyone to want to hang out there Arguably the closest Google has come to a successful social site is YouTube which has succeeded in part because it still operates semiautonomously beyond the Googleplex Other Google flops include Google Checkout the PayPal killer that never killed PayPal attempts at shaking up the newspaper and radio ad markets Froogle the shopping search engine and Google Wave an attempt to reinvent email Why does Google do all this stuff In part because it thinks that some of these products and services could evolve to be market leaders In part to disrupt others such as Microsoft  thats why Google is putting so much effort into Google Apps Google Docs Chrome Chrome OS Android and other products that compete with Microsofts Windows and Office juggernauts And in part because Google is an engineeringdriven company that sometimes likes to create stuff for the sake of creating it To be sure many of Googles products are great and beloved But it has certainly been a long time since Google built something that killed any other companys productCopyright   Business Insider

 Google Alarm plugin tries to wake the world up to privacy issuesBy  Gillian Tee CNN  Filed under Web  Google and your privacySTORY HIGHLIGHTS Google Alarm alerts users when they visit a website that sends Google info  The browser plugin was developed independently of Google  It runs on the Firefox and Internet Explorer Web browsers  Google says there are less earsplitting ways to learn about privacy CNN  The sound of the Google Alarm is hard to miss  Web users who install this browser plugin hear a loud buzzing noise whenever they visit a website that relays information to Google It might seem intuitive that Google tracks the Web activity of users who search for things at Googlecom But whats less obvious is that unassuming Web users might have their browsing behavior tracked on other sites too Jamie Wilkinson a technology entrepreneur unaffiliated with Google created the Google Alarm plugin in an attempt to clear up any confusion Im very interested in exploring privacy issues on the internet and the collection of data through these tracking bugs that are installed all over the Web is normally a very silent experience he said And so my hope is to make it something more visceral and raise awareness about the issue Wilkinson released the alarm plugin on his website this week The plugin currently works on the Internet Explorer and Firefox Web browsers It tracks information that is sent to Google Analytics  a product that allows Web developers to gather statistics on site traffic and activity Some metrics available through Google Analytics range from the number of visitors tracked over a duration of time to the amount of time people spend on a site Google maintains that while it gathers data on the browsing habits of users who have installed the Analytics tool it has made these actions clear We like to think there are less earsplitting ways of being transparent with users and thats why weve created tools like Google Dashboard which shows users what information they share with us and provides direct links to control their personal settings and an optout for Google Analytics said Brian Richardson a Google spokesman Google offers ways in which its users can navigate their online privacy or opt out of having their information tracked by Google altogether  According to Richardson information provided to website owners through Google Analytics is completely anonymous and cannot be tied to an individual user The optout option has been created such that if a user does not want the anonymous data sent directly to the website owner a piece of software can be downloaded and installed on a computer which would then discontinue sending information directly to Google servers Google users can also make use of the Google Dashboard which is a tool that shows users all the information associated with your Google account and allows users to track the information that are stored on its servers Users are also able to control their personal privacy settings through a number of links on the dashboard Thousands of people seem to want a little help in navigating all of these choices however as more than  downloads of the Google Alarm plugin were recorded in its first week on the Web according to Wilkinson In my tests I found that something like  to  percent of websites that I visit on a daily basis have some kind of Google tracking bug on themI use Google analytics on all my websites said Wilkinson  Despite the fact that you can install and look at your Google dashboard doesnt meant that people are aware that you can do these things Another Google product Google Street View has sparked controversy over the past few months where the company admitted to collecting personal Web activity of users on unsecured WiFi networks from Street View vehicles and is facing multiple lawsuits in the US Were working with governments to resolve issues relate to the WiFi situation We have been very up front and said that it was a complete mistake and we apologized for that situation And were now working with data protection authorities across the world to resolve any outstanding issues said Richardson Google maintains that user trust maintains its priority But in a world where a company holds such large amounts of information how much should an internet user trust Google Actually most users still do trust usPrivacy online is knowing what information youre sharing being able to control that information and who you share it with said Richardson Thats why all our products at Google  the analytics optout browser the dashboard and so many other tools  that you can find at our privacy center are built to provide that provide that level of choice and transparency so users can control their privacy online It is now up to users to decide how much trust they place in Google

 Why Googles data collection snafu could be good for GmailBy  Mark Milian CNN  Filed under Web   Unlike most other webbased email services Gmail uses a highsecurity protocol at all times STORY HIGHLIGHTS Gmail has a security mechanism that helps prevent hackers from accessing passwords  Hotmail added such a security method as an option for users last week  Yahoo Mail doesnt provide the alwayson security feature  CNN  Google disclosed recently that its Street View project had inadvertently collected personal data and the company has faced an onslaught of investigations from two US federal agencies and several European governments But in a strange irony Googles blunder could reflect favorably on Gmail the Mountain View California companys advertisingsupported email service Google faces scrutiny most recently from the Federal Communications Commission last week for logging emails and passwords that its Street View cars found floating on unprotected WiFi networks  But had those people been using Gmail their data probably would have been safe Gmail is the only major Webbased email client that uses a highsecurity standard called Secure Sockets Layer by default at all times Its been doing so since January and has offered the feature in some capacity since it launched in

Last week Microsoft added a fullsession security option to Hotmail its email service Customers of Hotmail which research firm Compete says is the secondlargest Web mail client in the US can enable the security feature in their settings page Most browsers note when a site is using security with an image that looks like a padlock or with the string https preceding the Web address Most banking websites use this security mechanism Yahoo Mail the largest in the US only uses https during login and when users are manipulating settings in order to prevent usernames and passwords from being easily snatched by nearby hackers Hotmail works the same way for those who havent activated the alwayson feature  Similarly Facebook and Twitter send login credentials over a secure line and then revert to an unsecure protocol Users of those social networks can add an s after http to force the systems to encrypt their browsing Social networking sites are where people increasingly conduct private conversations whether through Facebooks Messages or Twitters Direct Message feature This common method encrypts usernames and passwords but reverts to the normal Web protocol HTTP for everything else That makes those messages vulnerable to interception by others on the same WiFi network When on a passwordsecure WiFi Protected Access WPA point messages sent to and from unprotected websites are safer but not as safe as when sites enable security on their end experts say With a little motivation and not much skill its fairly trivial to sniff HTTP traffic said Alan Ross the lead security analyst for Intel IT noting there are free and easily attainable programs that can do just that Maybe I want to see all web traffic for Facebook because I want to see what the interesting person across the cafe is updating on Facebook he said Furthermore someone can gain access to an email or social network account using sniffing methods without needing that persons password Websites install a cookie file on a users computer which includes a unique string of letters and numbers that make up the session ID When that file is sent over an unsecure connection it can be intercepted and used to access an account Ideally wed like to see HTTPS enabled by just about every website Ross said Dont use HTTP for anything that you dont want anyone else to see he advised site operators Thats what they should be doing added Toby Kohlenberg a senior security specialist for Intel IT But thats not what the majority of them are doing Technology experts say implementing the secure protocol can slow page loading and put additional strains on corporate servers A Google spokesman said the company figured out a way to do it without noticeably slowing the process In addition to Gmails alwayson security Google offers HTTPS for many of its apps including a beta version of the search engine called Google with SSL

 CNN  Looking for lastminute recipes You wont have to search further than Googlecom The search engine turned its logo on Thursday into an interactive smorgasbord of Thanksgiving foods  each of which links to a recipe Among the choices are roasted Brussels sprouts which isnt exactly an American favorite The recipe comes from the TV chef Ina Garten perhaps better known as the Barefoot Contessa and includes a bunch of salt and olive oil  You could make these lookeddownupon veggies more delicious by turning to other websites too You could add bacon as The Food Networks Rachael Ray suggests Or go the southern route  a la celebrity chef Paula Deen  and pour in a cup of melted butter  The other Google doodle recipes sound a little tastier They include roast turkey smashed sweet potatoes popovers cranberry fruit conserve and a pumpkin banana mousee tart Its clear that many people in the United States were turning to the internet for advice about food and Thanksgiving on Thursday morning All of the top  hot searches on Google were focused on the holiday Six of them were focused on cooking with some of the popular searches including butterball turkey cooking instructions and butterball turkey hotline Last Thanksgiving the New York Times used search data from Allrecipescom to compile a fascinating look at regional cooking trends Based on the foods people were searching for it appears that few people in the northeast United States like pecan pie Macaroni and cheese is a southern Thanksgiving dish And pumpkin pie which was the second most popular search term overall is a hot dish in the Pacific northwest although you could serve it cold   The San Francisco Chronicle noted that the Google recipes are hosted by that website  so instead of linking out to recipes on cooking sites Google keeps the Web traffic squarely on Googlecom So on Thanksgiving Google is competing with every other recipe site on the web and is once again officially a media company the paper writes For more on Thanksgiving and food check out CNNs Eatocracy blog and CNN iReport where you can share recipes and stories of your own

 European Commission to investigate GoogleBy  the CNN Wire Staff  Filed under Web     Google says it will cooperate with the EC investigation STORY HIGHLIGHTSThe Commission is opening an antitrust probeIt is looking into allegations Google abused its dominant positionOther search providers have complained about unfavorable treatmentGoogle says it will work with the Commission to address concerns

 CNN  The European Commission said Tuesday it will investigate whether Google abused its dominant position in online search in violation of European Union rules Search service providers have complained about unfavorable treatment of their services in Googles unpaid and sponsored search results along with an alleged preferential placement of Googles own services the European Commission said The decision to open an antitrust investigation does not imply that the Commission has proof of any infringements it said Google responded by saying it will cooperate with the investigation Since we started Google we have worked hard to do the right thing by our users and our industry  ensuring that ads are always clearly marked making it easy for users to take their data with them when they switch services and investing heavily in open source projects a Google statement said But theres always going to be room for improvement and so well be working with the Commission to address any concerns Google provides two types of results when users search its site for information The first are unpaid search results often referred to as algorithmic results and the second are thirdparty ads and sponsored links appearing at the top and right of the results page The Commission said it will investigate whether Google lowered the ranking of unpaid search results of competing services  such as pricecomparison sites also known as verticalsearch services  and gave preferential placement to the results of its own such services Investigators will also look into allegations that Google lowered the quality score for sponsored links of competing vertical search services The quality score is one of the factors determining the price advertisers must pay to Google The quality score also influences the likelihood of an ad being displayed by Google and its ranking If two advertisers are using the same key words the one with a lower quality score will have to pay a higher price to rank at the same place The Commission will also look at whether Google imposes exclusivity obligations on advertising partners  preventing them from placing certain types of competing ads on their own websites and on computer and software vendors sites with the aim of shutting out competing search tools The probe will last as long as it takes to complete the investigation the Commission said

FORTUNECOM  Loyal readers may remember my passionate enthusiasm a year ago upon the release of a new Web search product called Grokker Making online searches more useful


This software tool takes the data culled by an online search and organizes it visually into categories that enable you to quickly dig deeply to find the exact site or information you need Grokker broke new ground but later ran out of gas when the Northern Lights search engine on which it was based went out of business


Now Grokker is back as a smarter and less expensive  instead of  application that works on top of many different databases including the allimportant Google Im as excited this time as I was a year ago This really could be the future for finding information


The new Grokker was released Monday by startup Groxis It makes me wonder if Google really does have search as sewed up as we often assume When you use Grokker you realize just how brain dead even the best search tools are today


Grokker is not a Web service but an application that sits on your PC A Mac OS X version should be ready in about four weeks say executives


Grokker takes the raw output of a search and organizes it into categories and subcategories Groxis has put more intelligence into the software this time so it is not dependent as it was with Northern Lights on categories established by others This means that a wide variety of types of databases can be Grokkednow Grokker can search with six different engines simultaneously  Yahoo MSN Alta Vista Fast Teoma and WiseNet


It also can organize searches for products on Amazon or for files on your own desktop Google capability is coming within weeks Groxis says as a separate software component that users will add Soon you will also be able to use it in conjunction with AskJeeves eBay social networks like Linkedin and job site Monster


Grokker creates a visual representation of a search When you type in say nanotechnology Grokker starts organizing data from the multiple search engines You see a big circle within which are smaller circles with labels including conference technology science research reports news molecular material and so on Each represents a subset of data on nanotechnology


Click on say molecular and that circle will enlarge so you can see several further subcircles one of which is molecular assemblies Click on that and another category becomes visible entitled molecular assembly sequencing software


Now you could in theory have typed that exact phrase into Google and gotten to the same Web sites However in many cases you cant be sure what youre looking for because you simply dont know whats out there Grokker gives you an easy way to delve into a data set and it often leads to inforevelations


For example a Grokker search of the Amazon database also using the initial term nanotechnology included a category circle labeled childrens books I would not have predicted that childrens books on nanotech existed But a few further clicks reveal a book entitled Nanotechnology Invisible Machines for  yearolds as well as  even more unexpectedly  Submarines and Underwater Exploration for kids  If you didnt know to look for it youd never have found it most likely


A search using Amazons own onsite search tool in which I asked for books for  yearolds related to the subject of nanotechnology found no matches


Says RJ Pittman CEO of Groxis Google has indexed several billion pages but there are between  and  billion in total on whats referred to as the invisible Web or deep Web Within a year Grokker will have ten times the reach of Google in terms of available Web pages


Adds Paul Hawken the environmentalist and entrepreneur who is chairman of Groxis Google cant do it because their technology is based on lists Hawken came up with the idea for Grokker a couple of years ago when he grew frustrated with the difficulty of finding information about environmental issues He hooked up with some ace programmers and Grokker is the result


Groxis may get traction first in the education market Both the Los Angeles and Chicago school districts have already taken trial licenses to see whether Grokker would be useful for their students The University of Nevada bought a license for  seats and is putting Grokker in campus computer labs


The real competition for Grokker is the amazing ability of Google and other search engines to place at the top of a thousandsite list just the one you were looking for If youre good at stipulating the terms for a Google search you may find Grokker unnecessary When I used the inferior predecessor I found that there was no reason to use Grokker for the vast majority of searches


But for some very important projects  like finding a certain type of real estate broker in a specific region  it was incomparable I was able to find a broker in minutes with Grokker that had been completely absent from my Google searches


In the most personally gratifying moment of the demonstration CEO Pittman gave me last week he typed in David Kirkpatrick There inside the big circle were two other circles representing me and my work at FORTUNE A smaller circle was labeled New York Times Thats where a much younger and very talented business journalist of the same name writes Since Ive been writing for more than a decade longer than the other DK its nice that Grokker figured that out


Grokker can be downloaded for  or you can get a day free trial at Groxiscom

SAN FRANCISCO California Reuters  Google Inc which dominates the market for Web search is developing a service that could dramatically extend the reach of its lucrative keywordbased advertising by linking such ads to email people familiar with the matter said on Friday


Privately held Google which is expected to go public later this year faces rising competition in its core search business from email providers including Yahoo Inc and MSN Microsoft Corps Internet unit


Adding an email service would provide a potential boost to Google as its technology lead in the search market seems destined to narrow and it prepares to answer to growthhungry shareholders analysts said


The Mountain View California company which has recently made several email related acquisitions is working on a way to serve advertising to an email at the moment it is opened people close to the company said


Im sure Google is getting more and more concerned about locking in users It wouldnt surprise me if they did something very sophisticated with email said Danny Sullivan editor of SearchEngineWatchcom who tracks the industry


By moving into email  the Webs mostused program  Google would open up a huge new market for its lucrative sponsored links advertising business that delivers ads tied to keywords in Web searches or on content pages analysts said


Offering its own branded email  whether for free or with enhanced services like spam filtering  would also enable Google to tie users more closely to its search site and to steal customers from rivals they said


In an email response to questions from Reuters spokesman David Krane said Google has a number of projects in the works to test monetization in various scenarios


In fact Googles AdSense contextual ads are already used in a number of email newsletters he said

Going portal

Google has for years said it would not turn its site into a fullservice Internet portal like Yahoo or MSN However since it opened in  Google has added portalstyle discussion groups and is testing a comparison shopping site called Froogle as well as a news site


Google late last year purchased rival Sprinks which had technology to deliver ads to email as the messages were opened Such realtime ad serving is important because it keeps ads fresh and insures that Google will not be giving away free ads or delivering ads nobody will see industry participants said


Kanoodle a small privately held search company in the coming weeks will roll out its own email advertising product as part of its deal with CBS MarketWatchcom said Lance Podell Kanoodles president of search and content


Under that deal sponsored link ads will be served to MarketWatchs optin subscriber emails including newsletters

Experience with sponsored links

Google already knows how to deliver its sponsored link ads  which are in the form of Web links and appear on the perimeter of Web pages  to email newsletters and content sites


Furthermore Google last year purchased an email management software maker and in  registered the domain name googlemailcom


Some in Silicon Valley also believe Google could be preparing to launch free email to compete with offerings from Yahoo and MSNs Hotmail


If they were to go the email route theyd have to provide an offering that competes with free email Antispam is one form of strong differentiation said Jim Pitkow chief executive of Moreover Technologies whose personalized search company Outride was acquired by Google in

CNN  Dennis Hwang may be the most famous unknown artist in the world  his work doesnt hang in galleries or museums but its been viewed hundreds of millions of timesThe yearold webmaster designs the whimsical logos that decorate Googlecoms otherwise Spartan Web site on special occasionsIts always a fun kind of challenge to incorporate the logo into the design Over the years just because I kind of push myself to use different types of design if I can Hwang said Have a look at Hwangss Google logosHe has been manipulating the six letters in the Google name into shamrocks fireworks hearts and goblins since shortly after he got an internship there in  Company founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin found out that he was an art major in collegeThey said Hey Dennis why dont you give this a shot and Ive been doing it ever since he saidNow hes in charge of all Googles webmasters and designing the logos is only about  percent of his job  but that doesnt mean its not a lot of work Hwang said he had to do a string of allnighters after he had what he called his brilliant idea to do individual designs for each of the  teams in this years World Cup soccer tournamentThe logos link to Google search results about the topic which can drive a lot of traffic to unsuspecting sitesSometimes we unfortunately take some sites down so we have to cycle through different search queries midday he said But yeah its kind of the fun aspect of it that users can do more research about a topic or find out more about it on their own if theyre not as familiar about what were recognizingJohn Malyon president of the online art guide Artcyclopediacom said his site got a huge surge in traffic in April when Google featured Spanish surrealist painter Joan Miro He said he got tens of thousands of extra clicksIt didnt cause any server problems or anything  It just took me a while to track down what was happening Malyon said You sort of come in you turn on your server and look at your stats and theyre wildly inflated so you then have to do some detective workMalyon said most of the traffic appeared to be curiosity clicks  people who were more interested in the logo than in the artists work He said the surge probably didnt help his business much but he appreciated the interestIm quite happy and every webmaster in the world is happy to have as many people as possible see their babies but its not the most targeted traffic in the world he saidHwang said users email from all over the world to praise the designs or petition for new onesHwang said they did a logo for the Persian New Year after a huge online campaign and that the National Library Day design was very popularThat one was a huge hit among librarians across the whole country he said They even sent me libraryrelated cool toys and hats things like that One was even a librarian action figure with shushing action so that was really funnyHe said he meets a few times a year with a small group of Google staffers to decide which events to coverWe talk about interesting holidays that are coming up or various international holidays or any current events or news events that we think are cool and geeky or Googley in some sense and then we just sort of give it a go he saidHwang said his favorite was the birthday series honoring Michelangelo Picasso Van Gogh and other famous artistsHaving been a student of art history for a long time those are a little bit more personal Hwang said Of course trying to mimic the style of a master is always difficult and humbling so it does take a lot more time to do those but its also a lot more funBut like any proud parent he would not say which one was his favoriteIf you had me picking just one I dont think I could  Theyre just all kind of special in their own little way

 Story Highlights Google Earth highlights atrocities in Darfur region of Sudan  Google official Tool can be catalyst for education and action  Google Earth has  million users  Official Technology will make it harder to ignore genocide By  Elise Labott CNN  Adjust font size

 WASHINGTON CNN   If you Google the word Darfur you will find about  million references to the atrocities in the western Darfur region of Sudan  what the United States has said is this centurys first genocideAs of today when the  million users of Google Earth log onto the site they will be able to view the horrific details of whats happening in Darfur for themselvesIn an effort to bring more attention to the ongoing crisis in Darfur the US Holocaust Memorial Museum has teamed up with Googles mapping service literally to map out the carnage in the Darfur regionExperts estimate that  people have been killed and  million more have been displaced since the conflict flared in  when rebels took up arms against the central Sudanese governmentThe new initiative called Crisis in Darfur enables Google Earth users to visualize the details in the region including the destruction of villages and the location of displaced persons in refugee camps Interactive See how the new technology worksElliot Schrage Googles vice president of global communications and public affairs joined museum director Sara J Bloomfield to make the official announcement about the new feature At Google we believe technology can be a catalyst for education and action  Schrage said  Crisis in Darfur will enable Google Earth users to visualize and learn about the destruction in Darfur as never before and join the museums efforts in responding to this continuing international catastropheThe Google Earth mapping service combines D satellite imagery aerial and groundlevel maps and the power of Google one of the Internets most widely used search engines to make the worlds geographic information user friendly Since its inception in June  nearly  million people have downloaded the free programUsing the highresolution imagery of Google Earth users will be able to zoom into the Darfur region for a better understanding of the scope of the destruction Interactive See where Darfur is locatedMore than  damaged and destroyed villages will be visible as will the remnants of more than  homes schools mosques and other structures destroyed by the Janjaweed militia and Sudanese forcesThe Holocaust museum also has compiled a collection of photos data and eyewitness testimony from its archives and number of sources including the US State Department nongovernmental organizations the United Nations and individual photographers That material also will be available when Google Earth users visit the Darfur siteThe Crisis in Darfur initiative is the first of what is expected to be several collaborations between the museum and Google Earth to highlight the dangers of genocide around the world The museum also announced Tuesday the creation of a mapping project with Google Earth on the Holocaust when Nazis killed  million Jews during World War II That project will use Google Earth to map key Holocaust sites such as Auschwitz Dachau BergenBelsen Treblinka Warsaw and Lodz with historic content from its collections to illustrate the enormous scope and impact of the Holocaust Each place links to a featured article with related historical photographs testimony clips maps artifacts and film footageEducating todays generation about the atrocities of the past and present can be enhanced by technologies such as Google Earth Bloomfield said When it comes to responding to genocide the worlds record is terrible We hope this important initiative with Google will make it that much harder for the world to ignore those who need us the most

   Getting to grips with Google EarthStory Highlights Innovative ways to navigate Google Earth and make experience more tangible  Part of trend that puts consumer electronics to unexpected new uses  Adapted devices like Wii Balance Board interest museums hospitals and offices Next Article in Technology    By  Steve Mollman For CNN 



 


 

  CNN  In the second Fantastic Four movie a character called the Silver Surfer glides effortlessly over the Earths terrain on a gleaming transgalactic surfboard  
Reaching out to the world LMLABS floating holographic globe 
 Less welltraveled beings in the form of researchers in Germany are now doing something similar only using Google Earth and the Wii Balance Board  In their project users stand on the board which is placed before a largescreen projection of Google Earth  To move forward or to the side users simply lean on the board in the corresponding direction The sensation say the researchers is indeed like being the Silver Surfer on his ride  The Balance Board of course was never intended for this use Its sold by Nintendo as an accessory for the Wii console and used in skiing fitness and other video games  But for the researchers the board is simply another interesting lowcost input device for enabling new user interactions says Matthieu Deru    Deru and his partner Simon Bergweiler work at the Advanced Tangible Interface Lab at the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence They do all kinds of intriguing research there but this particular project involves analyzing and interpreting the data of the Wii Balance Board and making the results usable  The project is part of a broader trend Innovative consumer hits like the iPhone Google Earth Second Life and the Wii remotes and accessories are increasingly put to unexpected  and often unauthorized  uses by outside researchers and tinkerers  Sometimes the experimenters combine these products Theres no shortage of examples  The Wiimote has been put to dozens of quirky uses from corporate training programs in Second Life to turning the human body into a musical instrument  Such experiments will likely increase in number after Nintendo releases its upcoming MotionPlus addon adaptor which will help the Wiimote detect an even greater range of motions think sword play  The German duo are also working on an intelligent touchscreen terminal for iPhones Place the latter on the kiosk and the phones media files are displayed on the terminal screen Users can then use gestures to say rotate or scale pictures  Meanwhile Google Earth though it works just fine with a regular mouse and keyboard cries out for experimenters to devise cooler navigation techniques After all zooming and zipping around the planet deserves more than the same tools used for opening and closing windows  The cry was answered partly by a new breed of mouse made specifically for navigating virtual worlds D Connexions SpaceNavigator for instance features a knob you can push in any direction to fly around with your speed depending on how hard you push    But more interesting if less accessible ideas have cropped up A startup called LMLABS based in Tokyo and France has created a large floating holographic version of Google Earth whereby users can spin the ghostly globe and use gestures to zoom in and out on it  Founder Nicolas Loeillot describes the experience as being far more rich and tangible despite the lack of touch than the desktop experience Stereo vision is used to track the finger in the air  The company is working on something similar for computers so you can say point and click your way around the screen without touching anything  Museums are interested in the globe says Loeillot because no learning is required Customers want slick and invisible technologies  The globe setup is not priced for consumers though

   For Deru and Bergweiler surfing came to mind for Google Earth once the Wii board went on sale in Europe But after posting a video of their project online the feedback they received made them realize their idea was merely a springboard  Hospitals expressed an interest in the board as a rehabilitation device where patients could do balance training after an injury  And game ideas of course blossomed Could a firstperson shooter incorporate the board A surf game  In a popular PCbased skateboarding game the German duo have used the board for a jump feature Theyve incorporated it into World of Warcraft too as well as Second Life  With a semicircular screen and D glasses they note users could be completely immersed in the virtual worlds theyre surfing through  Theyve also looked into putting the board to more mundane uses such as under a desk to say let users scroll back and forth through a Word or PDF document That way users wouldnt have to lean forward or reach for the keyboard to do something basic like go to the next page  Ergonomics specialists take note Many a sufferer of carpal tunnel syndrome have wished for just such a feature  What do companies like Nintendo Apple and Google think about outside researchers taking their products in unexpected directions  In a way it doesnt matter These days any company that puts out an innovative lowcost product has to realize that once it leaves the store shelves or is downloaded it becomes a potential new tool for tinkerers  But whatever their official line  frowning upon or encouraging this experimentation  companies are welladvised to keep an eye on what the independent researchers are up to  For the German researchers a certain satisfaction can be had in simply knowing their project has spurred further experiments that will likely lead to yet others  We are pretty sure this will give new interaction ideas we have never thought about says Deru Thats one interesting part of our research

 CNN  In a nod to the growing debate on free access to news stories on the Web Google has updated options to help news organizations limit access The move comes after revelations that Microsoft has been in talks with Rupert Murdochs News Corp and other publishers to delist from Google in return for payments to index on the companys rival search engine Bing In recent months Murdoch has repeatedly threatened to pull his companys news Web sites  which include the Wall Street Journal the Times of London and the Australian  from Google and put company sites that are currently free behind a pay wall Google has updated a program on Google Search to allow publishers to limit users to no more than five page views per day without registering or subscribing to the news site If youre a Google user this means that you may start to see a registration page after youve clicked through to more than five articles on the Web site wrote Josh Cohen senior business product manager on Google News Blog on Tuesday 



Video No News Corp stories on Google


In addition Google is now allowing story headlines and first paragraphs on preview pages that publishers make available which will be labeled as subscription in Google News As newspapers consider charging for access to their online content some publishers have asked Should we put up pay walls or keep our articles in Google News and Google Search Cohen wrote In fact they can do both  the two arent mutually exclusive Murdoch and other newspaper publishers have complained that Google is profiting unfairly from their content while many newspapers are struggling to survive

   Why the ocean matters    to GoogleStory Highlights Imaging the ocean depths via the new Google Earth  is a smart move for Google  It adds to the overall utility of the software which in the long run keeps it relevant  Ocean researchers attended Googles launch and are eager to display their data  Eventually Google wants to provide data on every single location on Earth  Next Article in Technology    By Stephen Shankland 



 


 

 
 SAN FRANCISCO California CNET  The fact that you now can explore the ocean through Google Earth isnt going to make Google much money directly But the move is nonetheless smart 
The new Google Earth  software allows users to explore the ocean depths from their computers 
 Google generated earlystage goodwill from being the best answer to the online search problem But the company is large and getting larger especially as it shows a better ability to withstand the recession than rivals and that goodwill wont last forever Google Earth though gives the company a new way to bring its brand to the world notably with students for whom the software will help supplant atlases and encyclopedias  And in the long run as Google Earth and Maps  either as standalone software or used through a browser  will likely become a widely used virtual window on the real world Google will control the technology and commercialization of that portal Will the visibility of the ocean depths on Google Earth make money directly Not likely But it adds incrementally to the overall utility of the software which in the long run keeps it relevant The nearterm opportunity is in local search for example people looking for restaurants or hotels said John Hanke director of Google Earth and Maps in an interview

 Google has begun experimenting with advertisements on Google Maps and Google Earth added Peter Birch product manager of Google Earth at the launch event  Since people often need to discover information about a place before going there Google Earth and Maps could prove a lucrative endeavor It may take years to get there and itll cost Google dearly in server hardware and network bandwidth but Google has shown patience in subsidizing longterm projects Though Hanke wouldnt reveal the expense of Googles geographic services some of the economics are in the companys favor Just as Googles search engine takes advantage of innumerable information that others put on the Internet Google Earth is a platform that houses information supplied by outsiders that Google doesnt have to pay Its the Internets usergenerated content story but this time its data that can be overlaid on a map of the Earth And in the case of the ocean work there are prestigious users generating highquality content Many ocean researchers gathered at the Google Earth  launch and several showed theres pentup demand for a way to conveniently display their data somewhere And its not just to share sea surface temperature data with fellow PhDs but also to try to educate the public Ken Peterson communications director for the Monterey Bay Aquarium was excited about his layer in Google Earth that shows the location of various types of fish  along with ratings for people about whether they should eat those varieties or substitute others  Barbara Block of Stanford University and Patrick Halpin of Duke University were eager to show the tracks of shark travels recorded by radio transmission to satellites Ross Swick of the University of ColoradoBoulder showed a Google Earth animation of the gradually shrinking Arctic ice cap over the last  years  And Philip Renaud of the Living Oceans Foundation has supplied underwater video of the Red Sea as part of the foundations mission to chronicle the state of coral reefs Hanke envisions much broader information though including consumeroriented material such as the best dive spots and kitesurfing areas Ultimately he wants every single location on Earth land or sea to have information Were trying to encourage our users to annotate all the places in the world Part of what were doing is seeding that ecosystem of spatial information Hanke said  That creates an opportunity for Google to provide location services on phones mobile devices in cars in the future to guide people to the best places Being a valued guide the goto source of information about the best places to go  that will be a powerful and valuable thing for Google Think of it as a second Internet in a way only instead of using abstract names to locate information you can use actual locations to locate information Some refer to the idea as the geographic Web The clearest illustration of the indirect benefits Google Earth can bring is the fact that the company could persuade former Vice President Al Gore whose climate change documentary won him an Oscar and a Nobel Peace Prize to bear the Google Earth standard In effect he provided an ecohalo that can offset the more downtoearth capitalistic realities of Googles operation Google seems to share the altruistic educational motivations of many researchers But its also got business in mind with Google Earth We try to create products people love to use Birch said We create value then think of appropriate ways of monetization

 SAN FRANCISCO California CNET  Google spent Wednesday morning trying to get developers excited about the next generation of Web technologies by showing off how future Web applications will mimic desktop apps 
Its time for us to take advantage of this  amazing opportunity Googles Eric Schmidt told developers 
 Its time for us to take advantage of the amazing opportunity that is before us said Google CEO Eric Schmidt kicking off Google IO  in San Francisco Schmidt was referring to the growing sense that the Internet and browsersrather than a computers operating systemwill be the future foundation for application development The industry isnt quite ready for that yet Many of applications demonstrated before the crowd of around  developers will require the widespread adoption of HTML  technologies which are still under development by a consortium of companies and organizations Still Googles Vic Gundotra vice president of engineering noted that the four modern open standards browsers Firefox Safari Chromeand Opera are all adopting some HTML  technologies as they become more stable taking every opportunity possible to ding Microsofts Internet Explorer for lagging behind the other four browsers However offstage after his keynote Gundotra downplayed any conflict with Microsoft noting that its task in moving toward HTML  is more complex because of the large number of enterprises running Internet Explorer and the possibility that internal applications developed for that browser could break As they follow through they are going to have a huge impact on moving the Web forward he said Gundotra showed off how Web applications will be able to take advantage of five main HTML  concepts canvas tags video tags geolocation application caching and database and Web Workers

  Google takes on Windows with Chrome OSStory Highlights Google says it will release a computer operating system in fall or early   Googles Chrome OS could change the way personal computers work  The system is touted as faster and more Webfriendly than Windows  It supports cloud computing and will be available as opensource technology Next Article in Technology    By  John D Sutter  CNN 



 


 

  CNN  Google is jumping into Microsoft Windows territory  and threatening to change the way personal computers work  with its own version of a computer operating system 
Googles operating system will augment its Web browser which is also called Chrome 
 The company says the forthcoming Google Chrome OS will revolutionize how computers operate putting more emphasis on Web functionality making computers faster and opening them up to helpful tinkering by outside program developers The operating systems that browsers run on were designed in an era where there was no web Google said late Tuesday on its official blog Its our attempt to rethink what operating systems should be   Chrome OS will be available to consumers in the second half of  Google says But why should you care    A trim and speedy Google operating system which has been buzzed about online for some time is interesting for several reasons  even if you think it could flop out of the gate iReport What do you think about Googles Chrome OS The first is that Chrome OS will be available as opensource technology That means software developers will be able to mess with the code behind the system allowing them to develop new applications for it In essence it puts the users in control

New search engines aspire to supplement Google


 This wisdomofthemasses philosophy flies right in the face of Microsoft Windows which keeps its code locked away   The opensource nature of Chrome OS also has led to some speculation that the software will be free as many opensource platforms are Google Inc based in Mountain View California hasnt commented on price as of yet although most of its services such as Gmail and Picasa are free Second Googles operating system supports another buzz term in the tech world cloud computing That phrase means a bunch of things to different people but it essentially refers to the idea that a lot of computing can be done through Internet servers instead of on the computer thats sitting in front of you Cloud computing in part is behind the rise in netbooks  small laptops that are essentially portals of entry into the much greater vat of information storage space and computing power that exists in the cloud Googles blog says its OS will be designed specifically to work with netbooks at first Later versions are expected to target the larger desktop and laptop computer markets The OS also probably will partner well with Googles Web browser also called Chrome Essentially the operating system could become an Internetbased experience  Michael Arrington coeditor at TechCrunch says thats a big threat to Microsofts business but it may help consumers   Dont worry about those desktop apps you think you need Office Meh Youve got Zoho and Google Apps he writes You wont miss Office Finally Google says in its blog post that its going back to basics with this operating system  The company realizes that speed and functionality are top priorities for computer users who now live on the Internet People want to get to their email instantly without wasting time waiting for their computers to boot and browsers to start up They want their computers to always run as fast as when they first bought them They want their data to be accessible to them wherever they are and not have to worry about losing their computer or forgetting to back up files the company writes Even more importantly they dont want to spend hours configuring their computers to work with every new piece of hardware or have to worry about constant software updates And any time our users have a better computing experience Google benefits as well by having happier users who are more likely to spend time on the Internet Many tech writers seem enamored with the idea   Writing for TechCrunch MG Siegler says Google is inventing an operating system that users almost wont notice It will boot quickly then get out of the way What Google is doing is not recreating a new kind of OS theyre creating the best way to not need one at all Siegler writes Siegler says Google is dropping the mother of bombs on its chief rival Microsoft adding that the move is a genius play   Microsoft Corp based in Redmond Washington did not respond immediately to a request for comment on this story The company is set to release Windows  its latest operating system  or program that helps your computers hardware run software applications  on October    Ars Technica a tech site that reportedly broke the story Tuesday before Google announced the news on its blog writes that Googles OS will forward the idea of computing in the cloud With such an OS Google could obviously make it extra easy for users to access the full range of Google cloud applications through the browser  Google Docs Gmail Google Maps etc the site says   But a Google operating system combined with the already extensive reach of Google products could draw more attention from the federal government for possible antitrust violations says CNET writer Stephen Shankland The move has widespread implications he writes One is that it shows just how serious Google is about making the Web into a foundation not just for static pages but for active applications notably its own such as Google Docs and Gmail   Another it opens new competition with Microsoft and potentially a new reason for antitrust regulators to pay close attention to Googles moves Others say the news is somewhat overblown The Silicon Alley Insider says success of the operating system is far from guaranteed Reporter Henry Blodget writes that Googles operating system could go the way of the Chrome Web browser  which has turned out to be more of a niche product rather than a true rival to Microsofts Internet Explorer Googles browser initiative Chrome has been a fun little science project but as a product it has been a flop Blodget writes  The same can be said for almost all of Googles nonsearch products If Google wants to have a chance at success in this business it needs to focus on it with the same intensity it once put into search This will be challenging for Google which for the last several years has had the luxury of dabbling in whatever it pleases What do you think Feel free to chime in with comments below

  Google vs Microsoft What you need to knowStory Highlights The escalating Google vs Micosoft battle is mostly over wholl be King of Tech  Top execs at each company dream of ways to steal the others pots of gold  Chrome OS will compete with Windows while Office  will include free online versions  Heres how the two tech giants stack up in four key areas of competition Next Article in Technology    By Ryan Singel 



 


 

  WIRED  In less than a week Google announced an operating system to compete with Windows while Microsoft announced that Office  will include free online versions of its four most popular software programs  a shot at Googles suite of webbased office applications 
The fight between Microsoft and Google is over wholl be seen as the worlds most important tech company 
 And not more than a month and a half ago Microsoft unveiled its new search engine Bing which it hopes will steal market share from Google and finally make it real money online From the news of it its a fullblown tech battle complete with behindthescenes machinations to sic government regulators on each other It is however not a death match  its more of an fight to see who will be the King of Technology since both companies pull in their billions through completely different siphons and are unlikely to severely wound one another any time soon Google pulled in  billion in revenue in   percent of which came tiny text ads bought by the keyword and placed next to search results or on pages around the web Google makes a negligible amount of money bundling its online apps for businesses charging  a head annually  but mostly it just gives its online text editor email and spreadsheet programs away By contrast Microsoft sold  billion worth of Microsoft Word and PowerPoint and other business applications over the last nine months making a profit of  billion It made a further  billion in revenue in  through sales of its operating systems which range from XP installations on netbooks to Vista to Windows Mobile to its server software Google now plans its own range of operating systems starting with Android an opensource OS for small devices like smartphones and Chrome OS a browserfocused opensource OS that will run on notebooks and desktops

 Clearly top executives at each company look over at the others pots of gold and dream of ways to steal them or at least make it harder for the other guy to make money In fact they even dislike each other enough to spend money to make the other one lose revenue  take for example Microsofts behindthescenes campaign to scuttle last years proposed GoogleYahoo advertising deal or its ongoing attempts to derail the Google Book Search settlement But in reality the competition is really about creating universes or ecosystems that it hopes consumers will want to live their technology lives inside And its about ego  a fight to be recognized as the worlds most important technology company Microsoft would love for everyone in the world to be using its Internet Explorer browser to search through Bing to find a story from its MSN portal to email via Hotmail or Outlook to a friend Add in a smartphone running Windows Mobile and an Xbox in the living room for the kids and you have a Microsoft family And though it is much joked about Microsoft is the dominant platform for software developers of all types whether they are making small business software massive online roleplaying games or photoediting utilities Googles ecosystem looks different It starts with a Google Chrome browser oddly running only on Windows with a default homepage set to Google News or a customized Google homepage From there you might go to Gmail and then click on a Word document sent to you as an attachment which Google will quickly  and safely  open for you in its online word processor But most importantly Google wants you to search and travel around the web hitting web pages that run Googleserved ads and Google tracking cookies You might think that Google is a really cool company to give away all this free technology while never thinking about the persistent and silent data collection Google is undertaking to profile you in order to deliver you to advertisers for a premium So how do the two stack up in four key areas of competition Browsers Internet Explorer in all its variations still retains close to  percent of the market depending on who is counting and how That dominance remains even though Microsofts latest offering IE lags behind all the other major browsers in features and advanced web capabilities Firefox Opera and Apples Safari have all driven browser innovation over the last five years but most people have not been convinced to leave IE behind despite other alternatives being safer and more advanced Why does it matter Well IE installations come with a default home page dont they Googles Chrome browser on the other hand is a handsome whizkid of a browser Its sleek and nimble and it revolutionizes how tabs are handled The address bar is the search box Google as default naturally Each website opened runs as its own browser instance and has very low permissions to read and write to files The sandboxing of tabs means that if a single website hangs or crashes the rest are unaffected Meanwhile lower permissions make it harder for a hacker to bust into your computer through your browser Chrome also has less than  percent of the browser market share Online Search Googles name now means search to most users Googles search engine means money to Google In June it delivered  percent of search results pages delivered to US web users In the first three months of  Google pulled in  billion in revenue a majority of which came from AdWords an auctionbased service that triggers ads based on the keywords in a search query Microsoft recently debuted Bing a new search engine it hoped would fare well in comparison to Google Its got some fine innovations and shows the company is thinking very hard about better ways to present information to users by finding ways to synthesize data rather than just retrieving links Still despite these improvements a  million ad campaign and generous press coverage that treats Bing like an underdog Bing gained only a point in June to get Microsoft  percent of all searches Operating Systems Microsoft has been making operating systems since  and has spent  years perfecting MSDOS and Windows NT the frameworks that Windows have been built around Microsoft is estimated to run on about  percent of all laptops and desktops in the world By copying its competitors best features leveraging questionable licensing arrangements and using its base of accustomed users to buy it time against innovators Microsoft has held on to its lead in the OS market for almost  years Thats despite challenges from Digital Research Apple and IBM Microsofts newest version Windows  will be available in the fall Early reviews say the OS boots quickly and sleeps fast and avoids much of the confusing interface decisions that have made many dislike Vista the successor to Windows XP Microsoft also dominates in the business world where nearly every medium to large company standardizes around Microsoft Office Microsoft is also at work on version  of its operating system for handheld devices which it first launched in  Its OS advantages are immense It has millions of users who know nothing else and who like Windows There are millions who are attached to games or the thousands of desktop apps that are only available on Windows Thousands of devices just plug in and work on its hardware And familiarity with Microsoft software is a requirement for a huge number of office jobs By contrast Google first stepped into the OS game in  when it announced its Android operating system for small devices Google estimates that some  phone models will be running its system by the end of the year Last week Google announced but did not show off a new OS to compete with Windows dubbing it Chrome OS That name signifies that Googles OS will be for the web and browserbased It hopes to convince developers to write software that runs inside a browser instead of on top of the OS as developers for Windows and Apples OS X do It will also let web developers extend the power of their websites by expanding the capabilities of the browser allowing websites to lean on the browser for storage and processing help Advertising Google is largely powered by its innovative auctionbased text ads on its own site but then expanded into serving ads on other peoples sites with the Adsense program It bought the adserving and behavioralprofiling giant Doubleclick in  for more than  billion and has ventured into mobile print radio and television ads Microsoft has struggled to replicate Googles online advertising success Despite owning MSNcom  a portal that is second only to Yahoo as a destination  Microsoft has not made money on the internet To turbocharge its addelivery technology it paid more than  billion in cash in  for aQuantive a fullservice online advertising concern Instead Microsofts online ad business lost  billion in  double what it lost in  The company expects  revenues to be higher than the  billion it took in last year but has not said it would make a profit Contrary to what some might have you believe the benefits of the GoogleMicrosoft competition are immense Microsoft had largely grown complacent until Google came along to shake up categories Gmails massive online storage capability and fancy programming made Microsoft hustle to upgrade its popular though not userfriendly web email service Google Maps led to Microsofts Live Maps which now bests Googles efforts in some ways Google has been winning the fight for the last few years showing that it is still nimbler than the software giant from the Northwest But the pendulum may be slowing or even poised to swing the other way With the innovations in Bing and the promise that Microsofts online Office offerings will be free and more fully featured than the Google equivalent Microsoft is taking on Google where it matters for users on the field of innovation And that will make for an interesting race no matter which horse you prefer to ride

  Analysis Microsoft wants some of Googles good thingStory Highlights Deal with Yahoo gives Microsoft a greater share of search market  Combined Microsoft and Yahoo are better poised to take on Google   Yahoo has effectively outsourced its search operation   Google also is challenging Microsoft on its own turf operating systemsNext Article in Technology   Read VIDEO  By Steve Mollman For CNN 



 


 

  CNN  Microsoft knows a good thing when it sees it And what Google has going on with its search advertising business is a good thing  which of course is why Microsoft wants a bigger piece of it 
Combined Microsoft and Yahoo will try to erode Googles dominance in search 
 To that end it struck a deal Wednesday to power the searches on Yahoos various properties The deal will increase the market share of Microsofts search platform Bing The boost will help In June according to estimates from comScore Microsofts share in the US search engine market was  percent and Yahoos was  percent compared to  percent for Google   So Bing will soon have close to a  percent market share making it a stronger alternative to Google and Microsoft will move closer to enjoying the selfreinforcing positive feedback loop that has powered Googles rise to dominance  Watch more on search engines  That loop as described by Gartner analyst Neil MacDonald is essentially what the software giant is after It works like this the more people use the search service the more advertisers are willing to pay because more people are using it And the more paying advertisers there are using the service the better and more relevant the ads that come up   Plus the more the search engine is used the better it becomes thanks to contextual learning algorithms Business  Contending Googles throne As for Yahoo its stock took a hit after the announcement and many observers predicted the deal was the beginning of the end for the firm

   Jason Calacanis CEO of the humanpowered search engine Mahalo wrote a blog posting entitled Yahoo committed seppuku today The once proud warrior of the Internet space laid down its sword knelt at the feet of Microsoft and gutted itself today wrote Calacanis But not everyone sees it that way MacDonald sees a very focused smart deal on both sides Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz was astute he says in realizing that the company was about a collection of media properties and the experience the user has and that you dont have to own search to make that experience compelling   Yahoo will not receive an up front payment from Microsoft as part of the deal Instead it will receive  percent of search revenue generated via its sites during the first five years of agreement according to yesterdays announcement The company estimates that the agreement will add about  million annually to its operating cash flow and that it will be able to save about  million by basically outsourcing search Search data will be shared between the two companies They will continue to compete in other areas including email instant messaging and display advertising coopetition like this is fairly common in both media and technology fields notes MacDonald Google isnt sitting still while Microsoft moves in on its territory Its working on a Chrome operating system slated to come out next year that will compete with Microsofts Windows And its suite of online applications already puts up a fight against the Office juggernaut Of course thats a feeble fight at the moment but then so is Microsofts fight in the search arena One or both of these fights might become less lopsided over time but well have to wait and see For now Google and Microsoft have seemingly insurmountable leads in their respective strongholds Not addressed in the deal is the challenge presented by the growth of realtime search  Twitter being a perfect example  which can make both Google and Bing look downright outdated in certain cases For instance by typing Bing into Twitter you can see what people around the world have been saying and sharing about this deal in the past  seconds Meanwhile the ever growing juggernaut of Facebook also challenges the central place held by Google  and by Bing if Microsoft has its way These search engines use impersonal algorithms to draw an atlas of the Web but Facebook wants users to get their information about the world through their filter of friends and colleagues  just as in real life When a Facebook user taps his or her social graph to find the best dentist they never leave the world of Facebook  and Google and Bing are left out in the cold And Facebook has far more details on its users who use their real names 





 Microsoft at least is an investor in Facebook thanks to a deal struck a few years ago Google much to its chagrin is not But it is clearly right in Microsofts sights

 Any one of the more than  million books old enough to fall out of copyright into the public domain Over the last seven years Google has scanned millions of dusty tomes from deep in the stacks of the nations leading university libraries and turned them into searchable documents available anywhere in the world through its search box And now Google Book Search in partnership with On Demand Books is letting readers turn those digital copies back into paper copies individually printed by bookstores around the world Or at least by those booksellers that have ordered its  Espresso Book Machine which cranks out a  page grayscale book with a color cover in about  minutes at a cost to the bookstore of about  for materials The machine prints the pages binds them together perfectly and then cuts the book to size and then dumps a book out literally hot off the press with a satisfying clunk The company says a machine can print about  books a year That means you can stop into the Northshire Bookstore in Manchester Vermont and for less than  customorder your own copy of Dame Curtseys Book of Candy Making the third edition of which was published in  and which can only be found online for  used

 Dane Neller On Demand Books CEO says the announcement flips book distribution on its head We believe this is a revolution Neller said Content retrieval is now centralized and production is decentralized Neller said the deal was clearly about the long tail of books a reference to Wired magazines EditorinChief Chris Andersons theory that hits become less important when distribution costs drop One of the main benefits according to Neller is letting local book stores compete with Amazoncom by reducing their need to have expensive inventory Other current retailers include the University of Michigan Shapiro Library Building in Ann Arbor the Blackwell Bookshop in London the Bibliotheca Alexandrina in Alexandria Egypt the University of Alberta Bookstore in Edmonton Canada and Angus  Robertson Bookstore in Melbourne Australia The company hopes to sell  more printers in the next year bringing the number of machines globally to about  On Demand Books suggests that book stores price the books at about  leaving retailers with a  profit after both Google and On Demand Books collect a buckabook fee Google plans to donate its share to a yetunspecified charity which might be a reaction to its messy legal and public policy fight over a copyright settlement that covers books that are still in copyright All the books that are being added to On Demand Books repertoire in this agreement are out of copyright in the country where it will be printed Starting Sept  Bostonians can stop in the privately owned Harvard Bookstore in Cambridge Massachusetts and have their books printed in front of them Or they can order it over the phone and have the store deliver it  by bicycle Theres a certain irony to that too according to Google spokeswoman Jennie Johnson since the bookstore is right next to Harvards library one of the libraries that partnered with Google to turn its millions of books into an online library of the future Most people cant get into the Harvard Library but you can print their books next door Johnson said Or put another way On Demand Books is betting that in the future every old book will have  readers Whats of interest in these old books Plenty according to Google One knitter discovered a longlost book about knitting and recreated the heirloom pieces and even built a loom from a longlost design Another reader who works with subsistence farmers in Africa currently uses PDFs of old farming techniques to teach stillrelevant skills Google already uses the publicdomain books in search results and users can read those books in full online and even download them as PDFs for free Neither Neller or Johnson cared to speculate on how many of these books they expect to sell but Johnson says some  percent of the publicdomain books are looked at in a given month Unfortunately its unlikely that the number of public domain books will grow larger anytime soon since Congress added two decades to existing copyright protection in  Copyright which originally lasts about  years now extends to the life of an author plus  years for newly created works As for their quality They feel like a typical paperback and are printed using typical  or pound paper with heavier stock for the inkjetprinted cover which currently all share one design While turning bits back into paper seems a bit of a stretch for Google Johnson said it fits with the companys goal of organizing the worlds information We think people should be able to find and read these books Johnson said We dont care how people end up reading them Neller said hed love to see the day when Google Book Searchers can press a button next to a search result and find the closest local printer but Google says thats a long way off So for now book buyers of the future who want to buy books from the past will need to walk to a bookstore  or get Harvard Bookstore to use the bicycle a thcentury invention to bring them a book printed with stcentury technology

 GoogleChina move hurts businesses academicsBy  Lara Farrar CNN   Google shutting China search engineSTORY HIGHLIGHTSChinese businesses and universities could be affected by Google departureAcademics students and researchers rely heavily on Googles search services Most of Chinas  million Internet users however wouldnt be affected Beijing China CNN  Businesses and universities could be substantially affected by the departure of Google from China Most of the countrys nearly  million Internet users may not be affected by the closure But academics university students and other researchers rely heavily on Googles search services to access information not available through Chinese search engines like Baiducom Chinas most popular search portal Small businesses that depend on Google applications such as Google Docs and Gmail may also suffer analysts said A recent survey of more than  Chinese scientists conducted by the journal Nature found that  percent regularly use Google to search for academic papers while  percent said they use the site to stay on top of new research Google quits censoring search in China Students who care more about searching for quality information choose to use Google because it definitely provides better search results than Baidu said Xin Liu a recent graduate of Fudan University in Shanghai It will force more and more students to use wallclimbing software Special circumvention software such as virtual private networks VPNs and proxies have become increasingly popular among Internet users in China who want to break through the Great Firewall as the countrys filtering system is known to access Web sites already blocked by the government China state media Google decision totally wrong Analysts say the use of such tools could dramatically increase if China bars access to Googles overseas search services in Hong Kong or the United States On Monday Google closed its Chinese site and began redirecting its users there to its Hong Kongbased search engine

So far the site has not been blocked Yet queries for sensitive words are blocked when searched from Beijing an indicator China is already filtering the portal If people can use overseas services the impact will not be that great said Jeremy Goldkorn founder of the Chinese media site Danweiorg If the filtering increases in any way from the past it is going to be a problem because none of the Chinese search engines are good at searching the international Internet in English That is going to impact anyone who relies on that Goldkorn said Others say they are worried Google applications including its popular Gmail service and document sharing service Google Docs could eventually be banned They are now one step closer to being blocked said Frank Yu a Beijingbased Internet analyst We depend on this whole series of services for translation and storing documents They are essential for running a small business or a startup A Google departure could also decrease Chinese engineering talent said Yu Google trains a lot of engineers he said Sure there are a lot of competent people here but now there is one less multinational that hires graduates and trains them at a higher level A journalism professor at a Chinese university who asked not to be named said some of my friends say what a pity if Google pulls out of China because they rely heavily on resources including Google Scholars and Google Books It is also true working journalists especially those who cover international news I think it is great pity that this might happen he added

 CNN  Google plunged into the world of social networking on Tuesday melding pieces of Facebook and Twitter into a new feature Google Buzz Buzz which will work through the popular Gmail service will allow users to post status updates photos and links to members of their network  as well as pull in their activity on other sites like Twitter Flickr and Picasa Google spokesman Bradley Horowitz said the service which was rolling out to some Gmail users Tuesday afternoon and should be available to all in the next couple of days aims to weed out what he called the clutter of other networking sites With networking sites theres obviously value there he said Its a phenomenon thats real but its increasingly becoming harder and harder to make sense and find the signal in the noise By letting users post photos links and updates openly the tool would mimic Twitters microblogging format But users also will be able to make their content available to friends only more closely following the Facebook model At an event at the companys Mountain View California headquarters Google also seemed poised to take a poke at the AOL Instant Messenger service saying Buzz will be offered to companies as a tool for interoffice communication It will change the way businesses communicate around the world Horowitz said Despite the inevitable comparisons Google spokesmen said they didnt set out to tread on anyone elses turf We try not to pay too much attention to competitors Gmail product manager Todd Jackson said We try to listen to users Horowitz said Google Buzz will automatically make friends out of the people a user emails or chats with the most on Gmail See CNNmoneys report on reaction from some Google competitors Comments on posts will appear in real time And comments by other users will be weighted similar to how Googles search engine weighs results to collapse bad buzz and recommend the good buzz Jackson said The handsdown leader in the search engine world Google has been branching out on projects that include its Nexus One smartphone the companys first foray into hardware marketing Late last month Google announced that people could tweak their accounts to make results related to friends coworkers and other members of their social networks appear above all other results  The Social Search feature was introduced to a limited number of Google users last year and was made available to everyone in beta status on January  The change came with a hint of more things to come This is just a first step in our ongoing effort to ensure that Google Web search is always as social as the Web itself the company said in an instructional video posted to its official blog  Google Buzz probably wont be able to bring in status updates and other materials from Facebook for the same reason that Social Search doesnt  Because most Facebook users set their information to be viewed only by friends Googles search engine cant collect that information in the same way it can from Twitter and obviously Googleowned sites like YouTube Buzz also will have a mobile component operating on most major wireless operating systems with features that include voicerecognition posting and a GPSenabled ability to attach the users location to posts The Webbased mobile application which can be used by iPhones despite not going through Apples online store can also be set to pick up posts to Buzz being made near the users location Changes to the tool could be coming quickly too Google officials say theyre already studying possible expansions They include allowing Buzz updates by phone letting users post to their Twitter account through the tool and linking Buzz with the stillemerging Google Wave system Were just getting started Horowitz said Were not launching this today because we think were done We dont think thats how a product like this is built

 Why Google Buzz will be a hitBy  Pete Cashmore Special to CNN      Mashable founder Pete Cashmore says Google Buzz will benefit from people already using Gmail STORY HIGHLIGHTS Cashmore Google Buzz is not original but should be moderate success  Gmail like Facebook has a builtin advantage with the millions who use it  Gmail had  million unique visitors in December according to comScore  Content from people you care about on a site you visit daily may be irresistible writer says

Editors note Pete Cashmore is founder and CEO of Mashable a popular blog about social media He is writing a weekly column about social networking and tech for CNNcom   CNN  Google Buzz Googles new social networking service announced this week isnt particularly original  Just like Facebook and Twitter it lets you share links updates and media with friends Even so itll probably be a moderate success  Google Buzz is perhaps the most generic social sharing service launched to date Users can enable the service in their Gmail accounts to share status updates photos videos and more with the group of people they email most often  Friends can also comment on these updates or like them to express approval  There isnt a great deal of innovation here early adopters will remember FriendFeed an identical service acquired by Facebook last year  While FriendFeed built a strong technology platform with an advanced search engine it failed to achieve significant mainstream success The sites features are instead being integrated into Facebook where FriendFeeds talented engineers and Facebooks massive reach more than  million users at last count combine for maximum effect  Good technology has value but leading social networks require network effects Facebook is infinitely more valuable because all your friends are on it Facebook has leveraged this critical mass of users to stay ahead of new rivals too Why visit Twitter you may ask when Facebook has continually extended its feature set to keep up with its less popular competitor  The story of social networks is in fact a story about network effects How can a service reach a point at which there are enough users and content to be useful YouTube achieved this trick by providing embedded videos for MySpace and blogs siphoning off members along the way MySpace eventually chose to block YouTube links and build a rival video service but the move came much too late to halt YouTubes rise  Photobucket meanwhile became one of the worlds largest photo sites by providing photo hosting to MySpace users MySpace parent Fox Interactive Media now News Corp Digital Media acquired the service in   There are arguably better video sites than YouTube and better photo hosts than Photobucket but network effects tend to trump technical prowess in the social networking realm  Google Buzz certainly isnt groundbreaking but it will achieve critical mass virtually overnight Thanks to integration with Gmail the new tool is in the eyeline of the millions of users who obsessively check their inboxes for new mail ComScore pegged Gmail at  million unique visitors in December  Whats more Google Buzz uses data about those you frequently email to automatically build a social network for you Gone are the challenges of critical mass faced by virtually every new social networking service In Google Buzz your address book is your network  Two forces are at work here then the immediate utility of a social service prepopulated with people you know combined with the habitual behaviors associated with checking your email throughout the day  A stream of fresh content from people you care about served up on a site you visit every day may prove to be an irresistible attraction  although perhaps not a novel one

 CNN  Google Inc owner of YouTube said an outage of the popular videosharing site Thursday was technical and not caused by outside tampering YouTube is up again following a technical issue which has now been resolved a spokeswoman for Google said in a written statement We know how important YouTube is for people and apologize for any inconvenience the downtime may have caused  The outage apparently lasted for just over an hour from roughly  to  am ET A YouTube source said the outage was not the result of any kind of attack or related in any way to Googles recent move to stop censoring results in China The timing of the outage just days after Googles announcement had spurred speculation online  During the time YouTube was down Internet users were still able to access individual videos but YouTubes main page returned a Http Service Unavailable message The source said its Googles default policy to not discuss the details on the cause of outages  The searchengine giant has been embroiled in a public feud with the communist nation since January when Google said it was the target of a highly sophisticated and targeted attack originating in China I think many people are understandably looking for China to take some unique and extraordinary technical measures to punish Google said Ron Deibert director of the Citizen Lab at the University of Torontos Munk Centre for International Studies But he said that nothing along those lines has been made public So far what I have seen is business as usual and this includes the filtering that is happening at the backbonegateway levels that have been more or less consistent for a long period of time As for the source of the YouTube problems I am sure they are investigating and it could be a billion problems just as it was for Wikipedia which turned out to be a server cooling problem according to reports Google began operating in China in  agreeing to limited censorship of what the government there considers controversial sites A dashboard page posted by Google after it made its announcement shows that YouTube one of the Internets most popular sites has been blocked in mainland China for the past four days View the page Google Sites and Blogger also have been blocked while other Google properties like photo site Picasa and Google Docs have been partially blocked according to the page Web search and Google Images which like other services now originate from Google servers in Hong Kong were reporting no blockage on the page The YouTube downtime created much online buzz early Thursday The term Service Unavailable became a trending topic and many blogs were speculating on a possible China connection The outage came a day after Wikipedia the usercreated online encyclopedia was down for several hours

 CNN  Google this week released its Instant Search feature which displays live search results as soon as you begin typing  By providing results before a query is complete and removing the need to hit the enter key Google claims users will save two to five seconds per search Are we too impatient to wait a matter of seconds for our search results Whats feeding our newfound need for speed And why does Google feel the need to answer our questions before weve even asked them Faster connections The flow of information around the Web has accelerated rapidly over recent years The most obvious cause is that our Web connections have become significantly faster over time This isnt merely a result of greater broadband penetration but also the nearubiquity of G networks Not only have we become accustomed to fast connections in our homes but weve become conditioned to a similar experience on the go The realtime Web To Web users however this trend has been most evident in the realtime Web movement Services like Twitter and Facebook now deliver messages from our friends in seconds  And while most breaking news stories were previously sourced from mainstream media outlets  taking hours to propagate via blog posts and emailed links  significant news events can now spread through Twitter in a matter of minutes Often stories also enter the news cycle via ontheground reports posted to social networks This significantly accelerates the newsgathering process and the speed at which important information reaches consumers In short these quick status updates between friends have conditioned us to expect immediate access to information  whether thats breaking news or simply knowing what our friends are up to Why should we expect anything less from search engines Enabling discovery Social networking services have fostered another change in consumer behavior one that puts Google at a real disadvantage As a greater volume of timely relevant information is delivered to us via status updates from friends we spend less time searching Whats more many social sites now use our social connections to recommend content to us without the need to seek it out  This socalled discovery trend of which iTunes Ping is the most recent example threatens to usurp the search box If relevant information is delivered to us without extra effort why type words into a box Google Instant Search is tackling the discovery problem too With every letter you type Google serves up suggestions of what you may be looking for Search for tech company and Google provides suggestions for tech company news tech company valuation and tech company names Whats more this feature enables truly personalized discovery by taking into account your search history location and other factors  Google is essentially emulating social networks by trying to predict what were looking for without the need to submit a fullyformed search Next up Google Predictive Search Google is unlikely to rest on its laurels now that Instant Search has been released The only way the company can truly compete with social discovery is by going one step further What if instead of guessing your intent while you search Google could predict your needs before you search Thats likely the next evolution of Google search according to statements from Google CEO Eric Schmidt The next step of search is doing this automatically When I walk down the street I want my smartphone to be doing searches constantly Did you know   Did you know   Did you know   Did you know    Schmidt said at the IFA consumer electronics event in Berlin Germany this week  This notion of autonomous search  to tell me things I didnt know but am probably interested in  is the next great stage in my view of search

 CNET  Google has seen enough of Microsofts Windows operating system suspending internal use of the OS amid security concerns related to the attack on its network late last year according to a report Google CEO Eric Schmidt believes that Chrome OS is more secure than Windows reportedly ordering employees to move away from Windows machines The Financial Times reported late Monday that Google has begun telling new employees that they are no longer able to request Windows PCs giving them the choice of Mac or Linux systems  Google has long offered its employees their choice of work operating system but will no longer do so The Financial Times said afteran attack on Windows and Internet Explorer  resulted in the theft of Google intellectual property believed to be source code late last year Rumors to this effect surfaced earlier in the year but CNET was unable to confirm them at the time  Microsoft has never been a friendly face inside the Googleplex but Googles engineeringdriven culture and need to test its software on a variety of systems usually meant that at least some portion of its employees preferred the Windows environment  Some Google employees will still be able to use Windows machines but they will have to get special permission according to the report Later this year Google will begin directing employees toward Chrome OS systems Google CEO Eric Schmidt told CIOs attending a Google seminar on cloud computing in April Google believes the browserbased operating system will be inherently more secure than alternative operating systems Schmidt said at that event Google declined to comment on specific operational matters   CBS Interactive Inc All rights reserved CNET CNETcom and the CNET logo are registered trademarks of CBS Interactive Inc Used by permission

 CNN  If you search Google on Tuesday you may notice that the information youre looking for is a bit fresher than it would have been on Monday  Thats because the worlds most popular search engine has unveiled a new search method called Caffeine which claims to index new information  percent faster than Googles old search Caffeine provides  percent fresher results for Web searches than our last index and its the largest collection of Web content weve offered the company says in a news release on its official blog Whether its a news story a blog or a forum post you can now find links to relevant content much sooner after it is published than was possible ever before That doesnt mean Google has changed its search formula entirely or that search results will pop onto your screen faster than before Essentially it means that Google is able to find new content more quickly So for instance a new Twitter update that in the past would be been missing from search results because Google hadnt found and indexed it yet would be posted to Google search results more quickly with Caffeine Heres a promotional video from Google that explains how the search works The update  which has been anticipated by tech and searchengine blogs  comes as Google faces increasing competition from both traditional search engines and from online social networks with searchlike functions  Google is still the top search engine with  percent of search queries according to a report from the Web traffic monitor comScore which cites April numbers But thats down  percent compared to the previous month Meanwhile Microsofts Bing search engine has been winning new fans and in general increasing traffic Microsoft and Yahoo combined now make up about  percent of the search market according to the report In terms of social networks Twitter has become a goto site for finding uptotheminute information And Facebook in April debuted its Like functionality all over the Web Some tech writers see that as a threat to Google since Facebook is essentially trying to organize information on the internet according to the likes and dislikes of someones friends Mashable a social media blog that has a content partnership with CNN says Google Caffeine is effective at making the Mountain View California companys search results more immediate This search is not only faster but in some instances in our few tests seems more capable of producing realtime results Ben Parr wrote on the site last year when rumors of Caffeine were surfacing The Google search update is a sign that the company is feeling some heat from its competitor Bing writes Charles Arthur at The Guardian  Its interesting to see that Google is focusing again on the element of its offering where it does lead the pack search he writes Thats what made its Googles name but its clear that even if Microsofts Bing hasnt yet won the market share it has got Google thinking about how it can improve what it does The blog The Next Web says the move is significant for the development of the realtime internet and that it also could provide a tremendous boast to not only Googles stock price but also to its ad revenue To better understand how Caffeine works it might help to think of Caffeine as a blog and the old Google as a newspaper Where a newspaper collects content and then publishes it all at once at the beginning of the day a blog is constantly looking for new information and updating on the fly This is sort of how Google Caffeine works Rather than collecting big batches of Web pages to index for its search Google is trying to publish more frequently as it goes Every second Caffeine processes hundreds of thousands of pages in parallel If this were a pile of paper it would grow three miles taller every second Google says In a blog post Google software engineer Carrie Grimes acknowledges that times are changing for search Content on the Web is blossoming she writes Its growing not just in size and numbers but with the advent of video images news and realtime updates the average Web page is richer and more complex  In addition peoples expectations for search are higher than they used to be Searchers want to find the latest relevant content and publishers expect to be found the instant they publish

 Wired  Google Voice opened to the public Tuesday Up to now you had to have an invitation from a current user before you could sign on to use the innovative phone addon service Now anyone in the US can sign up Voice which premiered in inviteonly fashion a year ago provides you with a single phone number that directs calls to your mobile home or work phone depending on the rules you set Beyond that it includes a basketful of features including transcribed voicemail sent as email or text message free conference calling free outbound domestic calls and callscreening The service is free except for international calls which cost a fraction of what the phone company charges per minute Google Voice used to be known as GrandCentral before Google bought the company in July  Craig Walker the former CEO of GrandCentral now runs Google Voice which he says has a million active users Thats a big number for a service that is inviteonly Walker said New users get a free new number hopefully somewhere near their local area and in anticipation of a rush Voice has bought a bunch of numbers spread across the country though Hawaii and Alaska remain challenges We are pretty optimistic there will be a high demand Walker said Voice also has native apps for Android and Blackberry phones while Palm Pre and iPhone users can use the HTML app including to make outbound calls Google made a fullfeatured app for the iPhone which Apple controversially rejected on the grounds it would confuse users The real cost of iPhone  vs Android rivals Those who commit to giving out a Google Voice number as their central point of contact arent locked into Google and can port their number out to a phone company or to competing services such as Toktumi Users cant yet port their existing numbers into Google Voice which would eliminate the need to have to commit to your Voice number by giving it out to friends and contacts and getting new business cards made Those unfamiliar with the service can see the features in this Googleproduced video Voice could mature into a service that competes with Skype which has become the worlds largest telephone service by allowing free calls between Skype users and cheap calls from PCs and mobile devices to overseas phone numbers To that end Google purchased a Skype competitor called Gizmo last November which lets users make calls from their PCs to other PCs or to the traditional network  Five ways to slash your cell phone bill Google is currently integrating this into Google Voice though there is reportedly some internal friction over whether to scrap the downloadable software in favor of an HTML web app even though the latter wouldnt have as good voice quality Currently Google Voice calls use the minutes of a mobile phone plan unlike Skype which bypasses the voice channel by making calls using data plansSubscribe to WIRED magazine for less than  an issue and get a FREE GIFT Click here
