She'd been coding since she was 6.A real life Powerpuff GirlAfter creating the board game, Mehta won the $2,500 second-place prize from Think Tank Learning's Pitchfest in 2016.This caught the notice of some marketeers for Cartoon Network who were looking to profile inspiring young girls as real life "Powerpuff Girls." She was featured in one of their videos, and things took off from there.Samaira Mehta at GoogleMoreSamaira MehtaMehta was featured on some newscasts and started selling her game on Amazon."We've sold 1,000 boxes, so over $35,000, and it's only been on the market for one year," the exuberant and adorable Mehta told Business Insider.It wasn't just happenstance promotion. When she launched the board game, she also came up with a killer marketing plan with the help of her proud father, Rakesh Mehta (an Intel engineer and Oracle and Sun Microsystems alum).Mehta uses the game to conduct coding workshops for school-age kids. And she thinks big.She launched an initiative called Yes, 1 Billion Kids Can Code that allows interested people to donate boxes of the game to schools. She then set up workshops to help kids at those schools learn how to master the game.At the start of this school year, 106 schools were using the game to teach kids to code, Mehta said."In the world there are over 1 billion kids," she said. "There are people who are willing to donate CoderBunnyz boxes to schools and to people in need all over the world who want to learn coding."Aadit MehtaMoreCoderMindzSales of the game have gone so well that Mehta has just launched a sequel: a game for kids that teaches them how to code using artificial intelligence.The new game is called CoderMindz and she's billing it as the first AI board game.With CoderMindz, kids can learn basic AI principals — concepts like training an AI model, inference, and adaptive learning. Eventually, they can use those skills to build robots.Story continuesShe developed it with the help of her brother, Aadit, who is 6, the age she was when her dad started teaching her to code.A young Valley star is bornAs the game took off, Mehta was booked with workshops. She's done over 60 of them in Silicon Valley with over 2,000 kids so far, she said.The workshops included a series held at Google headquarters in Mountain View, California. That's where she met Stacy Sullivan, Google's chief culture officer.Samaira MehtaMoreCoderBunnyz"After my back-to-back workshops at Google headquarters, we talked for an hour," Mehta said. "She told me I was doing great and once I get out of college, I can come work for Google."The plucky young coder told Sullivan that she didn't know if she would want to work for Google. She likes being an entrepreneur.Meanwhile, Sullivan and the folks at Google were so impressed with the kid coder that she was picked as the keynote speaker at a Diversity in Tech conference held in August hosted at Google Launchpad, the company's startup accelerator in San Francisco. But she's done a bunch of other speaking gigs, too, including one at Microsoft and at the Girls' Festival sponsored by World Wide Women earlier this month.Samaira MehtaMoreSamaira MehtaSince the debut of CoderBunnyz she's met a lot of big names. One of her proudest moments was receiving an encouraging letter from former first lady Michelle Obama.She also met Mark Zuckerberg on Halloween when she was trick-or-treating in his neighborhood, and took the opportunity to chat him up about her coding work.She said there was "a super long line" at his house."I finally got to meet him," she remembered. "He was handing out chocolates. I told him I was a young coder and he told me to keep going, you're doing great."She's now launched her own interview series on her CoderBunnyz website in which she talks with people in the robotics, game, and education sectors.CoderBunnyz workshopMoreCoderBunnyzWhile she's reinvesting all the money from her young business into manufacturing more CoderBunnyz games and creating the new AI game, she's already got a charity picked out for when she generates profits: PATH."It ends homelessness and helps people rebuild skills and I care about the homeless," she said.Until the day her company can make donations, she's putting her entrepreneurial know-how to work in other ways to raise money for it, including hosting a lemonade stand this summer that brought in $119.NOW WATCH: How a coding genius makes incredible 3D-graphics for major Hollywood moviesSee Also:Here's how Google's new $150 Home Hub compares to the Amazon Echo ShowBattle of the big phones: How Google's new Pixel 3 XL compares to the jumbo iPhone XS MaxDELETE YOUR ACCOUNT: How to wipe your personal information from Facebook, Amazon, Google, and other major websites and appsSEE ALSO: The extraordinary life of Microsoft's billionaire cofounder Paul Allen, who has died at the age of 65ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWhat to Expect When Alphabet Reports Later This MonthMotley FoolThe Morning After: The Weather Channel got hackedEngadgetCaterina Fake is known for her trend-spotting; here's some of what she's chasing nowTechCrunchConsole gaming is at a crossroadsEngadgetMueller's Reminder That Silicon Valley Isn't Ready for the Next ElectionBloombergZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceState defends South Dakota pipeline protest legislationAssociated Press'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolIn Ukrainian candidate's hometown, a cry for changeAssociated PressAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHere's What Hedge Funds Think About NIO Inc.

But when a whopping15,000 eggs were delivered to their kitchen, they realized their translation had been in error.“There wasliterally no end to the delivery. Absolutely unbelievable,” chef Ståle Johansen told Afterposten, according to an NBC News translation.  OL-leiren bestilte 1500 egg gjennom å oversette via Google Translate. Men det slo feil. 15.000 ble levert på døra. Vi ønsker lykke til og håper at de norske gullhåpene er glade – veldig glade – i egg: 😁pic.twitter.com/qaWVpq1Xgy— Trønder-Avisa (@tronderavisa) February 3, 2018 Johansen said they fortunately were able to return the extra 13,500 eggs to the store but said the chefs will still be whipping up plenty of egg dishes for the Norwegian competitors. He added that his culinary team will be preparing food “almost 24 hours a day” to keep their athletes well-nourished. Norway has thehighest all-time Winter Olympics medal count, with 329 medals amassed since the first Winter Games in 1924. The Scandinavian nation is expected to yet againbe one of the top countries to beatat this year’s games. Cooking for Olympic athletes is no small feat, as Megan Chacosky, a chef for the U.S. Winter Olympics team, explained to Mic.com in an interview last month. “I often joke that it’s likemaking Thanksgiving dinner twice a day,” said Chacosky, who will reportedly help prepare about 3,000 meals for the American teamwhile it’s in Pyeonchang.Chacosky told ABC News that most athletes at the Games, which kick off this Friday, will be consuming 3,000 to 4,000 calories per day.“The amount of travel these athletes do, in addition to their training, they’re putting their bodies to the max,” she said. “We try to get lots of fresh produce to get vitamins and minerals to help keep them healthy.”This article originally appeared on HuffPost.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceMagic Johnson joins Ice Cube's bid to buy sports networks from DisneyAmerican City Business Journals'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolAtlanta businessmen's horses to race in Kentucky DerbyAmerican City Business JournalsAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceInstagram test visualizes hiding 'Like' counts from viewersEngadgetWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphThe Quick Read About… Ukraine's Run-Off Presidential ElectionsTimeMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance內地熱門城市樓價回升星島日報57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolMLS Review: De Boer's Atlanta woes continue, Nani lifts Orlando CityGoal.comWhat's next for Trump following the Mueller Report?Yahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin Rivet3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley Fool

AÂ recent survey says 72% of Americans were stressed about money last month.In fact, according to the Federal Reserve, 60% of Americans between the ages of 18 to 40 saved absolutely nothing in 2013. Last year, adults under 35 had a savings rate of negative 2%.So why is this happening? Is it that hard to go to a bank and open an automatic savings or a CD account?â€œThe bank experience has too much friction and inertia that people are just not saving,â€ Ethan Bloch, founder of the personal finance app Digit, tells Business Insider.Bloch created Digit, an app that automatically saves money from your checking account without your even having to think about it. He got $2.5 million in seed funding from Baseline Ventures, Google Ventures, and a handful of other firms last December, and the app opens to the public Thursday.The way it works is simple. Once you connect your checking account to Digit, it will automatically transfer a small portion of your money that it knows you wonâ€™t be needing immediately to a separate Digit savings account. These are FDIC-insured, custodial accounts held by Digit at two of its partner banks, Wells Fargo and BofI Federal Bank, meaning that even if Digit or both those banks go bankrupt, you will be insured up to $250,000.The secret sauce is in Digitâ€™s algorithm, which monitors your income and spending patterns and calculates the exact amount of money you wonâ€™t be missing.It mainly looks at four things: the level of money in your checking account, upcoming salary, upcoming bills, and how youâ€™ve been spending lately (with some banks, Digit can pull three years of transaction data). So if you get fired one day and your paycheck stops, Digit will see that and readjust the transfer amount. Users can always manually set their savings amount, and, if needed, withdraw their savings anytime they want, too.But thereâ€™s a catch: Users do not earn any interest on their savings.Digit screenshotMoreDigitDigit doesn't charge users for its service, so all the transfer and operating costs are covered by the interest Digit earns by saving those usersâ€™ money at its partner banks.Â Eventually, it hopes to share some of that interest back with its users once it builds enough of a financial base. â€œOur goal is to share some of the interest with our customers as we grow our deposits, as long as we know we can cover our costs,â€ Bloch tells us.That sharing may happen sooner than later, as the company is growing pretty well. During its five-month pilot period, which ended in December, Digit saved a total of $600,000 for its members, and now itâ€™s saving members $1 million per month. And it hasn't even launched to the public until this week.If anyone can make this happen, Bloch seems to be the right guy.

So we asked a few Motley Fool contributors to name some businesses they think have potential that resembles that of the Google of yore. They came back with ADT Inc. (NYSE: ADT), Shopify (NYSE: SHOP), and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX).Image of a tower viewer overlooking a mountain landscape.MoreImage source: Getty Images.You just can't ignore this e-commerce playNeha Chamaria (Shopify): Google was already profitable when it IPOed in 2004. But the numbers that stood out in its books quarter after quarter were on the top line: Its revenue was growing at a torrid pace. That, combined with Google's potential to become a tech juggernaut, caught investors' attention, and went on to make it one of the most successful stocks ever. I see similar potential in Shopify -- an e-commerce powerhouse in the making that's already turning heads with its differentiated product offerings and strong revenue growth.Unlike Amazon.com, which operates its own marketplace, Shopify offers a cloud-based e-commerce platform that makes it easy for small and medium-sized businesses to create and run their own online stores. Shopify earns monthly fees (subscription solutions revenue) from the merchants that use its platform, as well as a percentage of transactions made on its portal (merchant solutions revenue).Shopify generated a record $9.1 billion in gross merchandise volume in the last quarter even as its merchant base crossed 600,000. Its revenue surged 73% in 2017. One strong factor appears to be working for Shopify: Access to entrepreneurs and smaller businesses to its technologically advanced, e-commerce platform. Just to give you an idea about what Shopify is doing on the tech front, the company recently partnered with none other than Apple to bring augmented reality to its platform.While Shopify isn't profitable yet because it's spending heavily to grow and market its business, investors are likely to be richly rewarded in the long run given the profitable niche it's carving for itself in the e-commerce space.You can invest in this security leader againChuck Saletta (ADT): By the time it went public, Google was already recognized as an internet search leader. Home and business security company ADT is similarly a leader in its industry in the U.S. and Canada. After about two years as a privately held company, it rejoined the public market last month, and is actually trading below its IPO price. That gives investors the opportunity to buy in for less than those "lucky" enough to get a piece of its offering.Home and business security monitoring, like internet search, is a business where scale matters a great deal. With alarm systems, central monitoring sites handle the response and dispatch duties. The more customers a company has, the more widely it can spread its overhead costs. As the largest player in its industry, ADT is thus best able to cover the costs of providing its service.ADT's shares aren't just trading below their IPO price, they're downright reasonable compared to the company's prospects. They're valued at less than 15 times its expected forward earnings,  and the company is expected to be able to grow earnings at a healthy clip over the next five or so years.Story continuesIf there's one risk with ADT, it's that its balance sheet has been "levered up" by its former private equity owner:  Its debt-to-equity ratio is a rather high 3.9.  Given its scale and relatively asset-light operating model, it will likely be able to generate enough cash to comfortably service its debt. Still, that's something to watch, especially if its growth doesn't materialize to the expected degree.The streaming video giant Chris Neiger (NFLX): Netflix is a powerhouse in its niche of video streaming, just like Google was (and is) with Internet search. The two companies similarly focused their attentions on building amazing products, and neither has looked back since. But the difference is that Netflix is only beginning to tap its international market potential.Netflix ended 2017 with about 118 million total subscribers and more than 53% of them are international customers. It would therefore be logical to assume that the majority of its sales and earnings come from outside the U.S. -- but they don't. International subscribers generate about 49% of revenue and have a contribution margin (which is sales, minus variable costs) of just 8.7%, compared to a 34.4% margin for Netflix's domestic customers. What all of this means is that Netflix has a huge opportunity to raise rates for its international customers in the coming years, just as it has done in the U.S., and drastically increase its margins in other markets.Netflix had its first full year of international-contribution profits in 2017, and more than doubled its global operating income as well. Conservative estimates forecast its international subscriber numbers will exceed 100 million just two years from now, which would require about 60% growth. That doesn't even include domestic customer growth over that same time period. Even if Netflix rolls out price increases more slowly for its international customers than it has domestically, those customers will still add significantly to the company's profits.Strong subscription and sales growth both at home and abroad have, of course, pushed up the Netflix's share price and valuation. Shares are trading at 67 times forward earnings estimates right now. But Netflix isn't anywhere near finished growing -- and its international profits are just getting started.

However, not every off-the-beaten-path stock is worth buying. We asked some of our top Motley Fool investors to scour the market for underfollowed companies they think can be bought now. At the top of their list are Jounce Therapeutics (NASDAQ: JNCE), Snap-On (NYSE: SNA), and Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU).Are these stocks right for your portfolio?Ignoring this biotech could be a mistakeTodd Campbell (Jounce Therapeutics): Clinical-stage biotech stocks are often overlooked by Wall Street until they report positive trial data. As a result, it could be a good time to buy Jounce Therapeutics ahead of midstage trial results for its lead product candidate, JTX-2011.A businessman looking through binoculars.MoreIMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.JTX-2011 is a cancer drug that's being evaluated as a monotherapy and in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb's multibillion-dollar PD-1 drug, Opdivo. It stimulates the immune system by activating the Inducible T cell CO-Stimulator (ICOS) protein that's found on certain T cells within tumors.Typically, cancer drugs are evaluated in trials enrolling patients with one type of cancer, such as lung cancer. However, that's not the case with JTX-2011. ICOS is expressed on effector cells across a number of cancer indications, so its trial is evaluating it in six different solid tumor indications, including lung cancer. JTX-2011 is additionally intriguing because it may help PD-1 drugs work in patients who wouldn't typically respond to them. PD-1 drugs are among the world's best-selling cancer drugs, so the potential for JTX-2011 to be used alongside them is significant.Assuming that JTX-2011's trial data is good, it's possible that regulators will consider giving it an accelerated or conditional OK, especially for use in advanced cancer patients with limited treatment options. If so, then JTX-2011 has a good shot at hitting the ground running because Jounce has inked a co-commercialization deal with the biotech Goliath Celgene (NASDAQ: CELG).Admittedly, there's no guarantee that JTX-2011's data will be good, and that makes this a high-risk stock. Nevertheless, if this trial pans out, I think there's potential for this company's shares to trade significantly higher. The cancer-treatment market is enormous, yet Jounce's market cap is just $844 million and only four analysts cover it, according to Yahoo! Finance. Since Jounce is underfollowed, its shares could rally if more analysts initiate coverage with a buy, following its JTX-2011 data.This stock could make growth a snapRich Duprey (Snap-On): Shares of automotive hand-tool maker Snap-On have risen 30% from their 52-week lows. With earnings on the table on Feb. 8, analysts are betting the company's going to miss consensus estimates. The bear case is that the company relies too much on financing its franchises, which now account for more than a quarter of operating profits compared to 4% from 2010, and collections on receivables are worsening.Management, however, says financing's contributions to the overall total are overblown when the situation is looked at as a whole, and slowdowns in sales last year were due more to adjustments in inventory than slack demand. It also doesn't expect charge-offs to worsen.Story continuesSnap-On has made several acquisitions over the last year or so, which gives it great opportunity to expand internationally. It continues to enhance its franchise network, while also expanding its relationship with repair-shop owners. And despite pockets of occasional weakness, Snap-On's main business segments all show solid growth prospects over the long haul.The economy is performing the best that it has in years, and car-rating service Edmunds.com says that, although values for 10- to 15-year old cars is stagnating a bit, they remain consistently higher for these cars, reflecting their demand. They represent just under 10% of all used-car sales, suggesting there will be a ready market for their repair, even if used-car sales, in general, are slowing.Snap-On pays a dividend of $3.28 per share that yields a modest 1.8% annually, but with Wall Street's bearish outlook, an upside surprise could send shares soaring.A red envelope filled with Chinese paper money with coins tied with red yarn resting on top of it.MoreIMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.The Google of ChinaDanny Vena (Baidu): Many investors tend to be U.S.-centric in their thinking. While that's easy to understand, it also can result in lost prospects. Expanding outside national borders provides a world of opportunities.Consider China, with its population of 1.37 billion consumers and 700 million internet users -- more than twice the number in the U.S. Even across hemispheres, the common thread among online users is search. That's why investors should check out Baidu, the "Google of China."Baidu dominates local search in the country, controlling more than 70% of the market. The company still generates 85% of its revenue from search, but has its sights set firmly on the future.The company realized early the trend toward mobile internet, allowing it to make the transition and maintain its leading position. Baidu was also among the first to see the potential for artificial intelligence (AI) and is the leader of AI in China, and has some of the top programs worldwide.Baidu is home to some of the foremost minds in AI, and this can be seen across the company's products and services. From improved search results to smart speakers to autonomous driving, AI is integrated into the company's operations.Baidu is also home to iQiyi, the leading streaming service in China, which has an estimated 442 million monthly active users and 33% of the coveted 25- to 30-year-old demographic. Baidu may spin off the streaming company in 2018.The company hasn't been without the occasional misstep. Its investments in the online-to-offline (O2O) market never gained significant momentum, and regulators took a particular interest in the advertising practices of questionable medical companies.In its most recent quarter, Baidu saw revenue that grew 29% year over year, and net income that soared 156% over the prior-year quarter.Wall Street is overlooking this stock -- don't make the same mistake.

By gathering information from mapping vehicles and anonymized snippets of route data from individual iPhones, Apple aims to provide users with a more comprehensive, current guide to the world—beginning this fall for iOS 12 users across northern California. That would be a decent start to redeeming Apple Maps from a legacy of errant routing. But if Apple wants to overcome the enormous lead of Google (GOOG, GOOGL), more accurate lines and dots can only be the start.Transit navigation in more placesSix years after Apple Maps launched without public transit information, it matches Google feature-for-feature in major cities like New York and Washington—it tells you which exit to take out of a subway station and even knows about single-purpose routes like the express bus from Metro to Dulles International Airport. But outside of such cities, Apple’s transit support remains woefully behind, leaving Google Maps unchallenged for bus guidance in smaller places like Burlington, Vermont, and Missoula, Montana.Beyond the U.S., Apple Maps is a joke for transit advice. It has no help for subways and buses in Bangkok, Barcelona, Brussels and Buenos Aires, and it’s just as bad across the rest of the alphabet of global cities. I don’t know what’s made adding transit navigation such a bespoke, artisanal process at Apple, but it has to stop. Because Google and, to a lesser extent, Microsoft (MSFT) have been able to incorporate transit agencies’ schedules and routes. In fact, there’s been a standard format for that since 2006—without the work looking like cartographic trench warfare.Not all lanes are the sameIf you drive to work, your commute can go by faster if you’re willing to pay—or if you have enough other passengers in the car. But both Apple and Google have been slow to recognize the advent of carpool lanes that charge single drivers a toll but let high-occupancy vehicles (typically, from two to three people per vehicle) roll by for free.Google is still way ahead of Apple’s mapping software.MoreGoogle’s Waze app added support for these surcharge-possible lanes at the end of November, in the form of a switch that lets people self-designate as “HOV” drivers to see the fastest, cheapest routes available.Apple Maps should follow suit. But first, it will need to mark out carpool lanes clearly—which it does not do on the Virginia side of the Capital Beltway, more than five years after the debut of those “Express Lanes.”Apple would also do well to roll out this feature worldwide faster than usual. Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with Creative Strategies, complained in an email that Apple took years to add lane-specific guidance on European highways. “It seems that California is their best implementation of Maps when it comes to the granularity of info,” she wrote.Safe walking directionsBoth Google and Apple could do better when guiding people on foot. I saw this firsthand last November at the Web Summit conference in Lisbon, when Google Maps suggested a seemingly optimum walking route from a restaurant back to my hotel. But it had found one of the least pedestrian-friendly routes in that walkable city, and sent me alongside a four-lane highway mostly absent of sidewalks. Google still offers the same defective routing, as does Apple Maps. And complaints of unsafe walking directions continue to pop up. This could be a chance for Apple to do better: The amount of data its vans collect (TechCrunch’s Panzarino counted eight cameras and four LiDAR sensors on one) should allow it better insight over what makes a safe path for a pedestrian. Story continuesBikes belong too—and so do scootersIf you get around on two wheels, Google Maps remains unchallenged eight years after Google added bicycling directions, even as bike-sharing services have revolutionized getting around cities.At a minimum, Apple should show cyclists the way as well as Google does—and it looks like Apple might do just that. In a Twitter thread following up on his story, Panzarino noted that Apple is already recording the speed at which people cross parks—an obvious indicator of cycling versus walking. But why not do better? To the extent that bike-sharing services allow public access to their availability data, a navigation app should be able to tell you which ones have bikes open near you—something third-party services like Transit Screen already do. The same goes for the electric bike and electric scooter sharing services that let people get a little farther across town without breaking a sweat.All-of-the-above routingBoth Apple and Google’s maps show their age when they list driving and transit as separate categories—but there’s no reason to do that when you can start a trip on a shared bike, take a train and then let Lyft or Uber complete your journey.“I’d like all apps including Google to do multimodal—like ‘take transit here and then hop on Capital Bikeshare from there’ or ‘Uber to transit’ or the like,” commented David Alpert, founder of the transit-and-development-policy site Greater Greater Washington. “Now it assumes you are using one mode.”An only-Apple situationLooking at all the things Apple Maps botches today, it can be tempting to tell people to stop waiting on Cupertino and use Google Maps already. But Apple doesn’t let iPhone users designate another map app as the default for navigation. If you use an Apple Watch, you can’t have Google call out turns on your wrist. And until iOS 12 ships, you can’t use Google Maps or Waze on the CarPlay screen of a suitably equipped vehicle.Apple has essentially said “I alone can fix this.” So it had better do that.More from Rob:Apple’s Safari has dropped the ball on securityHow self-driving cars will take to China’s roadsFacebook’s push to kill bad political ads is also hiding regular postsHow Europe’s proposed copyright laws could ruin your search enginesHere’s what it’s like to drive a hydrogen-powered car Email Rob at rob@robpegoraro.com; follow him on Twitter at @robpegoraro.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextFoxconn says it remains committed to Wisconsin investment projectReutersAt $1 Trillion, Apple is Bigger Than These ThingsInvestopediaWhat to Expect When Alphabet Reports Later This MonthMotley FoolDon't Miss Out on the Netflix of 5G StocksInvestorPlaceThe Morning After: The Weather Channel got hackedEngadgetZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business Videos57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphThe Boeing 737 MAX Is 1 Step Closer to Flying Again -- but Don't Expect to See It SoonMotley FoolBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadgetBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolTesla's board is about to get a lot smallerTechCrunchAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo Finance3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetInvesting in General Electric Is All About These 3 Key ThingsMotley Fool

Like the full-size Echo, it responds to your commands and questions from across the room—but it’s a tiny, sawed-off one that costs $50. The only difference is that because you don’t have the big cylinder, the sound quality is tinny. It makes a fantastic second Echo—say, for the upstairs.Well, now here’s Google (GOOG, GOOGL) with its own version of the Dot, called the Google Home Mini. Also puck-shaped, also $50. (Google will also be releasing the Google Home Max, a beefier version with better sound.)The new Google Home Mini (right) has clearly been inspired by the Amazon Echo Dot (left).MoreThe Dot and the Mini are 90% identical. They both work great. Each has a Microphone Off switch, so you can be sure that it’s not listening for its trigger word. Both can now distinguish who is making the request, so that it can respond to commands like “Play my party playlist” and “What’s next on my calendar?” with the right person’s music or info. Both now let you make free speakerphone calls to actual phone numbers (although the Google’s call quality is awful).There are, however, a few differences to note.In this corner: The Google Home Mini.The sound is much better. Neither assistant pod will be mistaken for a concert hall. But there’s no question that Google’s built-in speaker is richer than Amazon’s.It talks to Chromecasts and Android TVs. If you spring $35 for a Chromecast (a little receiver stick that plugs into a modern TV’s USB jack), or if you have a TV that runs Android TV, you can perform a nifty trick. You can say, “Ok Google, show me a video about how to remove contact lenses” or “Show me funny cat videos” or “Show me the trailer for the new Avengers movie,” and it appears on your TV instantly. As you can see in the video above, it’s quite magical.It will someday have a tap-to-talk feature. The top of the Mini is supposed to be touch sensitive. As designed, you could tap it to issue a command (instead of saying “OK Google”), or tap it to pause music. But just as the Home Mini was shipping, a reviewer discovered a bug in which that button thought that it was being pressed all the time, transmitting everything anyone said in the room to Google’s servers. So Google responded by shutting off that top button’s features altogether.Google will presumably restore the tap-the-top feature once they get their act together.MoreAnd now, in this corner: The Amazon Echo Dot.Works with more home-automation products, like internet-controlled thermostats, lights, security cameras, and so on. It’s a huge list. Google’s improving on this front, but Amazon’s had a several-year head start.It has an audio output jack. Lots of people love plugging in their nice speakers or sound systems to an Echo Dot, thanks to the standard miniplug on the side (the Google offers nothing similar). That makes it easy to control your music by voice—one of the most luxurious features ever.It’s much easier and more reliable to adjust the Echo Dot’s volume (left) by turning its ring instead of tapping the sides.MoreYou can see feedback across the room. The Dot’s LED ring glows in different colors and patterns to communicate different things—for example, it glows when it’s transmitting sound back to Amazon. You can see it from the side, and therefore from across the room. The Google’s four LEDs are visible only when you’re looking down on the device, which isn’t nearly as useful.You can order stuff. Of course, this is exactly what Amazon hopes you’ll do, but it’s still cool. “Alexa—order more paper towels.”If you’re a Google Play subscriber, maybe the convenience of speaking your desires for music tips the balance for you toward the Google Home Mini. (The argument about “Buy a Google Home if you keep your calendar in Google Calendar” doesn’t really hold water, since the Echo can consult or add events to the calendar systems of Google or Apple (AAPL) or Microsoft (MSFT).Otherwise, though, the Echo Dot is still the better micro-assistant. (Especially when it’s on sale for $40—for example, on the typical Black Friday, which is in a couple of weeks.)There will be a lot of people unwrapping these little guys this holiday season.MoreBoth of these devices are delicious enhancements to almost anyone’s home. Over time, you’ll find more and more ways that they’re useful—and for only 50 bucks!Correction: The originally posted version of this story referred to the volume ring of the Echo Dot. That was a feature of the first-generation Dot; the current second-generation Dot has volume buttons on the top instead of the ring.More from David Pogue:The Fitbit Ionic doesn’t quite deserve the term ‘smartwatch’Augmented reality?

While no server is completely secure, this could provide peace of mind to people who don't trust large tech companies to protect their data. It's not hard to get the impression that big tech companies can't effectively keep our data safe. Just in the past few weeks, Google disclosed a security bug that exposed hundreds of thousands of private accounts on the Google+ social network. Facebook admitted that 29 million users had private information stolen. It's easy to decide to quit using social media sites, but nearly everyone needs or uses an email service. Email is the backbone of every internet account — you almost can't get by in life these days without an email address. One solution is to run your own in-house email server, as plenty of companies and tech-savvy individuals do. This means that a private entity is in control of the email server and all of the information stored there. There's no need to place your trust in a tech company that has proven itself to be vulnerable to security bugs or breaches. But if you're not an IT pro, the idea of setting  up an email server can be pretty intimidating. That's where Helm comes in.Helm wants to make that a reality for the everyday email user — someone who probably wouldn't know how to set up an email server from scratch. Helm's $500 device is an in-home email server, meaning all of your data and emails are stored on the device right in your home. Helm doesn't collect much information about its users besides the necessary details like payment information and device diagnostics, and any communication or data are encrypted when they leave the Helm device. With traditional email services like Gmail or Yahoo, your data and emails are stored on a server controlled by the email provider. You don't have much control over what that company does with your data.Helm stores your emails and data in your home, but that doesn't mean it's completely safe. Any server can be attacked, regardless of where it's located. However, you're paying for the control over your emails and the ability to be free from a tech company storing your data. Helm also says it hires hackers to try to locate vulnerabilities in the device or its software, and it plans to release improvements and boost security through future software updates. You can choose to store a backup of your emails on Helm's servers, but those backups are encrypted and require your security key in order to be decrypted. Helm features a standard 120GB of storage, but that can be increased to up to 5TB with additional hardware. The device also comes with physical encryption keys for encrypting data locally on the machine and offline for a secure backup. The device costs $500, and has a $99 subscription fee for every year after the included one-year subscription. For more information, or to purchase a device, visit Helm's website here. NOW WATCH: Watch Apple unveil a new, bigger watchSee Also:Facebook has admitted that data collected by its Portal devices could be used in targeted adsSundar Pichai spoke about Google's China plans for the first time and it doesn't look like he's backing downThe Facebook hack that exposed 30 million accounts shows we're going to be dealing with the consequences of its 'Move Fast' motto for years to comeSEE ALSO: This clever $35 iPhone case has a scroll wheel with six built-in lenses — and it turns your phone camera into a Swiss-army knife for taking picturesReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWhat to Expect When Alphabet Reports Later This MonthMotley FoolThe Morning After: The Weather Channel got hackedEngadgetConsole gaming is at a crossroadsEngadgetMental health apps are sharing data without proper disclosureEngadget6 Workouts That Will Shake Up Your Current RoutineBRIT + COZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceState defends South Dakota pipeline protest legislationAssociated PressWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolIn Ukrainian candidate's hometown, a cry for changeAssociated Press'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadgetWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCThe Boeing 737 MAX Is 1 Step Closer to Flying Again -- but Don't Expect to See It SoonMotley FoolButina Shouldn't Serve Any More Time in Prison, Her Lawyers SayBloomberg

Simple, cheap and with long-lasting batteries, they have become a popular option for students and children.Devices made by Acer, HP Inc, Dell Inc and others, including Google itself, have taken nearly 60 percent of the U.S. grade-school market in the seven or so years since they appeared.The new Acer machines are part of the latest step in Google's long-term strategy to conquer the lucrative business market, where personal computers running Microsoft Corp's Windows operating system still account for 90 percent of the market.Google, a part of Alphabet Inc, is pushing Chromebooks because they help draw customers to its cloud computing services and G Suite workplace software bundle - a rival to Microsoft's Office - both of which are key to the company's efforts to diversify revenue.Chromebooks' difficulties running complex applications have so far limited their appeal to businesses, but that could change soon."Chromebook from the gate has been that just-good-enough for your grandma device," said Linn Huang, research director at technology advisory firm IDC. "They are still leaps and bounds behind, but this year and next year Google will make massive corrections to close the gap."Acer, which IDC estimates was the No. 2 Chromebook vendor in the United States last year, will outfit its new line with large, hardened screens, aluminium bodies and Intel Corp's top-flight 8th Generation processors, said Gregg Prendergast, president of Acer Pan America.He declined to specify prices, but said they would be higher than the typical $300 (£223) Chromebooks aimed at students.Google, which makes its own $1,000-and-up Pixelbook, is working with other hardware manufacturers to launch other top-tier Chromebooks this year. Since August, Google has charged businesses $50 per laptop per year for a management licence. Its education plan costs $30 annually.Chromebooks' adoption in schools has shown businesses that the devices are easy to secure and manage, according to Huang, but their "low horsepower" has limited use to fast-food outlets, shops, banks, health clinics and similar situations where a single lightweight and mobile device is shared by many employees.Google has upped the capabilities of its software and increased the number of its authorized sales partners by 25 percent over the last year in an attempt to persuade business users that Chromebooks can handle more complex tasks.Last year, more Chromebooks began supporting Google's Android apps, which provide offline functionality and enable companies to make specialised software more accessible.

She said that Fiber's pace of rollout has been paused until the company find a way to make the service "10x" better. Don't expect Google Fiber to start announcing new target cities any time soon.Alphabet's GOOGL once-ambitious plan to blanket the country with superfast internet service has been on hold of late, and it was up to Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat on Monday to field questions about the unit's future.At the Morgan Stanley Technology Conference, where Porat was speaking, an analyst asked about Fiber's change in strategy and the company's new milestones. Porat said that Fiber's rollout has been paused until the company finds a way to make the service 10 times better."As we were looking at our rollouts going back to 2015, 2016, our view was that we had not done enough," Porat said. She said that Fiber hadn't achieved its "10x moment," which is Google-speak for getting a 10-fold improvement over existing technology.It's been a tough couple of years for Fiber. Launched in 2010 with the promise of bringing fast and affordable internet service to municipalities across the country, the initiative has endured cost-cutting measures, layoffs and two CEO resignations since becoming part of the Alphabet unit Access.Porat said that Alphabet was holding off on pushing Fiber into new markets until it could find a better way to "bring technology to bear in a meaningful way." She said that the company won't start "accelerating the rollout" again until it can prove that it has a valuable new deployment and delivery method.Access acquired the home broadband company Webpass in 2016 to help it work on new delivery methods, but Webpass recently stopped accepting new customers in Boston .Access hired a new CEO earlier this month , a Time Warner Cable executive who Porat described as having a "really strong history in the industry."Fiber is one of only three "Other Bets" businesses consistently highlighted during Alphabet's earnings calls for bringing in any revenue, alongside health-care company Verily, and Nest , which just got rolled back into Google.Alphabet cut its Other Bets capital expenditures from $1.4 billion in 2016 to $507 million in 2017 because of a reduced investment in Fiber.The pause on Fiber has had other ramifications. Ahead of a potential rollout in Portland, Oregon, Google convinced the state to provide a tax exemption. Google "paused" its Fiber plans and the tax break went to Comcast CMCSA (owner of NBC Universal, the parent of CNBC) and Frontier, which may have cost local governments and school districts more than $17 million, according to a recent report in The Oregonian ."The one thing that has not changed [about Fiber's strategy] is our view that there is a real need for quality service," Porat said.It's just not clear if Alphabet will ever be the one providing it.Here is Porat's full response:The one thing that has not changed is our view that there is a real need for quality service. As we were looking at our roll-outs going back to 2015, 2016, our view was that we had not done enough — we were appropriately self-critical — to use technology to fundamentally change the implementation approach, whether on the deployment or delivery of service to the homes of users. There wasn't kind of that breakthrough, 10x moment. And as a result of that, we concluded that we would pause the pace of rollout. We're still implementing and executing in the cities that we announced, but we've slowed the pace of rollout so that we could spend time on how do we really bring technology to bear in a more meaningful way? And it's really specifically focused on deployment and delivery. When you ask about milestones, in our view, when we have something that is substantive enough of value to justify accelerating the roll-out again, that's how we're looking at it. We're delighted to have brought in a new CEO, Dinni Jain, who has a really strong history in the industry, so we are continuing to forge ahead.More From CNBC Apple is launching medical clinics for its employeesAlphabet details how Larry Page and Sundar Pichai split dutiesSalesforce field service lightning is fastest growing product in company historyReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

REUTERS/Mike Blake/File PhotoMoreBy Paresh Dave and Arjun PanchadarSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google owner Alphabet Inc reported first-quarter sales and profit Monday that topped financial analysts' estimates due to strong ad sales and a change in accounting for investments in startups, sending its shares up about 1 percent after hours.The results eased concerns that investment in new ventures beyond its core search business was undermining Alphabet's outlook. There also were no immediate signs that rising global privacy concerns would affect profits."The strong economy has companies spending more on advertising and we have an ongoing migration from traditional types of media advertising to greater online and social media-based advertising," said analyst Ivan Feinseth from Tigress Financial Partners. "Google continues to dominate both mobile and desktop search," he added.Worldwide sales increased to $31.1 billion, above the average analysts' estimate of $30.3 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Still, operating income margins dropped to 22 percent from 27 percent a year ago.Alphabet's profit margins have fallen in recent quarters as it ramps up costly new projects in cloud computing and hardware at its core Google unit, and despite spending cuts on an unprofitable set of ancillary initiatives known as "other bets."Overall, quarterly profit of $9.4 billion, or $13.33 per share, exceeded estimates of $6.56 billion, or $9.28 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. About $3.40 of the earnings per share were attributable to a new accounting method for unrealized gains in Alphabet's investments in startups such as Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL].Excluding the investment-related gains and other items, adjusted earnings were $9.93 per share, topping the $9.28 per share consensus. Alphabet's effective tax rate dropped to 11 percent from 20 percent a year earlier.Revenue from ads sold by Google rose as advertisers pursued slots on its search engine, YouTube video service and millions of partner apps and websites.Investor appetite for Alphabet has been weakened by a combination of cost and regulatory concerns as officials across the world seek to force changes in Google's business practices, such as giving customers more control over privacy of their data. Shares had fallen nearly 3.5 percent this year until a swift pre-earnings rebound last week.U.S. lawmakers initially sought to question Google alongside rival Facebook Inc at a hearing this month on how British data analysis firm Cambridge Analytica was able to acquire data on unwitting Facebook users.Google was later excused. But analysts who follow the company have said Google may not escape European Union regulators, which plan to begin enforcing a new data privacy law next month. It could prompt more users to reject receiving personalized ads online, costing Google a few billion dollars in annual sales, said Brian Wieser, a senior analyst at Pivotal Research.Advertisers also may limit ad-buying this year while sorting out their own compliance with the new European policy, known as General Data Protection Regulation, he said.Still, any pullback would be temporary because of the effectiveness of Internet advertising compared with declining media such as print and broadcast, analysts say. Alphabet's first-quarter results again showed that advertisers' attraction to Google's powerful systems in particular is strong, which could help it rebound from any privacy setbacks.Google also revealed smart thermostat maker Nest generated about $726 million in revenue in 2017. Financial results for the Alphabet division had not been released since its acquisition in 2014, but they were provided to investors Monday as it integrates into the Google unit.UBS analyst Eric Sheridan estimated last week that Nest would contribute $490 million in revenue this year to Google.Revenue from Google's mobile app store and growth priorities such as cloud computing services and consumer devices was $4.4 billion in the first quarter.The operating income margin fall reflected the acquisition of 2,000 employees in Taiwan for $1.1 billion from HTC Corp.Google also saw cost increases from moving up when it awards equity to employees and acquiring streaming rights for its YouTube TV offering.Executives have said some costs will moderate this year.Alphabet’s non-operating income jumped in the first quarter compared with a year ago because of new accounting rules that require it to record estimates of the value of its investments in startups such as Uber and Airbnb Inc.

But “Android O”—which should get a dessert-based moniker when it ships later this summer—does have a set of features that Google (GOOG, GOOGL) pitched over the first day of its I/O developer conference here.As in earlier updates, Android O brings a grab-bag of features. Some address lingering pain points in this mobile operating system, while others borrow from features Apple (AAPL) added to iOS. Another represents an overdue remedy for a problem that’s afflicted Android since its debut almost nine years ago: the zombie-like persistence of obsolete versions. And of course, there’s better emoji support.Project Treble: easing updates, we can only hopeThe most important part of O—a rebuilding of Android’s foundation to remove an obstacle to timely software updates—barely got a mention in the almost-two-hour keynote from Google CEO Sundar Pichai and other Googlers that opened I/O at the Shoreline Amphitheatre Wednesday.But there’s no missing the reason for its existence in the embarrassing pie chart on Google’s Android-development site showing the versions of Android in use. As of May 2, the current Nougat release that debuted last August runs on 7.1% of all devices that had connected to the Play Store in the prior seven days. The most widely used Android release was the two-year-old Marshmallow, on 31.2% of devices. At Apple, meanwhile, 79% of iOS devices that visited the App Store on Feb. 20 ran the current iOS 10 release.Project Treble, announced in a blog post last week, aims to free chipset vendors from having to tweak the code that keeps their circuitry talking to the rest of Android. Treble will add a layer of translation code between that proprietary software and the rest of Android—the equivalent of putting a standard-size joint atop some intricate plumbing in the basement. A hardware vendor can write Treble-compliant, circuit-specific code once for a device and know that future versions of Android will understand it without further rewrites.That won’t end all Android-update holdups. As this post from Ron Amadeo at Ars Technica explains, Treble won’t stop phone vendors from shipping weird Android interfaces (hello, Samsung!) that demand their own revisions. But it’s an important step in an operating system that now runs on more than 2 billion active devices.Security and privacyThe afterlife of abandoned versions of Android remains the biggest problem in Android security, but many users worry instead that they’ll pick up malware in the Play Store. In reality, that’s a vanishingly small risk compared to the odds of getting hacked after downloading an app from elsewhere, thanks to a variety of malware scans that happen in the background.Android O will add more layers of security hardening but will also make these app-safety checks visible in a Google Play Protect feature showing their status. It’s literally security theatre. As Stephanie Saad Cuthbertson, product-management director for Android, said in the keynote, “Most Android users don’t know these services come built into Android devices with Play.” But if it gets people to trust the Play Store over less-secure sources, it’ll be a worthwhile production.This update will guard against a different device threat—a runaway app killing your battery life—by imposing limits on how often apps running in the background can ask for a device’s location or make other requests of the system. If that sounds like an overdue move… it probably is.In the area of privacy, Android O will randomly assign different device IDs to apps—a small but significant change that will make it harder for a developer of multiple apps to correlate your use among them. Notifications, picture-in-picture and other interface tweaksStory continuesAndroid O will require apps to group their notifications—the little nags that pop down from the top of the screen—into “channels” that you can turn on or off. It’s meant to stop apps from being too needy; in practice, having yet another option to set may not yield much difference. You’ll also be able to snooze notifications, which may help avoid losing sight of yet another message from a friend coming in on yet another messaging app. These changes should certainly help Android’s notifications experience stay ahead of the same in iOS, where you can’t even clear all notifications unless you use a device with Apple’s Touch ID pressure-sensitive control.App icons will be able to show a different sort of notice: colored “notification dots” at the top right corner of each that indicate something’s changed. That seems a pretty clear case of Google following Apple’s lead, not that there’s anything wrong with that.A picture-in-picture option will pick up on the examples of some Android vendors by letting you watch a video clip or chat in one corner while taking notes or checking your calendar.The interface change I’m most likely to appreciate: “Smart Text Selection,” in which Android will automatically select all of a street address, phone number or other significant block of text once you start trying to pick it up. This won’t work out of the box (as I saw in a demo phone), because Android will use “on-device intelligence” to build a phone-specific model of the kinds of data you often copy and paste. By not syncing this personal data to the cloud—as Cuthbertson boasted, “without any data leaving the device”—Google borrows yet again from its neighbors at Apple. The interface tweak everybody may notice first? A new “EmojiCompat” feature that should end the stigma of an iOS user sending a new emoji that doesn’t appear correctly on Android. Goodbye, blank boxes; hello, taco and unicorn emoji.More from Rob:How a wider laptop ban could threaten your safety and dataHow Gogo will transform your Wi-Fi experience in the skyThese are the tech industry’s 2 biggest concerns about TrumpWhy Hulu with Live TV and other streaming TV services are worth the moneyHow to get 4 billion unconnected people onlineTrump’s FCC chair issues attack on open internet rules  Email  Rob  at rob@robpegoraro.com; follow him on Twitter at  @robpegoraro . ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextFoxconn says it remains committed to Wisconsin investment projectReutersAt $1 Trillion, Apple is Bigger Than These ThingsInvestopediaWhat to Expect When Alphabet Reports Later This MonthMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolThe Boeing 737 MAX Is 1 Step Closer to Flying Again -- but Don't Expect to See It SoonMotley Fool8 Happy Easter Images to Post on Facebook, Twitter and InstagramInvestorPlaceTesla's board is about to get a lot smallerTechCrunchBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

Morgan Knutson, who worked at Google for eight months before resigning in May 2012, described a lack of vision for the service and wasted resources while detailing ways Vic Gundotra, the overall leader of Google+, wielded his massive power within the company.Knutson's narrative, written like a Twitter serial, sheds light on the troubled Google+, one of the company's most noteworthy and expensive failures.If you're interested in technology, then one of the most fascinating longer reads available about Silicon Valley culture is the Twitter serial posted last week by Morgan Knutson, a former Google+ web designer.Knutson wrote 149 tweets over a period of five days about his brief tenure at Google+, the long-troubled, now-defunct social network.Knutson began writing a day after The Wall Street Journal revealed that Google had not disclosed for seven months that a security lapse had enabled third-party developers to see private information belonging to as many as 500,000 Google+ users.A few hours after the story was published, Google announced it had shuttered Google+, which was created to challenge Facebook but never came close.Video: Google Shuts Down Google+ For ConsumersFor more news videos visit Yahoo View.   Apparently, the situation prompted Knutson to reveal information he had bottled up for six years.Now that Google+ has been shuttered, I should air my dirty laundry on how awful the project and exec team was.I'm still pissed about the bait and switch they pulled by telling me I'd be working on Chrome, then putting me on this god forsaken piece of shit on day one. Part of what makes Knutson's tweets so fascinating is the idea that a former Googler has anything bad to say about the company. Google has a reputation for being one of the most employee-friendly places in tech, chock full of perks and benefits. It's rare that a former staffer complains publicly.The other reason Knutson's story is so compelling is due to the titillating details about the dysfunction he said reigned at the Google+ of 2012.Knutson, who resigned for a job at Dropbox in 2012 after only eight months at Google, describes a service that lacked an overall vision, often wasted resources, and was propelled and shielded internally by Vic Gundotra, the powerful former Google executive who led the Google+ effort.He also said, contrary to his prior beliefs or the image that Google sells, that not all employees were at the top of their field.Thought this was the pros. Never would’ve imagined that I was joining a team of 50+ designers where a bunch of them had never designed before. And I was “evaluated” at *about* their level? These weren’t interns, these were designers in their very first roles ever...at Google. It's important to remember, as Knutson acknowledges, that he was one employee working on one project during a brief period.To say Knutson sounds disgruntled is an understatement. To his credit, he acknowledges that he chaffed at receiving criticism and disliked it when he believed he didn't get enough credit.He also had good things to say about some of his managers and about most of the people he came in contact with at Google.The common thread between 99.8% of the people that I interacted with at Google is that they were ethical, highly intelligent, and hard working. I had a lot of admiration and respect for many of them and wish more of them had stayed in touch.

Critics have dubbed this as an effective "link tax," but proponents say hyperlinks will be exempt.Meanwhile, Article 13 calls for "effective content recognition" technology to filter out copyright-protected content. Detractors hold that this part of the law could threaten social media users' ability to share anything from internet memes to snippets of music and film.Reacting to the result of the vote, Julia Reda, a German Pirate Party lawmaker, said it was "catastrophic" that the parliament voted in favor of the most controversial pieces of the legislation."Final vote for Parliament position on the copyright directive with #UploadFilters and #LinkTax adopted," she wrote in a tweet. "Parliament has failed to listen to citizens' and experts' concerns."TweetOpponents of the directive have been using the hashtag #SaveYourInternet on social media."The legislation is now better balanced, answering many of the concerns of journalists, publishers and musicians whose work was being shared freely online without stifling innovation or fundamentally changing the nature of the internet," Sajjad Karim, a British Conservative lawmaker, said in a statement following the vote."It also takes into account the rights of users, ensuring that materials used for teaching and research, and by cultural and heritage organizations, are not encumbered by unnecessary restrictions."What's next?Wednesday's vote won't be the last you've heard about the EU's copyright reforms.Lawmakers had initially voted to delay the vote, rejecting the version of the directive that had been agreed by a committee at that time.Now that politicians in Strasbourg have come to an agreement, the next stage for the law will be what's known as "trilogue," which consists of talks between European Parliament, EU executive body the European Commission, and a collective of the leaders of EU member states known as the European Council.And even once the directive goes through this process, it will still require each individual EU nation to decide on how they will implement the new rules.The EU copyright battle pits media companies and musicians against tech giants over the widespread availability of their content online. Supporters of the law argue that people and companies in the creative industries are being starved of revenues lost to the sharing of their intellectual property on digital platforms.It could particularly impact platforms like Facebook FB and Google's GOOGL YouTube, which rely on user-generated content. Google has been accused of lobbying aggressively to prevent the directive from being passed into law.The issue has drawn attention from notable figures in both the tech and media worlds, including internet pioneer Tim Berners-Lee, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, former Beatles star Paul McCartney and French DJ David Guetta .More From CNBC AT&T CEO calls Netflix the 'Walmart' of video streamingSnap shares tumble after BTIG's Greenfield cuts target to $5Apple will probably lower iPhone prices on Wednesday — here's whyReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextGold Faces A New Trade Conflict, Banks Accumulate The MetalFX EmpirePound Looks Placid in Brexit Break Before Parliament Meets AgainBloombergWhy Livestreaming TV Can't Break ThroughMotley FoolPanel to review approval of Boeing 737 Max flight controlsAssociated PressIntroducing Électricite de Strasbourg Société Anonyme (EPA:ELEC), The Stock That Dropped 18% In The Last YearSimply Wall St.Zookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatchWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosNetflix might have more Beyoncé specials planned after 'Homecoming'EngadgetAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance'American Ninja Warrior Junior': Get an exclusive sneak peek at the semi-finals!AOL.comWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley Fool

The new policies are designed to "provide more transparency" in the investigation process, Pichai wrote."We will make arbitration optional for individual sexual harassment and sexual assault claims," Pichai's memo reads. "Google has never required confidentiality in the arbitration process and arbitration still may be the best path for a number of reasons (e.g. personal privacy) but, we recognize that choice should be up to you."Read more:  One of Google's new sexual harassment policies could be the key to changing all of Silicon Valley's bro cultureAlmost 20,000 Google employees participated in a staged walkout earlier this month after details of the company's past sexual misconduct issues came to light. The New York Times reported in an explosive story that Google had provided a top executive accused of sexual misconduct with a $90 million exit package when he left the company, and then Pichai revealed in a memo that 48 employees had been fired in the past two years for sexual harassment.Just hours before Pichai's memo was published Thursday, the Google CEO was quoted in a sit-down interview with the Times acknowledging that the company "clearly got some things wrong."Read Thursday's memo in full below:  Hi everyone, At Google we try hard to build a workplace that supports our employees and empowers them to do their best work. As CEO, I take this responsibility very seriously and I’m committed to making the changes we need to improve. Over the past few weeks Google’s leaders and I have heard your feedback and have been moved by the stories you’ve shared. We recognize that we have not always gotten everything right in the past and we are sincerely sorry for that. It’s clear we need to make some changes. Going forward, we will provide more transparency on how we handle concerns. We’ll give better support and care to the people who raise them. And we will double down on our commitment to be a representative, equitable, and respectful workplace. Today, we’re announcing a comprehensive action plan to make progress. It’s detailed here and I encourage everyone to read it. Here are some of the key changes: We will make arbitration optional for individual sexual harassment and sexual assault claims. Google has never required confidentiality in the arbitration process and arbitration still may be the best path for a number of reasons (e.g. personal privacy) but, we recognize that choice should be up to you. We will provide more granularity around sexual harassment investigations and outcomes at the company as part of our Investigations Report. We’re revamping the way we handle and look into your concerns in three ways: We’re overhauling our reporting channels by bringing them together on one dedicated site and including live support. We will enhance the processes we use to handle concerns—including the ability for Googlers to be accompanied by a support person. And we will offer extra care and resources for Googlers during and after the process. This includes extended counseling and career support. We will update and expand our mandatory sexual harassment training. From now on if you don’t complete your training, you’ll receive a one-rating dock in Perf (editor's note: Perf is our performance review system). We will recommit to our company-wide OKR around diversity, equity and inclusion again in 2019, focused on improving representation—through hiring, progression and retention—and creating a more inclusive culture for everyone. Our Chief Diversity Officer will continue to provide monthly progress updates to me and my leadership team. I hope you’ll take the time to read the full range of actions we’re announcing today. Thank you all for the feedback you’ve shared with us. This is an area where we need to continually make progress and are committed to doing so. We often hear from Googlers that the best part of working here is other Googlers. Even in difficult times, we are encouraged by the commitment of our colleagues to create a better workplace. That’s come through very strongly over the past few weeks. -Sundar NOW WATCH: How to train the last days before a marathonSee Also:People are going wild for a handy new shortcut that will change the way you use Google DocsGoogle revamped its homepage for Election Day to show you where to voteGoogle is working on a fix for an issue causing apps on the Pixel 3 to randomly closeSEE ALSO: Amazon employees are reportedly gearing up to confront CEO Jeff Bezos at an all-staff meeting this week about selling facial recognition software to law enforcementReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWhat to Expect When Alphabet Reports Later This MonthMotley FoolInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Morning After: The Weather Channel got hackedEngadgetAt Coachella, One Group Is Taking On Sexual Assault and Harassment Prevention.

UCLA Law’s James Park tried synthesizing industry events in a recent academic paper to highlight just when an offering might fall within the purview of securities law.In a recent chat over all-things-crypto, he told me much of the regulatory woes spurred by the nascent marketplace arise from “the SEC responding to something that developed quickly and normalized,” while trying “not to be seen as stomping entrepreneurship.” That also raises the question of whether securities laws “quash innovation potential.”Here are a few notable snippets from my 1-1 with Park, edited for length and clarity:Q: Your paper digs into the SEC deeming Ether a security, then changing its status. What’s the ramifications of such a status change on other initial coin offerings?It at least raises the possibility that you could get to the point that you could start out as a security and evolve into something else. To some extent, I think that having a clear path towards that outcome could be sort of a plus for your ICO. If you could proceed in a way if you’re initially a security and you’re selling through private placement, methods where you don’t need registration, you could hopefully build it up to a point where you could distribute tokens more widely.Even with Ether, though, there’s still some questions with centralization. Etherium is actively working to make Ether better. And then the question becomes, well isn’t that centralized management in a sense and thus potentially a security?What thornier issues can arise from bouncing in and out of security status?One is maybe you fall out and back in to status. You could imagine a point where you are decentralized but people aren’t active on your community, so it might get to the point where you decide to become more centralized. The other is to what extent do you have to be functional. I think it has to be, you achieve some sort of use by individuals of your platforms not by the promise of speculative returns but because you’ve got a good idea. I think that’s what will distinguish projects that can evolve out of security status and those that fail.What do you make of the SEC’s pace of enforcement action?The Nov. 16 enforcement actions—if they had not brought those I’d say they weren’t moving fast enough. I think the fact they were working on this, it sort of signals they are treating the ICO registration requirements seriously. But I have two worries about the amount of time. Number one, if you don’t have a presence in enforcing the law, people don’t know what the law is and go forward with ICOs. Secondly, you’re getting more retail investors who are now potentially trading real dollars in these bitcoins when early on it was people who had invested in bitcoin when it was a dollar and are now reinvesting the proceeds. You’re getting someone who’s buying for $4,000 and reinvesting—I think those are the people we’re most worried about.You note that if a handful of working, viable projects ensue, the SEC should relax its regulation. How would they?I think they could expand the amount you could raise without registration through crowdfunding. Now, you could raise about $1 million. Maybe you could modestly raise some of those thresholds so you could more easily get substantial amounts without registering as a security. And so getting more options in reaching the general public, that might balance the need for investor protections with the needs of entrepreneurship. But the burden is really on the tech industry to show these are some projects that are good and work and are worthwhile.➤ Takeaway: Recent regulatory activity suggests a paced approach by the SEC in tackling crypto registration to both protect consumers and at least avoid looking like it’s hindering entrepreneurship.Story continues On the Radar: Three Things to Know➤ Tweet On. Social media, it’s the breeding ground of bad ideas. But apparently not in the opinion of Elon Musk. The embattled mastermind behind Tesla, whose tweets sparked an SEC probe, told “60 Minutes” viewers Sunday that the company’s ensuing settlement with the agency—which WSJ said calls for the company to get a grip on Musk’s handle—has done zilch to curb his social media use. But Musk didn’t stop there. Never one to mince words, he noted: “I want to be clear. I do not respect the SEC.”➤ SCOTUS Rule Curbs Crowd Funds. At least in the case of amicus briefs. As Law.com’s Tony Mauro reports, a “nascent trend” of deploying GoFundMe to collect costs for producing amicus briefs to bring before the Supreme Court may be coming to a halt. A U.S. Alcohol Policy Alliance lawyer withdrew her brief, funded in part by anonymous donors, after hearing form the court clerk’s office that amicus groups need to identify any contributor forking funds for such an effort. The reason? Rule 37.6, a 1997 rule that prevents a case’s parties from purchasing what Mauro writes amount to “a second or supplemental merits brief, disguised as an amicus brief, to get around word limits.” Interestingly, the brief in question isn’t the only on the case fueled by GoFundMe—an organization on the other side of the case has used the site to raise over $26,000.➤ Killing Cambridge Analytica litigation is what Facebook’s attorneys are trying to do in an ensuing MDL they deem “little more than a broadside against Facebook’s business model.” In a November motion to dismiss, Gibson Dunn’s Orin Snyder, repping the social media company, wrote that plaintiffs have been going on a limb to find a “viable cause of action against Facebook,” putting forth a 255 page complaint that includes “a kitchen sink-like lobbing of 50 claims—all in the hopes that something, anything, sticks.” A hearing for the dismissal motion is set for Jan. 23, and plaintiffs attorneys are charging ahead, writing in their opposition that Cambridge Analytica “represents only the tip of the iceberg with respect to Facebook’s willful pursuit of generating revenue at the expense of its users.”  Google CEO Sundar Pichai Congress Calls Google on Its Privacy ProblemSundar Pichai got an earful in a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee Tuesday that touched upon Google’s increasingly controversial practices around data collection, political bias, and the alleged launch of a censored search engine in China.Seem like a highlight of the company’s controversies from the past year? It essentially was, and Congress went a step further, probing Pichai over the company’s attempt to educate users on their privacy policy, which Rep. Martha Roby described as “20 pages long” and changing “multiple times a year.” And likely for a good reason, as Rep Bob Goodlatte put it: “Google is able to collect an amount of information about its users that would even make the NSA blush.”It’s interesting to consider how little consumers understand the data being collected on them. The NY Times recently found that “at least 75 companies receive anonymous, precise location data from apps whose users enable location services to get local news and weather or other information.” What’s more, Google is facing suits for surreptitious data collection practice.Whether Congress is taking a cue and brushing up on data collection 101, however, is a different question (Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King, FWIW, got on Pichai about problems with an iPhone). But, according to Caroline Spiezio, Law.com’s in-house reporter covering Congressional (and EU) hearings over tech companies behind-the scenes practices, the fact that hearings over data collection and use “keep happening” shows “it’s important, even if Congress doesn’t realize why it’s important.”Yet Congress seems to peg Pichai as evasive. When Rep. Ted Poe asked if Google tracked his whereabouts via his phone when he crossed the room, the Google CEO wouldn’t give a yay or nay, the Times reported.“You make $100 million a year,” Poe said. “You should be able to answer that question… I’m shocked you don’t know. I think Google obviously does.”➤ Looking Ahead: It’s tough to say what sort of impact hearings will have on practices by companies like Google, though they do show that people are waking up to how their data is being used, or at least making clear they aren’t happy about it.Thanks for reading!

I think it has to be, you achieve some sort of use by individuals of your platforms not by the promise of speculative returns but because you’ve got a good idea. I think that’s what will distinguish projects that can evolve out of security status and those that fail.What do you make of the SEC’s pace of enforcement action?The Nov. 16 enforcement actions—if they had not brought those I’d say they weren’t moving fast enough. I think the fact they were working on this, it sort of signals they are treating the ICO registration requirements seriously. But I have two worries about the amount of time. Number one, if you don’t have a presence in enforcing the law, people don’t know what the law is and go forward with ICOs. Secondly, you’re getting more retail investors who are now potentially trading real dollars in these bitcoins when early on it was people who had invested in bitcoin when it was a dollar and are now reinvesting the proceeds. You’re getting someone who’s buying for $4,000 and reinvesting—I think those are the people we’re most worried about.You note that if a handful of working, viable projects ensue, the SEC should relax its regulation. How would they?I think they could expand the amount you could raise without registration through crowdfunding. Now, you could raise about $1 million. Maybe you could modestly raise some of those thresholds so you could more easily get substantial amounts without registering as a security. And so getting more options in reaching the general public, that might balance the need for investor protections with the needs of entrepreneurship. But the burden is really on the tech industry to show these are some projects that are good and work and are worthwhile.➤ Takeaway: Recent regulatory activity suggests a paced approach by the SEC in tackling crypto registration to both protect consumers and at least avoid looking like it’s hindering entrepreneurship.Story continues On the Radar: Three Things to Know➤ Tweet On. Social media, it’s the breeding ground of bad ideas. But apparently not in the opinion of Elon Musk. The embattled mastermind behind Tesla, whose tweets sparked an SEC probe, told “60 Minutes” viewers Sunday that the company’s ensuing settlement with the agency—which WSJ said calls for the company to get a grip on Musk’s handle—has done zilch to curb his social media use. But Musk didn’t stop there. Never one to mince words, he noted: “I want to be clear. I do not respect the SEC.”➤ SCOTUS Rule Curbs Crowd Funds. At least in the case of amicus briefs. As Law.com’s Tony Mauro reports, a “nascent trend” of deploying GoFundMe to collect costs for producing amicus briefs to bring before the Supreme Court may be coming to a halt. A U.S. Alcohol Policy Alliance lawyer withdrew her brief, funded in part by anonymous donors, after hearing form the court clerk’s office that amicus groups need to identify any contributor forking funds for such an effort. The reason? Rule 37.6, a 1997 rule that prevents a case’s parties from purchasing what Mauro writes amount to “a second or supplemental merits brief, disguised as an amicus brief, to get around word limits.” Interestingly, the brief in question isn’t the only on the case fueled by GoFundMe—an organization on the other side of the case has used the site to raise over $26,000.➤ Killing Cambridge Analytica litigation is what Facebook’s attorneys are trying to do in an ensuing MDL they deem “little more than a broadside against Facebook’s business model.” In a November motion to dismiss, Gibson Dunn’s Orin Snyder, repping the social media company, wrote that plaintiffs have been going on a limb to find a “viable cause of action against Facebook,” putting forth a 255 page complaint that includes “a kitchen sink-like lobbing of 50 claims—all in the hopes that something, anything, sticks.” A hearing for the dismissal motion is set for Jan. 23, and plaintiffs attorneys are charging ahead, writing in their opposition that Cambridge Analytica “represents only the tip of the iceberg with respect to Facebook’s willful pursuit of generating revenue at the expense of its users.”  Google CEO Sundar Pichai Congress Calls Google on Its Privacy ProblemSundar Pichai got an earful in a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee Tuesday that touched upon Google’s increasingly controversial practices around data collection, political bias, and the alleged launch of a censored search engine in China.Seem like a highlight of the company’s controversies from the past year? It essentially was, and Congress went a step further, probing Pichai over the company’s attempt to educate users on their privacy policy, which Rep. Martha Roby described as “20 pages long” and changing “multiple times a year.” And likely for a good reason, as Rep Bob Goodlatte put it: “Google is able to collect an amount of information about its users that would even make the NSA blush.”It’s interesting to consider how little consumers understand the data being collected on them. The NY Times recently found that “at least 75 companies receive anonymous, precise location data from apps whose users enable location services to get local news and weather or other information.” What’s more, Google is facing suits for surreptitious data collection practice.Whether Congress is taking a cue and brushing up on data collection 101, however, is a different question (Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King, FWIW, got on Pichai about problems with an iPhone). But, according to Caroline Spiezio, Law.com’s in-house reporter covering Congressional (and EU) hearings over tech companies behind-the scenes practices, the fact that hearings over data collection and use “keep happening” shows “it’s important, even if Congress doesn’t realize why it’s important.”Yet Congress seems to peg Pichai as evasive. When Rep. Ted Poe asked if Google tracked his whereabouts via his phone when he crossed the room, the Google CEO wouldn’t give a yay or nay, the Times reported.“You make $100 million a year,” Poe said. “You should be able to answer that question… I’m shocked you don’t know. I think Google obviously does.”➤ Looking Ahead: It’s tough to say what sort of impact hearings will have on practices by companies like Google, though they do show that people are waking up to how their data is being used, or at least making clear they aren’t happy about it.Thanks for reading!

The deal is now complete, setting the stage for a new era in the search engine company's history, and for the technology industry in general.What Google didLast year, Google announced that it would be acquiring HTC's design team for $1.1 billion, and the deal is now complete. It nets Google about 2,000 new employees, including engineers and support staff, who will remain in Taiwan. The team is involved in device research and development and gained fame for producing Google's Pixel line of smartphones.HTC said it will maintain an in-house R&D team and will keep making its own line of smartphones. But the company has been on a downward trend in recent years, with increased competition chopping down its already small global market share into insignificance.

Image source: Google.Why this move mattersGoogle's slice of the smartphone industry appears to be on the rise. Phones using the Android operating system are knocking on the door of 90% total global market share. The company doesn't provide specific numbers for its branded devices and its new Pixel lineup, but management did say it was a contributing factor to growth during its fourth quarter 2017 update.The segment that contains hardware sales, labeled "other revenues," grew 38% to cap 2017. The division also contains Google's cloud computing business and Google Play online store. Though its growth rate is outpacing the rest of the company's, it still represents only 15% of total revenue. That makes its foray into hardware a big potential payoff for investors. So far, so good, as management said "made by Google" device sales doubled during the last holiday shopping season.But why move the Pixel phone team in-house? It seems it's all about greater control. Devices licensed out bearing the Google badge are on the rise, and the company's strategy has been -- and still is -- to push much of that work to hardware developers. The idea behind the Pixel lineup, though, is to offer a higher-end product where the hardware and Google's software are more closely aligned. Think better integration with Google Assistant, Play store, and YouTube.That strategy of keeping the hardware and software package neat and operating together seamlessly has worked wonders for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) over the years. Google's path seems to be putting it on a direct collision course with its other highfalutin rival, and Google intends to win. The new Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL start at $649 and $849, respectively. In contrast, the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X are $699, $799, and $999, respectively.

The company reported record revenue of $112 million, up 54% year over year, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.60, which climbed 15%. That was driven by triple-digit year-over-year growth in a number of the company's channels, including audio, mobile video, and mobile in-app, which all grew more than 100%. Connected TV growth soared, more than doubling sequentially -- on top of the more than 2,000% year-over-year growth it produced just last quarter.Investors got all the financial data they were looking for. But in the conference call to discuss the results with analysts, there was a wealth of additional information about the company's explosive growth and the expanding opportunity. The Trade Desk identified three significant developments that it sees as catalysts for future growth. Read on to see why management is excited about the changing television landscape, the launching of GDPR in the European Union, and consumer privacy changes at Google, a subsidiary of Alphabet.Two hands touching a digital rendering of a globe surrounded by icons representing various consumer advertising mediaMoreImage source: Getty Images.Big media marriagesOne of the biggest opportunities ahead for the company is the result of massive mergers that are happening in the television space. The Trade Desk founder and CEO Jeff Green specifically addressed Disney's acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox, and AT&T's recent coupling with Time Warner, as indicators of the opportunities ahead."The worldwide advertising market is currently at $700 billion and moving toward $1 trillion over the next 10 years," Green said. "The biggest part of that market is television, which ... is nearly $230 billion this year." He pointed to the "generational shift with the global convergence of the Internet and television."He also sees the combination of digitally delivered content from services like Hulu, skinny cable bundles like Sling TV, and direct relationships with providers like Discovery as opening up a wealth of additional opportunities for programmatic advertising.The GDPR phenomenonThe recent and far-reaching new data-privacy regulations that went into effect in the European Union -- known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) -- address the privacy rights and data protections afforded to EU citizens. But the GDPR had an unforeseen consequence for advertisers. When the new rules went into effect in late May, many publishers found they were not in compliance.This provided a big opportunity for The Trade Desk. "Our engineering and partnerships team put in a huge effort working with publishers and their SSPs [supply-side platforms] who, in some cases, were not ready to ensure the technology was in place to secure the required consents." This helped deliver "record spend in all four of our European offices: the U.K., Spain, Germany, and France." Green said this was a result of the trust the company has fostered with its client base.Big changes at GoogleIn addition to the significant runway the company already had, recent changes at Google increased the prospects for The Trade Desk. Green detailed how "Google announced in April that they would stop sharing DoubleClick IDs with clients ... this makes comparative reporting go away, so this is a very big deal."Story continuesGreen said that this was likely related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, and that Google is now reducing the risk that personally identifiable consumer data will be maliciously used. Since The Trade Desk doesn't collect any of this data, there's no chance it could be breached, giving the company a strategic advantage against Google in the programmatic advertising space. The Trade Desk "enables advertisers to compare every destination on their media plan to every other destination objectively."Group of people, shown only from the neck down, using mobile phonesMoreImage source: Getty Images.The big pictureThe common thread running through each of these discussions is the large and growing opportunity in the programmatic advertising realm. Green said, "Let me remind you that programmatic is growing at 21%, while our growth was nearly two and a half times that."He also said that programmatic was at "just over 2% of the entire advertising market ... Programmatic is the fastest-growing segment of advertising, and The Trade Desk is growing faster than anyone in programmatic."That sounds like the investment thesis in a nutshell.

Marcio Jose Sanchez/APMoreApple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) have made billions of dollars by charging developers to sell their apps on the tech giant’s respective app stores. But now some of those app developers and their parent companies are starting to push back against the so-called app-store tax, which is often up to 30% of the amount consumers pay.Epic Games, developer of the overwhelmingly successful “Fortnite”, has cut Google’s Play Store out of the app equation entirely by having Android users download the game to their phones from its own website. More recently, Netflix (NFLX) began testing a way to get around paying Apple a cut of its customer subscription fees by having users sign up for the service outside of the App Store in 33 countries, not including the U.S.The move follows a similar decision by Netflix to move its subscription sign-up process off of Google’s Play Store. Even Spotify (SPOT) has moved the subscription process away from Apple’s Store. However, these measures could backfire on app developers for one reason — Consumers are lazy.“Whenever you add a step, conversion declines,” explained Gene Munster of Loup Ventures, referring to a customer who’s being “converted” to a regular subscriber. “It could be one, or two, or three steps to leave the platform, get redirected and sign up. And that’s the experiment that these companies are doing. You are going to lose some conversion.”Why leave app storesAccording to a study by SensorTower, Apple earned $38.5 billion in revenue through the App Store in 2017, while Google pulled in $20.1 billion. Those would be enormous sums for standalone companies. But for Apple, this is just a portion of its total services revenue, which made up $9.5 billion of the company’s $53.3 billion in total revenue in Q3 2018.For every app purchase made through Apple’s App Store or Google’s Play Store, the companies take a 30% cut, leaving developers with 70% of the revenue from their own apps. For subscription services like Netflix, Apple and Google start off by taking 30% of the purchase for the first year, but cut that back to 15% after 12 months.For a company like Epic Games, which offers “Fortnite” for free but earns money on in-app purchases, each 30% taken by Apple or Google hits its bottom line. Apple makes it difficult for developers to offer their apps outside of the App Store, so Epic had to stay with Apple when it launched “Fortnite” for iOS. But Google’s Android lets users download and install apps from outside of the Play Store, which is why Epic can skirt that company’s storefront.Importantly, for companies like Netflix and, especially, Spotify, Apple and Google have become both distributors and direct competitors for their products. With Apple and Google poised to release even more of their own original content, the tech giants are homing in on Netflix’s business. Spotify has already had to deal with Google’s Play Music on Android phones, and now with Apple Music pre-installed on every iPhone sold the Swedish streaming service has even more competition in its space.So not only do such companies have to pay Apple and Google to host their apps, they also have to compete with them.The problem with leavingTo be clear, Netflix and Spotify aren’t taking their apps off of Apple’s or Google’s app stores. Instead, they are making customers who want to sign up for subscriptions, called conversions, move over to the services’ own websites. But consumers are fickle, and they’re less likely to sign up for a service if you throw more roadblocks in their path.According to Munster, consumers would rather simply sign up for and pay for their subscriptions through Apple and Google’s app stores, because it’s a faster, more seamless process.“My guess is that, they’d be giving up more than they’d be gaining, because of the increased hassle,” Munster said.“Some players, like Netflix, … may be a different animal, where they are so good people are willing to say, ‘That’s fine, I’m okay with jumping over this very low hurdle,’ but most people are lazy,” Munster explained.Apple and Google will be fine either wayWhile Netflix and Spotify could muscle consumers into signing up for their services because they are already so ubiquitous, other app developers and service providers are likely to have a much more difficult time.Story continues“I think the bottom line is that for most companies, it’s not worth giving up the incremental user to give up 15% [of app revenue],” Munster said. “It’s kind of like someone selling on Amazon. Amazon’s average take-rate is 12%, and as a seller you put up with it because you generate a lot of users from it.”Netflix says its move to test moving user subscriptions off the Apple App Store is one of many it does to improve the user experience for consumers, meaning it may never be fully implemented as a permanent solution.That’s not true for the Google Play Store, for which Netflix stopped supporting subscription sign ups back in May. If you already signed up, you’ll still be billed through Google. But if you’re a new user or try to re-subscribe, you’ll be directed offsite. Similarly, Spotify doesn’t allow for new subscribers to sign up through the Apple App Store.Despite that, the moves are unlikely to impact either tech company in such a way that they would eliminate such fees or reduce them by a significant amount. Both Apple and Google previously cut their fees for subscription services from the standard 30% to the current 15% after one year in 2016 and 2017, respectively. But that 30% still stands for one-time purchases.Munster says the chances of Apple and Google being impacted by a handful of app developers moving away from the App Store is low. In fact, he believes that over time, they will move back to the App Stores.“If I’m wrong and there ends up being a sea change where people just get comfortable to redirect to mobile [websites] to sign up … this is going to be a real stinger for Apple’s services growth. If I was going to put a probability on it, I would say a 5% chance, it’s a low probability,” Munster said.More from Dan:Facebook’s latest scandal will leave it unscathedNew technology could upend the video-game marketT-Mobile promises to make customer service less painful with Team of ExpertsGoogle is giving you more storage for your money with Google OneEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@oath.com; follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley. Follow Yahoo Finance on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextFoxconn says it remains committed to Wisconsin investment projectReutersAt $1 Trillion, Apple is Bigger Than These ThingsInvestopediaNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchWhat to Expect When Alphabet Reports Later This MonthMotley FoolNetflix might have more Beyoncé specials planned after 'Homecoming'EngadgetZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHere's What Hedge Funds Think About NIO Inc.

On Monday, hundreds of companies, including others like Microsoft, eBay, and Uber, — alongside a group of mayors and colleges — joined together as part of the "We Are Still In" campaign to reiterate their commitment to the principles of the climate agreement. "In the absence of leadership from Washington, states, cities, colleges and universities and businesses representing a sizeable percentage of the U.S. economy will pursue ambitious climate goals, working together to take forceful action and to ensure that the U.S. remains a global leader in reducing emissions," the campaign said in its press release.The move comes days after President Donald Trump announced on June 1 that the United States is pulling out of the Paris climate agreement, which was signed by 195 nations in December 2015. The Paris agreement was intended to slow climate change by setting limits on carbon emissions and has been widely embraced by the business community. The tech industry in particular has supported the Paris Agreement, and many of the big tech companies are currently transitioning their giant, energy-guzzling data centers to using completely renewable energy.The "We Are Still In" campaign launched with an open letter to to the world, acknowledging that the businesses and communities that signed will continue to work towards climate change. "It is imperative that the world know that in the U.S., the actors that will provide the leadership necessary to meet our Paris commitment are found in city halls, state capitals, colleges and universities, investors and businesses," the campaign wrote. "Together, we will remain actively engaged with the international community as part of the global effort to hold warming to well below 2°C and to accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy that will benefit our security, prosperity, and health."Here's a full list of all the companies that signed: 2 Point Perspective: Architecture2050 Partners, Inc.22 Designs23andMe3rd Rock Data, Inc.475 High Performance Building Supply7th Generation LabsAdidasAdmix, Inc.AdobeAdrian Dominican Sisters, Portfolio Advisory BoardAdventiveAdventureCORPS, Inc.Aegis Renewable EnergyAggie Writing ServicesAlameda Natural GroceryAleva StoresAllianz SEAlnical LLCAlphaGlider LLCAlpine Enterprises Inc.Alter EcoAlter Eco FoodsAmalgamated BankAmavida Coffee and Trading CompanyAmazonAmbata Capital, LLCAmbataliaAmeresco, Inc.American Outdoor Products, Inc.American Reading CompanyAmicus Green Building Center, LLCAmper MusicAmy's KitchenAngstrom Science Inc.Annie's, Inc.AnthemWildAnthesis GroupAnthropocene InstituteAntonelli's Cheese LLCAphra CommunicationsAppalachian Ski Mtn.

apple, google, samsung: who steals the most ideas?

Try insulting someone’s phone.Apparently, a lot of people hang their identities on what phones they carry. An iPhone person might feel personally affronted when a Samsung Galaxy gets a great review, and vice versa.These days, since all smartphones have pretty much the same features, it seems to be searingly important to remember which brand had those features first. Android must be better, because it had a quick-settings panel before Apple did! The iPhone must be better, because it had Find My Phone first! And so on.It seems very important to identify which phone had a feature first.MoreNow then. According to the law, you can’t copyright an idea, only the expression of that idea. Apple found that out the hard way when, in 1988, it filed a lawsuit accusing Microsoft of copying the Mac’s interface (mouse, windows, menus)—and lost. From that day onward, blatantly ripping off other companies’ ideas became part of doing business. Google steals. Samsung steals. Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon steal. And yes, Apple steals.On one hand, why should we care? What’s wrong with bringing great ideas to as many people as possible?On the other hand, I can understand the phone cultists’ pain. Seems like a company should get credit for inventing an idea. Instead, it gets only a few months of exclusivity before its rivals catch up.(The late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs certainly cared about idea theft. “Our lawsuit is saying, ‘Google, you f**king ripped off the iPhone, wholesale ripped us off,'” Jobs told biographer Walter Isaacson. “I’m going to destroy Android, because it’s a stolen product. I’m willing to go to thermonuclear war on this. They are scared to death, because they know they are guilty.”)So I thought: After all these decades of consumers pointing the finger, maybe we should settle this once and for all. Which company is the biggest copycat?What if someone with too much time on his hands were to dive into the hundreds of features that make a phone a phone, and track down which company first introduced each one?Yeah, that’d mean months of tedious effort. But think of the payoff! For the first time ever, we’d know. We’d see which company should hang its head in ripoff shame.You can probably see where this is going. That’s how I spent my spring.The methodologyFirst, I made up a list of every major feature that’s standard on smartphones today. Pinch-to-zoom. Auto-rotating screen. Slow-mo video. Word suggestions above the keyboard. A quick settings panel. Voice assistant. Voice calling. Private browsing. And on and on.Second, I hunted down the first appearance of every feature by poring through old user manuals, Wikipedia, tech reviews, and how-to books. With help from my assistant Jan Carpenter, we eventually filled in a spreadsheet, which you can see here.I turned the data over to David Foster, infographics lead for Oath Studios, who designed the timelines you see below. Each one shows clearly not just which company wins each horse race, but how long it took its rivals to copy each feature. The timeline bars also provide a fascinating look at how smartphones have evolved since the iPhone’s debut in 2007.Now, a few notes on this project’s limitations:I’ve restricted the game to three players: Apple, Samsung, and Google. Some features may have appeared first in phones by smaller companies, but most of the “you stole that!” accusations involve the Big Three. Especially when it comes to software features (Apple’s iOS vs. Google’s Android) and hardware features (Apple’s iPhone vs. Samsung’s Galaxy S series).Not all features get stolen. Nobody ever copied Apple’s Force Touch screen idea (detects how hard you’re pressing) or its Emergency SOS siren (to use when you’re being mugged). Similarly, to this day, only Android offers desktop widgets and multiple user accounts on the phone. And Samsung, through the years, has introduced dozens of features that nobody chose to imitate (built-in heart-rate sensor, auto-scrolling based on your head tilt). This story is about features that have become universal, so those features don’t appear here.Also not included: Features that existed before the smartphone era, like downloadable ringtones. They weren’t Apple’s, Samsung’s, or Google’s ideas in the first place.Even with all of this research and documentation, I’m sure there will be much to argue about. Does Samsung’s easily fooled face recognition get credit for being first, when Apple’s later implementation, which uses depth cameras that can’t be fooled by a photo, is far better? Should a company get credit for being the leader, when the feature it introduced seems obvious and inevitable (say, an on-screen keyboard)? Should a feature be listed if two companies introduced it more or less simultaneously?Story continuesIn all three cases, I’ve answered “yes” as I built this study. As long as it’s an even playing field—the same rules apply to all three companies—the sheer number of examples should average out any cases where one company gets the benefit of the doubt.All right, ready for the results? Scroll on.OS FeaturesApple invented the touchscreen phone as we know it. The original 2007 iPhone brought us multitouch (pinch to zoom), an on-screen keyboard, auto-rotate, lists that scroll as though with momentum, and the apps-on-a-Home-page design that we all use to this day.Not surprisingly, then, Apple wins this category, having introduced 13 ideas, compared to Android’s 10 (and Samsung’s 1).ScreenThe screen is the first thing you notice when you turn on a phone—how big, bright, and gorgeous it is.Samsung has spent years pushing the size envelope: Its screens were the first to reach 4 inches, then 5 inches, then 6 inches diagonal. Steve Jobs always favored tiny phones, but eventually, Apple had to admit that the public wanted bigger screens, even if it meant bigger phones. Samsung has led the way with OLED screens, too—Apple finally adopted this stunning screen technology in the iPhone X.Even so, Apple barely wins this category, 6 to 4.Text & VoiceSmartphones don’t have physical keyboards. So how can you quickly and accurately enter text?Over the years, Apple and Google have introduced one new feature after another to address this problem. That includes Apple’s introduction of Siri (even though Apple didn’t create Siri in-house), and Google’s introduction of a hands-free, voice-triggered assistant (“OK Google—what’s the weather?”).Google wins this one: Android 6, Apple 5.CameraWhy do we even call these things “phones?” Making calls is the last thing many people use them for. The first, of course, is taking photos and videos.Believe it or not, the first smartphones didn’t have a flash, didn’t have a front-facing camera, and couldn’t even record video. How did we live?This time, the innovation rate is nearly tied: Apple 6, Android 6, and Samsung 5.PhoneNo surprise that the rate of new ideas in phone calling has slowed down recently; for many of us, texting and even video calling are our comms of choice.The calling/texting score: a tie. Android 3, Apple 3.Hardware FeaturesThe first smartphones didn’t have stereo speakers, GPS chips, and wireless charging, and weren’t water resistant; all of that came later. Kudos to Samsung for figuring out how to waterproof its phones without losing the headphone jack.The score: Apple 2, Android 2, Samsung 1.InternetThese days, the internet is the whole point, isn’t it? We expect our phones to show us websites and emails exactly as they’d appear on our laptops and desktops, full of formatting, photos, and videos. All of the features listed here are standard on smartphones—but somebody originally dreamed each of them up.The winner: Apple, with 4 inventions. Android had 3. Security“Security” means protection for both the physical phone—when you leave it somewhere, or when it gets stolen—and for its contents. (Activation lock—the iOS feature that makes it impossible to erase a stolen phone without the owner’s Apple ID credentials—was single-handedly responsible for plummeting iPhone thefts around the world. Why bother stealing a phone if you can’t erase it and resell it?)The tally here: Apple brought forth three out of four of these breakthroughs. WirelessLittle by little, cables and cords are going away. Look at the list of things that once required cables and can now happen wirelessly: sending video playback from the phone to the TV, listening to headphones, printing, sending files to other phones and computers, paying at a cashier terminal, and, lately, even charging.Android and iOS tie for the greatest number of cable eliminations, with 3 apiece.The ResultsWhen the dust settles, who’s the winner? Who innovates the most phone ideas, and who steals the most?Apple leads the invention category, with 44 innovations, according to our calculations. Google’s Android comes in second, with 31. And Samsung brings up the rear with 12 innovations.Now, if you count the number of times each company is listed as a Follower in the spreadsheet, you discover that Apple also seems to have stolen the most ideas. In part, that’s because I’m pitting Apple against Google/Samsung (its phones use Google’s software). As a result, no feature ever lists Google and Samsung as innovator+follower, or vice versa; they’re always a single team.This setup gives Apple an advantage, because it has two companies to steal from—but also a disadvantage, since it’s two-on-one.Of course, in the end, none of this tabulation really matters. The real conclusion of this massive research exercise is this: whoever makes your favorite phone steals ideas. They all do—always have, always will. It’s how the business runs.I still hope that, each time some engineering team swipes a great idea from a competitor, they feel a hot little spike of shame. “Well, hey, they do it!” is not a satisfying reason for copying someone else’s idea. And Keeping Up with the Joneses is not the recipe for creating an original, differentiated phone that reflects your company’s philosophy and values.If you’re among those who grow indignant when the phone you despise shows up with a feature copied from the one you love, maybe it’s time to accept the marketplace reality that everybody rips off ideas.If nothing else, you’ll have a lot more time to debate politics and religion.David Pogue, tech columnist for Yahoo Finance, welcomes comments below.

Apple had ranked No. 2 as recently as 2016, according to the annual Harris Poll Reputation Quotient poll released on Tuesday.The poll, conducted since 1999, surveyed 25,800 U.S. adults from Dec. 11 to Jan. 12 on the reputations the "most visible" corporate brands.John Gerzema, CEO of the Harris Poll, told Reuters in an interview that the likely reason Apple and Google fell was that they have not introduced as many attention-grabbing products as they did in past years, such as when Google rolled out free offerings like its Google Docs word processor or Google Maps and Apple's then-CEO Steve Jobs introduced the iPod, iPhone and iPad."Google and Apple, at this moment, are sort of in valleys," Gerzema said. "We're not quite to self-driving cars yet. We're not yet seeing all the things in artificial intelligence they're going to do."Meanwhile, Amazon.com held on to the No. 1 spot, which it has held for five years with the exception of 2015, when it slipped to No. 2. Gerzema attributed Amazon's ranking to its expanding footprint in consumers' lives into areas like groceries via its Whole Foods acquisition.Elon Musk's Tesla climbed from No. 9 to No. 3 on the strength of sending Tesla Roadster into space aboard a SpaceX rocket - despite fleeting success delivering cars on time on earth, Gerzema said."He's a modern-day carnival barker - it's incredible," Gerzema said of Musk. "This 'The Right Stuff' attitude is able to capture the public's imagination when every news headline is incredibly negative. They're filling a void of optimism."For its part, Facebook Inc's (FB.O) reputation improved in the 2018 study, despite being the target of questions from U.S. lawmakers about the role of social media in Russia's efforts to influence the U.S. presidential election in 2016. Facebook ranked 51st, its best showing since 2014 when it ranked 38th, the highest the firm ever ranked in the poll.This year, film production company The Weinstein Co made its debut at 99th out of 100 on the list after more than 70 women accused co-founder Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct, including rape. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.Last place went to Japanese auto parts supplier Takata Corp (TKTDQ.PK), whose air bags can explode with too much force and have been linked to at least 22 deaths and hundreds of injuries, prompting the largest recall in automotive history and forcing Takata and its U.S. unit, TK Holdings Inc, into bankruptcy.1.

The speaker went on sale on Feb. 9.A number of other reviewers have praised the HomePods's sound quality compared with similar speakers like the Echo and the Google Home. Fortune's Don Reisinger noted in his review that the HomePod's sound was better than the Echo and Home, but he conceded that the "sound quality isn't something that can justify its lofty price tag."In announcing the HomePod in June, Apple highlighted its sound quality in its sales pitch. It was a different sales strategy than Apple’s rivals, which instead promoted how well their respective speakers work with voice-activated digital assistants like Amazon's Alexa. People use these digital assistants for things like changing the volume and to play specific songs.Now that the HomePod is finally for sale, newer versions of smart speakers sold by Google and Sonos are also offering better sound quality compared to older models, noted Consumer Reports. That puts increased pressure on Apple and its claim about the superiority of its HomePod’s sound.The Google Home Max, which costs $400, and the Sonos One, which costs $200, manages to slightly exceed the HomePod's sound quality, according to Consumer Reports."Overall the sound of the HomePod was a bit muddy compared with what the Sonos One and Google Home Max delivered," the review said. The review also noted that while the HomePod would "serve many music fans well," there were some "flaws" like the way it projects bass sounds, which were "a bit boomy and overemphasized."Last week, Sonos co-founder and former CEO John MacFarlane briefly reviewed the HomePod via Twitter, by praising the speaker and saying it "handily beats a Sonos One." However, he said two Sonos One speakers provide better sound than one Apple HomePod (of course, he’s hardly objective). Got my HomePod. First impressions…Good packaging, easy setup.Great sound. No clipping at volume.A little heavy on the bass (Jimmy Iovine effect). Handily beats a single Sonos One, at full, acoustically. Two Sonos Ones, in pair, do a superior job.

CEO Tim Cook announced the device as the day’s “one last thing.”“We think we can do a lot,” Cook said, “to make the experience [of listening to music in your home] much better.”The speaker is 7 inches tall, covered in “acoustic” mesh, with a 4-inch woofer. Along the bottom: 6 microphones and a beam-forming tweeter. It runs $349, which is far more expensive than competing products.The Apple Homepod. Photo: AppleMoreLike Amazon’s (AMZN) $179 Echo, Apple’s HomePod is not just for music. It can tell you the weather, read you news and sports scores, and perform many other tasks, all beginning with the command, “Hey Siri.”Three years after Amazon launched the Echo and six months after Google (GOOG, GOOGL) launched its $109 Home, this is Apple’s first entry to the category. And like those products, the speaker is a gateway to other Apple products, and a showcase for Apple’s voice assistant, Siri. Amazon Echo is powered by Alexa, while Google Home is powered by Google Assistant. (Last month, Microsoft announced the Invoke, a smart speaker powered by its Cortana voice assistant, set to go on sale in the fall.) Of course, you could also count the Sonos, the Beats Pill, and the Jawbone Jambox as home speakers that will have to compete with Apple HomePod now.Google Home (L) vs. Amazon EchoMoreYou might wonder why it took Apple this long to launch a home speaker. Apple senior vice president Phil Schiller answered that very question. He reasoned that there are great speakers already out there, but they aren’t “smart,” and there are smart speakers, but they don’t always deliver great quality.In addition to its own new speaker, Apple revealed that its new iOS 11 can control all the speakers in your home from your iPhone, including any Airplay-compatible third-party speakers.Announcing the Siri speaker was just one of many Siri-related upgrades that came out of this year’s WWDC. Apple opened the event by showing off new “Siri faces” for the Apple Watch Series 2 that use the voice assistant to provide quick information on the go.Later in the event, Apple ran through upgrades to Siri, including an updated voice (female and male), ability to translate from other languages, and syncing Siri’s learning about you across all your devices.So, which smart home speaker should you buy—Amazon’s, Google’s, or Apple’s?

SAN FRANCISCO, California (Reuters) -- Google Inc., which dominates the market for Web search, is developing a service that could dramatically extend the reach of its lucrative keyword-based advertising by linking such ads to e-mail, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.


Privately held Google, which is expected to go public later this year, faces rising competition in its core search business from e-mail providers including Yahoo Inc. and MSN, Microsoft Corp.'s Internet unit.


Adding an e-mail service would provide a potential boost to Google as its technology lead in the search market seems destined to narrow and it prepares to answer to growth-hungry shareholders, analysts said.


The Mountain View, California, company, which has recently made several e-mail related acquisitions, is working on a way to serve advertising to an e-mail at the moment it is opened, people close to the company said.


"I'm sure Google is getting more and more concerned about locking in users. It wouldn't surprise me if they did something very sophisticated with e-mail," said Danny Sullivan, editor of SearchEngineWatch.com, who tracks the industry.


By moving into e-mail -- the Web's most-used program -- Google would open up a huge new market for its lucrative "sponsored links" advertising business that delivers ads tied to keywords in Web searches or on content pages, analysts said.


Offering its own branded e-mail -- whether for free or with enhanced services like spam filtering -- would also enable Google to tie users more closely to its search site and to steal customers from rivals, they said.


In an e-mail response to questions from Reuters, spokesman David Krane said, "Google has a number of projects in the works to test monetization in various scenarios.


"In fact, Google's AdSense contextual ads are already used in a number of e-mail newsletters," he said.

Going portal?

Google has for years said it would not turn its site into a full-service Internet portal like Yahoo or MSN. However, since it opened in 1998, Google has added portal-style discussion groups and is testing a comparison shopping site called Froogle, as well as a news site.


Google late last year purchased rival Sprinks, which had technology to deliver ads to e-mail as the messages were opened. Such real-time ad serving is important because it keeps ads fresh and insures that Google will not be giving away free ads or delivering ads nobody will see, industry participants said.


Kanoodle, a small privately held search company, in the coming weeks will roll out its own e-mail advertising product as part of its deal with CBS MarketWatch.com, said Lance Podell, Kanoodle's president of search and content.


Under that deal, "sponsored link" ads will be served to MarketWatch's opt-in subscriber e-mails, including newsletters.

Experience with sponsored links

Google already knows how to deliver its sponsored link ads -- which are in the form of Web links and appear on the perimeter of Web pages -- to e-mail newsletters and content sites.


Furthermore, Google last year purchased an e-mail management software maker and in 2001 registered the domain name googlemail.com.


Some in Silicon Valley also believe Google could be preparing to launch free e-mail to compete with offerings from Yahoo and MSN's Hotmail.


"If they were to go the e-mail route they'd have to provide an offering that competes with free [e-mail]. Anti-spam is one form of strong differentiation," said Jim Pitkow, chief executive of Moreover Technologies, whose personalized search company Outride was acquired by Google in 2001.

  Google Earth maps out Darfur atrocities





 Story Highlights• Google Earth highlights atrocities in Darfur region of Sudan • Google official: Tool can be "catalyst for education and action" • Google Earth has 200 million users • Official: Technology will make it harder to ignore genocide By  Elise Labott CNN  Adjust font size:

 WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- If you Google the word Darfur, you will find about 13 million references to the atrocities in the western Darfur region of Sudan -- what the United States has said is this century's first genocide.As of today, when the 200 million users of Google Earth log onto the site, they will be able to view the horrific details of what's happening in Darfur for themselves.In an effort to bring more attention to the ongoing crisis in Darfur, the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum has teamed up with Google's mapping service literally to map out the carnage in the Darfur region.Experts estimate that 200,000 people have been killed and 2.5 million more have been displaced since the conflict flared in 2003, when rebels took up arms against the central Sudanese government.The new initiative, called "Crisis in Darfur," enables Google Earth users to visualize the details in the region, including the destruction of villages and the location of displaced persons in refugee camps. (Interactive: See how the new technology works)Elliot Schrage, Google's vice president of global communications and public affairs, joined museum director Sara J. Bloomfield to make the official announcement about the new feature. "At Google, we believe technology can be a catalyst for education and action,"  Schrage said. " 'Crisis in Darfur' will enable Google Earth users to visualize and learn about the destruction in Darfur as never before and join the museum's efforts in responding to this continuing international catastrophe."The Google Earth mapping service combines 3-D satellite imagery, aerial and ground-level maps and the power of Google, one of the Internet's most widely used search engines, to make the world's geographic information user friendly. Since its inception in June 2005, nearly 200 million people have downloaded the free program.Using the high-resolution imagery of Google Earth, users will be able to zoom into the Darfur region for a better understanding of the scope of the destruction. (Interactive: See where Darfur is located)More than 1,600 damaged and destroyed villages will be visible, as will the remnants of more than 100,000 homes, schools, mosques and other structures destroyed by the Janjaweed militia and Sudanese forces.The Holocaust museum also has compiled a collection of photos, data and eyewitness testimony from its archives and number of sources, including the U.S. State Department, nongovernmental organizations, the United Nations and individual photographers. That material also will be available when Google Earth users visit the Darfur site.The "Crisis in Darfur" initiative is the first of what is expected to be several collaborations between the museum and Google Earth to highlight the dangers of genocide around the world. The museum also announced Tuesday the creation of a mapping project with Google Earth on the Holocaust, when Nazis killed 6 million Jews during World War II. That project will use Google Earth to map key Holocaust sites, such as Auschwitz, Dachau, Bergen-Belsen, Treblinka, Warsaw and Lodz with historic content from its collections to illustrate the enormous scope and impact of the Holocaust. Each place links to a featured article with related historical photographs, testimony clips, maps, artifacts and film footage."Educating today's generation about the atrocities of the past and present can be enhanced by technologies such as Google Earth," Bloomfield said. "When it comes to responding to genocide, the world's record is terrible. We hope this important initiative with Google will make it that much harder for the world to ignore those who need us the most."

   Google offers free music downloads in ChinaStory Highlights Google free music in China averaging 1.5 million downloads  Rather than fight piracy, record labels seek slice of online advertising revenues  Google aims to take market share from Chinese search giant Baidu Plans to make more than a million songs freeNext Article in World Business »   Read  VIDEO   By  Emily Chang CNN  



 


 

  BEIJING, China (CNN) -- If you can't beat 'em, join 'em. 
Google and music companies are giving Chinese Internet users free downloads. 
 That's the idea behind Google's latest move to allow users to download free music in China. Google has partnered with a Chinese company, Top100.cn, to make it happen. About 140 music labels have joined in, including the "Big Four" -- EMI Group, Sony Music Entertainment, Warner Music Group and Universal Music. Most Chinese users get their music for free anyway, thanks to rampant online piracy. Google and its partners hope the new business model will generate revenue from advertising that all will share. More importantly, Google wants to increase traffic and catch up to its competitor Baidu.   "We will provide free, high-quality, legal downloads," Google China President Li Kaifu told CNET News. "Not providing music was a strategic mistake on our part."  Watch how Google intends to curb piracy » Baidu offers a popular search feature, which, despite lawsuits from many labels, enables users to download music through third-party sites. The company commands 62.2 percent of China's market, compared with Google's 27.8 percent, according to research firm Analysys International.

 Will Google's move pay off? Well, users are already streaming songs 1.5 million times per day. So far, Chinese music is topping the list of most popular downloads, including top artists Jolin Tsai and Liang Lin. But Western music isn't far behind. Favorites are "My Life Would Suck Without You" by Kelly Clarkson, the Backstreet Boys hit "I Want It That Way" and Sarah Brightman's rendition of "Scarborough Fair." Brightman, who co-performed the theme song at the opening ceremony of the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, is a longtime favorite among Chinese fans. Google offers about 350,000 free songs, but says more than 1 million will be available soon. The company also provides user-friendly searching and song lyrics, and recommends music based on a listener's preference. Several students at a cafe in Beijing say they have tried the service. "I think it will bring convenience," one girl said. "Baidu has some disadvantages, and sometimes they do not have high-quality music. I think Google will provide a large quantity of high-quality music." It's no surprise that China's gregarious Internet community is having a heated discussion. "I can't find any songs I like on it," one blogger wrote. "It's good quality, but there aren't enough songs," another blogger said. "It's better than buying it, though." Some rushed to Google's defense. "You can't really compare Google with other sites, because all of their music is legitimate," one blogger said. "They pay those music labels for every download. Baidu and others all use pirated music." Will Baidu make the next move? "Actually, Baidu may be threatened now," said Internet analyst Duncan Clark. 





 If the Chinese search site doesn't cooperate with music companies, it could be seen as "basically aiding and abetting pirates," he added. "But if there is a better service offered by Google ... then Google will threaten Baidu and Baidu will have to respond," Clark said.

   Google tries out offline Gmail featureStory Highlights Google is testing a feature that would allow users to access Gmail offline  Users could read, write, and search messages while not connected to the network  Google: offline Gmail is "almost identical" to the experience you get online  Gmail works by downloading a copy of a user's archive to their personal computer Next Article in Technology »   By Stephen Shankland 



 


 

 
 (CNET) -- Significantly increasing the utility and competitiveness of its Web-based e-mail service, Google is enabling an experimental ability to read, write, and search Gmail messages even while not connected to the network. 
Google wants to allow users to access its Gmail service while not connected to the network. 
 Google believes almost religiously in cloud computing, the idea that computer applications and data live on the Internet rather than on PCs. But there are times when the network is inaccessible, and generally Web-based applications like today's Gmail effectively seize up under those circumstances. Offline sidesteps that problem, the classic example being a busy executive traveling on a plane. And offline Gmail access begins a new chapter for Google's ambition to appeal to business customers for services such as Google Apps, of which Gmail is a component. "This is a feature we've heard loud and clear the enterprise wants," said Todd Jackson, Gmail's product manager. Trying to sign up business customers generally means wooing them away from the dominant e-mail products, Microsoft's Exchange server software and Outlook PC software. Google and Microsoft began in separate spheres, but are ever-closer competitive rivals, each with a strong cash-generating business that can be used to subsidize forays into other markets. There's more, too. Google Apps customers will get another major offline option "soon," too: Google Calendar access, though not initially the ability to create new entries. If the organization's administrator enables the "New Features" option, each person within that organization will get access to the calendar, Google said.

 New features help make Gmail more compelling for business customers, but for many, a bigger problem is the fact that Gmail still sports its beta tag, said Gartner analyst David Smith. "That's one of the biggest stumbling blocks for businesses," Smith said. "You're hard-pressed to find any businesses who decide to go into production with anything that a vendor calls beta, no matter how good it is." Google promises customers will get 99.9 percent availability through a service level agreement for Google Apps, which includes Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Docs. Cloud vs. PC  And Microsoft, while not turning on a dime, isn't counting on a future that consists exclusively of PC-based Office. It already has a product, Office Live Workspace that lets users share and view--but not edit--Office documents online, and the next version of Office will run in a browser. Philosophically, though, Microsoft remains firmly tethered to the PC, while Google wants to move as fast as possible to Web-based applications. "We think the browser is the ideal platform for deploying all kinds of applications. That's where Google is placing its bet," Jackson said. "But people are traditionally limited by the speed and connectivity of the Internet. We want to fill in those gaps." Google already developed open-source technology called Gears that helps further this cloud computing agenda by storing Web data on PC, and Gmail, used by millions, could help coax more people to install Gears. That, in turn, could help solve the chicken-and-egg problem that currently means it's not worthwhile for most Web application programmers to build in Gears support. Greater Gears support could help other cloud-computing companies, including Zoho, which already has offline access for its Web-based e-mail application. It's not as if offline Gmail were completely impossible. People can set up software such as Outlook or Thunderbird to read and write e-mails, for example. But offline Gmail means people won't have to learn a new interface. Offline Gmail has been in testing for months, though Jackson wouldn't share specifics about exactly how long. What can offline Gmail do?  "We wanted the user experience to be almost identical to the experience you get when you're online," Jackson said. Offline Gmail stores a copy of a user's inbox on a personal computer. Most people will have to install it, a process Google walks you through, but it's built into Google's Chrome browser. Once Gears is installed and offline access is enabled, the software automatically detects when a person's network connection is working. If the network is good, Gmail works as usual. If it's bad, it goes into offline mode, sending unsent messages and retrieving new ones when the connection is restored. And if the network is dodgy, a person can use the intermediate "flaky connection mode," which for example queues a message to be sent immediately by storing it to the hard drive then actually sends it as soon as it can. Google positions this as useful for coffee shops and poaching a neighbor's weak-signal wireless network, but I think of this as "tech conference mode." When enabled, offline Gmail begins by downloading, in the background, a copy of a user's archive to the user's personal computer. But the software stores about 10,000 e-mails, so heavy users won't get a complete archive. Gmail automatically updates the local cache of messages with new and recently read items and with messages associated with a particular label on which a person has clicked, Jackson said. Imperfect  Not everything works, though. One big missing piece is the ability to add attachments to new messages, though attachments are visible with existing messages. Another is the contacts tab, so forget about managing e-mail lists or adding new addresses while offline. The autocomplete option works, though, so there's no need to start remembering e-mail addresses. English-speaking Gmail users will be able to enable offline access as Google gradually adds the ability over the next "couple" of days, said Gmail engineer Andy Palay in a blog post. "Offline Gmail is still an early experimental feature, so don't be surprised if you run into some kinks that haven't been completely ironed out yet," Palay said. What kinds of problems occur? "We've seen issues with the local cache getting out of sync. You have to refresh the browser, and that gets you going again," Jackson said. "In some rare circumstance, it has to be fully flushed, so we ask to disable and re-enable the feature." But these should be unusual problems, he said: "It's been in testing for awhile on all 20,000 Googlers, so it's gotten some good testing."

   Why the ocean matters . . . to GoogleStory Highlights Imaging the ocean depths via the new Google Earth 5.0 is a smart move for Google  It adds to the overall utility of the software, which in the long run keeps it relevant  Ocean researchers attended Google's launch and are eager to display their data  Eventually, Google wants to provide data on "every single location" on Earth  Next Article in Technology »   By Stephen Shankland 



 


 

 
 SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNET) -- The fact that you now can explore the ocean through Google Earth isn't going to make Google much money directly. But the move is nonetheless smart. 
The new Google Earth 5.0 software allows users to explore the ocean depths from their computers. 
 Google generated early-stage goodwill from being the best answer to the online search problem. But the company is large and getting larger, especially as it shows a better ability to withstand the recession than rivals, and that goodwill won't last forever. Google Earth, though, gives the company a new way to bring its brand to the world, notably with students for whom the software will help supplant atlases and encyclopedias.  And in the long run, as Google Earth and Maps -- either as standalone software or used through a browser -- will likely become a widely used virtual window on the real world. Google will control the technology and commercialization of that portal. Will the visibility of the ocean depths on Google Earth make money directly? Not likely. But it adds incrementally to the overall utility of the software, which in the long run keeps it relevant. "The near-term opportunity is in local search," for example people looking for restaurants or hotels, said John Hanke, director of Google Earth and Maps, in an interview.

 Google has begun experimenting with advertisements on Google Maps and Google Earth, added Peter Birch, product manager of Google Earth, at the launch event.  Since people often need to discover information about a place before going there, Google Earth and Maps could prove a lucrative endeavor. It may take years to get there, and it'll cost Google dearly in server hardware and network bandwidth, but Google has shown patience in subsidizing long-term projects. Though Hanke wouldn't reveal the expense of Google's geographic services, some of the economics are in the company's favor. Just as Google's search engine takes advantage of innumerable information that others put on the Internet, Google Earth is a platform that houses information supplied by outsiders that Google doesn't have to pay. It's the Internet's user-generated content story, but this time it's data that can be overlaid on a map of the Earth. And in the case of the ocean work, there are prestigious users generating high-quality content. Many ocean researchers gathered at the Google Earth 5.0 launch, and several showed there's pent-up demand for a way to conveniently display their data somewhere. And it's not just to share sea surface temperature data with fellow Ph.D.s, but also to try to educate the public. Ken Peterson, communications director for the Monterey Bay Aquarium, was excited about his layer in Google Earth that shows the location of various types of fish -- along with ratings for people about whether they should eat those varieties or substitute others.  Barbara Block of Stanford University and Patrick Halpin of Duke University were eager to show the tracks of shark travels recorded by radio transmission to satellites. Ross Swick of the University of Colorado-Boulder showed a Google Earth animation of the gradually shrinking Arctic ice cap over the last 29 years.  And Philip Renaud of the Living Oceans Foundation has supplied underwater video of the Red Sea as part of the foundation's mission to chronicle the state of coral reefs. Hanke envisions much broader information, though, including consumer-oriented material such as the best dive spots and kite-surfing areas. Ultimately, he wants "every single location" on Earth, land or sea, to have information. "We're trying to encourage our users to annotate all the places in the world. Part of what we're doing is seeding that ecosystem of spatial information," Hanke said.  "That creates an opportunity for Google to provide location services on phones, mobile devices, in cars in the future, to guide people to the best places. Being a valued guide, the go-to source of information about the best places to go -- that will be a powerful and valuable thing for Google." Think of it as a second Internet in a way, only instead of using abstract names to locate information, you can use actual locations to locate information. Some refer to the idea as the "geographic Web." The clearest illustration of the indirect benefits Google Earth can bring is the fact that the company could persuade former Vice President Al Gore, whose climate change documentary won him an Oscar and a Nobel Peace Prize, to bear the Google Earth standard. In effect, he provided an eco-halo that can offset the more down-to-earth capitalistic realities of Google's operation. Google seems to share the altruistic, educational motivations of many researchers. But it's also got business in mind with Google Earth. "We try to create products people love to use," Birch said. "We create value, then think of appropriate ways of monetization."

   Google Latitude keeps tabs on friends' locationsStory Highlights New Google software, Latitude, lets cell phone users share their location with others  Google hopes it will help people find each other and keep track of loved ones  To protect privacy, Google specifically requires people to sign up for the service  People can share their precise location, the city they're in, or nothing at all  Next Article in Technology »   By Stephen Shankland 



 


 

 
 (CNET) -- Just because the Internet has broken down geographic barriers, don't assume that Google doesn't care about geography. 
With Google's new Latitude software, cell phone users can share their locations with others. 
 The company plans to launch software called Latitude on Wednesday that lets mobile phone users share their location with close contacts. Google hopes it will help people find each other while out and about and to keep track of loved ones. "What Google Latitude does is allow you to share that location with friends and family members, and likewise be able to see friends and family members' locations," said Steve Lee, product manager for Google Latitude. For example, a girlfriend could use it to see if her boyfriend has arrived at a restaurant and, if not, how far away he is. To protect privacy, Google specifically requires people to sign up for the service. People can share their precise location, the city they're in, or nothing at all. "What we found in testing is that the most common scenario is a symmetrical arrangement, where both people are sharing with each other," Lee said.

 The software spotlights Google's fixation with mapping and location technology. Location is an important part of navigating the real world, and Google clearly sees its geographic services as a way to establish a more personal connection with customers who today use Google chiefly for the virtual realm of the Internet.  And of course money is involved, too: Google hopes its mapping technology will lead to location-based advertising revenue. Google's power is firmly lodged in search and search advertising, but the company is trying to expand to broader online services, too. That includes online documents and various aspects of social networking, which are much more personal services and ones that put Google into more direct competition with rivals such as Microsoft, Facebook, and Yahoo. Like using Google profiles to contact information with select contacts, using Google Latitude tells Google who's who in your social graph. How it works  Latitude is part of Google Maps for Mobile, the company's mapping software for mobile phones, but also can be used through a gadget loaded onto its iGoogle customized home page. It'll work in 27 countries at launch, Google said. Initially, it will work on most color-screen BlackBerry phones, most phones with Windows Mobile 5.0 or later, and most Symbian-based devices such as Nokia smartphones. An update to the Google Android operating system now being distributed to the T-Mobile G1 phone also enables it, and iPhone and iPod Touch users will get the option "very soon," Lee said. Latitude uses Google's technology to judge a user's location not just by GPS satellite, but also by proximity to mobile phone towers and wireless networks. That's a much more automated approach than the manual "check-in" process used by Dodgeball, a service that Google decided in January to shut down. Other competitors exist, though. BrightKite and Loopt offer mechanisms for people to find each other by mobile phone, for example. Then there's MobiFriends, Tripit, and Dopplr. And Google's clearest competitor, Yahoo, offers some competition with Fire Eagle. That service doesn't provide location information, but it does provide a mechanism to centralize people's geographic privacy choices, in effect taking care of some of the social graph management when it comes to location information. To use the service, you need a Google account to record who has permission to see your location. For choosing who gets to see your location, you can use contacts stored with Gmail or Picasa, Google said. The white lie  With the service, you can hide from specific people or disappear altogether. And you can manually set a specific location if, for example, your phone can't show it with sufficient precision or if you wish to tell someone a white lie about whether you really aren't going to go to the candy store. Google envisions two broad classes of people with whom you might want to share location information. First is a small, close-knit circle of friends and family with whom you're willing to share your exact spot. Second is a larger group with whom you're happy to share city-level detail, convenient for finding out when somebody's in town but not much more. When somebody is close, the software lets you contact the person various ways--by calling or sending an e-mail or text message, for example. It also lets you hide from that specific person. Privacy is of course a significant concern when it comes to sharing this sort of information. If you want to use Latitude, you must specifically enable the service. Meeting your pals at a bar is an obvious example of the software's possibilities, but there are softer cases I see as useful, too.   Lee pointed to a case where a friend's girlfriend, though far away in Seattle, will "virtually place herself next to him." That sounds a little sappy for my tastes, but I can still relate. My wife is on the other side of the country right now, and it would be heart-warming to see just where. iReport.com: Share your thoughts on Google Latitude There are a lot of occasions where technology is better for maintaining relationships than it is for establishing them, and this looks like one to me.

   Google, Universal Music partner on new music video siteStory Highlights YouTube and Universal Music Group are joining to create music-video site Vevo  YouTube will handle the technology while Universal Music supplies the content  The two companies will share ad revenue from the site, to launch later this year  Universal's content and artists will be the only label represented on the site at first Next Article in Technology »   By Greg Sandoval 



 


 

 
 (CNET) -- Universal Music Group and Google are now partners in the music-video business. 
YouTube and Universal Music Group are joining to create Vevo, a new music video site set to launch later this year. 
 The largest of the four top recording companies and YouTube's parent company announced on Thursday that they are working together on Vevo, a new music and video entertainment service set to launch later this year. YouTube will handle the technology while Universal Music supplies the content. The two companies will share ad revenue. The companies said and at this point it appears that Universal's content and artists will be the only label represented on the site. However, Doug Morris, Universal Music's chief executive, said in a conference call with the media that he is in negotiations with other top record labels and is confident they will join. Google CEO Eric Schmidt said on the same conference call that YouTube and Universal Music have renewed their existing licensing agreement. YouTube will continue to be licensed to allow visitors to use songs from Universal Music. Professionally made videos from the label will only appear on Vevo, the companies said. This is the first time that YouTube has launched a satellite Web site, Schmidt said, but he added that he hopes there will be more.

 For Universal Music, the move means that Morris has obtained the standalone music-video service that he has long wished for. Ever since MTV became a cultural force and huge financial success by offering music videos on TV, the record industry realized that it goofed in thinking of music videos as a promotional tool. Morris has said that in this era of declining revenue in the sector, he doesn't see anything as "promotional" and argues that music videos are worth cash. In September, CNET reported that Morris was looking for a way to build his own video site. It appears now that Morris already had the partner he needed in Google. Sources close to Universal Music said last year that Morris wanted his artists' videos to be given a higher profile and presented to viewers with higher-quality video than what YouTube offered. But where could he go to find an audience as gigantic as YouTube's? Vevo undoubtedly will have what Morris wanted. For Google, which acquired YouTube in 2006, the agreement continues the company's streak of signing partnerships with top entertainment companies. For the past year, YouTube has been steadily shedding its rogue reputation among music, film, and TV companies. On Monday, CNET reported that Sony Pictures is in talks about licensing some full-length films to YouTube. When it comes to challenges, the new joint venture faces plenty. While Universal Music's YouTube is by far the largest on the site, with nearly 4 billion views, nobody knows for sure whether a standalone music-video site can attract a big audience or ad revenue. The question is whether Universal Music's content is attracting viewers to YouTube or whether visitors stumble on to the videos while they are already on YouTube. Either way, the companies say they are confident that the site won't have any trouble drawing fans. "We believe that at launch, Vevo will already have more traffic than any other music video site in the United States and in the world," Morris said in a statement, presumably referring to the traffic Universal sees at its YouTube channel." And this traffic represents the most sought after demographic for advertisers, especially as advertising dollars continue their shift from old media to new."

  New search engines aspire to supplement GoogleStory Highlights New search engines try to make searches faster, smarter, more personal  Wolfram Alpha, which launches this month, acts as a powerful calculator  Others are trying to make searches more visual instead of text-based Next Article in Technology »  Read VIDEOTIMELINE  By  John D. Sutter CNN 



 


 

  (CNN) -- We may be coming upon a new era for the Internet search. 
Google dominates the search world, but some sites are trying to expand the possibilities. 
 And, despite what you may think, Google is not the only player. New search engines that are popping up across the Web strive to make searches faster, smarter, more personal and more visually interesting.         Some sites, like Twine and hakia, will try to personalize searches, separating out results you would find interesting, based on your Web use. Others, like Searchme, offer iTunes-like interfaces that let users shuffle through photos and images instead of the standard list of hyperlinks. Kosmix bundles information by type -- from Twitter, from Facebook, from blogs, from the government -- to make it easier to consume. Wolfram Alpha, set to launch Monday, is more of an enormous calculator than a search: It crunches data to come up with query answers that may not exist online until you search for them. And sites like Twitter are trying to capitalize on the warp-speed pace of online news today by offering real-time searches of online chatter -- something Google's computers have yet to replicate. Google, of course, remains the search king. Recent efforts to revolutionize Web searching have failed to unseat the dominant California company, which captures nearly 64 percent of U.S. online searches, according to comScore. Tech start-ups like Cuil, which billed itself as more powerful than Google, and Wikia, which relied on a community to rank search results rather than a math formula, have largely faded away after some initial buzz.  Timeline: the history of searching for data » "The general trend has been relatively clear and consistent for the past five years: Google is growing its market share at the expense of every other engine," said Graham Mudd, vice president for search and social media at comScore, a company that tracks industry trends.

 The new class of search engines and data calculators enters the fray with those failures in mind, though. Instead of trying to be Google killers, these sites have more humble aspirations: to be alternatives to the industry giants.  Real-time searches offer the most promise, Mudd said. If you search Google news, the results will be recent, but not live. That's where Twitter's search comes in. It searches the site's micro-blog posts by the second, allowing users to see what's buzzing on the Web at any instant. Facebook and FriendFeed also are experimenting with real-time searches, according to news reports. But each of these searches operates only within its own social network. Scoopler is another real-time site that's trying to aggregate info from all of these sites.     And all of these are seeing more competition, as two new sites -- TweetMeme and OneRiot -- launched new or updated real-time searches on Tuesday. Nova Spivack, a technology developer who writes about search engines, said sites that forecast trendy topics will become more prominent. Knowing what will be trendy tomorrow is becoming valuable to more people, he said. Search trend predictions will be valuable to people interested in news in much the same way as stock forecasts are valuable to financial industry workers. "The topography of the Web is shifting much faster. Instead of happening kind of glacially, you're on the beach right where the water is coming in and it's constantly changing the way the sand is laid out," he said. Other search sites are just trying to get smarter, with some acting as giant data crunchers.   The much-talked about Wolfram Alpha, or Alpha for short, harnesses massive computing power to answer users' questions, even if they're never been answered on the Web before.  Watch a Wired editor discuss the site » "It's not a new Google. It's not supposed to be. It's a new thing. It's very complementary, in a way, to what search engines do," said Theodore Gray, co-founder of Wolfram Research, which created Alpha. People need to get away from the idea that every 3-inch-long search bar online acts just like Google and Yahoo!, he said. If you ask Google a question, the search engine's computers scan the Web for matching search terms and come up with answers that make the most sense statistically. Alpha, by contrast, pulls information from existing data sets that have been approved by the site's math-minded staff. The site then computes an answer to your question. An example will help this make sense.   Say you wanted to find out nutritional information for your favorite recipe. On Google, you would have to search each ingredient individually and then add the calories and fat grams together yourself. With Alpha, you can type in the full recipe and the site produces a completed graphic that looks like it came right off the side of a cereal box. Read about a CNN test of 'Alpha' Some search sites are trying to get better at understanding what their users want. Twine, a social site created by Spivack, soon will start incorporating information about its users into a search function, he said. Some of the information comes through a user's search history. The site also will ask users to rank search results by their relevance to your interests. "Right now, one of the problems with search is that it's really one-size-fits-all. It's not very personalized," Spivack said. "The fact is when I'm searching for certain kinds of things, the way that the results should be ranked might quite be different than if someone with a very different background or interests was searching for those same things." So if you're someone who is into heavy science, a search about evolution might yield more academic papers. If you're a person whose Web interests lean more toward pop culture, an evolution search might turn up photos and more basic information. Helping computers understand the information that's online is the next step in making searches more personal, Spivack said. It's unclear which companies, if any, will be able to accomplish this, but Google appears to be working on that problem as well as others. At an event on Tuesday, Google announced a new "show options" feature as part of its search. Users can use the function to see new ways search results are linked, such as through timelines or a "Wonder Wheel," which displays visual relationships between search terms.   And in a staff letter published last week on Google's blog, company co-founder Sergey Brin wrote about making searches more intelligent.  





 "Perfect search requires human-level artificial intelligence, which many of us believe is still quite distant," he wrote. "However, I think it will soon be possible to have a search engine that 'understands' more of the queries and documents than we do today.  "Others claim to have accomplished this, and Google's systems have more smarts behind the curtains than may be apparent from the outside, but the field as a whole is still shy of where I would have expected it to be."

  Microsoft, Google expand search-engine toolsStory Highlights Microsoft and Google released new search products this week  Microsoft Bing's "visual search" features images instead of text  Google's Fast Flip aims to replicate the magazine reading experience online  Products are evidence that search-engine market is diversifying Next Article in Technology »  Read VIDEO  By  John D. Sutter and Brandon Griggs CNN 



 


 

  (CNN) -- Say you're buying a dog. You know the breed you want; you can picture it in your head. But what was the name? A bull terrier? A pit bull? A bull mastiff? 

Bing's "visual search" and Google's Fast Flip produce search results as images. 


 Or what if you're in the market for a new camera? You saw a friend with a credit-card-thin model at a party last weekend. But was that a Canon? A Nikon? A brand you've never heard of? If you're like many people, you'd turn to the Internet for answers. But you type in "dog breeds" or "digital cameras" into Google and punch enter, and a big list of blue links comes up. You don't see the dog you want. You don't find the camera, either -- at least not quickly.    Such quandaries are the driving force behind Bing's new "visual search" function, which lets Web users troll through image catalogues instead of Web pages when they know what something looks like but can't put their finger on the name. The examples are also evidence that the search engine market, once dominated by simple rectangular search bars and the lists of Web pages that follow, is diversifying. People who once were happy with a one-search-fits-all model are finding exceptions, and a number of niche search products are trying to respond to these increasingly diverse needs.   Also this week, Google introduced a test product called Fast Flip, which takes a retro look at Web design by making online news look like something magazine readers will find familiar.

The future of libraries, with or without books


 The company has other news products -- namely Google Reader and Google News -- but is looking for ways to make news content more visual and to share some of the revenue. The new products come as Microsoft's Bing continues to elbow for more room in an online search market that Google has dominated for years. In June, 65 percent of all Internet searchers were done through Google sites, according to comScore. Microsoft caught only 8.4 percent of searchers in the same period. Fast Flip, an experimental feature of Google Labs, is a Web application that allows users to scan news articles from 39 print and online publishers, including The New York Times, Newsweek, TechCrunch and Us magazine. Users can "flip" through a horizontal stream of screen grabs of articles as they appear on the partners' Web sites, with layout, design and images intact. You can click once on a story to enlarge the page; a second click takes you to the partner's site. Users also can browse popular topics (the economy, Taylor Swift) or search for others of their choosing. Google says the idea behind the new service is to make online news-browsing faster and replicate the reading experience of flipping through a magazine or newspaper.  Unlike Google News, which emphasizes breaking news articles from the past 24 hours, Fast Flip "is more for stories with a longer shelf life," Google spokesman Chris Gaither said. "We think there's a lot of room for innovation in how people consume news articles on the Web," Gaither said. "The easier it is for people to browse articles quickly, the more they'll read."   Loren Baker, editor of Search Engine Journal, says that increases in bandwidth make "visual search" functions more successful today than in previous years, when images would load more slowly. Baker believes that Google Fast Flip could make it easier for people to scan news articles on their netbooks, tablets or even smartphones. "I don't have to sift through my bookmarks. I don't even have to leave Google," he said. "It's almost like a virtual newsstand on my handheld." But not everyone is excited about Google's new product.   "If this is the future of news, I think news is kind of screwed," said Frederic Lardinois, a writer at ReadWriteWeb, a technology blog. Lardinois said the interface is backward-thinking and is hard to use. Fast Flip is in a test phase and will incorporate feedback from users, Gaither said. Google also is seeking to expand the roster of Fast Flip partners, he said. Some tech observers say Bing's hyper-visual search function gives it a new leg up on Google in terms of functionality.  Nova Spivack, a search expert and founder of Twine, said the most important thing about Bing's visual search is that users can sort the images into categories.  By creating different kinds of searches and making them sortable, Bing is catering to high-end Internet users -- which, soon, will be everyone, he said. "I think Bing has realized that everybody is becoming a search geek," he said.  On the dog-breed search example, users can filter the images to include only terriers, or hypoallergenic dogs or toy dogs, or dogs that need a medium level of exercise, so they don't have to scroll through hundreds of photos to find the dog they're searching for.   Mary Jo Foley, editor of the All About Microsoft blog at ZDNet, said she personally finds Bing's visual search useless because she's not a visually minded person. But she said it's an example of search engines diversifying, and that's a good thing for everyone. "I think the idea for Microsoft and Google and Yahoo is to present things in new ways and say, 'What if you could do this? Would you want to do it this way?' " She added: "Not all people search in the same way, and not all people want to get their results in the same way." There are about 50 galleries of images in the new Bing visual search bin, but more will be added, and eventually the idea will be integrated into the main search site, said Stefan Weitz, director of Bing. Right now, users have to go to a separate page to find the visual searches. 





 David Coursey, a blogger at PCWorld.com, said the search works like a "visual dictionary." "I think Bing is onto something," he said. "And if they can figure out how to extend Bing's visual search, it could be very helpful for people who know what something looks like but don't know what to call it."

 China state media: Google decision 'totally wrong'By  Kevin Voigt and Lara Farrar, CNN   Waiting Beijing's next stepsSTORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: China's foreign ministry says move won't impact Sino-U.S. relations  Google says it will stop censoring search results in China  China Daily quotes official: Move "totally wrong"  Google.cn users will be re-routed to an uncensored site in Hong Kong  Beijing and Hong Kong, China (CNN) -- China state media said Google's decision to quit censoring its China Web site "violated its written promise" and was "totally wrong." In the chess game between Beijing and Google, Google has redirected all search traffic from mainland China to Google's Hong Kong site, google.com.hk rather than pulling out of China. Although Hong Kong, a former British colony, was handed over to Beijing in 1997, the region operates with some autonomy and has a free press. China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs weighed in on Tuesday, saying Google's moves won't impact Sino-U.S. relations -- despite a raft of editorials in state media over the weekend lambasting Google and accusing the company of having close ties to the Obama administration. China state media step up rhetoric against Google

"The Google incident is just an individual action taken by one company -- I can't see its impact on Sino-U.S. relations unless someone wants to politicize it," said Qin Gang, ministry spokesperson. "I cannot see its impact on China's international image unless someone wants to make an issue of it," Qin added. "It is not China that has undermined its image but rather it is the Google company itself." The government wouldn't comment whether Google's actions were legal or if the government planned further action. The next move may be for China to block access to Google.cn -- as it has done for Web sites like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. Google quits censoring search in China "We very much hope that the Chinese government respects our decision, though we are well aware that it could at any time block access to our services," David Drummond, Google's chief legal officer, wrote in a statement posted on the company's official blog. As of 9:30 p.m. ET, Google users in China could still access Google.cn but results on politically sensitive search terms, such as "Tiananmen Square massacre" or the outlawed religious group "Falun Gong," were being blocked when searched from Beijing -- suggesting that although Google is no longer self censoring, China state censors of "the Great Firewall" may be. Google-China move hurts businesses, academics A similar search in Hong Kong, however, successfully loads searches for controversial terms. Google indicated yesterday in a blog post that using the Hong Kong site could be patchy or slow due to so much traffic being redirected to its servers there. Google made the announcement on its Web site at 3:03 a.m. local Beijing time (3:03 p.m. ET). China Daily, a state-run media organization, responded with a story four hours later quoting an unnamed official from the Internet bureau under the State Council Information Office. "Google has violated its written promise it made when entering the Chinese market by stopping filtering its searching service and blaming China in insinuation for alleged hacker attacks," said the official. "This is totally wrong. We're uncompromisingly opposed to the politicization of commercial issues, and express our discontent and indignation to Google for its unreasonable accusations and conducts," the official said. Instead of shuttering its operations in China, Google plans to continue operating there. "We intend to continue R&D work in China and also to maintain a sales presence there, though the size of the sales team will obviously be partially dependent on the ability of mainland Chinese users to access Google.com.hk," wrote Drummond of Google. The company on Monday also launched a dashboard page, which it promises to update regularly each day, that will show which Google services are available in China. According to the page, YouTube, Google Sites and Google's Blogger apps were blocked, with some others partially blocked, such as Picasa.Kevin Voigt reported from Hong Kong and Lara Farrar reported from Beijing.

 Waiting game in Google-China sagaBy  Lara Farrar, for CNN    The spat between Google and Beijing may soon come to a close, as the search giant awaits word whether its license to operate there will be renewed. STORY HIGHLIGHTSGoogle is awaiting a decision on renewal of its license in ChinaGoogle-China spat began in January over cyber attacks on the firmSince March, google.cn redirected users to its Hong Kong siteIf the license is not renewed, google.cn will "go dark" Beijing, China (CNN) -- The saga for Google's operations in China continues as the search giant awaits a decision from Beijing on whether its operating license will be renewed. Guxiang, the company that runs Google's websites in China, has submitted its renewal application to the government, pledging to "abide by Chinese law," the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. The application was due Wednesday for the license. A "quick reply is expected soon" and Google was "late" in submitting the documents, Xinhua reported, citing an unnamed official from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, which issues the licenses. In a blog post published Monday night, David Drummond, Google's chief legal officer, said Google would stop redirecting users to its Hong Kong search engine, instead taking them to a google.cn "landing page" that contains a link to google.com.hk -- a technical step seen as a move to placate Beijing's concerns. In January Google said it no longer wanted to cooperate with China's Web filtering, following attacks from hackers that the company said it traced to China. On March 22, it announced it would redirect users to its uncensored Hong Kong search site.

While google.cn has remained accessible from the mainland, government filters have blocked sensitive queries made on the site. On Thursday, there were reports that the Google "suggest" search feature was not available to Chinese users. The feature offers possible search results as users type queries. "It's clear from conversations we have had with Chinese government officials that they find the redirect unacceptable -- and that if we continue redirecting users our Internet Content Provider license will not be renewed," Drummond wrote. "This approach ensures we stay true to our commitment not to censor our results on google.cn and gives users access to all of our services from one page." "Without an ICP license, we can't operate a commercial website like google.cn -- so Google would effectively go dark in China," Drummond said. Yet whether Google's move to effectively relaunch google.cn will be enough to appease government regulators who were unimpressed by the March 22 redirect is unclear. Google was not included on a list of companies released Wednesday by the State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping that Beijing plans to approve to provide online mapping services in the country. More than 20 companies were on the list, including Baidu, China's largest search provider. At a press conference Thursday, Qin Gang, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said "all internet companies in China, including international companies, should abide by Chinese laws." Whether google.cn will continue to operate in China "is hard to say at this point," said Edward Yu, head of Analysys International, a Beijing-based research firm. "The Chinese government often makes their decisions basically in a way that is not transparent. It is very hard to judge at this point." "What Google can do is wait for the process, and they need to further understand how consumers react," Yu said. "So far we think it is a negative blow to Google China." Google, which has been operating in China since 2006, had built up a 30 percent share of ad revenues in China and around a 20 percent share of users, according to Analysys. While those shares dropped slightly after Google's January announcement, they have stabilized in the second quarter, Yu said. "We need to see what kind of damage they are looking at and how this damage will effect their revenue," he said.

Editor's note: Fareed Zakaria is an author and foreign affairs analyst who hosts "Fareed Zakaria GPS" on CNN U.S. on Sundays at 1 and 5 p.m. ET and CNN International 2 p.m. and 10 p.m. CET / 5 p.m. Abu Dhabi / 9 p.m. HK  New York (CNN) -- Google's threat to shut down its operations in China might seem like just a dispute between a private company and a government, but the implications are huge for the world's fastest-growing economy, for the United States and for global relations, says analyst Fareed Zakaria. With the dispute in the background, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Thursday the U.S. is committed to freedom of speech online and to freedom from the fear of cyber-attacks.  The Google-China dispute surfaced January 12 when the search engine company said it and other companies were the target of cyber-attacks originating in China aimed at gaining access to the e-mail of Chinese advocates for human rights. Google announced that it is no longer willing to comply with China's requirements that it censor the results of searches in that country. The State Department has told China it is concerned about the issue. Zakaria, author and host of CNN's "Fareed Zakaria: GPS" spoke to CNN Wednesday. CNN: What's the dispute between Google and China all about? Fareed Zakaria: At one level, the dispute is about one company and the difficulty it's having doing business in China, but it's really a much broader issue. It's about two things really. The first is the tension between China's drive for modernity and its attempt to control information. China has very successfully modernized over the last few decades, but it places unique limits on information. Eric Schmidt, the CEO of Google, told me that China is the only country in the world where they had to basically sign up for a censorship regime. The second issue: Is China turning inward? Is it beginning to believe it needs the world less than it has in the past few decades? That would have very profound consequences both for China-US relations and for the world. CNN: What gives you the feeling that China might be turning inward? Zakaria: It's not just the problems they've had with Google. Over the last few years, there's been the rise in China of what the Chinese call "The new right," a group of people, fairly influential in the establishment, who argue that China should be more aggressive toward the West, more aggressive toward America, that it doesn't need the U.S. as much as it did. There is also the reality that China's economy, as it has grown, is becoming large enough that China doesn't depend as much on the rest of the world for exports. It has accumulated huge surpluses of capital. All of this is producing a China that is more parochial, more inward-looking and potentially more adversarial in its relationships with the West. If you look at the way it handled the Copenhagen summit, it's really quite striking. The Chinese are usually protocol-obsessed. And here they had a situation where Obama wanted to meet with Wen Jiabao, the Chinese leader who was there. Now Obama technically outranks Wen Jiabao because he is a head of state. Wen Jiabao is the premier, the prime minister. Ordinarily that would mean that Wen Jiabao would go to see Obama. The reverse happened and Obama attended the meetings. Chinese officials scolded him. All of this is very unusual. CNN: In a sense Google is raising a broader issue than the immediate issue they uncovered. They uncovered evidence that there was hacking of their sites and those of other American companies. But rather than deal with the hacking issue, they brought up the whole issue of having to have a filtered search engine in China. They're saying they're no longer willing to do that. So what's their real motivation? Zakaria: Having spoken to Eric Schmidt for years about this, they were always uncomfortable with the system of censorship they had to sign up to in China. But they believed at the end of the day that it was a huge market, and they could do well and it could help open up information in China.  I think they came to the conclusion that China has such an elaborate apparatus of censorship but also an elaborate apparatus of cyber-warfare or cyberattack. They were really not able to have that broader beneficial effect. Let's remember that China doesn't only have what's called the great firewall of China, the filtering and censoring system. They also have a very aggressive system of cyber-spying and cyberattack, probably the most sophisticated in the world. I should point out there are people who say Google did this because they weren't doing well in China, that they had lost market share to Baidu, a local Web search engine. Baidu is definitely the leader, but it doesn't make any sense to quit a market because you're not the market leader. By the way, Google is not dominant in other countries and they still participate. I take them at face value, that this was a decision prompted by values. You wouldn't give up whatever percent of the world's fastest-growing market for no rhyme or reason. They clearly were uncomfortable with this tension between their mission -- which they see as widening access to information everywhere all the time -- and China's very elaborate set of constraints on information. By the way there's a national security component for this for the United States and other countries. Cyber-spying is clearly an effort by the Chinese to move into the information age and adopt a kind of asymmetrical warfare. China is not matching the U.S. military, ship for ship, but if it develops a very sophisticated capability to destroy command and control systems, computer systems, that's a very potent weapon in any kind of conflict, military or otherwise. CNN: Getting back to Google's motivation, you do take their "Don't be evil" motto at face value? Zakaria: I don't know if I take it in all places and at all times, but I do believe in this case they were motivated largely by the sense that they were undermining their values and their mission. I recognize that were this to have been churning out billions of dollars in revenue, they might not have done it. But I don't think you can make the case that there was a business motivation for this. This will clearly cost them revenue, it may not cost them a huge amount of revenue, but it will cost them. CNN: How do we know that the hacking is being done by the Chinese government rather than by individual hackers on their own? Zakaria: We don't know that for sure. In fact, Eric Schmidt was clear to me about that. The nature of the hacking, the coordinated elements of it, the targets, all suggest that it is something that is being done at the very least with the acquiescence or encouragement of the state. There are very few experts I've talked to who doubt that much of this has the backing of the Chinese government, but to be clear it's very difficult to tell, and there's no conclusive proof. CNN: All of this suggests that the U.S. government has a lot at stake, and yet they don't seem to have been on the frontlines of this issue. It's a private company dealing with the Chinese government, not a government-to-government issue. Zakaria: That's right. Washington is treading very cautiously into this, and I think correctly because this is really a dispute between China and a private company in America. The U.S. government should watch it with great interest and concern, and they should come out in favor of certain broad principles, but I don't think the U.S. government should be out there trying to open up the market for Google. CNN: On the national security side, should the government be more active? Zakaria: It's trying to figure out how to respond to this kind of attack, but I gather there is a fairly sustained effort now in the government. Obama has made this a top priority. CNN: What's at stake for other American businesses that want to serve the Chinese market? Zakaria: I think a lot is at stake, because what we're basically talking about is China's orientation, China's belief that it has to accept a global system and an open global economy, that it benefits from having foreign companies participate on an equal footing. The more China turns inward, the more difficult it will be for American companies to find equal footing in China. The Chinese are making it increasingly clear they want to have national champions. Avatar opened in China to great success and two weeks later they basically shut it down [except for 3-D showings] and said that the movie theaters had to make way for a biopic about Confucius, and more importantly keep theaters free for Chinese-made movies. CNN: So what can the United States do about it? Zakaria: Washington should try to have a really sustained strategic dialogue with China, but also with our other allies, with the European countries, with Japan, and create a kind of common front for openness and greater engagement with the global system. One of the things that has helped the global system enormously is that it had two hegemons, two global superpowers -- first Britain and then the United States -- that were very outward-oriented and shared universal values and similar conceptions of a global system, open liberal values, an open economy, a common understanding of what would make for a good global system. If China as the great rising power turns out to be much more insular, parochial in its orientation, that would mean a much less stable, much less open world order. Think about the period of American isolationism when the United States was the rising power and it turned inward in the 1920s and 1930s. It was not good for the world. CNN: Can the Chinese government continue to limit expression of political views as its economy grows and the Web becomes an ever more important medium of communication worldwide? Zakaria: That's the trillion-dollar question. So far China has been remarkably successful at maintaining a system that has embraced markets, but also maintained a very controlled political system. My own view is that that cannot last forever, but that China is still in the early stages of modernization, and it is quite possible that it will be able to continue doing this for several decades. But I think it's very difficult to imagine China being a truly innovative country at the cutting edge of the information age, of global economics, if it has all these constraints on information, all this political control on human-to-human contact, which is what the next wave of the information age is all about. Ultimately the question is: Can China be a world leader that is admired, imitated and that shapes the global system and global values? There I have my doubts that an insular, inward-looking China that maintains tight political control over information and human contact will end up being the country that becomes the model for the world.

 Italy's Google verdict won't stop hate speechBy Christopher Wolf, Special to CNN       STORY HIGHLIGHTS Chirstopher Wolf says Google execs convicted in Italy after bullying video posted  Free speech protections prevent such verdicts in U.S., have let Internet thrive, he says  Wolf: Firms would have to restrict Internet use if Italian case were to become legal norm  Enforcement of speech codes hasn't stopped hatemongers from posting online, Wolf says

Racism and Bigotry

Editor's note: Christopher Wolf is a lawyer specializing in privacy and Internet law at Hogan & Hartson and is chair of the Internet Task Force of the Anti-Defamation League.  Washington (CNN) -- The Internet is awash with hate. It is the favorite tool of racists, anti-Semites, homophobes and other bigots. They host Web sites, upload videos and post comments intended to propagate the lies of prejudice, to recruit like-minded haters, to mislead children and to hurt minorities. Online culture has made it acceptable for even "nice people" to do hateful things, which is why we have an epidemic of cyber-bullying. And the platforms of Google, an Internet giant, serve as a major transport vehicle for hate speech of all kinds. But does that mean that Google executives deserve a jail sentence for what online haters post through its services? Absolutely not. Unfortunately, an Italian judge found otherwise last week and has convicted three Google executives for violating Italy's privacy code. The offense? A misguided user of a Google video service -- a predecessor to YouTube -- uploaded a video showing the bullying of a disabled youth. When Google received a formal complaint about the video from Italian police, it took the video down within hours. But the judge in Milan found that under Italian law Google had a legal duty to prevent the posting of the video that invaded the victim's privacy and dignity, and he imposed a suspended jail sentence and fines on them and their company. (Google plans to appeal.) Such a conviction is unimaginable in the United States. The First Amendment prevents the criminalization of even the most repugnant speech, except in very limited circumstances. Moreover, early in the Internet era, Congress passed a law immunizing Web companies for the content posted by third parties (other than copyrighted material). That law has allowed blogs and video uploads to flourish, empowering individuals to become publishers. It is fair to say that the culture of free speech in the United States has allowed the Internet to become the powerful tool of communication, education and entertainment that it is today. If legal constraints such as the Italian prosecution of Google become the online norm, companies will be forced to restrict how people use the tools of the Internet. The threat of liability, not just fines but jail time, will create too much risk. And the Internet will be the poorer for it. Moreover, it may be technologically impossible to monitor and filter the thousands of videos posted to YouTube every hour. At the same time, hatemongers will find a way to stay online while ordinary users are thwarted. Time after time, we have seen how the enforcement of speech codes in Europe against hate sites has resulted in the temporary take-down of offending content -- and its subsequent reappearance from hosting sites in the United States. But that does not mean we should throw up our hands and simply accept online hate as something that will always infect the Internet. There is a role for Internet users, for Internet companies and for educators. We should speak up when we see hate sites, explain to our kids what they are seeing and counter the vicious lies. Those offering Internet services with terms of use that prohibit hate speech should enforce those terms and remove offending content. That is exactly what Google did in the Italian case. The same U.S. law that provides Internet companies with immunity from liability for the posting of third-party content allows those companies to edit and remove offensive speech -- even speech that might have First Amendment protection but which the company deems to be repugnant because it is hate-filled. It is also time for Internet education to be required in all schools, to teach kids how to filter what they are seeing and to reject hate online. The epidemic of cyber-bullying alone should inspire such attention to kids' use of the Internet. The Italian conviction in the Google case may have a silver lining: It has shined attention on the often overlooked problem of hate on the Internet and spurred those of us concerned with how the Internet evolves to work even harder to fight the scourge of online hate speech. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Christopher Wolf.

 Google vs. China: Free speech, finances or both?By  Doug Gross, CNN    A man walks past the Google Chinese logo at the company's office in Shanghai, China, on Wednesday. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Activists applaud Google's demand for free access to information in China Google threatens to leave China after it was victim of "highly sophisticated" hacking Google trails in Chinese market, while its filtered operation there hurt its "Don't be evil" image China says Chinese Web users will be the victims if Google leaves  (CNN) -- Google's announcement that China should either stop censoring Internet searches or risk a pullout by the search-engine giant rocked the online world Wednesday, leaving observers to break down the meaning of the provocative move. By standing up to the communist regime, Google fashioned itself a champion of free speech -- a mantle the California-based company has wrapped itself in, even as its decision to allow only limited results in China drew criticism. But while many applauded Google's bold stance, others questioned whether finances may have had as much to do with its move as freedoms. Google said Tuesday that the company and at least 20 others were victims of a "highly sophisticated and targeted attack" originating in China in mid-December, evidently to gain access to the e-mail accounts of Chinese human rights activists.  A Google spokesman said intellectual property was stolen in the attack, while declining specifically to say what kind. But the company said the attacker or attackers gained access to the header -- or subject-line information -- from the e-mails of two human rights activists through the Google network.  Do you think Google should leave China?

The contents of the e-mails were not accessed, the spokesman said.  As a result, the company said, it is no longer willing to abide by the filters that the Chinese government demanded on certain searches before allowing Google to operate in the country. "We'd like to talk to the government about the ability to operate an unfiltered search engine in China, and that would be our preferred outcome," Google chief legal officer David Drummond said in an interview Tuesday with CNN.  "However if that's not possible, then we'll have to consider other alternatives which could include shutting down the local site or even closing down our offices entirely." Google officials acknowledge that since it started operating in China in 2006, thousands of search terms have been censored there. Within hours of Tuesday night's announcement, Google.cn was retrieving results for sensitive topics, including the 1989 crackdown at Tiananmen Square, the Dalai Lama and the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement in China. Advocates of Internet freedom cheered the move. Google's decision to filter itself in China in the first place was likely the most controversial in the history of the search-engine leader -- whose stock in trade is unfettered access to information and whose unofficial slogan is "Don't be evil." "It's a move that, in the past, has been highly criticized," said Rhea Drysdale, who handles search-engine issues for Internet marketing company Outspoken Media. "As a search marketer myself, it's not something that we've really agreed with." Google has argued that moving into China allowed Chinese users at least limited access to information. Workarounds by savvy Chinese users, particularly political dissidents, have at times found loopholes in the site's filters. "We've always had a strong value of free expression and free access to information," Drummond said. "And we decided to go into China a few years ago because we thought our being there could help to open things up there, and to help open access to information.  "But what I think we've seen is that the environment in China on the Internet has gotten more restrictive, not less restrictive." 
We just no longer in good conscience can continue to censor our results. --Google legal officer David Drummond

Standing up to China, Drysdale said, buys Google lots of goodwill in the online community. The company had taken some heat online after CEO Eric Schmidt, in an interview with CNBC, defended Google's practices of gathering information in the wake of complaints about privacy. "When Eric made that comment, it shook a lot of confidence in Google," Drysdale said. "Now, actually coming out and saying that they're not going to allow censorship to happen anymore in Chinese search results is a very strong stance. And I think it restores a lot of faith." Others were wondering if there wasn't more to the story though. Kit Eaton, a digital technology columnist for business magazine Fast Company, wrote Wednesday that finances almost certainly played a role in the all-or-nothing gambit. "Everything seems to be extremely positive -- everyone is waving their hands in the air and saying, 'Go Google! It's a blow for human rights,' " Eaton told CNN. "But no one has really analyzed why." For one thing, Google has not managed to dominate the search-engine market in China as it has in the rest of the world. Beijing-based Baidu was claiming it had 77 percent of the market share in that country in the third quarter of last year, according to Fortune magazine, with Google pulling about 19 percent. Analysts said less than 2 percent of Google's revenue comes from China. Best known for its search engine, Google also provides other computer services, including e-mail, online mapping, social networking and operating systems for mobile phones. "I think we'd be daft to think that someone or other, some finance guys, haven't sat down and looked at the financial situation in China and said, 'You know what? This isn't going to work out,' " Eaton said. By reacting to the Chinese hacking incident -- which Google says it has tightened security to prevent -- the company can save face while doing something it was considering anyway, he said. "Pulling out of China may be a way to score a huge PR hit," Eaton said. "It looks good if Google, say, looks for some sort of government regulation approval inside the States in the future." But Danny Sullivan, editor in chief of the Search Engine Land blog, said that Google was making good money in China and was steadily growing its share of the market. He called suggestions that Google is considering pulling out of China because of money "cynical," saying that the mobile phone market was opening up for its Android operating system and that studies show Google has been earning more, per search, than Baidu. "I think they were more successful than people are giving them credit for," Sullivan said. "They were not such losers that they decided, 'We better get out and here's a good excuse.' " For its part, the Chinese government said Wednesday that it welcomes foreign Web-based enterprises and is working "to promote sound development of the Internet."  "The Internet in China is open," said Xi Yanchun, a Chinese Embassy spokesman. "It is illegal to assault the Internet. China [welcomes] foreign Internet enterprises to do business legally in China." In the English-language version of the state-run Xinhua news, a Chinese official highlighted the 700 Chinese jobs that would be lost if Google pulled out.  Xinhua quoted Guo Ke, a communications professor at Shanghai International Studies University, saying it would be "almost impossible" for Google to quit China and that the government would never back down on censorship. "It will not make any difference to the government if Google quits China; however, Google will suffer a huge economic loss from leaving the Chinese market," Guo said, according to Xinhua. "Chinese Internet users are the real victims if Google quits China. I think Google is just playing cat and mouse, and trying to use netizens' anger or disappointment as leverage." The final result, Drummond told CNN, will be up to the Chinese. "[W]e just no longer in good conscience can continue to censor our results," he said. "And so it's kind of up to the Chinese government as to whether they want to work with us in a way that will allow us to be there on that basis." That stance, Sullivan said, is the sort of brash approach that industry analysts have come to expect. "That actually felt very Google-like," he said. "It's the kind of thing they would do." CNN's Manav Tanneeru contributed to this report.

 Google-as-Topeka tops Web's April Fool's gagsBy  Doug Gross, CNN   STORY HIGHLIGHTS Google announces April Fool's name change to "Topeka"  Gag plays off of city's change to "Google," a stunt to lure Google's broadband project  ThinkGeek offers iCade, an arcade game console for iPad  Reddit let everyone be an administrator; chaos ensued

 (CNN) -- Want to read this story later, but afraid you'll forget where you saw it? Just Topeka it. Google led a wave of technology-related April Fool's Day gags Thursday morning, announcing on its homepage that the search-engine giant had changed its name to that of the Kansas town. The announcement, along with the word "Topeka" replacing "Google" in the site's multicolored logo, is a riff on the city "renaming" itself Google for a month. The stunt was part of the city's bid to be picked for Google's "Fiber for Communities" program, which Google says will provide Internet access 100 times faster than normal. "We didn't reach this decision lightly; after all, we had a fair amount of brand equity tied up in our old name," Google ... er ... Topeka CEO Eric Schmidt said in a blog post. "But the more we surfed around (the former) Topeka's municipal website, the more kinship we felt with this fine city at the edge of the Great Plains." The blog even gave a list of proper and improper usage of the new name. "Before our blind date, I did a Topeka search on him" got the green light, while "Before our blind date, I topeka'd him with AltaVista" did not. The post did point out that the "honor" didn't mean Topeka has a leg up in Google's broadband plan. YouTube saves a buck or two Forget high-definition. It's time for text-only video. YouTube said Thursday that new bandwidth-sucking video technology is cutting into its profits, so it's now offering TEXTp, a low-tech, text-only mode that looks like a grainy cross between "The Matrix" and when satellite interference is screwing up your TV reception. Users could switch to the joke mode on at least some videos by clicking on 480, the default bandwidth, and scrolling up to TEXTp. "By using text-only mode, you are saving YouTube $1 a second in bandwidth costs," read a message that appears when viewing in TEXTp. "Click here to go back to regular YouTube and happy April Fools Day!" New use for the iPad ThinkGeek, that purveyor of the latest in awesome tech-nerd gizmos and gadgets, was offering an add-on for the highly anticipated iPad: the iCade. The fictional iCade looks just like a miniature version of an old-school arcade game, and a photo features two of them: one with a docked iPad showing a basic screen and the other appearing to run the classic game Donkey Kong. The site's "sales pitch" makes fun of the Apple-fanatic furor over the iPad, which hits stores Saturday. "After the glow of the initial announcement wore off, many of us came to the conclusion that the iPad was actually pretty useless," it read. " 'It's a giant iPhone!' some said. Others exclaimed, 'WTF, no Flash!?' Still, we knew that most Apple fanbots (us included) would have to have one anyway." The page links to other "suggested items" for sale, including the Screaming Knife and Tell Me Your Secrets Bear. Other favorites: • Electronics maker Toshiba got into the act with the TubeTop, an inflatable laptop with an internal inner tube. • On news-sharing site Reddit, everyone is an administrator. The result was regular users banning each other and using their unlimited voting power to move stories to the top of the site. No. 1 as of this writing? "Reddit, here's a picture I just drew ... " followed by "Quick! Use your new admin powers to upvote the crap out of this puppy dog." • Instead of latitude and longitude coordinates, smartphone users who type "Where am I?" into Google's search field get answers such as "Neptune," "Mordor" and "Entrance to Hogwarts." • Google Maps is offering users who pan down to Street View a new option: 3-D. Of course, if you don't have a set of 3-D glasses handy, tough luck. • Wikipedia's main page offered an interesting array of articles, from a featured piece on the cherished custom of wife-selling to a headline about how Sony had accidentally used a time machine to zap some of its customers back to 1999.

 Blippy users' credit card numbers exposed in Google search resultsBy Jennifer Van Grove, Mashable 

   Several credit card transactions shared on social networking site Blippy have been exposed in Google search results. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Blippy's security system has been breached in a very public and unfortunate way  There's a bug in the "administrative, physical and electronic measures" that ensure privacy  Mashable suggests that Blippy users take immediate action to revoke access

Google Inc.

Mashable.com

 (Mashable) -- Sharing your credit card and online purchases with friends on the web sounds risky and it is.  We've just discovered that several credit card transactions shared on social networking site Blippy have been exposed -- with full credit card numbers included -- in Google search results.  Tipster Trey Copeland wrote to us with a link to results for the search: site:blippy.com +"from card". That search returns results showing detailed purchase information for transactions. Each result highlights that there was a "debit card transaction" or "card transaction," the amount spent, the specific location (address included) and the full card number. Blippy users who share their credit card and bank account information do so with the assumption that this information will remain private. Blippy addresses security concerns with the following statement on its website:  "Blippy is very concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your personally identifiable information. We employ administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access. We will make any legally-required disclosures of any breach of the security, confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored personal data to you via email or conspicuous posting on the Services in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system."  Unfortunately it appears that there is a bug in the "administrative, physical and electronic measures" that ensure privacy, as Blippy's security system has been breached in a very public and unfortunate way.  Given the breach, we suggest that Blippy users who have authorized the site to access their debit or credit transactions take immediate action to revoke access. We've e-mailed Blippy, notified of them of the situation and will update this post when we know more.© 2013 MASHABLE.com. All rights reserved.

 Five lesson for Google from Nexus One's sluggish startBy  Priya Ganapati 

      STORY HIGHLIGHTS Four months after its release, Google's support for Nexus One phone seems to be waning  Phone has sold 135,000 units in same time Droid and iPhone sold over 1 million  Analyst says outing still not a failure, taught Google about marketing  Google says plan has always been for Nexus One to be first of many phones
RELATED TOPICS


Nexus One

Google Inc.

Smartphones

 (Wired) -- Barely four months after the launch of its first smartphone, the HTC-built Nexus One, Google's commitment to the device seems to be on the wane. Google is now pointing customers interested in buying a Verizon version of the Nexus One to the newly launched HTC Droid Incredible phone. The Incredible, which has garnered rave reviews, is on par with the Nexus One in terms of processing power and its vivid OLED display, but packs a more powerful camera. Google has also said that it is no longer working on "further engineering improvements" to the 3G reception on its Nexus. Some people are taking that as a sign that the search company might not be in the handset business for the long haul. In Silicon Valley, Nexus Ones are remarkably easy to get hold of, thanks to a generous developer program, liberal press review program and other handouts. Google is literally giving them away, which is never a sign of a hot product. Indeed,Nexus One sales are barely a blip on the market-share charts. Google sold only 135,000 units in its first 74 days, compared to 1 million iPhones and 1.05 million Droids in those phones' first 74 days. But that doesn't mean the Nexus One is a failure: Far from it. In fact, it's a sort of inspired experiment, a laboratory for Google to get a taste of the mobile-handset business, up close and personal. For instance, who could have realized the extent to which the lack of a telephone support line would make Google-loving customers unhappy? The Nexus One gives Google direct-sales experience and customer contact that they don't get as the developer of the Android OS, which is used on many phones from other manufacturers. Indeed, competing with those manufacturers may be the last thing Google wants. "It wasn't about Google becoming a phone company," wrote telecom analyst Jack Gold in a recent e-mail newsletter. "It was about Google getting a significant number of devices out there to form a big 'reference platform' testing/pilot environment where they could model, test and tune their ecosystem based on the real-life use of the early adopters who would buy NexusOne." When we asked Google for a comment, a company spokesperson said, "We've said from the beginning that Nexus One is the first of many Google-branded Android handsets. Today's announcement (steering Nexus One customers to the HTC Incredible on Verizon) doesn't mean any change on that front." Google may not be saying much, but here's our takeaway on the lessons Google has learned -- or should have learned -- from the Nexus One. 1. You can't sell phones like computers.  At first, Google's strategy to offer a phone just through its website, bypassing traditional wireless-carrier stores, may have seemed innovative and clever. After all, consumers buy almost all their major electronics products online, including computers, storage devices, digital media players and even TVs. But when it comes to cellphones, users want to touch and play with the product. And they want in-store customer support for these devices. "Fundamentally, Google's contention that mobile phones will increasingly be purchased more like other consumer electronics -- online and without subsidy -- has so far been proven wrong, or at least premature," said Charles Golvin, an analyst with Forrester Research. "Very few U.S. consumers will spend $500 for a phone, and even fewer will do so without at least the opportunity to paw the hardware, even if they eventually buy online," said Colvin. Even those who purchased the device through Google's online store faced problems. Nexus One was plagued by consumer complaints, including spotty 3G connectivity, a high early termination fee and poor customer support from Google. Weeks after the device's launch, Google finally introduced a phone support line. Until then, customers with problems could only e-mail Google and had to wait for hours for a response. "Google's technical support for the device has been derided both online and in the media, deservedly," said Golvin." In the intensely competitive world of mobile handsets, that just doesn't cut it. 2. Marketing matters.  All those iPhone and Droid commercials on TV may seem like ego trips for Apple and Motorola. But marketing plays a big role in phone sales. Smartphones are not just for gadget-heads, so if handset makers want to reach an audience beyond the early adopters, they have to advertise and sell their product through traditional media channels. Google didn't capitalize on the initial buzz around the first "Googlephone." The company never ran a focused marketing campaign that would try to impress on potential customers why the Nexus One was worth considering. The result has been that few potential customers have had a chance to hear why the phone may be special. Google also limited itself by offering the device only on T-Mobile. Last month, it extended it to AT&T, but AT&T customers will not get a subsidy on the device and will have to pay the full price -- $530 -- for the unlocked version of the phone. 3. In mobile phones, Google is a startup. The search giant's web products draw in millions of users, which means even half-baked ideas like Google Wave get a full workout from people eager to try the company's latest new thing. But in the world of consumer electronics, Google is a rookie, and the company will have to fight hard for its place. It has to build the retail relationships that companies such as Research In Motion and Motorola have created over the years. While Apple can use its own retail stores to let customers play with the iPhone, Motorola's Droid is available at Best Buy. When it comes to selling mobile handsets, Google needs to find the right spot for its devices. Google also has to build relationships with cellphone carriers. In the mobile world, carriers are extremely powerful, and for good reason: Without a good cellular data network, using even the most high-end phone becomes an exercise in frustration. A typical consumer's choice between a Nexus One and a Droid may come down to which carrier offers it. Google needs to craft its retail strategy with that in mind. 4. The mobile phone ecosystem is complex.  With Android, Google is trying to do with mobile phones what Microsoft did with Windows on PCs. Instead of having a proprietary operating system tied to hardware made by the same company, Google wants to separate the two. Handset makers such as Motorola and HTC are buying into the strategy. But to help them give up their older operating systems and use Android, Google needs to understand how phones are designed, developed, priced and sold. It also needs to understand how customers use these products and the challenges they face. Listening to its hardware partners talk about this with PowerPoint presentations is one way. Getting your hands dirty to do it yourself, is another, and that's what Google did with Nexus One. "At 200K to 300K or so devices deployed, think of all the feedback they can get on real world operations and user requirements," said Gold. "It's a massive number of test subjects." With Nexus One customers, Google not only gets to test and tune the device's OS, but also the app store and delivery ecosystem, he said. It gives Google the kind of insight that the company could use to create the next versions of the Android OS. "If you call this type of an advanced ability to garner real-world customer data and hone your ecosystem a flop, then so be it," said Gold. "I see it as a pretty positive effort on Google's part. If Google never makes a dime in the hardware market with its own Android-based products, it will still be a success." 5. Earning developer goodwill is the key.  The success of Apple's app store has spurred rivals to launch their own versions. But with the exception of Android, few other app stores -- including the BlackBerry World and the Palm app store -- have come close to becoming a viable competitor to iPhone's App Store. One reason is that Google has been generous with seeding the developer community with the Nexus One. A significant portion of the Nexus One sales went to programmers, and that's not by accident. Google has also been handing them out. "Google got these devices into the hands of early adopters who are generally unlikely to be silent about any issues they may uncover," said Gold. "These are the kinds of debuggers you want working with your device in the early stages and giving you lots of feedback." Having its own Android device helped Google take control of this feedback without having to rely on the HTCs and the Motorolas of the world to do it. For Google the handset experiment isn't over. Andy Rubin, Google's vice president of engineering and Android czar, has said that the company plans to come out with a series of Google phones. Make no mistake, there will be another Google handset. But it will not likely repeat the mistakes of the Nexus One, and future Googlephones phones will get better. Just don't expect a stunning blockbuster phone from Google, because Google understands it's not in the business of just selling a phone.Wired's Dylan Tweney contributed to the reporting on this story.Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT!

London, England (CNN) -- Facebook dropped a bombshell on the tech industry last week in the form of a Web-wide "Like" button and the launch of the "Open Graph." Using this new platform, Web sites can drive Web traffic from Facebook by including Like buttons on their pages; every Like posts an update to that user's Facebook page.  What's more, any Web site can customize its experience for you, if you're logged into Facebook: Suddenly CNN.com stories can be ranked not just by an editor but by your friends too.  Likes replace links?  Facebook announced Likes as a form of "social links" -- better than a link because it's related to a specific user. If Like buttons take off, that's really bad news for Google, since its algorithm uses links between sites to determine their order in search results.  Facebook seeks to replace this open system of links between pages with the "social links" (or Likes) that it controls. Google and other search engines won't have full access to all these Likes, so the company best positioned to rank the Web will be Facebook. No wonder the "open Web" advocates are sounding the alarm, concerned that a single company will stockpile all of our personal information and preferences.  Already there are calls to create an "OpenLike" standard that's accessible to all, reports Facebook watcher Nick O'Neill.  Facebook optimization?

As Google rose to become the barometer of all that's worthy on the Web, publishers rushed to change their sites to appease the Google god. "Search Engine Optimization" became a massive industry; a multitude of SEO consultants sprung up, offering to tweak your Web site to better fit Google's measure of the Web.  What if Facebook Likes take off? Or to use the proper jargon: What if the Open Graph becomes the measure of the Web? Will publishers change their sites to appease our new overlord?  I'm already seeing it: Thousands of sites are adding Facebook's version of semantic data in preference to the open standards as Facebook becomes the new kingmaker. In the week since launch, more than 50,000 Web sites have added Facebook's "social plug-ins." All of which will make it blissfully easy for Facebook to organize the Web:  Facebook Optimization may be the new SEO.  Open Web advocates have reason to be concerned. Privacy experts are also raising red flags. No doubt they'll find an ally in Google: Without access to the stitches that bind Web pages together, the search engine could falter.

 Microsoft revamps Hotmail, takes on Google and YahooBy  Doug Gross, CNN    The updates to Hotmail are expected to roll out in the next few weeks. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Hotmail service will get a major overhaul, Microsoft announces  The service is world's most popular e-mail, but it has lagged in innovation  The update eliminates clutter, lets users easily choose which messages to look at  It also will let people use programs like PowerPoint without ever leaving e-mail
RELATED TOPICS


Microsoft Corporation

Email Software

Internet

 (CNN) -- Hotmail, the world's most widely used e-mail service, is getting a major overhaul from Microsoft in a bid to fend off competitors like Google's Gmail. Microsoft says the planned update to Windows Live Hotmail is designed to remove clutter and let users interact with other sites and applications while checking their mail. In the blog post, Microsoft program manager Dick Craddock said the company studied e-mail usage for a year while considering the changes. "People made it clear to us that the No. 1 thing they wanted their e-mail service to address -- whether it was Hotmail or any other e-mail service -- was to help them manage the clutter in their inbox; not just the spam, but all the mail they get that's clogging their inboxes," he wrote. A key feature to the new Hotmail, which will be rolled out over the next few weeks, will be a "sweep" feature that allows users to clean out their inbox in one fell swoop. The single-click feature lets the user select a single e-mail sender, or multiple senders, and automatically delete every message from that sender. Another single click will let users decide which e-mails they want to look at -- from people on their contacts list, from their social networking sites or otherwise. Microsoft's study showed that only about 25 percent of e-mail people get is from members of their contacts list. The rest tends to be business related, from social networks, tracking of purchases they've made online and spam, the post says. Despite the growing popularity of social networks like Facebook as a way to communicate, Craddock wrote that people are getting more e-mail than ever. While it remains on top of the global e-mail market with roughly 350 million users, the decade-and-a-half old Hotmail has been a largely stagnant service compared to third-place Gmail, which has been steadily picking up users. Yahoo is also more widely used in the United States than Hotmail. Gmail has always offered ways to link up with Google's expansive list of internet offerings, most recently its foray into the world of social networking, Google Buzz. By comparison, Hotmail and Yahoo have offered more-basic mail to their users. Hotmail's proposed changes follow some of what Gmail has done. For example, with the new Hotmail, people will be able to open and edit PowerPoint documents in their e-mail accounts, whether they have PowerPoint installed on their computer or not. Hotmail Active View will give people an automatic preview of their incoming mail, including a look at photos they've received -- both attachments and links to photo sites like Flickr. They'll be able to watch YouTube videos, check social networks and perform other outside tasks without ever leaving e-mail. Gmail has similar features. The proposed changes got mostly positive feedback early Tuesday from the tech community -- where Hotmail's vanilla setup hadn't garnered many fans before. "It'll be hard to steal users away from Gmail -- which still has dozens of minor features that Hotmail doesn't (just check the Labs) -- but Hotmail will most likely be a worthy competitor after the new version is launched this summer," Stan Schroeder of social media blog Mashable, wrote on Tuesday. Harry McCracken of PC World wrote that the new Hotmail could be preferable to Gmail in some ways and pick up new users, particularly from flailing AOL. "Hotmail also feels less densely packaged with stuff," he wrote. "I could see some folks preferring it to Gmail, which is beginning to flirt with bloat."

 Google aims to make app creation easyBy  John D. Sutter, CNN | Filed under: Mobile     Google announced a product called App Inventor, which aims to make app development simpler. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Google announces a program called App Inventor  The program aims to make app development easy enough for kids  Until now, creating a smartphone app required code-writing skills
RELATED TOPICS

Smartphones

Apple iPhone

 (CNN) -- It's not uncommon these days for people to know how to build websites and create blogs. That's largely because sites like WordPress, Blogger and Tumblr have simplified the process, so you don't have to be a code wonk to publish. Now, Google is trying to make smartphone app creation easy, too. On Monday, the company announced a program called App Inventor, which claims to make app development easy enough for schoolkids. "App Inventor requires NO programming knowledge," Google says on its new website for the program. "This is because instead of writing code, you visually design the way the app looks and use blocks to specify the app's behavior." News sites have compared App Inventor to building with Lego blocks.  Google says it tested the program with kids. "For the past year, we've been testing App Inventor in classrooms around the United States, and we've found that it opens up the world of computer programming to students in new and powerful ways," the company says on its official blog. The program is an extension of research and product development done by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.  MIT's Lifelong Kindergarten Group created a building-blocks version of code programming for kids called Scratch, which Google says was one inspiration for its new app creator. The school's Scheller Teacher Education Program also gave Google some code to make the project possible. Eric Klopfer, an associate professor at MIT and director of that program, said he hopes App Inventor gets young people -- particularly those in middle school and high school -- more interested in how phones and computers operate. "It's not as easy as using a word processor, which is pretty close to what blogs have gotten to. It's not as easy as that," he said of App Inventor, "but it's a big leap forward." The new program is an apparent attempt by Google to both democratize app development and increase the number of apps that are available for smartphones that run Google's Android operating system. The number of Android apps has been growing in recent months, but there are only about half as many apps available for download on the Android Market as there are from Apple's popular App Store, which services the iPhone and iPad. Fortune: The coming Android app explosion Some tech bloggers criticized Google on Monday for looking to up the number of Android apps instead of improving their quality. Others questioned whether non-techie developers could create apps that are worth using. "They have to hope it doesn't backfire and simply flood the Android Market with more junk apps than already exist," writes MG Siegler on the blog TechCrunch. On the blog Mashable, which is a CNN Tech partner site, Pete Cashmore writes that App Inventor may lead to a number of "cookie cutter" apps that are fairly useless, but it also may have long-term positive effects for Google. "If App Inventor is so simple that schoolchildren can make apps, some of those same children will soon become coders themselves ... and perhaps choose to develop Android apps rather than iPhone," Cashmore writes. The blog The Next Web says app quality may suffer, but that won't hurt the overall usefulness of Google's Android Market for apps. "Will it negatively impact the Android Market? It's not likely," writes Brad McCarty. "Let's face it, even though we're approaching 100,000 applications in the Market, the good ones rise to the top very quickly. There are literally thousands of useless, trash-directed applications, but they tend to get buried in a hurry." Google is not the first company to try to make app development simple. Nokia tried a similar program this year, according to Engadget, but Google may be the first company that is big enough to popularize the idea. Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment. To learn more about the program, go to Google's App Inventor information page. To download the program, you have to fill out a form telling Google why you would like access to it. Watch a video preview of the program If you give it a try, let us know what you think of it in the comments below. Is app development really easy enough for anyone -- even young kids -- on this program?

Google Inc.

Apple iPhone

 (CNN) -- With the eyes of the technology world squarely on Apple's iPhone 4, Google quietly announced it will stop selling the Nexus One, its first and possibly only foray into the smartphone world. In a two-paragraph post on its official blog, Google's Nexus One team said the next shipment of the phones will be the last. "Once we sell these devices, the Nexus One will no longer be available online from Google," according to the post. The announcement was made Friday, the same day that Apple CEO Steve Jobs held a news conference to announce the company's solution for reception problems with the popular iPhone 4. Running on Google's Android operating system, the Nexus One was released in January to mostly positive reviews from the tech blogosphere. Early users compared it favorably to the iPhone and liked the ability to buy the phone, albeit for more money, without a data plan from a particular service provider. But sales were anemic, with the phone selling only 135,000 units in roughly the same time it took the iPhone and the Droid -- Motorola's phone that runs the Android system -- to sell 1 million. Many blamed Google's experimental try at selling the Nexus One only in its online store. The company abandoned that approach in May, offering the phone in brick-and-mortar stores for the first time. With the announcement, Google seems satisfied to write off the Nexus One as a tool to experiment with Android's features. Recently, the search engine giant has been pushing Android users to phones made by other manufacturers, such as the HTC Droid Incredible. May's announcement mentioned both the Incredible, for Verizon customers, and the HTC Evo 4G from Sprint as phones that have benefited from advances made on the Nexus One. The new Droid X from Motorola has most of the Android buzz now. It was released last week to positive reviews and is selling out online and in many retail stores. Google's blog post said that it will continue to make the Nexus One available to Android developers so they have something to use while writing apps for the mobile platform.

 Google Instant goes mobile 

By Radhika Marya, Mashable | Filed under: Mobile   The Instant search option is presently on Android 2.2 devices, as well as iPhones and iPods running on iOS 4.

Apple iOS

 (Mashable) -- A beta version of Google Instant is now available on many U.S. iPhone and Android mobile devices. According to the Google Blog, the Instant search option is presently on Android 2.2 devices, as well as iPhones and iPods running on iOS 4. As of right now, Google Instant is only available in English, although Google (Google) plans on adding more languages and bringing the service to other countries and devices. In order to test out Instant's latest incarnation, one must tap the "turn on" link beneath the search box while visiting Google.com on a mobile device. Users are advised to wait for a bit and refresh the page if the "turn on" option isn't immediately visible. Mobile Google Instant is similar to its desktop counterpart -- it offers a list predicting what users are searching for based on what they type. The first prediction's results will automatically appear on the screen. To access the remaining results, users just have to tap their fingers on the other listed predictions. If they press "enter" or the search button, the predictions will be skipped in favor of results that match the exact search terms. The service, best designed to work on 3G and Wi-Fi networks, can also be enabled or disabled without causing users to leave the page they're on. All one needs to do is tap the "turn on" or "turn off" link. Google Instant made its desktop debut in September, which is when a mobile sneak peek was also made available. By the end of the month, while in the midst of rolling out Instant to other countries, Google also added keyboard navigation to the service.

 Apple finally approves Google Voice appBy  Mark Milian, CNN | Filed under: Mobile     Google Voice allows for cheaper calls to other countries, compared to most telecom rates, and free text messages. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Apple approves the official Google Voice app for distribution in its App Store  Google had submitted a version of the app 17 months ago  In the last couple of months, other developers have been selling Google Voice apps
RELATED TOPICS


Google Inc.

Apple Inc.

Apple iPhone

 (CNN) -- Apple began carrying Google's free voice app for iPhone on Tuesday, after the application hung in limbo for more than a year. The Google Voice app interfaces with the Web service by the same name. Voice lets users register a new phone number where calls can be forwarded and organizes voice mail, text messages and call logs in a central inbox. Google submitted its iPhone app in June 2009. Six weeks later, Google said its app still hadn't been approved. At the time, Apple carried a handful of third-party apps that hooked into Google's voice service. Not long after the U.S. Federal Communications Commission inquired into this public dispute, Apple took down all apps that interface with Google Voice, including one called GV Mobile. In Apple's response to the FCC, the company expressed concern that these applications replace key functions of the phone and may cause confusion. Apple tests all apps for bugs -- as well as compliance with the company's contentious and somewhat ambiguous rules -- before they are admitted to its online App Store. Google has other apps for the iPhone, including one for its search engine that allows users to input text, voice or pictures from the phone's camera. But with no way to get the Google Voice app past Apple's guards, Google created a mobile-optimized website for iPhone and other smartphone owners to use with Voice. However, websites cannot achieve features that apps can, such as system notifications and integration with a phone's address book. But then Apple suddenly began approving third-party voice apps a couple of months ago. They were mainly pay-per-download programs. Google declined to comment at that time, instead pointing people to the Web version. On Tuesday, Google's free software appeared in the App Store. Google already has voice apps for its own Android mobile operating system and for Research in Motion's BlackBerry devices. Those apps work more seamlessly with those phones than the iPhone version. But in our testing, we found Google Voice for iPhone to be well designed. While calls made through Gmail on a computer are connected over the internet through a technology called VoIP, the iPhone app routes calls through traditional cellular telephony protocols. Google Voice allows for cheaper calls to other countries, compared to the rates telecoms like AT&T charge, and free text messages. It can also transcribe voice mails into text, although that technology is far from perfect. Apple has taken verbal beatings this week at the Web 2.0 Summit, a conference in San Francisco, California, frequented by high-tech executives. Google CEO Eric Schmidt painted Apple's system as "closed," which clashes with his company philosophy, he said in his fireside chat on Monday. "The Android model is very different from Apple's on just about every point," he said. Apple CEO Steve Jobs said in his most recent earnings call that Schmidt's argument is a sort of smoke and mirrors, and called Android "fragmented." Jobs took shots at RIM in that call. So RIM co-CEO Jim Balsillie joined the fight on Tuesday at the Web 2.0 Summit, echoing Schmidt's sentiment about Apple's policies. He also appeared to express some contempt for Jobs' "sit back and say things" attitude. But with the Voice app finally available, Apple may be lowering the barrier on the types of software it will allow in its store, and at the same time smoothing its competitive relationship with Google.

 Cashmore: Google building a Facebook rival? Let's hope soBy  Pete Cashmore, Special to CNN | Filed under: Social Media     Pete Cashmore says there is no truly competitive social network to which disgruntled Facebook users can flee. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Even satisfied Facebook users should hope Google's social-networking efforts bear fruit  Facebook could launch both a search engine and ad network, a double threat for Google  Facebook's recent privacy issues made users face reality: There's no real alternative  Google's social-networking efforts have so far fallen flat

Editor's note: Pete Cashmore is founder and CEO of Mashable, a popular blog about social media. He writes a weekly column about social networking and tech for CNN.com.   (CNN) -- Google is working on a social service to rival Facebook, if Web rumors are to be believed.  And while Google's social-networking efforts have so far fallen flat, even satisfied Facebook users should hope that the search engine's efforts bear fruit. First, to the rumor: A now-deleted Tweet last weekend from entrepreneur Kevin Rose claimed that Google is working on a Facebook competitor called "Google Me." That claim gained credence as former Facebook CTO Adam D'Angelo weighed in. Posting a response on the question-and-answer service Quora, D'Angelo wrote: "This is not a rumor. This is a real project. There are a large number of people working on it. I am completely confident about this."  Google, he added, is threatened by Facebook's rise to prominence and feels the need to build a social network of its own.  The Facebook threat The search giant has legitimate cause for concern. As I wrote in this column two months ago, Facebook is gathering masses of data through its recently launched "Likes" feature, which lets Web visitors express interest in a piece of content.  More than 50,000 websites implemented this "Like button" in the week after it launched, providing Facebook with a treasure trove of data about the preferences of Web users. This data could form the basis of a powerful search engine, ranking Web pages by "Likes" rather than the links that Google relies upon.  What's more, Facebook could serve up different search results to each user based on the preferences of his or her friends. It gets worse for Google. Facebook's mountain of personal data could also provide the backbone of an ad network many times more targeted than Google's keyword-based advertising. If Facebook were to launch both a search engine and ad network, it could put a significant dent in Google's more than $23 billion in annual revenue.  But Google shouldn't be the only party concerned about Facebook's rapid ascent -- the lack of a Facebook alternative is a threat to consumer choice, providing no escape route when things turn sour.  No real alternative Facebook's privacy issues over recent months have opened our eyes to a grim reality: There is no real alternative. While dissatisfied MySpace users hopped over to Facebook, there is no truly competitive social network to which disgruntled Facebook users can elope.  The demand for a legitimate alternative is so great that a project called Diaspora was able to raise more than $200,000 from Web users to develop its "privacy aware, personally controlled, do-it-all, open source social network."  Until such a rival emerges, Facebook has little incentive to maintain user trust -- the only option available to unhappy Facebookers is to delete their accounts and lose contact with their friends.  Google's social stumbles  Alas, Google has a dismal track record when it comes to social networks. Orkut, an early social-networking effort, has seen success in Brazil, but in the U.S. it's virtually unheard of. Google Friend Connect, a possible rival to the recently renamed Facebook Connect, went nowhere.  Open Social, a challenge to Facebook Apps, has been forgotten. And Google Buzz, a recent attempt to add Twitter-like status updates to Gmail, flopped -- and generated a regrettable privacy backlash for the company.  Google, the narrative goes, is exquisitely talented at solving problems with algorithms. But when it comes to the touchy-feely stuff -- like human interaction -- it falls flat.  Getting behind Google So while it's definitely a long shot, it's time to rally behind Google. If the search giant is able to pull off a half-decent Facebook rival, the fast-growing social network will finally have a competitor to keep its power in check.  That would be a win not just for Google, but for the Web as a whole.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Pete Cashmore.

 'Google Me' site may be in the worksBy  Doug Gross, CNN | Filed under: Social Media     According to an online report, Google has invested more than $100 million in socal-game company Zynga. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Reports: Google invested in "FarmVille" maker Zynga as it plans social-networking move  Online tech pundits say Google Me will aim to take on Facebook  Former Facebook technical officer says Google plans are "not a rumor"

Internet

 (CNN) -- If online reports are to be believed, Google could be cooking up a rival for Facebook -- and bringing the maker of popular social games like "FarmVille" with them. Google Games, built around some sort of partnership with casual-gaming company Zynga, is in the works and would be part of a larger social network called Google Me, according to technology blog Tech Crunch. Statements from notable internet players, including Digg founder Kevin Rose and a former Facebook chief technical officer, have suggested in recent weeks that the search-engine giant is working on a social network geared toward rivaling Facebook. TechCrunch this weekend reported that unnamed sources said Google has invested between $100 and $200 million in Zynga, the maker of successful online social games like "FarmVille" and "Mafia Wars." The investment part of the deal was confirmed last month and a "larger strategic project" is still in the works, according to that report. A Zynga spokeswoman said Monday that the company has no comment on the reports. A Google spokesman referred questions to the company's media-relations e-mail account, which did not respond to inquiries. The popularity of Zynga's games -- more than 50 million people play them on any given day, according to developerAnalytics -- could bring considerable heft to any online networking or gaming project Google launched. The obvious question then would become whether the "Farmville" maker would pull its games from Facebook. That would be a tall order considering the success those games have seen. The TechCrunch report also added a new wrinkle to the Google Me speculation -- saying the Zynga deal would be part of a project called Google Games, according to sources. On the question-and-answer site Quora, former Facebook technical officer Adam D'Angelo said the Google Me rumors are real. The project would build on Google Buzz, a social networking effort rolled out by Google in February, he said. Google Buzz has been widely criticized by tech pundits. Reports have not offered details on how a Google site would look, whether it would link to Gmail and other Google pages like Buzz does, or how Google Games would integrate with it. "This is not a rumor. This is a real project. There are a large number of people working on it. I am completely confident about this,"D'Angelo wrote.  "They realized that Buzz wasn't enough and that they need to build out a full, first-class social network. They are modeling it off of Facebook."

 Most of us Google ourselves, survey findsBy Stephanie Goldberg, Special to CNN    More than half of adult internet users say they have looked their name up on a search engine. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Survey: 57 percent of adult internet users have looked their name up on a search engine  In 2006, only 47 percent of adult internet users said they searched their name  Reputation management is a defining feature of online life, study says

 (CNN) -- Web search engines make our lives easier: They connect us with what we're searching for in a matter of seconds, and sometimes they bring us to places we didn't even know we were looking for. But they can also teach us a lot about ourselves, as more than half of adult internet users already know. About 57 percent of adult internet users in the United States said they have entered their name into a search engine to assess their digital reputation, according to a new Pew Research Center study "Reputation Management and Social Media." That's a significant increase since 2006, when only 47 percent of adult internet users said they had looked their name up on a search engine. The findings show "reputation management has now become a defining feature of online life," the study says. This probably doesn't come as a surprise to many, considering a new story about Facebook's privacy settings surfacing each day. And the concern about people's digital reputations will most likely continue to grow as posting and sharing information over the internet becomes more and more widespread. The study also found that young adults are more apt to "restrict what they share" and manage their online reputations more closely than older internet users. This is "contrary to the popular perception that younger users embrace a laissez-faire attitude about their online reputations," wrote Mary Madden, a senior research specialist. The Pew Research Center study, which took place by phone between August 18 and September 14, sampled 2,253 adults 18 and older. The margin of error is 2.3 percentage points.

Web Design

 (CNET) -- Google has given Google News a serious makeover, adding more personalization options and organizing everything in a single row of topic headlines. The company announced the changes Wednesday afternoon, butthey have been testing ways to improve the ability to customize the Google News page for a while.  "We're also trying to better highlight interesting stories you didn't know existed and to make it easier for you to share stories through social networks," said Kevin Stolt, a Google software engineer,in a blog post. Over the next day or two, Google News visitors will start seeing a "News for You" section underneath the "Top Stories" section at the top of the page.  "News for You" is a user-generated list of topics and news sources, while the "Top Stories" section plays pretty much the same role it does on the current site, highlighting the top three or so major stories being covered by the media. Google said it also improved the way it allows readers to share stories with the social network of their choice, and will put the "Spotlight" section designed to highlight interesting feature stories in a more prominent place near the top of the page. The changes are coming first to the English-language version of Google News in the U.S., but will arrive in other countries and languages over the next several months, Google said. © 2010 CBS Interactive Inc.

 Analysis: Google and China agree on a fiction 

By  Ryan Singel | Filed under: Web     Writer says China agreed to a fiction in order to allow Google, save face. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Google's application to work in China for another year was unexpectedly renewed  Compromise lets Chinese users click box, go to unfiltered, Hong Kong-based search  The compromise doesn't tear down Chinese firewall but it does create a hole, writer says
RELATED TOPICS


Google Inc.

China

 (Wired) -- Google got its Chinese visa extended Friday, but that doesn't mean the company is having a good trip or that China's censorship has gone away. Google's application to run Google.cn for another year looked like it was going to be denied by the Chinese government, who decided that simply redirecting all Google.cn users to an unfiltered search site in Hong Kong wasn't acceptable. Perhaps they found it a bit too clever and easy for Google.  Now Google has replaced the search box on Google.cn with a picture of a search box, which when clicked on takes the user to Google.hk.com  adding another click between a Chinese citizen and unfiltered search results. That seems to have satisfied the Chinese authorities -- and saved them some face -- at least for the time being. It's a testament to the power of Google that it can get away with what is really a shameless charade. The problem is neither side is totally committed to their stated positions. The whole thing started when Google got hacked, letting an intruder get to source code and information on Chinese human rights activists.  Out of anger and embarrassment -- and perhaps to change the subject --  Google blamed China for the hacking and said that it was no longer willing to censor its search results on Google.cn as it had been since 2006. Of course, Google could have tested the limits of its quasi-governmental power by simply shutting down Google.cn.  But the Chinese market is the largest in the world, and while Google may have the world's best search technology, that's not likely enough to break the spine of China's authoritarian rulers.  On the surface, it seems like China's government is in a perilous position, trying to run a free-market economy within a regime dedicated to censoring negative information. But the strategy is working well enough, clocking nearly 10 percent growth in GDP, even in the midst of one of the worst global recessions. But clearly, Google is loved by enough powerful people -- especially the growing middle and upper classes in China -- that China is willing to make some concessions, so long as they aren't perceived as kowtowing to a powerful U.S. corporation. Google also gets to continue keeping an engineering office in China, running an ad business, and offering a product and music search engine on Google.cn -- all ways to keep themselves from being exiled from a market that is destined to become a huge profit-maker for some search engine.  The new compromise does, however, hobble the company's ability to serve as the default search engine for online portals, Chinese web browsers and mobile phones -- which in the West has helped drive Google to its undeniable spot as the king of search engines. So the fake image of a search box oddly makes for a logical, if temporary, impasse. That's not tearing the Great Chinese firewall down, but it's actually a pretty big hole, even if both Google and China decide not to call it a hole. This kind of odd compromise is hardly unprecedented with the Chinese. Taiwan and China avoid war by both claiming to be the legitimate rulers of mainland China, a fiction that has persisted for more than 50 years, even as Taiwan is, in nearly all respects, its own country.  But if Taiwan ever does decide to publicly say it is its own country, that's ground for a Chinese invasion. So now we have a new fiction to add to that one. Google doesn't run an unfiltered search engine in China, even though Chinese users can use an unfiltered Google search engine by going to Google.cn and clicking a facsimile of a search box. Depending on where you stand, that's either a good thing for net freedom or a capitulation by Google. But that's the fiction that's been agreed upon.Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here!

 1,000 images per page on new Google search 
By  Tom Krazit | Filed under: Web     Google says image search users should see the changes in the next week. STORY HIGHLIGHTS New Google Images Search can show up to 1,000 images per page  About 10 percent of users have new version, others will be rolled out in the coming week
RELATED TOPICS


Google Inc.

Internet

 (CNET) -- Google took the wraps off a new look for Google Images Search on Tuesday, putting up to 1,000 images on the first results page and implementing a new image-based ad format. Google Images Search hadn't received a major update since 2001, said Marissa Mayer, vice president of search products and user experience, during a briefing for reporters at Google's San Francisco offices.  The new look is designed to reduce the number of clicks it takes to find the image you're looking for and to provide more information about a particular image without having to click through to the result. For basic searches such as "Yellowstone," Google Images Search will now return up to 1,000 images on a single page, using something called "infinite scroll" to navigate down the page looking for the right image.  The company also built a thumbnail preview that pops up when you hover over a given image with information such as the URL where it is located, said Ben Ling, director of search products at Google. Users of Microsoft's Bing Image Search will find the interface familiar. Bing also uses its version of an "infinite scroll" to let users scroll through images without clicking through any number of search results pages, and offers up some background information in a thumbnail preview. On the business end,Google announced that advertisers on Google Images Search pages will be able to insert an image into their text ads.  The idea is that such ads will be more relevant and catchy, hopefully enticing more users to click on those ads and generating more traffic for Google's advertisers and more revenue for the search company. Around 10 percent of Google Images Search users are seeing the new interface at the moment, and it will roll out for the rest of its users over the coming week © 2010 CBS Interactive Inc.

 For all its might, Google is no 'product-killer' 

By Dan Frommer, Business Insider | Filed under: Web     Despite its growth into many sectors of technology, Google rarely launches products that become market leaders. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Despite its growth into many sectors of technology, Google rarely launches "killer" products  Most Google products survive as middle-of-the-pack offerings or get spiked altogether  One recent big failure was Google's Nexus One mobile phone store, which closed this week  Arguably, the closest Google has come to a successful social site is YouTube

Nexus One

 (Business Insider) -- Google has invested billions of dollars building dozens of different products across a wide swath of the technology industry, from productivity tools to mobile phones to e-commerce. As a result, many tech companies large and small have to think about a "Google plan" -- what to do if Google suddenly gets into their line of business? It's the same way companies used to worry about Microsoft during the last tech boom. But it's surprisingly rare that any of these Google products actually end up as a "killer" or the market leader. In fact, since its inception, Google has only really developed one major "killer" product: Its original search engine, which blew past Yahoo years ago and currently dominates in the industry. Most other Google products wind up surviving as middle-of-the-pack offerings, or get spiked by Google altogether. One recent big failure was Google's Nexus One mobile phone store, which it launched in January to much fanfare, and closed this week. The idea was that Google was going to sell mobile phones -- based on its Google Android operating system -- on its website. This was supposed to compete with and disrupt wireless companies' local retail stores, where most people buy their cellphones. But it didn't work. Google sold very few phones, in part because they were so expensive, and in part because people still want to try phones out in person before committing to them for two years. Also because Google refused to advertise the Nexus One store on TV, one important place where people learn about mobile phones. Google, recognizing this failure, announced its plans to close the Nexus One store in May, and this week, Google ran out of phones. The company has similarly struggled to do anything involving social networking. Over the years, numerous Google attempts to buy or build "social" services have either flopped or fizzled. These include: - Dodgeball, an early version of Foursquare created by one of the Foursquare co-founders, which Google acquired in 2005, and shut down in 2009. - Jaiku, a Twitter-like service that Google bought in 2007 and stopped caring about in 2009. - Orkut, a Friendster-like service that Google commissioned, which was only a success in some markets like Brazil and India. - Lively, a Second Life-like "virtual world" that Google launched in 2008 and killed a few months later. - Latitude, a mobile/location-based social networking service that most people don't use and have never heard of. - Google Buzz, a poorly executed attempt earlier this year designed to turn Gmail into a social network, which also hasn't been much of a success. Google is now supposedly working on yet another social networking tool called "Google Me," which is reportedly some sort of Facebook competitor. Will it be a hit? Google certainly has the engineering talent, money, brand and user base to make social networking work, in theory. But in practice, it appears that "social" just isn't in Google's DNA -- it can't seem to make a service that's fun or useful enough for everyone to want to hang out there. Arguably, the closest Google has come to a successful social site is YouTube, which has succeeded in part because it still operates semi-autonomously, beyond the Googleplex. Other Google flops include Google Checkout, the PayPal killer that never killed PayPal; attempts at shaking up the newspaper and radio ad markets; Froogle, the shopping search engine; and Google Wave, an attempt to reinvent e-mail. Why does Google do all this stuff? In part, because it thinks that some of these products and services could evolve to be market leaders. In part, to disrupt others, such as Microsoft -- that's why Google is putting so much effort into Google Apps, Google Docs, Chrome, Chrome OS, Android, and other products that compete with Microsoft's Windows and Office juggernauts. And in part, because Google is an engineering-driven company that sometimes likes to create stuff for the sake of creating it. To be sure, many of Google's products are great and beloved. But it has certainly been a long time since Google built something that "killed" any other company's product.Copyright © 2011 Business Insider.

 'Google Alarm' plug-in tries to wake the world up to privacy issuesBy  Gillian Tee, CNN | Filed under: Web  Google and your privacySTORY HIGHLIGHTS "Google Alarm" alerts users when they visit a website that sends Google info  The browser plug-in was developed independently of Google  It runs on the Firefox and Internet Explorer Web browsers  Google says there are "less ear-splitting ways" to learn about privacy (CNN) -- The sound of the 'Google Alarm' is hard to miss.  Web users who install this browser plug-in hear a loud, buzzing noise whenever they visit a website that relays information to Google. It might seem intuitive that Google tracks the Web activity of users who search for things at Google.com. But what's less obvious is that unassuming Web users might have their browsing behavior tracked on other sites, too. Jamie Wilkinson, a technology entrepreneur unaffiliated with Google, created the 'Google Alarm' plug-in in an attempt to clear up any confusion. "I'm very interested in exploring privacy issues on the internet, and the collection of data through these tracking bugs that are installed all over the Web is normally a very silent experience," he said. "And so my hope is to make it something more visceral, and raise awareness about the issue." Wilkinson released the alarm plug-in on his website this week. The plug-in currently works on the Internet Explorer and Firefox Web browsers. It tracks information that is sent to Google Analytics -- a product that allows Web developers to gather statistics on site traffic and activity. Some metrics available through Google Analytics range from the number of visitors tracked over a duration of time to the amount of time people spend on a site. Google maintains that while it gathers data on the browsing habits of users who have installed the Analytics tool, it has made these actions clear. "We like to think there are less ear-splitting ways of being transparent with users, and that's why we've created tools like Google Dashboard which shows users what information they share with us, and provides direct links to control their personal settings and an opt-out for Google Analytics," said Brian Richardson, a Google spokesman. Google offers ways in which its users can navigate their online privacy, or "opt out" of having their information tracked by Google altogether.  According to Richardson, information provided to website owners through Google Analytics is completely anonymous and cannot be tied to an individual user. The opt-out option has been created such that if a user does not want the anonymous data sent directly to the website owner, a piece of software can be downloaded and installed on a computer, which would then discontinue sending information directly to Google servers. Google users can also make use of the Google Dashboard, which is a tool that shows users all the information associated with your Google account, and allows users to track the information that are stored on its servers. Users are also able to control their personal privacy settings through a number of links on the dashboard. Thousands of people seem to want a little help in navigating all of these choices, however, as more than 15,000 downloads of the Google Alarm plug-in were recorded in its first week on the Web, according to Wilkinson. "In my tests, I found that something like 70 to 85 percent of websites that I visit on a daily basis have some kind of Google tracking bug on them....I use Google analytics on all my websites," said Wilkinson.  "Despite the fact that you can install and look at your Google dashboard doesn't meant that people are aware that you can do these things." Another Google product, Google Street View, has sparked controversy over the past few months, where the company admitted to collecting personal Web activity of users on unsecured Wi-Fi networks from Street View vehicles, and is facing multiple lawsuits in the U.S. "We're working with governments to resolve issues relate to the Wi-Fi situation. We have been very up front and said that it was a complete mistake and we apologized for that situation. And we're now working with data protection authorities across the world to resolve any outstanding issues," said Richardson. Google maintains that user trust maintains its priority. But in a world where a company holds such large amounts of information, how much should an internet user trust Google? "Actually most users still do [trust us]....Privacy online is knowing what information you're sharing, being able to control that information, and who you share it with," said Richardson. "That's why all our products at Google -- the analytics opt-out browser, the dashboard, and so many other tools -- that you can find at our privacy center are built to provide that provide that level of choice and transparency so users can control their privacy online." It is now up to users to decide how much trust they place in Google.

Search Engines

 (CNN) -- Google has been working to make its web searches faster -- up to the point of guessing what you're searching for before you're finished typing with Google Instant. Now, they want to give you a peek at the web pages you find before you click on them. Instant Previews, being rolled out to users this week, will let you click on a magnifying glass icon at the top of a search result to see an image of the page before you choose it. Once you have clicked the icon, yout can then scroll down the list of search results, with images appearing as your mouse hovers over each result. A text box will show users where their search term appears on the page, so they can better decide whether it's a useful result, Google says. Watch a video explainer on Instant Previews "Instant Previews provides a graphic overview of a search result and highlights the most relevant sections, making finding the right page as quick and easy as flipping through a magazine," Google product manager Raj Krishnan wrote on Google's official blog. The world's most popular search engine, Google processes more than 80 billion searches a month. According to analytics company Experian, in September, Google was responsible for about 71 percent of all Web searches, followed by Yahoo with about 13.5 percent and Microsoft's Bing with just over 10 percent. According to Google, Instant Previews should be available in 40 languages in the next few days.

 Google unveils Hotpot, a recommendation engine for Places  

By Jolie O'Dell, Mashable | Filed under: Web   With Hotpot, users will be encouraged to rate and review businesses directly from their Google-linked profile. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Hotpot has a distinctly user-friendly UI that mirrors current trends in web app design  It presents high-impact data (star ratings and images) for each place in a grid format   Users can create a profile nickname to separate their Hotpot account from their general Google profiles

Yelp! Inc.

 (Mashable) -- Google has just taken the wraps off Hotpot, an early release of a location-based recommendation engine "powered by you and your friends." It's painfully obvious that location is one of the fastest-growing segments of the tech industry; Google has been iterating quickly in this area with improvements to Places, Images, Latitude and other services with location features.  Its newest foray into the world of location-based services is Hotpot. Hotpot takes all of Google Places' ratings and reviews features and adds a more personal touch. Currently, Place Pages mostly aggregate review data from sources such as Yelp.  With Hotpot, users will be encouraged to rate and review businesses directly from their Google-linked profile. Users' ratings and reviews are tracked with a counter at the top of each profile, and likes and dislikes are remembered and used in Google's recommendation engine. Unlike the just-the-facts, business-friendly interface of Places, Hotpot has a distinctly user-friendly UI that mirrors current trends in web app design.  In other words, it's aimed directly at average consumers, not web junkies who live to search. While Hotpot works well with Places data, its presentation is entirely fresh, both visually and functionally. It presents high-impact data (star ratings and images) for each place in a grid format without introducing too many details -- such as phone number or URL -- that might not be needed until the user decides to dig down another level or two. Another part of Hotpot is its social features. Users can create a profile nickname to separate their Hotpot account from their general Google profiles (the whole web can see the Places nickname, but only friends will see the linked Google profile and the user's real name).  Google uses Gmail accounts and linked Google profiles to help users find their friends. Friends' reviews and ratings will be visible, and users will get recommendations based on what their friends like. When you search for specific places, such as "sushi Berkeley," in Hotpot, you can filter your search results to see businesses or other places you haven't rated before; you can also choose to see only places that have been rated by your Hotpot friends.© 2013 MASHABLE.com.

 Why Google's data collection snafu could be good for GmailBy  Mark Milian, CNN | Filed under: Web   Unlike most other web-based e-mail services, Gmail uses a high-security protocol at all times. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Gmail has a security mechanism that helps prevent hackers from accessing passwords  Hotmail added such a security method as an option for users last week  Yahoo Mail doesn't provide the always-on security feature  (CNN) -- Google disclosed recently that its Street View project had inadvertently collected personal data, and the company has faced an onslaught of investigations from two U.S. federal agencies and several European governments. But in a strange irony, Google's blunder could reflect favorably on Gmail, the Mountain View, California, company's advertising-supported e-mail service. Google faces scrutiny, most recently from the Federal Communications Commission last week, for logging e-mails and passwords that its Street View cars found floating on unprotected Wi-Fi networks.  But had those people been using Gmail, their data probably would have been safe. Gmail is the only major Web-based e-mail client that uses a high-security standard, called Secure Sockets Layer, by default at all times. It's been doing so since January and has offered the feature in some capacity since it launched in 2004.

Last week, Microsoft added a full-session security option to Hotmail, its e-mail service. Customers of Hotmail, which research firm Compete says is the second-largest Web mail client in the U.S., can enable the security feature in their settings page. Most browsers note when a site is using security with an image that looks like a padlock, or with the string "https" preceding the Web address. Most banking websites use this security mechanism. Yahoo Mail, the largest in the U.S., only uses "https" during login and when users are manipulating settings in order to prevent usernames and passwords from being easily snatched by nearby hackers. Hotmail works the same way for those who haven't activated the always-on feature.  Similarly, Facebook and Twitter send login credentials over a secure line and then revert to an unsecure protocol. (Users of those social networks can add an "s" after "http" to force the systems to encrypt their browsing.) Social networking sites are where people increasingly conduct private conversations, whether through Facebook's Messages or Twitter's Direct Message feature. This common method encrypts usernames and passwords, but reverts to the normal Web protocol, HTTP, for everything else. That makes those messages vulnerable to interception by others on the same Wi-Fi network. When on a password-secure Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) point, messages sent to and from unprotected websites are safer, but not as safe as when sites enable security on their end, experts say. "With a little motivation and not much skill, it's fairly trivial to sniff HTTP traffic," said Alan Ross, the lead security analyst for Intel IT, noting there are free and easily attainable programs that can do just that. "Maybe I want to see all web traffic for Facebook because I want to see what the interesting person across the cafe is updating on Facebook," he said. Furthermore, someone can gain access to an e-mail or social network account using sniffing methods, without needing that person's password. Websites install a "cookie" file on a user's computer, which includes a unique string of letters and numbers that make up the session ID. When that file is sent over an unsecure connection, it can be intercepted and used to access an account. "Ideally, we'd like to see HTTPS enabled by just about every website," Ross said. "Don't use HTTP for anything that you don't want anyone else to see," he advised site operators. "That's what they should be doing," added Toby Kohlenberg, a senior security specialist for Intel IT. "But that's not what the majority of them are doing." Technology experts say implementing the secure protocol can slow page loading and put additional strains on corporate servers. A Google spokesman said the company figured out a way to do it without noticeably slowing the process. In addition to Gmail's always-on security, Google offers HTTPS for many of its apps, including a beta version of the search engine called Google with SSL.

 Google's computers want to dress youBy  John D. Sutter, CNN | Filed under: Web   Google has launched Boutiques.com, a site that includes pages devoted to the styles of female celebs such as Ashley Olsen. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Google launches a fashion site, Boutiques.com  The company's computers seek to learn your style and help you shop  Boutiques.com features only women's clothing for the moment  (CNN) -- What kind of turban would Ashley Olsen wear?  Google's computers know. And they desperately want to tell you. The search-engine company on Wednesday launched a fashion site -- Boutiques.com -- that aims to use algorithms to help the world's internet users dress a bit more awesomely. Among the features: a celebrity fashion guide and personal shopping profiles that help Google's computers learn your style over time, so the site can make recommendations about what you should wear. Users who click on Olsen's boutique store, for example, see a list of items that the former child star deems appropriate for the masses. People can shuffle through these items one by one, clicking a button to indicate if they "love" or "hate" the clothing.

If you see the $710 scarf-turned-turban on Olsen's head as speaking to your inner Michelle Tanner, for instance, then you can click "love" and other items with a certain Sahara chic will show up in your personal profile. Google explains the technology in a blog post: "Boutiques uses computer vision and machine learning technology to visually analyze your taste and match it to items you would like." "Computer vision." That sounds futuristic. But what does it mean? Google elaborates in listing some new features of the site. In one feature called "visual search," the computers analyze photos of clothing and sort it by color and type.  Then, applying a number of style rules (for example: "heavily patterned handbags don't tend to go with heavily patterned dresses"), Google can make recommendations about which items match and which would make "Project Runway's" Tim Gunn scowl. That feature is called "complete the look." Finally, Boutiques also learns about its users' likes and dislikes in a feature that could be appropriately labeled "celebrity-fashion death match" (although it's actually called "Create Your Boutique"). Users sort through pairs of celeb fashion photos, clicking on the one that's more their style. Shoppers also can tell the site the colors they favor as well as what cut of dress they tend to reach for and the "silhouettes you hate." The site includes pages devoted to the styles of female celebrities. Among them are both Olsen twins, the rapper Eve, Kelly Osbourne (daughter of Ozzy), Nicole Richie (daughter of Lionel), as well as trend-setters such as Carey Mulligan, the short-haired star of "An Education" and the "Wall Street" sequel, "Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps."  Overall, Google says it's trying to make shopping for clothes online as easy as it is to shop for gadgets. There are a number of sites and online features that compare specs on new computers and smartphones. Fashion is more difficult, writes Google's Munjal Shah, because it's more about an overall impression and style -- not specifications that go in a chart. "With fashion, reviews and specs are less important; fashion shopping is about discovering something that fits your taste and feels right," she writes. "The Web works well for buying cameras and other hard goods but for soft goods, such as clothing and accessories, it's not the same as shopping in a store." Google, of course, is not the first to try its hand at making the shopping mall work on the internet. TechCrunch's Leena Rao notes that the site is a combo of lots of other ideas that are floating around the realm of online shopping. "Boutiques.com melds the best of what Like.com had to offer within a fast Google search engine. Boutiques.com combines elements of shopping personalization engine Covet.com; street style social network Weardrobe, and visual styling tool Couturious," she writes, noting that Google purchased Like.com to create the new Boutiques site. Rao says the site is much improved from Google's old shopping site. "As an avid online shopper and someone who loves fashion, I have always found Google's product search to lack any sort of aesthetic appeal," she says. "Pictures are small, filters are too basic for power shopping and for the fashion-focused crowd; the overall design is unappealing." Boutiques.com only features women's clothing for the moment -- and most of it is pretty darn expensive. (Wal-Mart and Old Navy are not in its list of "designers.")  If you check it out, let us know what you think in the comments.

 Google wants you to eat Brussels sproutsBy  John D. Sutter, CNN | Filed under: Web   Google linked to Thanksgiving recipes on its homepage on Thursday. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Google transforms its homepage into a recipe list -- including Brussels sprouts  All the top 10 Google search trends were Thanksgiving-related Thursday morning
RELATED TOPICS


Google Inc.

Holidays

Food and Cooking

 (CNN) -- Looking for last-minute recipes? You won't have to search further than Google.com. The search engine turned its logo on Thursday into an interactive smorgasbord of Thanksgiving foods -- each of which links to a recipe. Among the choices are roasted Brussels sprouts, which isn't exactly an American favorite. The recipe comes from the TV chef Ina Garten, perhaps better known as the "Barefoot Contessa," and includes a bunch of salt and olive oil.  You could make these looked-down-upon veggies more delicious by turning to other websites, too. You could add bacon, as The Food Network's Rachael Ray suggests. Or go the southern route -- a la celebrity chef Paula Deen -- and pour in a cup of melted butter.  The other Google "doodle" recipes sound a little tastier. They include: roast turkey, smashed sweet potatoes, popovers, cranberry fruit conserve and a pumpkin banana mousee tart. It's clear that many people in the United States were turning to the internet for advice about food and Thanksgiving on Thursday morning. All of the top 10 "hot searches" on Google were focused on the holiday. Six of them were focused on cooking, with some of the popular searches including "butterball turkey cooking instructions" and "butterball turkey hotline." Last Thanksgiving, the New York Times used search data from Allrecipes.com to compile a fascinating look at regional cooking trends. Based on the foods people were searching for, it appears that few people in the northeast United States like pecan pie. Macaroni and cheese is a southern Thanksgiving dish. And pumpkin pie, which was the second most popular search term overall, is a hot dish in the Pacific northwest (although, you could serve it cold).   The San Francisco Chronicle noted that the Google recipes are hosted by that website -- so instead of linking out to recipes on cooking sites, Google keeps the Web traffic squarely on Google.com. "So, on Thanksgiving, Google is competing with every other recipe site on the web, and is once again, officially, a media company," the paper writes. For more on Thanksgiving and food, check out CNN's Eatocracy blog and CNN iReport, where you can share recipes and stories of your own.

 European Commission to investigate GoogleBy  the CNN Wire Staff | Filed under: Web     Google says it will cooperate with the EC investigation. STORY HIGHLIGHTSThe Commission is opening an anti-trust probeIt is looking into allegations Google abused its dominant positionOther search providers have complained about unfavorable treatmentGoogle says it will work with the Commission to address concerns
RELATED TOPICS


Google Inc.

 (CNN) -- The European Commission said Tuesday it will investigate whether Google abused its dominant position in online search in violation of European Union rules. Search service providers have complained about unfavorable treatment of their services in Google's unpaid and sponsored search results, along with an alleged preferential placement of Google's own services, the European Commission said. The decision to open an anti-trust investigation does not imply that the Commission has proof of any infringements, it said. Google responded by saying it will cooperate with the investigation. "Since we started Google, we have worked hard to do the right thing by our users and our industry -- ensuring that ads are always clearly marked, making it easy for users to take their data with them when they switch services and investing heavily in open source projects," a Google statement said. "But there's always going to be room for improvement, and so we'll be working with the Commission to address any concerns." Google provides two types of results when users search its site for information. The first are unpaid search results, often referred to as algorithmic results, and the second are third-party ads and sponsored links appearing at the top and right of the results page. The Commission said it will investigate whether Google lowered the ranking of unpaid search results of competing services -- such as price-comparison sites, also known as vertical-search services -- and gave preferential placement to the results of its own such services. Investigators will also look into allegations that Google lowered the "quality score" for sponsored links of competing vertical search services. The quality score is one of the factors determining the price advertisers must pay to Google. The quality score also influences the likelihood of an ad being displayed by Google and its ranking. If two advertisers are using the same key words, the one with a lower quality score will have to pay a higher price to rank at the same place. The Commission will also look at whether Google imposes exclusivity obligations on advertising partners -- preventing them from placing certain types of competing ads on their own websites and on computer and software vendors' sites, with the aim of shutting out competing search tools. The probe will last as long as it takes to complete the investigation, the Commission said.

BRAINSTORM


Going deeper than Google
Software called Grokker could be the future of search

(FORTUNE.COM) -- Loyal readers may remember my passionate enthusiasm a year ago upon the release of a new Web search product called Grokker (Making online searches more useful).


This software tool takes the data culled by an online search and organizes it visually into categories that enable you to quickly dig deeply to find the exact site or information you need. Grokker broke new ground, but later ran out of gas when the Northern Lights search engine, on which it was based, went out of business.


Now Grokker is back as a smarter and less expensive ($49 instead of $99) application that works on top of many different databases, including the all-important Google. I'm as excited this time as I was a year ago. This really could be the future for finding information.


The new Grokker was released Monday by startup Groxis. It makes me wonder if Google really does have search as sewed up as we often assume. When you use Grokker you realize just how brain dead even the best search tools are today.


Grokker is not a Web service but an application that sits on your PC. (A Mac OS X version should be ready in about four weeks, say executives.)


Grokker takes the raw output of a search and organizes it into categories and subcategories. Groxis has put more intelligence into the software this time, so it is not dependent, as it was with Northern Lights, on categories established by others. This means that a wide variety of types of databases can be Grokked-now Grokker can search with six different engines simultaneously -- Yahoo, MSN, Alta Vista, Fast, Teoma, and WiseNet.


It also can organize searches for products on Amazon or for files on your own desktop. Google capability is coming within weeks, Groxis says, as a separate software component that users will add. Soon you will also be able to use it in conjunction with AskJeeves, eBay, social networks like Linkedin, and job site Monster.


Grokker creates a visual representation of a search. When you type in, say, "nanotechnology," Grokker starts organizing data from the multiple search engines. You see a big circle, within which are smaller circles with labels including "conference," "technology," "science," "research," "reports," "news," "molecular," "material," and so on. Each represents a subset of data on nanotechnology.


Click on, say, "molecular," and that circle will enlarge so you can see several further subcircles, one of which is "molecular assemblies." Click on that, and another category becomes visible entitled "molecular assembly sequencing software."


Now you could, in theory, have typed that exact phrase into Google and gotten to the same Web sites. However, in many cases you can't be sure what you're looking for because you simply don't know what's out there. Grokker gives you an easy way to delve into a data set, and it often leads to info-revelations.


For example, a Grokker search of the Amazon database, also using the initial term "nanotechnology," included a category circle labeled "children's books." I would not have predicted that children's books on nanotech existed. But a few further clicks reveal a book entitled "Nanotechnology: Invisible Machines," for 9-12 year-olds, as well as -- even more unexpectedly -- "Submarines and Underwater Exploration," for kids 4-8. If you didn't know to look for it you'd never have found it, most likely.


A search using Amazon's own onsite search tool, in which I asked for books for 4-8 year-olds related to the subject of nanotechnology, found no matches.


Says R.J. Pittman, CEO of Groxis: "Google has indexed several billion pages, but there are between 550 and 600 billion in total on what's referred to as the invisible Web or deep Web. Within a year Grokker will have ten times the reach of Google in terms of available Web pages."


Adds Paul Hawken, the environmentalist and entrepreneur who is chairman of Groxis: "Google can't do it because their technology is based on lists." Hawken came up with the idea for Grokker a couple of years ago when he grew frustrated with the difficulty of finding information about environmental issues. He hooked up with some ace programmers and Grokker is the result.


Groxis may get traction first in the education market. Both the Los Angeles and Chicago school districts have already taken trial licenses to see whether Grokker would be useful for their students. The University of Nevada bought a license for 500 seats, and is putting Grokker in campus computer labs.


The real competition for Grokker is the amazing ability of Google and other search engines to place at the top of a thousand-site list just the one you were looking for. If you're good at stipulating the terms for a Google search you may find Grokker unnecessary. When I used the inferior predecessor I found that there was no reason to use Grokker for the vast majority of searches.


But for some very important projects -- like finding a certain type of real estate broker in a specific region -- it was incomparable. I was able to find a broker in minutes with Grokker that had been completely absent from my Google searches.


In the most personally gratifying moment of the demonstration CEO Pittman gave me last week, he typed in "David Kirkpatrick." There inside the big circle were two other circles representing me and my work at FORTUNE. A smaller circle was labeled "New York Times." That's where a much younger (and very talented) business journalist of the same name writes. Since I've been writing for more than a decade longer than the other DK, it's nice that Grokker figured that out.


Grokker can be downloaded for $49, or you can get a 30-day free trial, at Groxis.com.

SAN FRANCISCO, California (Reuters) -- Google Inc., which dominates the market for Web search, is developing a service that could dramatically extend the reach of its lucrative keyword-based advertising by linking such ads to e-mail, people familiar with the matter said on Friday.


Privately held Google, which is expected to go public later this year, faces rising competition in its core search business from e-mail providers including Yahoo Inc. and MSN, Microsoft Corp.'s Internet unit.


Adding an e-mail service would provide a potential boost to Google as its technology lead in the search market seems destined to narrow and it prepares to answer to growth-hungry shareholders, analysts said.


The Mountain View, California, company, which has recently made several e-mail related acquisitions, is working on a way to serve advertising to an e-mail at the moment it is opened, people close to the company said.


"I'm sure Google is getting more and more concerned about locking in users. It wouldn't surprise me if they did something very sophisticated with e-mail," said Danny Sullivan, editor of SearchEngineWatch.com, who tracks the industry.


By moving into e-mail -- the Web's most-used program -- Google would open up a huge new market for its lucrative "sponsored links" advertising business that delivers ads tied to keywords in Web searches or on content pages, analysts said.


Offering its own branded e-mail -- whether for free or with enhanced services like spam filtering -- would also enable Google to tie users more closely to its search site and to steal customers from rivals, they said.


In an e-mail response to questions from Reuters, spokesman David Krane said, "Google has a number of projects in the works to test monetization in various scenarios.


"In fact, Google's AdSense contextual ads are already used in a number of e-mail newsletters," he said.

Going portal?

Google has for years said it would not turn its site into a full-service Internet portal like Yahoo or MSN. However, since it opened in 1998, Google has added portal-style discussion groups and is testing a comparison shopping site called Froogle, as well as a news site.


Google late last year purchased rival Sprinks, which had technology to deliver ads to e-mail as the messages were opened. Such real-time ad serving is important because it keeps ads fresh and insures that Google will not be giving away free ads or delivering ads nobody will see, industry participants said.


Kanoodle, a small privately held search company, in the coming weeks will roll out its own e-mail advertising product as part of its deal with CBS MarketWatch.com, said Lance Podell, Kanoodle's president of search and content.


Under that deal, "sponsored link" ads will be served to MarketWatch's opt-in subscriber e-mails, including newsletters.

Experience with sponsored links

Google already knows how to deliver its sponsored link ads -- which are in the form of Web links and appear on the perimeter of Web pages -- to e-mail newsletters and content sites.


Furthermore, Google last year purchased an e-mail management software maker and in 2001 registered the domain name googlemail.com.


Some in Silicon Valley also believe Google could be preparing to launch free e-mail to compete with offerings from Yahoo and MSN's Hotmail.


"If they were to go the e-mail route they'd have to provide an offering that competes with free [e-mail]. Anti-spam is one form of strong differentiation," said Jim Pitkow, chief executive of Moreover Technologies, whose personalized search company Outride was acquired by Google in 2001.

(CNN) -- Internet search engine Google has rolled out a China-based version of its popular Web site -- one that bows to Beijing's censorship laws and will edit the content of its results.Google.cn -- the Chinese language version of the search portal -- debuted Wednesday with the company acknowledging the balancing act it was attempting to perform."In order to operate from China, we have removed some content from the search results available on Google.cn, in response to local law, regulation or policy," a Google statement said."While removing search results is inconsistent with Google's mission, providing no information (or a heavily degraded user experience that amounts to no information) is more inconsistent with our mission."Google said it intends to report to users when information is removed from search results. The company says it does the same thing in response to local laws in Germany, France and the United States.Prior to Wednesday's debut in China, Google operated the Chinese-language version of the search engine through a link on its U.S. Web site, Google.com.Previously, the Beijing government blocked the results of search requests that violated its regulations. The new Google site will self-censor based on Chinese law.The Google statement said the tradeoff for going against its basic principle of making the "world's information universally available and accessible" is gaining greater access to a quickly growing Chinese economy."As an emerging economic powerhouse, China is developing rapidly, thanks in no small measure to the Internet," Google said. "We firmly believe, with our culture of innovation, Google can make meaningful and positive contributions to the already impressive pace of development in China."Google's cooperation with the Chinese government comes on the heels of the company's resistance to a U.S. Justice Department subpoena, asking Google to turn over a week's worth of search results.The request is part of a case designed to protect children from Internet porn.Google said the government query "overreaches."

  Google's unknown artist has huge followingBy  David E. Williams CNN

(CNN) -- Dennis Hwang may be the most famous unknown artist in the world -- his work doesn't hang in galleries or museums, but it's been viewed hundreds of millions of times.The 28-year-old webmaster designs the whimsical logos that decorate Google.com's otherwise Spartan Web site on special occasions."It's always a fun kind of challenge to incorporate the logo into the design. Over the years, just because I kind of push myself to use different types of design if I can," Hwang said. (Have a look at Hwangs's Google logos)He has been manipulating the six letters in the Google name into shamrocks, fireworks, hearts and goblins since shortly after he got an internship there in 2000. Company founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin found out that he was an art major in college."They said 'Hey Dennis, why don't you give this a shot,' and I've been doing it ever since," he said.Now he's in charge of all Google's webmasters, and designing the logos is only about 20 percent of his job -- but that doesn't mean it's not a lot of work. Hwang said he had to do a string of all-nighters after he had what he called his "brilliant" idea to do individual designs for each of the 32 teams in this year's World Cup soccer tournament.The logos link to Google search results about the topic, which can drive a lot of traffic to unsuspecting sites."Sometimes we unfortunately take some sites down, so we have to cycle through different search queries midday," he said. "But, yeah, it's kind of the fun aspect of it that users can do more research about a topic or find out more about it on their own if they're not as familiar about what we're recognizing."John Malyon, president of the online art guide Artcyclopedia.com, said his site got a huge surge in traffic in April when Google featured Spanish surrealist painter Joan Miro. He said he got tens of thousands of extra clicks."It didn't cause any server problems or anything.  It just took me a while to track down what was happening," Malyon said. "You sort of come in, you turn on your server and look at your stats and they're wildly inflated, so you then have to do some detective work."Malyon said most of the traffic appeared to be "curiosity clicks" -- people who were more interested in the logo than in the artist's work. He said the surge probably didn't help his business much, but he appreciated the interest."I'm quite happy, and every webmaster in the world is happy to have as many people as possible see their babies, but it's not the most targeted traffic in the world," he said.Hwang said users e-mail from all over the world to praise the designs or petition for new ones.Hwang said they did a logo for the Persian New Year after a huge online campaign and that the National Library Day design was very popular."That one was a huge hit among librarians across the whole country," he said. They even sent me library-related cool toys and hats things like that. One was even a librarian action figure with 'shushing action' so that was really funny."He said he meets a few times a year with a small group of Google staffers to decide which events to cover."We talk about interesting holidays that are coming up, or various international holidays or any current events or news events that we think are cool and geeky or 'Google-y' in some sense and then we just sort of give it a go," he said.Hwang said his favorite was the birthday series honoring Michelangelo, Picasso, Van Gogh and other famous artists."Having been a student of art history for a long time those are a little bit more personal," Hwang said. "Of course, trying to mimic the style of a master is always difficult and humbling, so it does take a lot more time to do those, but it's also a lot more fun."But, like any proud parent, he would not say which one was his favorite."If you had me picking just one, I don't think I could.  They're just all kind of special in their own little way."

  Google Earth maps out Darfur atrocities





 Story Highlights• Google Earth highlights atrocities in Darfur region of Sudan • Google official: Tool can be "catalyst for education and action" • Google Earth has 200 million users • Official: Technology will make it harder to ignore genocide By  Elise Labott CNN  Adjust font size:

 WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- If you Google the word Darfur, you will find about 13 million references to the atrocities in the western Darfur region of Sudan -- what the United States has said is this century's first genocide.As of today, when the 200 million users of Google Earth log onto the site, they will be able to view the horrific details of what's happening in Darfur for themselves.In an effort to bring more attention to the ongoing crisis in Darfur, the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum has teamed up with Google's mapping service literally to map out the carnage in the Darfur region.Experts estimate that 200,000 people have been killed and 2.5 million more have been displaced since the conflict flared in 2003, when rebels took up arms against the central Sudanese government.The new initiative, called "Crisis in Darfur," enables Google Earth users to visualize the details in the region, including the destruction of villages and the location of displaced persons in refugee camps. (Interactive: See how the new technology works)Elliot Schrage, Google's vice president of global communications and public affairs, joined museum director Sara J. Bloomfield to make the official announcement about the new feature. "At Google, we believe technology can be a catalyst for education and action,"  Schrage said. " 'Crisis in Darfur' will enable Google Earth users to visualize and learn about the destruction in Darfur as never before and join the museum's efforts in responding to this continuing international catastrophe."The Google Earth mapping service combines 3-D satellite imagery, aerial and ground-level maps and the power of Google, one of the Internet's most widely used search engines, to make the world's geographic information user friendly. Since its inception in June 2005, nearly 200 million people have downloaded the free program.Using the high-resolution imagery of Google Earth, users will be able to zoom into the Darfur region for a better understanding of the scope of the destruction. (Interactive: See where Darfur is located)More than 1,600 damaged and destroyed villages will be visible, as will the remnants of more than 100,000 homes, schools, mosques and other structures destroyed by the Janjaweed militia and Sudanese forces.The Holocaust museum also has compiled a collection of photos, data and eyewitness testimony from its archives and number of sources, including the U.S. State Department, nongovernmental organizations, the United Nations and individual photographers. That material also will be available when Google Earth users visit the Darfur site.The "Crisis in Darfur" initiative is the first of what is expected to be several collaborations between the museum and Google Earth to highlight the dangers of genocide around the world. The museum also announced Tuesday the creation of a mapping project with Google Earth on the Holocaust, when Nazis killed 6 million Jews during World War II. That project will use Google Earth to map key Holocaust sites, such as Auschwitz, Dachau, Bergen-Belsen, Treblinka, Warsaw and Lodz with historic content from its collections to illustrate the enormous scope and impact of the Holocaust. Each place links to a featured article with related historical photographs, testimony clips, maps, artifacts and film footage."Educating today's generation about the atrocities of the past and present can be enhanced by technologies such as Google Earth," Bloomfield said. "When it comes to responding to genocide, the world's record is terrible. We hope this important initiative with Google will make it that much harder for the world to ignore those who need us the most."

   Getting to grips with Google EarthStory Highlights Innovative ways to navigate Google Earth and make experience more 'tangible'  Part of trend that puts consumer electronics to unexpected new uses  Adapted devices like Wii Balance Board interest museums, hospitals and offices Next Article in Technology »   By  Steve Mollman For CNN 



 


 

  (CNN) -- In the second Fantastic Four movie, a character called the Silver Surfer glides effortlessly over the Earth's terrain on a gleaming trans-galactic surfboard.  
Reaching out to the world: LM3LABS' floating holographic globe. 
 Less well-traveled beings, in the form of researchers in Germany, are now doing something similar, only using Google Earth and the Wii Balance Board.  In their project, users stand on the board, which is placed before a large-screen projection of Google Earth.  To move forward or to the side, users simply lean on the board in the corresponding direction. The sensation, say the researchers, is indeed like being the Silver Surfer on his ride.  The Balance Board, of course, was never intended for this use. It's sold by Nintendo as an accessory for the Wii console and used in skiing, fitness and other video games.  But for the researchers, the board is simply another interesting low-cost input device for enabling new user interactions, says Matthieu Deru.    Deru and his partner, Simon Bergweiler, work at the Advanced Tangible Interface Lab at the German Research Center for Artificial Intelligence. They do all kinds of intriguing research there, but this particular project involves analyzing and interpreting the data of the Wii Balance Board and making the results usable.  The project is part of a broader trend: Innovative consumer hits, like the iPhone, Google Earth, Second Life, and the Wii remotes and accessories, are increasingly put to unexpected -- and often unauthorized -- uses by outside researchers and tinkerers.  Sometimes the experimenters combine these products. There's no shortage of examples.  The Wiimote has been put to dozens of quirky uses, from corporate training programs in Second Life to turning the human body into a musical instrument.  Such experiments will likely increase in number after Nintendo releases its upcoming MotionPlus add-on adaptor, which will help the Wiimote detect an even greater range of motions (think sword play).  The German duo are also working on an intelligent touch-screen terminal for iPhones. Place the latter on the kiosk and the phone's media files are displayed on the terminal screen. Users can then use gestures to, say, rotate or scale pictures.  Meanwhile Google Earth, though it works just fine with a regular mouse and keyboard, cries out for experimenters to devise cooler navigation techniques. After all, zooming and zipping around the planet deserves more than the same tools used for opening and closing windows.  The cry was answered partly by a new breed of mouse made specifically for navigating virtual worlds. 3D Connexion's SpaceNavigator, for instance, features a knob you can push in any direction to fly around, with your speed depending on how hard you push.    But more interesting, if less accessible, ideas have cropped up. A startup called LM3LABS, based in Tokyo and France, has created a large, floating holographic version of Google Earth whereby users can "spin" the ghostly globe and use gestures to zoom in and out on it.  Founder Nicolas Loeillot describes the experience as being far more rich and "tangible" (despite the lack of touch) than the desktop experience. Stereo vision is used to track the finger in the air.  The company is working on something similar for computers, so you can, say, point and click your way around the screen without touching anything.  Museums are interested in the globe, says Loeillot, because no learning is required: "Customers want slick and invisible technologies."  The globe set-up is not priced for consumers, though.

   For Deru and Bergweiler, surfing came to mind for Google Earth once the Wii board went on sale in Europe. But after posting a video of their project online, the feedback they received made them realize their idea was merely a springboard.  Hospitals expressed an interest in the board as a rehabilitation device, where patients could do balance training after an injury.  And game ideas, of course, blossomed. Could a first-person shooter incorporate the board? A surf game?  In a popular PC-based skate-boarding game, the German duo have used the board for a "jump" feature. They've incorporated it into World of Warcraft, too, as well as Second Life.  With a semi-circular screen and 3D glasses, they note, users could be completely immersed in the virtual worlds they're surfing through.  They've also looked into putting the board to more mundane uses, such as under a desk to, say, let users scroll back and forth through a Word or PDF document. That way users wouldn't have to lean forward or reach for the keyboard to do something basic, like go to the next page.  Ergonomics specialists take note. Many a sufferer of carpal tunnel syndrome have wished for just such a feature.  What do companies like Nintendo, Apple and Google think about outside researchers taking their products in unexpected directions?  In a way, it doesn't matter. These days any company that puts out an innovative, low-cost product has to realize that once it leaves the store shelves or is downloaded, it becomes a potential new tool for tinkerers.  But whatever their official line -- frowning upon or encouraging this experimentation -- companies are well-advised to keep an eye on what the independent researchers are up to.  For the German researchers, a certain satisfaction can be had in simply knowing their project has spurred further experiments that will likely lead to yet others.  "We are pretty sure this will give new interaction ideas we have never thought about" says Deru. "That's one interesting part of our research."

 Google strengthens news content wallsBy  Kevin Voigt      Google has given news publishers more options to limit access to free news stories. STORY HIGHLIGHTSGoogle has updated options to help news organizations limit accessAllow spublishers to limit users to no more than five page views per day without subscriptionComes as Microsoft has entered talks with publishers to list on rival search engine, Bing
RELATED TOPICS


Google Inc.

Rupert Murdoch

News Corporation Ltd.

 (CNN) -- In a nod to the growing debate on free access to news stories on the Web, Google has updated options to help news organizations limit access. The move comes after revelations that Microsoft has been in talks with Rupert Murdoch's News Corp and other publishers to de-list from Google in return for payments to index on the company's rival search engine, Bing. In recent months, Murdoch has repeatedly threatened to pull his company's news Web sites -- which include the Wall Street Journal, the Times of London and the Australian -- from Google and put company sites that are currently free behind a pay wall. Google has updated a program on Google Search to allow publishers to limit users to no more than five page views per day without registering or subscribing to the news site. "If you're a Google user, this means that you may start to see a registration page after you've clicked through to more than five articles on the Web site," wrote Josh Cohen, senior business product manager, on Google News Blog on Tuesday. 



Video: No News Corp stories on Google?


In addition, Google is now allowing story headlines and first paragraphs on preview pages that publishers make available, which will be labeled as "subscription" in Google News. "As newspapers consider charging for access to their online content, some publishers have asked: Should we put up pay walls or keep our articles in Google News and Google Search?" Cohen wrote. "In fact, they can do both -- the two aren't mutually exclusive." Murdoch and other newspaper publishers have complained that Google is profiting unfairly from their content while many newspapers are struggling to survive.

   Why the ocean matters . . . to GoogleStory Highlights Imaging the ocean depths via the new Google Earth 5.0 is a smart move for Google  It adds to the overall utility of the software, which in the long run keeps it relevant  Ocean researchers attended Google's launch and are eager to display their data  Eventually, Google wants to provide data on "every single location" on Earth  Next Article in Technology »   By Stephen Shankland 



 


 

 
 SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNET) -- The fact that you now can explore the ocean through Google Earth isn't going to make Google much money directly. But the move is nonetheless smart. 
The new Google Earth 5.0 software allows users to explore the ocean depths from their computers. 
 Google generated early-stage goodwill from being the best answer to the online search problem. But the company is large and getting larger, especially as it shows a better ability to withstand the recession than rivals, and that goodwill won't last forever. Google Earth, though, gives the company a new way to bring its brand to the world, notably with students for whom the software will help supplant atlases and encyclopedias.  And in the long run, as Google Earth and Maps -- either as standalone software or used through a browser -- will likely become a widely used virtual window on the real world. Google will control the technology and commercialization of that portal. Will the visibility of the ocean depths on Google Earth make money directly? Not likely. But it adds incrementally to the overall utility of the software, which in the long run keeps it relevant. "The near-term opportunity is in local search," for example people looking for restaurants or hotels, said John Hanke, director of Google Earth and Maps, in an interview.

 Google has begun experimenting with advertisements on Google Maps and Google Earth, added Peter Birch, product manager of Google Earth, at the launch event.  Since people often need to discover information about a place before going there, Google Earth and Maps could prove a lucrative endeavor. It may take years to get there, and it'll cost Google dearly in server hardware and network bandwidth, but Google has shown patience in subsidizing long-term projects. Though Hanke wouldn't reveal the expense of Google's geographic services, some of the economics are in the company's favor. Just as Google's search engine takes advantage of innumerable information that others put on the Internet, Google Earth is a platform that houses information supplied by outsiders that Google doesn't have to pay. It's the Internet's user-generated content story, but this time it's data that can be overlaid on a map of the Earth. And in the case of the ocean work, there are prestigious users generating high-quality content. Many ocean researchers gathered at the Google Earth 5.0 launch, and several showed there's pent-up demand for a way to conveniently display their data somewhere. And it's not just to share sea surface temperature data with fellow Ph.D.s, but also to try to educate the public. Ken Peterson, communications director for the Monterey Bay Aquarium, was excited about his layer in Google Earth that shows the location of various types of fish -- along with ratings for people about whether they should eat those varieties or substitute others.  Barbara Block of Stanford University and Patrick Halpin of Duke University were eager to show the tracks of shark travels recorded by radio transmission to satellites. Ross Swick of the University of Colorado-Boulder showed a Google Earth animation of the gradually shrinking Arctic ice cap over the last 29 years.  And Philip Renaud of the Living Oceans Foundation has supplied underwater video of the Red Sea as part of the foundation's mission to chronicle the state of coral reefs. Hanke envisions much broader information, though, including consumer-oriented material such as the best dive spots and kite-surfing areas. Ultimately, he wants "every single location" on Earth, land or sea, to have information. "We're trying to encourage our users to annotate all the places in the world. Part of what we're doing is seeding that ecosystem of spatial information," Hanke said.  "That creates an opportunity for Google to provide location services on phones, mobile devices, in cars in the future, to guide people to the best places. Being a valued guide, the go-to source of information about the best places to go -- that will be a powerful and valuable thing for Google." Think of it as a second Internet in a way, only instead of using abstract names to locate information, you can use actual locations to locate information. Some refer to the idea as the "geographic Web." The clearest illustration of the indirect benefits Google Earth can bring is the fact that the company could persuade former Vice President Al Gore, whose climate change documentary won him an Oscar and a Nobel Peace Prize, to bear the Google Earth standard. In effect, he provided an eco-halo that can offset the more down-to-earth capitalistic realities of Google's operation. Google seems to share the altruistic, educational motivations of many researchers. But it's also got business in mind with Google Earth. "We try to create products people love to use," Birch said. "We create value, then think of appropriate ways of monetization."

  No need to Google 'Engelberth' -- she'll be on the home pageStory Highlights San Antonio, Texas, 12-year-old wins "Doodle for Google" national contest  Christin Engelberth's work will grace Google's main site for 24 hours Thursday  Other prizes: $25,000 college scholarship, laptop, tech grant for her school  When she grows up, she said, she hopes to do "anything to do with art" Next Article in Technology »   By Emily Anderson CNN 



 


 

  NEW YORK (CNN) -- One of the perks of using search engine Google's home page is checking out the frequently changing seasonal, current-event, and holiday-inspired "doodles" used for the logo.  
Christin Engelberth's "doodle" beat out more than 28,000 entries in Google's annual contest. 
 Soon the work of 12-year-old Christin Engelberth will occupy the Google spotlight to be viewed by millions of online searchers worldwide. On Wednesday, Google announced that Christin, a sixth-grader at Bernard Harris Middle School in San Antonio, Texas, is this year's winner of "Doodle 4 Google," a yearly competition that asks K-12 students to dream up their own variation of the logo. Her work will be featured on Google's main site for 24 hours on Thursday. The theme of this year's contest was "What I Wish for the World."   "Both our country and the world are undergoing significant change," Google said on the contest's Web pages. At Google we believe in thinking big, and dreaming big, and we can't think of anything more important than encouraging students to do the same." "A New Beginning," the title of Christin's doodle, depicts the Google logo as a land and sea naturescape intertwined with trees, a frog and leaping dolphin, a curious lizard, a turtle and fish, and a butterfly set against an orange and yellow background with a rising sun represented by the second "O" in "Google." In an interview with CNN, Christin said she portrayed a dawn as a symbol of a new day. Her wish was that "out of the current crisis, discoveries will be found to help the Earth prosper once more." She added that wanted to portray a brighter tomorrow and "discoveries being made lead to a better Earth for everyone." Christin said her initial idea for a doodle was for animal conservation, but then she decided "it shouldn't just include animals; it should include the rest of the world."

 Christin did check out her competition, and said she thought the other doodles were "much better than mine." But a panel of independent judges and Google employees, along with close to 6 million online voters, disagreed, and chose her sketch as the overall winner from a field of over 28,000 other submissions. Google's Marissa Mayer, vice president of search products and user experience, and Dennis Hwang, webmaster manager, said on the Google Blog that Christin's design was part of "a very creative pool of doodles." As the national winner, Christin will receive a $15,000 college scholarship, a laptop, and a $25,000 technology grant for her school, in addition to having her artwork featured on the Google site. She was presented with her award at the Smithsonian's Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in New York City, where Google also unveiled an exhibit of the top doodles. They will be on display until July 5. National finalists also were selected in three grade groups. Each will receive a laptop computer. All winners were treated to a day in New York that Google said "included activities which promote peace, sustainability and wellness -- all inspired by this year's theme." The winners also will participate in a doodling class led by Dennis Hwang and the Google doodle team. Grand prize winner Christin -- who told CNN she was excited to visit New York City -- said she's been "drawing for as long as she can remember."   When she grows up, she said, she hopes to do "anything to do with art."

  Google: Web and browsers will lead app development Story Highlights Google shows developers how future Web applications will mimic desktop apps  Eric Schmidt: "It's time for us to take advantage of [this] amazing opportunity"  Google CEO speaks to about 4,000 at Google developers conference  The Internet and browsers may be future foundation for app development  Next Article in Technology »   By Tom Krazit 



 


 

 
 SAN FRANCISCO, California (CNET) -- Google spent Wednesday morning trying to get developers excited about the next generation of Web technologies by showing off how future Web applications will mimic desktop apps. 
"It's time for us to take advantage of [this]. . .amazing opportunity," Google's Eric Schmidt told developers. 
 "It's time for us to take advantage of the amazing opportunity that is before us," said Google CEO Eric Schmidt, kicking off Google I/O 2009 in San Francisco. Schmidt was referring to the growing sense that the Internet and browsers--rather than a computer's operating system--will be the future foundation for application development. The industry isn't quite ready for that yet. Many of applications demonstrated before the crowd of around 4,000 developers will require the widespread adoption of HTML 5 technologies, which are still under development by a consortium of companies and organizations. Still, Google's Vic Gundotra, vice president of engineering, noted that the four modern open standards browsers (Firefox, Safari, Chrome,and Opera) are all adopting some HTML 5 technologies as they become more stable, taking every opportunity possible to ding Microsoft's Internet Explorer for lagging behind the other four browsers. However, offstage after his keynote, Gundotra downplayed any conflict with Microsoft, noting that its task in moving toward HTML 5 is more complex because of the large number of enterprises running Internet Explorer, and the possibility that internal applications developed for that browser could break. "As they follow through, they are going to have a huge impact on moving the Web forward," he said. Gundotra showed off how Web applications will be able to take advantage of five main HTML 5 concepts: canvas tags, video tags, geolocation, application caching and database, and Web Workers.

 For example, canvas tags help developers bring all kinds of sophisticated graphics to their Web applications without having to use a plug-in--which is also the appeal of the video tag. Google showed off an "experiment" with YouTube videos coded using the video tags, which gives developers quite a few more options when it comes to how those videos can be embedded into a Web page. Geolocation is another huge topic of late with mobile applications. Google showed off how its Google Latitude application takes advantage of a new iPhone geolocation API that Apple will release as part of the iPhone 3.0 software to run in the mobile Safari browser. Mozilla's Jay Sullivan also showed off how Firefox 3.5 will come with a button that allows the browser to pinpoint your location in Google Maps using Wi-Fi and cell tower positioning data. In a briefing session following the keynote, Google's Matthew Papakipos, engineering director, said Google has various aspects of the HTML 5 capabilities demonstrated Wednesday in different parts of the development process. For example, the canvas tags that allow for richer graphics are present in Chrome 2.0, which is currently available, but others, such as the video tags, are farther away from reaching the world. Mozilla plans to support all the HTML 5 technologies demonstrated Wednesday with the release of Firefox 3.5, Sullivan said. That is expected to arrive fairly soon. One interesting question, perhaps saved for another day, concerned how, or if, Google plans to index the coming wave of Web applications as part of its search efforts. Attempting to index these rich applications at the moment presents quite a "challenge" for search bots trying to figure out how to categorize the content within an application. "Content won't be a problem, but how do you index Gmail? Should you index Gmail?" Gundotra pondered.

  Google takes on Windows with Chrome OSStory Highlights Google says it will release a computer operating system in fall or early 2010  Google's Chrome OS could change the way personal computers work  The system is touted as faster and more Web-friendly than Windows  It supports cloud computing and will be available as open-source technology Next Article in Technology »   By  John D. Sutter  CNN 



 


 

  (CNN) -- Google is jumping into Microsoft Windows territory -- and threatening to change the way personal computers work -- with its own version of a computer operating system. 
Google's operating system will augment its Web browser, which is also called Chrome. 
 The company says the forthcoming Google Chrome OS will revolutionize how computers operate, putting more emphasis on Web functionality, making computers faster and opening them up to helpful tinkering by outside program developers. "The operating systems that browsers run on were designed in an era where there was no web," Google said late Tuesday on its official blog. "It's our attempt to re-think what operating systems should be."   Chrome OS will be available to consumers in the second half of 2010, Google says. But why should you care?    A trim and speedy Google operating system, which has been buzzed about online for some time, is interesting for several reasons -- even if you think it could flop out of the gate. iReport: What do you think about Google's Chrome OS? The first is that Chrome OS will be available as "open-source" technology. That means software developers will be able to mess with the code behind the system, allowing them to develop new applications for it. In essence, it puts the users in control.

Commentary: Google and Microsoft free-for-all


Google: Web and browsers will lead app development


New search engines aspire to supplement Google


 This wisdom-of-the-masses philosophy flies right in the face of Microsoft Windows, which keeps its code locked away.   The open-source nature of Chrome OS also has led to some speculation that the software will be free, as many open-source platforms are. Google Inc., based in Mountain View, California, hasn't commented on price as of yet, although most of its services, such as Gmail and Picasa, are free. Second, Google's operating system supports another buzz term in the tech world: cloud computing. That phrase means a bunch of things to different people, but it essentially refers to the idea that a lot of computing can be done through Internet servers instead of on the computer that's sitting in front of you. Cloud computing, in part, is behind the rise in netbooks -- small laptops that are essentially portals of entry into the much greater vat of information, storage space and computing power that exists "in the cloud." Google's blog says its OS will be designed specifically to work with netbooks at first. Later versions are expected to target the larger desktop and laptop computer markets. The OS also probably will partner well with Google's Web browser, also called Chrome. Essentially, the operating system could become an Internet-based experience.  Michael Arrington, co-editor at TechCrunch, says that's a big threat to Microsoft's business, but it may help consumers.   "Don't worry about those desktop apps you think you need. Office? Meh. You've got Zoho and Google Apps," he writes. "You won't miss Office." Finally, Google says in its blog post that it's "going back to basics" with this operating system.  The company realizes that speed and functionality are top priorities for computer users who now live on the Internet. "People want to get to their email instantly, without wasting time waiting for their computers to boot and browsers to start up. They want their computers to always run as fast as when they first bought them. They want their data to be accessible to them wherever they are and not have to worry about losing their computer or forgetting to back up files," the company writes. "Even more importantly, they don't want to spend hours configuring their computers to work with every new piece of hardware, or have to worry about constant software updates. And any time our users have a better computing experience, Google benefits as well by having happier users who are more likely to spend time on the Internet." Many tech writers seem enamored with the idea.   Writing for TechCrunch, MG Siegler says Google is inventing an operating system that users almost won't notice. It will boot quickly, then get out of the way. "What Google is doing is not recreating a new kind of OS, they're creating the best way to not need one at all," Siegler writes. Siegler says Google is "dropping the mother of bombs on its chief rival, Microsoft," adding that the move is "a genius play."   Microsoft Corp., based in Redmond, Washington, did not respond immediately to a request for comment on this story. The company is set to release Windows 7, its latest operating system -- or program that helps your computer's hardware run software applications -- on October 22.   Ars Technica, a tech site that reportedly broke the story Tuesday before Google announced the news on its blog, writes that Google's OS will forward the idea of computing in the cloud. "With such an OS, Google could obviously make it extra easy for users to access the full range of Google cloud applications through the browser -- Google Docs, Gmail, Google Maps, etc," the site says.   But a Google operating system, combined with the already extensive reach of Google products, could draw more attention from the federal government for possible antitrust violations, says CNET writer Stephen Shankland. "The move has widespread implications," he writes. "One is that it shows just how serious Google is about making the Web into a foundation not just for static pages but for active applications, notably its own such as Google Docs and Gmail.   "Another: it opens new competition with Microsoft and, potentially, a new reason for antitrust regulators to pay close attention to Google's moves." Others say the news is somewhat overblown. The Silicon Alley Insider says success of the operating system is "far from guaranteed." Reporter Henry Blodget writes that Google's operating system could go the way of the Chrome Web browser -- which has turned out to be more of a niche product rather than a true rival to Microsoft's Internet Explorer. "Google's browser initiative, Chrome, has been a fun little science project, but as a product it has been a flop," Blodget writes.  "The same can be said for almost all of Google's non-search products. If Google wants to have a chance at success in this business, it needs to focus on it with the same intensity it once put into search. This will be challenging for Google, which, for the last several years, has had the luxury of dabbling in whatever it pleases." What do you think? Feel free to chime in with comments below.

  Google vs. Microsoft: What you need to knowStory Highlights The escalating Google vs. Micosoft battle is mostly over who'll be King of Tech  Top execs at each company dream of ways to steal the others' pots of gold  Chrome OS will compete with Windows, while Office 10 will include free online versions  Here's how the two tech giants stack up in four key areas of competition Next Article in Technology »   By Ryan Singel 



 


 

  (WIRED) -- In less than a week, Google announced an operating system to compete with Windows, while Microsoft announced that Office 10 will include free, online versions of its four most popular software programs -- a shot at Google's suite of web-based office applications. 
The fight between Microsoft and Google is over who'll be seen as the world's most important tech company. 
 And not more than a month and a half ago, Microsoft unveiled its new search engine Bing, which it hopes will steal market share from Google and finally make it real money online. From the news of it, it's a full-blown tech battle, complete with behind-the-scenes machinations to sic government regulators on each other. It is, however, not a death match -- it's more of an fight to see who will be the King of Technology, since both companies pull in their billions through completely different siphons and are unlikely to severely wound one another any time soon. Google pulled in $22 billion in revenue in 2008, 97 percent of which came tiny text ads bought by the keyword and placed next to search results or on pages around the web. Google makes a negligible amount of money bundling its online apps for businesses, charging $50 a head annually -- but mostly it just gives its online text editor, email and spreadsheet programs away. By contrast, Microsoft sold $14.3 billion worth of Microsoft Word and PowerPoint and other business applications over the last nine months, making a profit of $9.3 billion. It made a further $16 billion in revenue in 2008 through sales of its operating systems, which range from XP installations on netbooks, to Vista, to Windows Mobile to its server software. Google now plans its own range of operating systems, starting with Android, an open-source OS for small devices like smartphones, and Chrome OS, a browser-focused, open-source OS that will run on notebooks and desktops.

 Clearly top executives at each company look over at the others' pots of gold and dream of ways to steal them, or at least make it harder for the other guy to make money. In fact, they even dislike each other enough to spend money to make the other one lose revenue -- take for example, Microsoft's behind-the-scenes campaign to scuttle last year's proposed Google-Yahoo advertising deal or its ongoing attempts to derail the Google Book Search settlement. But in reality, the competition is really about creating universes or ecosystems that it hopes consumers will want to live their technology lives inside. And it's about ego -- a fight to be recognized as the world's most important technology company. Microsoft would love for everyone in the world to be using its Internet Explorer browser to search through Bing to find a story from its MSN portal to email via Hotmail or Outlook to a friend. Add in a smartphone running Windows Mobile and an Xbox in the living room for the kids, and you have a Microsoft family. And though it is much joked about, Microsoft is the dominant platform for software developers of all types, whether they are making small business software, massive online role-playing games or photo-editing utilities. Google's ecosystem looks different. It starts with a Google Chrome browser (oddly running only on Windows) with a default homepage set to Google News or a customized Google homepage. From there you might go to Gmail and then click on a Word document sent to you as an attachment which Google will quickly -- and safely -- open for you in its online word processor. But most importantly, Google wants you to search and travel around the web, hitting web pages that run Google-served ads and Google tracking cookies. You might think that Google is a really cool company to give away all this free technology, while never thinking about the persistent and silent data collection Google is undertaking to profile you in order to deliver you to advertisers for a premium. So how do the two stack up in four key areas of competition? Browsers: Internet Explorer in all its variations still retains close to 70 percent of the market (depending on who is counting and how). That dominance remains, even though Microsoft's latest offering IE8 lags behind all the other major browsers in features and advanced web capabilities. Firefox, Opera, and Apple's Safari have all driven browser innovation over the last five years, but most people have not been convinced to leave IE behind, despite other alternatives being safer and more advanced. Why does it matter? Well, IE installations come with a default home page, don't they? Google's Chrome browser, on the other hand, is a handsome, whiz-kid of a browser. It's sleek and nimble, and it revolutionizes how tabs are handled. The address bar is the search box (Google as default, naturally). Each website opened runs as its own browser instance and has very low permissions to read and write to files. The sandboxing of tabs means that if a single website hangs or crashes, the rest are unaffected. Meanwhile, lower permissions make it harder for a hacker to bust into your computer through your browser. Chrome also has less than 2 percent of the browser market share. Online Search: Google's name now means search to most users. Google's search engine means money to Google. In June, it delivered 78.5 percent of search results pages delivered to U.S. web users. In the first three months of 2009, Google pulled in $5.2 billion in revenue, a majority of which came from AdWords, an auction-based service that triggers ads based on the keywords in a search query. Microsoft recently debuted Bing, a new search engine it hoped would fare well in comparison to Google. It's got some fine innovations, and shows the company is thinking very hard about better ways to present information to users by finding ways to synthesize data, rather than just retrieving links. Still, despite these improvements, a $100 million ad campaign, and generous press coverage that treats Bing like an underdog, Bing gained only a point in June to get Microsoft 8.2 percent of all searches. Operating Systems: Microsoft has been making operating systems since 1979 and has spent 28 years perfecting MS-DOS and Windows NT, the frameworks that Windows have been built around. Microsoft is estimated to run on about 90 percent of all laptops and desktops in the world. By copying its competitors' best features, leveraging questionable licensing arrangements and using its base of accustomed users to buy it time against innovators, Microsoft has held on to its lead in the OS market for almost 30 years. That's despite challenges from Digital Research, Apple and IBM. Microsoft's newest version, Windows 7, will be available in the fall. Early reviews say the OS boots quickly and sleeps fast, and avoids much of the confusing interface decisions that have made many dislike Vista, the successor to Windows XP. Microsoft also dominates in the business world, where nearly every medium to large company standardizes around Microsoft Office. Microsoft is also at work on version 6 of its operating system for handheld devices, which it first launched in 2000. Its OS advantages are immense. It has millions of users who know nothing else and who like Windows. There are millions who are attached to games or the thousands of desktop apps that are only available on Windows. Thousands of devices just plug in and work on its hardware. And familiarity with Microsoft software is a requirement for a huge number of office jobs. By contrast, Google first stepped into the OS game in 2007 when it announced its Android operating system for small devices. Google estimates that some 18 phone models will be running its system by the end of the year. Last week, Google announced, but did not show off, a new OS to compete with Windows, dubbing it Chrome OS. That name signifies that Google's OS will be for the web and browser-based. It hopes to convince developers to write software that runs inside a browser, instead of on top of the OS as developers for Windows and Apples' OS X do. It will also let web developers extend the power of their websites by expanding the capabilities of the browser, allowing websites to lean on the browser for storage and processing help. Advertising: Google is largely powered by its innovative auction-based text ads on its own site, but then expanded into serving ads on other people's sites with the Adsense program. It bought the ad-serving and behavioral-profiling giant Doubleclick in 2007 for more than $3 billion, and has ventured into mobile, print, radio and television ads. Microsoft has struggled to replicate Google's online advertising success. Despite owning MSN.com -- a portal that is second only to Yahoo as a destination -- Microsoft has not made money on the internet. To turbocharge its ad-delivery technology, it paid more than $6 billion in cash in 2007 for aQuantive, a full-service online advertising concern. Instead, Microsoft's online ad business lost $1.2 billion in 2008, double what it lost in 2007. The company expects 2009 revenues to be higher than the $3.2 billion it took in last year, but has not said it would make a profit. Contrary to what some might have you believe, the benefits of the Google-Microsoft competition are immense. Microsoft had largely grown complacent until Google came along to shake up categories. Gmail's massive online storage capability and fancy programming made Microsoft hustle to upgrade its popular, though not user-friendly, web e-mail service. Google Maps led to Microsoft's Live Maps, which now bests Google's efforts in some ways. Google has been winning the fight for the last few years, showing that it is still nimbler than the software giant from the Northwest. But the pendulum may be slowing, or even poised to swing the other way. With the innovations in Bing and the promise that Microsoft's online Office offerings will be free and more fully featured than the Google equivalent, Microsoft is taking on Google where it matters for users: on the field of innovation. And that will make for an interesting race, no matter which horse you prefer to ride.

Analysis: Microsoft wants some of Google's good thing - CNN.com 



















 

  





  













  Analysis: Microsoft wants some of Google's good thingStory Highlights Deal with Yahoo gives Microsoft a greater share of search market  Combined, Microsoft and Yahoo are better poised to take on Google   Yahoo has effectively outsourced its search operation   Google also is challenging Microsoft on its own turf: operating systemsNext Article in Technology »  Read VIDEO  By Steve Mollman For CNN 



 


 

  (CNN) -- Microsoft knows a good thing when it sees it. And what Google has going on with its search advertising business is a good thing -- which, of course, is why Microsoft wants a bigger piece of it. 
Combined, Microsoft and Yahoo will try to erode Google's dominance in search. 
 To that end, it struck a deal Wednesday to power the searches on Yahoo's various properties. The deal will increase the market share of Microsoft's search platform, Bing. The boost will help. In June, according to estimates from comScore, Microsoft's share in the U.S. search engine market was 8.4 percent, and Yahoo's was 19.6 percent, compared to 65 percent for Google.   So Bing will soon have close to a 30 percent market share, making it a stronger alternative to Google, and Microsoft will move closer to enjoying the "self-reinforcing, positive feedback loop" that has powered Google's rise to dominance.  Watch more on search engines » That loop, as described by Gartner analyst Neil MacDonald, is essentially what the software giant is after. It works like this: the more people use the search service, the more advertisers are willing to pay because more people are using it. And the more paying advertisers there are using the service, the better and more relevant the ads that come up.   Plus, the more the search engine is used, the better it becomes, thanks to contextual learning algorithms. Business 360: Contending Google's throne As for Yahoo, its stock took a hit after the announcement and many observers predicted the deal was the beginning of the end for the firm.

Microsoft, Yahoo strike deal to take on Google


Google eyes Microsoft's stronghold


   Jason Calacanis, CEO of the human-powered search engine Mahalo, wrote a blog posting entitled "Yahoo committed seppuku today." "The once proud warrior of the Internet space laid down its sword, knelt at the feet of Microsoft and gutted itself today," wrote Calacanis. But not everyone sees it that way. MacDonald sees a "very focused, smart deal" on both sides. Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz was astute, he says, in realizing that the company was about a "collection of media properties and the experience the user has," and that "you don't have to own search to make that experience compelling."   Yahoo will not receive an up front payment from Microsoft as part of the deal. Instead, it will receive 88 percent of search revenue generated via its sites during the first five years of agreement, according to yesterday's announcement. The company estimates that the agreement will add about $275 million annually to its operating cash flow and that it will be able to save about $200 million by basically outsourcing search. Search data will be shared between the two companies. They will continue to compete in other areas, including e-mail, instant messaging, and display advertising ("coopetition" like this is fairly common in both media and technology fields, notes MacDonald). Google isn't sitting still while Microsoft moves in on its territory. It's working on a Chrome operating system, slated to come out next year, that will compete with Microsoft's Windows. And its suite of online applications already puts up a fight against the Office juggernaut. Of course that's a feeble fight at the moment, but then so is Microsoft's fight in the search arena. One or both of these fights might become less lopsided over time, but we'll have to wait and see. For now Google and Microsoft have seemingly insurmountable leads in their respective strongholds. Not addressed in the deal is the challenge presented by the growth of real-time search -- Twitter being a perfect example -- which can make both Google and Bing look downright outdated in certain cases. For instance by typing #Bing into Twitter you can see what people around the world have been saying and sharing about this deal in the past 5 seconds. Meanwhile the ever growing juggernaut of Facebook also challenges the central place held by Google -- and by Bing, if Microsoft has its way. These search engines use impersonal algorithms to draw an atlas of the Web, but Facebook wants users to get their information about the world through their filter of friends and colleagues -- just as in real life. When a Facebook user taps his or her "social graph" to find the best dentist, they never leave the world of Facebook -- and Google and Bing are left out in the cold. And Facebook has far more details on its users, who use their real names. 





 Microsoft, at least, is an investor in Facebook, thanks to a deal struck a few years ago. Google, much to its chagrin, is not. But it is, clearly, right in Microsoft's sights.

  Google lets you custom-print millions of booksStory Highlights Google Book Search is letting readers turn digitized texts back into paper copies  Google scans millions of books and turns them into searchable documents  Books can be printed on demand by a special machine in about 4 minutes  The machine is only in a few dozen bookstores so far Next Article in Technology »   By Ryan Singel 



 


 

  (WIRED) -- What's hot off the presses this week? 
Want an out-of-print book? With the help of Google, a machine may be able to print one for you. 
 Any one of the more than 2 million books old enough to fall out of copyright into the public domain. Over the last seven years, Google has scanned millions of dusty tomes from deep in the stacks of the nation's leading university libraries and turned them into searchable documents available anywhere in the world through its search box. And now Google Book Search, in partnership with On Demand Books, is letting readers turn those digital copies back into paper copies, individually printed by bookstores around the world. Or at least by those booksellers that have ordered its $100,000 Espresso Book Machine, which cranks out a 300 page gray-scale book with a color cover in about 4 minutes, at a cost to the bookstore of about $3 for materials. The machine prints the pages, binds them together perfectly, and then cuts the book to size and then dumps a book out, literally hot off the press, with a satisfying clunk. (The company says a machine can print about 60,000 books a year.) That means you can stop into the Northshire Bookstore in Manchester, Vermont, and for less than $10, custom-order your own copy of Dame Curtsey's Book of Candy Making, the third edition of which was published in 1920 and which can only be found online for $47.00 used.

 Dane Neller, On Demand Books CEO, says the announcement flips book distribution on its head. "We believe this is a revolution," Neller said. "Content retrieval is now centralized and production is decentralized." Neller said the deal was clearly about the long tail of books, a reference to Wired magazine's Editor-in-Chief Chris Anderson's theory that hits become less important when distribution costs drop. One of the main benefits, according to Neller, is letting local book stores compete with Amazon.com by reducing their need to have expensive inventory. Other current retailers include the University of Michigan Shapiro Library Building in Ann Arbor; the Blackwell Bookshop in London; the Bibliotheca Alexandrina in Alexandria, Egypt; the University of Alberta Bookstore in Edmonton, Canada; and Angus & Robertson Bookstore in Melbourne, Australia. The company hopes to sell 60 more printers in the next year, bringing the number of machines globally to about 90. On Demand Books suggests that book stores price the books at about $8, leaving retailers with a $3 profit after both Google and On Demand Books collect a buck-a-book fee. Google plans to donate its share to a yet-unspecified charity, which might be a reaction to its messy legal and public policy fight over a copyright settlement that covers books that are still in copyright. (All the books that are being added to On Demand Books repertoire in this agreement are out of copyright in the country where it will be printed.) Starting Sept. 29, Bostonians can stop in the privately owned Harvard Bookstore in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and have their books printed in front of them. Or they can order it over the phone and have the store deliver it -- by bicycle. There's a certain irony to that, too, according to Google spokeswoman Jennie Johnson, since the bookstore is right next to Harvard's library, one of the libraries that partnered with Google to turn its millions of books into an online library of the future. "Most people can't get into the Harvard Library, but you can print their books next door," Johnson said. Or put another way, On Demand Books is betting that in the future, every old book will have 15 readers. What's of interest in these old books? Plenty, according to Google. One knitter discovered a long-lost book about knitting, and recreated the heirloom pieces and even built a loom from a long-lost design. Another reader, who works with subsistence farmers in Africa, currently uses PDFs of old farming techniques to teach still-relevant skills. Google already uses the public-domain books in search results, and users can read those books in full online and even download them as PDFs for free. Neither Neller or Johnson cared to speculate on how many of these books they expect to sell, but Johnson says some 80 percent of the public-domain books are looked at in a given month. Unfortunately, it's unlikely that the number of public domain books will grow larger anytime soon, since Congress added two decades to existing copyright protection in 1999. Copyright, which originally lasts about 14 years, now extends to the life of an author plus 70 years for newly created works. As for their quality? They feel like a typical paperback, and are printed using typical 20- or 24-pound paper, with heavier stock for the inkjet-printed cover, which currently all share one design. While turning bits back into paper seems a bit of a stretch for Google, Johnson said it fits with the company's goal of organizing the world's information. "We think people should be able to find and read these books," Johnson said. "We don't care how people end up reading them." Neller said he'd love to see the day when Google Book Searchers can press a button next to a search result and find the closest local printer, but Google says that's a long way off. So for now, book buyers of the future who want to buy books from the past will need to walk to a bookstore -- or get Harvard Bookstore to use the bicycle, a 19th-century invention, to bring them a book printed with 21st-century technology.

 At a loss for words? Google offers search by sightBy Stephen Shankland 
   Vic Gundotra of Google takes a photo of the Itsukushima Shrine in Japan. The Google Goggles feature successfully identified it. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Google announces the ability to perform an Internet search by submitting a photograph  The experimental search-by-sight feature, Google Goggles, has a database of billions of images   However, the feature is still in Google Labs and hasn't been released to the public  Google engineer: "It is our goal to be able to identify any image"   Mountain View, California (CNET) -- Google's first search engine let people search by typing text onto a Web page. Next came queries spoken over the phone.  On Monday, Google announced the ability to perform an Internet search by submitting a photograph. The experimental search-by-sight feature, called Google Goggles, has a database of billions of images that informs its analysis of what's been uploaded, said Vic Gundotra, Google's vice president of engineering. It can recognize books, album covers, artwork, landmarks, places, logos, and more. "It is our goal to be able to identify any image," he said. "It represents our earliest efforts in the field of computer vision. You can take a picture of an item, use that picture of whatever you take as the query." However, the feature is still in Google Labs to deal with the "nascent nature of computer vision" and with the service's present shortcomings. "Google Goggles works well on certain types of objects in certain categories," he said.  Google Goggles was one of the big announcements at an event at the Computer History Museum here to tout the future of Google search. The company also showed off real-time search results and translation of a spoken phrase from English to Spanish using a mobile phone. "It could be we are really at the cusp of an entirely new computing era," Gundotra said, with "devices that can understand our own speech, help us understand others, and augment our own sight by helping us see further." Offering one real-world example of the service in action, Gundotra said that when a guest came by for dinner, he snapped a photo of a wine bottle she gave him to assess its merits. The result--"hints of apricot and hibiscus blossom"--went far beyond his expertise, but that didn't stop him from sharing the opinion over dinner. He also demonstrated Google Goggles to take a photo of the Itsukushima Shrine in Japan, a landmark tourists may recognize even if they can't read Japanese. The uploaded photo returned a description of the shrine on his mobile phone. Although the service can recognize faces, since faces are among the billions of images in the database, it doesn't right now, Gundotra said. "For this product, we made the decision not to do facial recognition," Gundotra said.  "We still want to work on the issues of user opt-in and control. We have the technology to do the underlying face recognition, but we decided to delay that until safeguards are in place." © 2010 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

 Google-China move hurts businesses, academicsBy  Lara Farrar, CNN   Google shutting China search engineSTORY HIGHLIGHTSChinese businesses and universities could be affected by Google departureAcademics, students and researchers rely heavily on Google's search services Most of China's 400 million Internet users, however, wouldn't be affected Beijing, China (CNN) -- Businesses and universities could be substantially affected by the departure of Google from China. Most of the country's nearly 400 million Internet users may not be affected by the closure. But academics, university students and other researchers rely heavily on Google's search services to access information not available through Chinese search engines, like Baidu.com, China's most popular search portal. Small businesses that depend on Google applications such as Google Docs and Gmail may also suffer, analysts said. A recent survey of more than 700 Chinese scientists conducted by the journal Nature found that 80 percent regularly use Google to search for academic papers while 60 percent said they use the site to stay on top of new research. Google quits censoring search in China "Students who care more about searching for quality information choose to use Google because it definitely provides better search results than Baidu," said Xin Liu, a recent graduate of Fudan University in Shanghai. "It will force more and more students to use wall-climbing software." Special circumvention software, such as virtual private networks (VPNs) and proxies, have become increasingly popular among Internet users in China who want to break through the "Great Firewall," as the country's filtering system is known, to access Web sites already blocked by the government. China state media: Google decision 'totally wrong' Analysts say the use of such tools could dramatically increase if China bars access to Google's overseas search services in Hong Kong or the United States. On Monday, Google closed its Chinese site and began redirecting its users there to its Hong Kong-based search engine.

So far, the site has not been blocked. Yet queries for sensitive words are blocked when searched from Beijing, an indicator China is already filtering the portal. "If people can use overseas services, the impact will not be that great," said Jeremy Goldkorn, founder of the Chinese media site Danwei.org. "If the filtering increases in any way from the past, it is going to be a problem because none of the Chinese search engines are good at searching the international Internet in English. That is going to impact anyone who relies on that," Goldkorn said. Others say they are worried Google applications, including its popular Gmail service and document sharing service Google Docs, could eventually be banned. "They are now one step closer to being blocked," said Frank Yu, a Beijing-based Internet analyst. "We depend on this whole series of services for translation and storing documents. They are essential for running a small business or a startup." A Google departure could also decrease Chinese engineering talent, said Yu. "Google trains a lot of engineers," he said. "Sure, there are a lot of competent people here but now there is one less multinational that hires graduates and trains them at a higher level." A journalism professor at a Chinese university, who asked not to be named, said "some of my friends say what a pity if Google pulls out of China because they rely heavily on resources including Google Scholars and Google Books. "It is also true working journalists, especially those who cover international news. I think it is great pity that this might happen," he added.

 'Van der Sloot' Google search stuns slain woman's brotherBy  Ashley Fantz CNN       Stephany Flores Ramirez, who loved to play poker, allegedly met Joran van der Sloot while playing cards. STORY HIGHLIGHTSStephany Flores Ramirez's father panicked when she didn't come home from poker tournamentHotel workers told family that young woman was with man who "looked like Brad Pitt"Videotape shows Flores entering hotel room with Joran van der SlootFlores was a university student and an avid poker player, her brother says (CNN) -- It was unlike Stephany Flores Ramirez not to come home on time. An avid poker player, the Peruvian 21-year-old lived with her father and knew he was expecting her after a night at a Texas Hold 'em tournament on May 30 in Lima.  "My father called me and said Stephany didn't come home, help me," Stephany's older brother Enrique Flores told CNN on Sunday. "So I went to the house and we started calling all the numbers of my sister's friends that I had and we called the police."  Eventually, authorities found surveillance video of the young woman at the hotel where the tournament was held. They found footage of Joran van der Sloot sitting next to Stephany, he said.  "At first, it was a relief because I saw her and that gave me hope," Enrique Flores said. "The people at the hotel told us, 'Yeah, she was with this guy. He seemed nice. He looked like Brad Pitt.'"  Van der Sloot is widely known as a suspect in the high-profile 2005 disappearance of Alabama teen Natalee Holloway in Aruba. The Dutch 22-year-old has repeatedly denied involvement in that case. He has twice been arrested and released but has not been charged.  Late Monday, Peruvian government authorities said Van der Sloot confessed to Flores' murder. He will likely be held at one of three maximum security prisons -- Castro Castro, Piedras Gordas and Lurigancho, authorities said. Flores' battered body was found last week in a hotel room registered to van der Sloot. Hotel videotape clearly shows the two entering a room together May 30 at 5:16 a.m. local time. Three hours and 20 minutes later, he left the hotel by himself carrying a backpack, telling the hotel staff not to bother "his girl," police said.

Natalee Holloway


The Flores family is well known in Peru. Patriarch Ricardo Flores is a politically connected former race car driver. The four Flores sons, including Enrique Flores, run a successful event-planning business.  After police showed Enrique and his father the surveillance tape, they again began trying to find out more from people at the hotel, and obtained information about the man on the tape.  "They gave us his social security number and his name," the brother told CNN. "We came back home and searched his name on the Internet. I cannot tell you the shock we felt."  "My wife typed 'Joran van der Sloot' into Google and started screaming for me to see," Enrique Flores told CNN on Sunday. "I couldn't believe it. How could it be that guy?"  "All I have been doing is reading about Natalee Holloway and what her family has gone through," Flores said. Stephany Flores was a trusting young woman, her family said.  "My sister is very friendly ... always smiling, always nice to everyone," said Enrique Flores. "I think about how she felt with him, that she probably did not think ... and it is ... so hard to think about that."  "My sister was the only girl in our house, the queen of our family," he continued. "What she wanted, she got. She loved to play soccer" and would organize matches with her friends in the family's backyard.  She was in her third year studying business administration at University of Lima, and ran the merchandising arm of the family entertainment and event-promotion business, Enrique Flores said.  "She had a lot of friends," he said. "A lot of people are crying."  About an hour after Enrique Flores found out who the man on the videotape was, police called to say they had found his sister's body. Investigators believe a tennis racquet found in the room was used in the killing, said Carlos Gonzalo, a spokesman for Peru's Interior Ministry.  When authorities knew who they were looking for, they found van der Sloot traveling alone in a taxi in Chile. Authorities said he had bloody clothes with him. He was taken into custody and transported to Peru where he remains jailed.  Before van der Sloot's confession Monday night, a Peruvian judge extended for another week the investigation into the killing, and the Dutch suspect was to  remain jailed in Lima, Gonzalo said. In Alabama on Thursday, the FBI announced van der Sloot is being charged in the United States for allegedly trying to extort $250,000 from someone related to the Holloway case. Van der Sloot allegedly promised to disclose the location of Holloway's body.  In the hours after his sister's wake, Enrique Flores is gripped with grief, sadness and determination. He cannot stand to talk for long about his sister until his voice cracks and he asks if the interview can please end. One sentence, though, before it does. "We just want justice," he said.CNN's Rafael Romo contributed to this report.

 Google Buzz goes after Facebook, TwitterBy  Doug Gross, CNN    Google Buzz, a feature of Gmail, aims to compete using elements similar to Facebook and Twitter. STORY HIGHLIGHTS NEW: Google Buzz plunges search giant into social networking world  NEW: The service was being rolled out to some users as early as Tuesday afternoon  Buzz will work through Gmail, allow users to post updates or pull in material from other sites  Move comes after Google tweaked searches to emphasize social networks 
RELATED TOPICS


Google Inc.

Facebook Inc.

Twitter Inc.

 (CNN) -- Google plunged into the world of social networking on Tuesday, melding pieces of Facebook and Twitter into a new feature, Google Buzz. Buzz, which will work through the popular Gmail service, will allow users to post status updates, photos and links to members of their network -- as well as pull in their activity on other sites like Twitter, Flickr and Picasa. Google spokesman Bradley Horowitz said the service, which was rolling out to some Gmail users Tuesday afternoon and should be available to all in the next couple of days, aims to weed out what he called the clutter of other networking sites. With networking sites, "there's obviously value there," he said. "It's a phenomenon that's real, but it's increasingly becoming harder and harder to make sense and find the signal in the noise." By letting users post photos, links and updates openly, the tool would mimic Twitter's micro-blogging format. But users also will be able to make their content available to "friends only," more closely following the Facebook model. At an event at the company's Mountain View, California, headquarters, Google also seemed poised to take a poke at the AOL Instant Messenger service, saying Buzz will be offered to companies as a tool for interoffice communication. "It will change the way businesses communicate around the world," Horowitz said. Despite the inevitable comparisons, Google spokesmen said they didn't set out to tread on anyone else's turf. "We try not to pay too much attention to competitors," Gmail product manager Todd Jackson said. "We try to listen to users." Horowitz said Google Buzz will automatically make "friends" out of the people a user e-mails or chats with the most on Gmail. See CNNmoney's report on reaction from some Google competitors. Comments on posts will appear in real time. And comments by other users will be weighted, similar to how Google's search engine weighs results, to "collapse bad buzz and recommend the good buzz," Jackson said. The hands-down leader in the search engine world, Google has been branching out on projects that include its Nexus One smartphone, the company's first foray into hardware marketing. Late last month, Google announced that people could tweak their accounts to make results related to friends, co-workers and other members of their social networks appear above all other results.  The Social Search feature was introduced to a limited number of Google users last year and was made available to everyone in beta status on January 28. The change came with a hint of more things to come. "This is just a first step in our ongoing effort to ensure that Google Web search is always as social as the Web itself," the company said in an instructional video posted to its official blog.  Google Buzz probably won't be able to bring in status updates and other materials from Facebook for the same reason that Social Search doesn't.  Because most Facebook users set their information to be viewed only by friends, Google's search engine can't collect that information in the same way it can from Twitter and, obviously, Google-owned sites like YouTube. Buzz also will have a mobile component, operating on most major wireless operating systems with features that include voice-recognition posting and a GPS-enabled ability to attach the user's location to posts. The Web-based mobile application, which can be used by iPhones despite not going through Apple's online store, can also be set to pick up posts to Buzz being made near the user's location. Changes to the tool could be coming quickly, too. Google officials say they're already studying possible expansions. They include allowing Buzz updates by phone, letting users post to their Twitter account through the tool and linking Buzz with the still-emerging Google Wave system. "We're just getting started," Horowitz said. "We're not launching this today because we think we're done. We don't think that's how a product like this is built."

 Man lands job with $6 Google campaignBy  Lauren Indvik 

     Alec Brownstein parlayed a $6 Google ad campaign into a new job. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Copywriter Alec Brownstein landed a job through a $6 Google marketing campaign  Brownstein bought ads on the names of directors he wanted to work for, knowing they'd pop up when the directors "Google" themselves  Since no one else was bidding, some of the ads cost him 15 cents  In a couple of months, he got calls from all but one of the directors and job offers from two

 (Mashable) -- By now, landing a job via social media is nothing new; we've perused the how-to guides and heard dozens of great success stories. There are, however, still plenty of creative opportunities for securing a job with a bit of clever online marketing. Meet Alec Brownstein, senior copywriter at creative advertising shop Young & Rubicam (Y&R) New York.  Last summer, Alec was just another tired, 28-year-old copywriter at a large international ad agency who wanted nothing more than to work at "a really creative shop for really creative [creative directors]." While Googling his favorite creative directors last summer, Brownstein noticed that there were no sponsored links attached to their names. Since Brownstein Googles himself "embarassingly frequently," he assumed that the creative directors did so as well, and thus he decided to purchase their names on Google AdWords. "Everybody Googles themselves," Brownstein explained. "Even if they don't admit it. I wanted to invade that secret, egotistical moment when [the creative directors I admired] were most vulnerable." Since Brownstein was the only person bidding on the names of the five creative directors he most admired, he was able to get the top search spots for a mere 15 cents per click. Whenever someone ran a search for one of the creative directors' names, the following message appeared at the top of the page: "Hey, [creative director's name]: Goooogling [sic] yourself is a lot of fun. Hiring me is fun, too" with a link to Brownstein's website, alecbrownstein.com. Over the next couple of months, Brownstein received calls from all but one of the creative directors whose names he had purchased. And finally, at the end of the year, he received a job offer from two: Scott Virtrone and Ian Reichenthal of Y&R New York. The whole campaign cost him $6. But the rewards for Brownstein's creativity haven't ended there. He has also received awards in the self-promotion category at two major advertising awards shows, The One Show and The Clios. We asked Brownstein if he has any advice for others trying to land their dream jobs via Internet marketing.  "Don't be afraid to put yourself out there in an interesting way," he said. "The people who you want to work for can't hire you any less than they already are. So shoot for the moon." We couldn't agree more with his advice. What do you think of Brownstein's story? Have you or anyone you know used online marketing to land yourself a job?© 2013 MASHABLE.com. All rights reserved.

 (CNN) -- Google kicked off its annual developers' conference on Wednesday by introducing tools to help people build web-based applications, while making a strong push for HTML5, the next generation of the code on which the web is built. In a wide-ranging keynote, Google engineers and guest speakers emphasized the potential of the web as an open-source platform for developers to build apps and reduce the dependence on plug-ins -- small external programs, such as the Flash media player, that can make browsers more useful. "The future of the web is HTML5," Sundar Pichai, a Google vice president of project management, told the audience at the Google I/O conference in San Francisco, California. In the early 2000s, developers focused almost exclusively on desktop applications, such as Microsoft Office. But in recent years, the priority has shifted toward web-based applications such as Google's Gmail and Twitter. "Since calling attention to HTML5 last year, we've been thrilled to see the industry rally around making the web faster, more capable and available in more places," said Vic Gundotra, Google vice president of developer platforms.  "From enterprises to consumers, from the smallest form factors to the largest, the web's reach and increasing capability make it the platform for the future." Google brought executives from browser companies Opera and Mozilla onstage to help introduce WebM, an open-source, royalty-free video format designed to be used with HTML5 video. Google-owned YouTube will support WebM starting today, the company said. The company also unveiled the Chrome Web Store, an online marketplace for applications that work with Google's Chrome browser. Developers may submit apps to the store, where users may buy and download them. Google also introduced an App Engine for Business, which enables companies to build internal applications on the same infrastructure that Google uses. Also Wednesday, Google announced that Google Wave, its web-based communications platform that allows multiple users to share information in real time, will be opened to all users. Previously, accessing Google Wave required an invitation. More than 5,000 developers from 66 countries are expected to attend the Google I/O developer conference, which ends Thursday.

 (Mashable) -- The Android 2.2 rollout has finally begun, starting with Google's flagship phone, the Nexus One. Android 2.2, codename "FroYo," was revealed last month at the Google I/O conference in San Francisco. It was a major leap forward for the open-source OS, featuring not only major speed upgrades, but Wi-Fi hotspot and tethering functionality, cloud-to-device integrations, and Adobe Flash 10.1. While the newest version of the Google-build OS has been available for a short while now, today marks the official rollout of Android 2.2 to the masses. Most Nexus One owners can expect an over-the-air update sometime later today. Owners of other android phones such as the HTC Evo or the Droid Incredible will have to wait a little while longer, though. Most Android phones run a customized version of the OS -- HTC has the Sense UI, for example. It's up to the phone manufacturers to implement rollouts of new OS updates, and most won't be ready until August.© 2013 MASHABLE.com. All rights reserved.

 Why Google Buzz will be a hitBy  Pete Cashmore, Special to CNN      Mashable founder Pete Cashmore says Google Buzz will benefit from people already using Gmail. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Cashmore: Google Buzz is not original but should be moderate success  Gmail, like Facebook, has a built-in advantage with the millions who use it  Gmail had 176.5 million unique visitors in December, according to comScore  Content from people you care about on a site you visit daily, may be irresistible, writer says

Editor's note: Pete Cashmore is founder and CEO of Mashable, a popular blog about social media. He is writing a weekly column about social networking and tech for CNN.com.   (CNN) -- Google Buzz, Google's new social networking service announced this week, isn't particularly original.  Just like Facebook and Twitter, it lets you share links, updates and media with friends. Even so, it'll probably be a moderate success.  Google Buzz is perhaps the most generic "social sharing" service launched to date. Users can enable the service in their Gmail accounts to share status updates, photos, videos and more with the group of people they e-mail most often.  Friends can also comment on these updates or "like" them to express approval.  There isn't a great deal of innovation here; early adopters will remember FriendFeed, an identical service acquired by Facebook last year.  While FriendFeed built a strong technology platform with an advanced search engine, it failed to achieve significant mainstream success. The site's features are instead being integrated into Facebook, where FriendFeed's talented engineers and Facebook's massive reach (more than 400 million users at last count) combine for maximum effect.  Good technology has value, but leading social networks require "network effects." Facebook is infinitely more valuable because all your friends are on it. Facebook has leveraged this "critical mass" of users to stay ahead of new rivals, too. Why visit Twitter, you may ask, when Facebook has continually extended its feature set to keep up with its less popular competitor?  The story of social networks is in fact a story about network effects: How can a service reach a point at which there are enough users and content to be useful? YouTube achieved this trick by providing embedded videos for MySpace and blogs, siphoning off members along the way. MySpace eventually chose to block YouTube links and build a rival video service, but the move came much too late to halt YouTube's rise.  Photobucket, meanwhile, became one of the world's largest photo sites by providing photo hosting to MySpace users; MySpace parent Fox Interactive Media (now News Corp. Digital Media) acquired the service in 2007.  There are arguably better video sites than YouTube and better photo hosts than Photobucket, but network effects tend to trump technical prowess in the social networking realm.  Google Buzz certainly isn't groundbreaking, but it will achieve critical mass virtually overnight. Thanks to integration with Gmail, the new tool is in the eye-line of the millions of users who obsessively check their inboxes for new mail. ComScore pegged Gmail at 176.5 million unique visitors in December.  What's more, Google Buzz uses data about those you frequently e-mail to automatically build a social network for you. Gone are the challenges of critical mass faced by virtually every new social networking service. In Google Buzz, your address book is your network.  Two forces are at work here, then: the immediate utility of a social service pre-populated with people you know, combined with the habitual behaviors associated with checking your email throughout the day.  A stream of fresh content from people you care about, served up on a site you visit every day, may prove to be an irresistible attraction -- although perhaps not a novel one.

 Google denies YouTube outage speculationBy  Doug Gross, CNN      Video-sharing site YouTube was down for about an hour on Thursday. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Google, YouTube's owner, says hourlong outage not due to tampering  YouTube users could still get videos, but main page returned error  Outage came less than a week after Google stopped censoring results in China  Expert says there "could be a billion problems" that caused site to go down

China

 (CNN) -- Google Inc., owner of YouTube, said an outage of the popular video-sharing site Thursday was technical and not caused by outside tampering. "YouTube is up again following a technical issue which has now been resolved," a spokeswoman for Google said in a written statement. "We know how important YouTube is for people and apologize for any inconvenience the downtime may have caused."  The outage apparently lasted for just over an hour, from roughly 7 to 8 a.m. ET. A YouTube source said the outage was not the result of any kind of attack or related in any way to Google's recent move to stop censoring results in China. The timing of the outage, just days after Google's announcement, had spurred speculation online.  During the time YouTube was down, Internet users were still able to access individual videos, but YouTube's main page returned a "Http/1.1 Service Unavailable" message. The source said it's Google's default policy to not discuss the details on the cause of outages.  The search-engine giant has been embroiled in a public feud with the communist nation since January, when Google said it was the target of a "highly sophisticated and targeted attack" originating in China. "I think many people are, understandably, looking for China to take some unique and extraordinary technical measures to 'punish' Google," said Ron Deibert, director of the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto's Munk Centre for International Studies. But he said that nothing along those lines has been made public. "So far, what I have seen is business as usual, and this includes the filtering that is happening at the backbone/gateway levels that have been more or less consistent for a long period of time. "As for the source of the YouTube problems, I am sure they are investigating, and it could be a billion problems, just as it was for Wikipedia, which turned out to be a server cooling problem, according to reports." Google began operating in China in 2006, agreeing to limited censorship of what the government there considers controversial sites. A dashboard page posted by Google after it made its announcement shows that YouTube, one of the Internet's most popular sites, has been blocked in mainland China for the past four days. View the page Google Sites and Blogger also have been blocked, while other Google properties like photo site Picasa and Google Docs have been partially blocked, according to the page. Web search and Google Images, which like other services now originate from Google servers in Hong Kong, were reporting no blockage on the page. The YouTube downtime created much online buzz early Thursday. The term "Service Unavailable" became a trending topic, and many blogs were speculating on a possible China connection. The outage came a day after Wikipedia, the user-created online encyclopedia, was down for several hours.

 Why Google Wave's demise is good news for FacebookBy Pete Cashmore, Special to CNN | Filed under: Social Media     Mashable's Pete Cashmore says the death of Google Wave means the search giant is no force in social networking. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Google's social collaboration tool, "Wave," was abandoned this week  Wave was a testament to Google's tech skills, a symbol of its social networking struggles  Google's failure to develop engaging social services must please rival Facebook

Editor's note: Pete Cashmore is founder and CEO of Mashable, a popular blog about social media. He is writing a weekly column about social networking and tech for CNN.com.  (CNN) -- Google this week abandoned "Wave," its much-hyped social collaboration tool. Wave was perhaps the prototypical Google product: Technically advanced, incredibly ambitious and near-impossible to use. Its demise is the canary in the coal mine for Google's social networking plans: Facebook is destined to build the Web's next wave, as Google continues to tread water. Wave was a testament to Google's technical prowess: A real-time communication platform that combined elements of instant messaging, e-mail and collaboration software. The only problem: With its many dials and switches, mastering Wave was the web equivalent of programming your VCR.  Few users took the time to understand the product, and mainstream adoption proved unattainable. It's the same fate that awaited Google's other recent foray into the social realm: Google Buzz. This Twitter-like service seemed smart in theory, but Google's inability to build simple and compelling social tools meant the service was perceived as a nuisance rather than a breakthrough. All of which must have Mark Zuckerberg rubbing his hands together in glee. While Google is one of the few companies large enough to build a significant social network, Google Wave's demise is further proof that these efforts (rumored to be called "Google Me") are destined to fail.  Like Wave, Google Me will likely be a work of technical wizardry too advanced for us mere mortals to understand. Google's failure to develop engaging social services is more disastrous than it might seem at first. Social networking is no longer just a time-waster for young people -- it now reaches all demographics and encompasses personalized search, highly targeted advertising and the red-hot social gaming trend. As Facebook builds a user base of more than 500 million people, it also stockpiles the personal information required to provide more comprehensive ad targeting -- and a more personalized search engine -- than Google could ever hope to engineer through algorithms alone. Google isn't unaware of this predicament: The company is throwing its resources behind a plan to escape its social networking slump. But short of a miracle -- an acquisition of Facebook nemesis Twitter, perhaps -- Google won't become a socialite anytime soon.

 Google Instant search feeds our real-time addictionBy  Pete Cashmore, Special to CNN | Filed under: Social Media     Mashable's Pete Cashmore says Google Instant feeds our ever-growing need for a faster, real-time Web. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Google Instant feeds our need for answers even before we're done asking  Faster connections, real-time Web have us expecting results in an instant  Social networking also means latest news can be reported instantly, not hours later  Google CEO predicts next step could really be results before we ask
RELATED TOPICS

Facebook Inc.

Twitter Inc.

 (CNN) -- Google this week released its Instant Search feature, which displays live search results as soon as you begin typing.  By providing results before a query is complete and removing the need to hit the "enter" key, Google claims users will save two to five seconds per search. Are we too impatient to wait a matter of seconds for our search results? What's feeding our new-found need for speed? And why does Google feel the need to answer our questions before we've even asked them? Faster connections The flow of information around the Web has accelerated rapidly over recent years. The most obvious cause is that our Web connections have become significantly faster over time. This isn't merely a result of greater broadband penetration, but also the near-ubiquity of 3G networks. Not only have we become accustomed to fast connections in our homes, but we've become conditioned to a similar experience on the go. The real-time Web To Web users, however, this trend has been most evident in the "real-time Web" movement. Services like Twitter and Facebook now deliver messages from our friends in seconds.  And while most breaking news stories were previously sourced from mainstream media outlets -- taking hours to propagate via blog posts and emailed links -- significant news events can now spread through Twitter in a matter of minutes. Often, stories also enter the news cycle via on-the-ground reports posted to social networks. This significantly accelerates the news-gathering process and the speed at which important information reaches consumers. In short, these quick status updates between friends have conditioned us to expect immediate access to information -- whether that's breaking news or simply knowing what our friends are up to. Why should we expect anything less from search engines? Enabling discovery Social networking services have fostered another change in consumer behavior; one that puts Google at a real disadvantage. As a greater volume of timely, relevant information is delivered to us via status updates from friends, we spend less time searching. What's more, many social sites now use our social connections to recommend content to us without the need to seek it out.  This so-called "discovery" trend, of which iTunes Ping is the most recent example, threatens to usurp the search box. If relevant information is delivered to us without extra effort, why type words into a box? Google Instant Search is tackling the discovery problem, too: With every letter you type, Google serves up suggestions of what you may be looking for. Search for "tech company," and Google provides suggestions for "tech company news," "tech company valuation," and "tech company names." What's more, this feature enables truly personalized discovery by taking into account your search history, location and other factors -- Google is essentially emulating social networks by trying to predict what we're looking for without the need to submit a fully-formed search. Next up: Google Predictive Search? Google is unlikely to rest on its laurels now that Instant Search has been released. The only way the company can truly compete with social discovery is by going one step further. What if instead of guessing your intent while you search, Google could predict your needs before you search? That's likely the next evolution of Google search, according to statements from Google CEO Eric Schmidt. "The next step of search is doing this automatically. When I walk down the street, I want my smartphone to be doing searches constantly: 'Did you know ... ?' 'Did you know ... ?' 'Did you know ... ?' 'Did you know ... ?' " Schmidt said at the IFA consumer electronics event in Berlin, Germany, this week.  "This notion of autonomous search -- to tell me things I didn't know but am probably interested in -- is the next great stage, in my view, of search."

 Report: Google moving away from WindowsBy  Tom Krazit 
     A breach emanating in China last year has had Google tightening up security. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Report says Google is moving away from internal use of Windows over security concerns  An attack on Windows and Internet Explorer resulted in the theft of Google intellectual property late last year  Some employees will still use Windows to test products, but will need permission

Computer Security

 (CNET) -- Google has seen enough of Microsoft's Windows operating system, suspending internal use of the OS amid security concerns related to the attack on its network late last year, according to a report. Google CEO Eric Schmidt believes that Chrome OS is more secure than Windows, reportedly ordering employees to move away from Windows machines. The Financial Times reported late Monday that Google has begun telling new employees that they are no longer able to request Windows PCs, giving them the choice of Mac or Linux systems.  Google has long offered its employees their choice of work operating system but will no longer do so, The Financial Times said, afteran attack on Windows and Internet Explorer 6 resulted in the theft of Google intellectual property, believed to be source code, late last year. Rumors to this effect surfaced earlier in the year, but CNET was unable to confirm them at the time.  Microsoft has never been a friendly face inside the Googleplex, but Google's engineering-driven culture and need to test its software on a variety of systems usually meant that at least some portion of its employees preferred the Windows environment.  Some Google employees will still be able to use Windows machines, but they will have to get special permission, according to the report. Later this year Google will begin directing employees toward Chrome OS systems, Google CEO Eric Schmidt told CIOs attending a Google seminar on cloud computing in April. Google believes the browser-based operating system will be "inherently more secure" than alternative operating systems, Schmidt said at that event. Google declined to comment "on specific operational matters." © 2010 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved. CNET, CNET.com and the CNET logo are registered trademarks of CBS Interactive Inc.

 Bing envy? Google now lets you create custom homepagesBy Ben Parr, Mashable 

   Now you can customize your background on Google.com.

Bing.com

 (Mashable) -- Ever think that Google's homepage was just a little too sparse? If all of that white space bothers you, your prayers have been answered: Now you can customize your background on Google.com. You can now choose any photo or image from your hard drive or your Picasa Web Albums to enhance your search experience. A new link on the bottom left-hand corner of Google.com will soon appear for all users that will give them the ability to change their search background. The rollout begins with the U.S. over the next few days, with international users to follow. The announcement, written by Google VP of Search Products Marissa Mayer, doesn't go into much detail as to why Google decided to add this feature. Personalization isn't something new -- iGoogle, Gmail and other Google products offer this type of feature already. However, the search giant has been working diligently to reduce clutter on the homepage. The new feature immediately reminds us of Bing, Microsoft's upstart search engine. Every day it has a different photo on its homepage, and it has proven to be a popular feature. Will you be customizing your Google homepage? Is this a smart move by the company?

 (CNN) -- If you search Google on Tuesday, you may notice that the information you're looking for is a bit "fresher" than it would have been on Monday.  That's because the world's most popular search engine has unveiled a new search method called "Caffeine," which claims to index new information 50 percent faster than Google's old search. "Caffeine provides 50 percent fresher results for Web searches than our last index, and it's the largest collection of Web content we've offered," the company says in a news release on its official blog. "Whether it's a news story, a blog or a forum post, you can now find links to relevant content much sooner after it is published than was possible ever before." That doesn't mean Google has changed its search formula entirely, or that search results will pop onto your screen faster than before. Essentially it means that Google is able to find new content more quickly. So, for instance, a new Twitter update that, in the past, would be been missing from search results because Google hadn't found and indexed it yet, would be posted to Google search results more quickly with Caffeine. Here's a promotional video from Google that explains how the search works. The update -- which has been anticipated by tech and search-engine blogs -- comes as Google faces increasing competition from both traditional search engines and from online social networks with search-like functions.  Google is still the top search engine, with 64 percent of search queries, according to a report from the Web traffic monitor comScore, which cites April numbers. But that's down 1 percent compared to the previous month. Meanwhile, Microsoft's Bing search engine has been winning new fans, and, in general, increasing traffic. Microsoft and Yahoo! combined now make up about 30 percent of the search market, according to the report. In terms of social networks, Twitter has become a go-to site for finding up-to-the-minute information. And Facebook in April debuted its "Like" functionality all over the Web. Some tech writers see that as a threat to Google, since Facebook is essentially trying to organize information on the internet according to the likes and dislikes of someone's friends. Mashable, a social media blog that has a content partnership with CNN, says Google Caffeine is effective at making the Mountain View, California, company's search results more immediate: "This search is not only faster, but in some instances in our few tests, seems more capable of producing real-time results," Ben Parr wrote on the site last year when rumors of Caffeine were surfacing. The Google search update is a sign that the company is feeling some heat from its competitor Bing, writes Charles Arthur at The Guardian.  "It's interesting to see that Google is focusing again on the element of its offering where it does lead the pack: search," he writes. "That's what made its [Google's] name, but it's clear that even if Microsoft's Bing hasn't (yet?) won the market share, it has got Google thinking about how it can improve what it does." The blog The Next Web says the move is significant for the development of the real-time internet, and that it also "could provide a tremendous boast to not only Google's stock price, but also to its ad revenue." To better understand how Caffeine works, it might help to think of Caffeine as a blog and the old Google as a newspaper. Where a newspaper collects content and then publishes it all at once, at the beginning of the day, a blog is constantly looking for new information and updating on the fly. This is sort of how Google Caffeine works. Rather than collecting big "batches" of Web pages to index for its search, Google is trying to publish more frequently as it goes. "Every second Caffeine processes hundreds of thousands of pages in parallel. If this were a pile of paper it would grow three miles taller every second," Google says. In a blog post, Google software engineer Carrie Grimes acknowledges that times are changing for search. "Content on the Web is blossoming," she writes. "It's growing not just in size and numbers but with the advent of video, images, news and real-time updates, the average Web page is richer and more complex.  "In addition, people's expectations for search are higher than they used to be. Searchers want to find the latest relevant content and publishers expect to be found the instant they publish."

 Google's new background option - Bing's not impressedBy  Doug Gross, CNN | Filed under: Web   Images are scheduled to appear as default backgrounds on Google through Friday morning. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Google's home page Thursday featured images by famous artists  Images are to promote users' ability to make their own photos a backdrop  Rival Bing takes shots, calling Google an imitator

 (CNN) -- You may have noticed that Google's simple white search page is much more colorful than usual. Google rolled out the first of a set of backgrounds by noted artists on Thursday, promoting a new feature that lets users add their own photos as the search page's backdrop. The feature was first announced last week. Beginning Thursday morning, users were greeted by a rolling set of images from a list of contemporary artists that will include Dale Chihuly, Jeff Koons and Tord Boontje. The page also will feature photos from National Geographic.  The images were scheduled to appear as default backgrounds through Friday morning In a preview image on Google's official blog, a link promised to let users revert to the traditional Google look with a single click. But that link didn't appear to be on the live page as of mid-morning Thursday. "Of course, since we want your Google homepage to be personal to you, you can still choose an image or photo from your computer or your own Picasa Web Album," the blog post read. "Whether you select an image from our new artist collection or prefer to have a more personal touch on your homepage, you'll still enjoy the speed and ease of use that you've come to expect from Google." The change didn't go unnoticed by one of Google's competitors. The folks at Microsoft's Bing search engine -- which also features colorful photos on its home page -- didn't have any official comment on their rival's new look.  But there was some snarky chatter on unofficial channels. As reported by London's Telegraph, Ashley Highfield, Microsoft's director in the United Kingdom, had this to say on his Twitter feed: "Imitation (however pale) is the sincerest form of flattery: a certain search engine put up the same pic (tulip fields) used on Bing long ago."  While the personalization option may catch on with users, at least some people, perhaps thinking the background change is permanent, seemed to be balking. They also were turning to Google to help. "Remove Google Background" was the No. 2 trending search on Google's trends page Thursday morning.

 Google Voice opens to all, no longer invite-only

 (Wired) -- Google Voice opened to the public Tuesday. Up to now, you had to have an invitation from a current user before you could sign on to use the innovative phone add-on service. Now, anyone in the U.S. can sign up. Voice, which premiered in invite-only fashion a year ago, provides you with a single phone number that directs calls to your mobile, home or work phone, depending on the rules you set. Beyond that, it includes a basketful of features including transcribed voicemail sent as e-mail or text message, free conference calling, free outbound domestic calls and call-screening. The service is free, except for international calls, which cost a fraction of what the phone company charges per minute. Google Voice used to be known as GrandCentral before Google bought the company in July 2007. Craig Walker, the former CEO of GrandCentral, now runs Google Voice, which he says has a million active users. "That's a big number for a service that is invite-only," Walker said. New users get a free new number, hopefully somewhere near their local area, and in anticipation of a rush, Voice has bought a bunch of numbers spread across the country (though Hawaii and Alaska remain "challenges"). "We are pretty optimistic there will be a high demand," Walker said. Voice also has native apps for Android and Blackberry phones, while Palm Pre and iPhone users can use the HTML5 app (including to make outbound calls). Google made a full-featured app for the iPhone, which Apple controversially rejected on the grounds it would confuse users. The real cost of iPhone 4 vs. Android rivals Those who commit to giving out a Google Voice number as their central point of contact aren't locked into Google and can port their number out to a phone company or to competing services such as Toktumi. Users can't yet port their existing numbers into Google Voice, which would eliminate the need to have to "commit" to your Voice number by giving it out to friends and contacts, and getting new business cards made. Those unfamiliar with the service can see the features in this Google-produced video. Voice could mature into a service that competes with Skype, which has become the world's largest telephone service by allowing free calls between Skype users and cheap calls from PCs and mobile devices to overseas phone numbers. To that end, Google purchased a Skype competitor called Gizmo5 last November, which lets users make calls from their PCs to other PCs or to the traditional network.  Five ways to slash your cell phone bill Google is currently integrating this into Google Voice, though there is reportedly some internal friction over whether to scrap the downloadable software in favor of an HTML5 web app, even though the latter wouldn't have as good voice quality. Currently, Google Voice calls use the minutes of a mobile phone plan, unlike Skype, which bypasses the voice channel by making calls using data plans.Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT!

Spam Email

 (CNN) -- You may have seen slightly less spam coming into your email inbox recently, but those messages were more likely than usual to contain a virus, according to a report by Google. The amount of spam being transmitted dipped slightly in August and September, the study found. Spam in the third quarter of the year was down 24 percent compared to the same period last year, the report said. In August viruses in emails processed by Google increased by 111 percent, compared to the same month last year, the company said in its statement. Google's system blocked a record-setting 188 million emails containing viruses in just one day. This malware is increasingly being housed in messages purporting to break news about a celebrity's death. The virus can unleash itself when the recipient clicks on a file attached to an email. For the study, Google analyzed more than 3 billion messages processed by its system each day during a three-month period.
