VIEW RESULTS











LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Columnist Arianna Huffington will run for governor of California in the October 7 recall election, she announced Wednesday.


In a speech to supporters, the Republican turned left-of-center independent slammed California's Republican leadership, President Bush, and Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, while promising a unique campaign.


"I'm not, to say the least, a conventional candidate," said the Greek-born 53-year-old before joking about her accent.  "But these are not conventional times.  And if we keep electing the same kinds of politicians who got us into the same kinds of mess funded by the same special interests, we'll never get out of this mess."


Huffington has never held public office, but is well known as a nationally syndicated columnist and television and radio commentator.


Speaking outside a youth center that she supports, Huffington criticized the recall process that has given her the chance to run for governor.


"Nothing is more laughable than hearing the Republicans running blame everything about the state on Gray Davis' fiscal irresponsibility, while ignoring the orgy of fiscal irresponsibility going on in Washington presided over by George W. Bush and the Congress.


"Let's get real.  As ineffectual as Davis may be, there can be no doubt that it is the Bush administration -- with its tax cuts for the wealthy, its perverse political priorities, and its way-too-cozy relationship with Enron and the other energy companies -- that have gotten California where it is."


She added, "My Democratic friends are right -- this recall is led by an embittered cult of right-wing zealots who have overdosed on tax-cuts Kool-Aid."


But Huffington also criticized Democrats for refusing to present other Democratic candidates for governor in the recall election.


"It is not just politically imperative, it is morally imperative that we do not allow this state to be hijacked by the Republicans.  And that's why the Democratic strategy of circling the wagons around Gray Davis makes absolutely no sense for the people of California.


Asked about her lack of experience in public office, she said that Davis "has held every office in the land and you have a $38 billion deficit and legislators who don't talk to each other.  How much worse could it be?"


Huffington said that in her campaign she will conduct no polls and will run no attack ads.


She touched on some key issues facing the state, promising that as governor she will commit badly needed funds to improving education, fairly assess property tax on commercial holdings, and improve the environment -- partly by seeing to it that "anybody who works for the state will be driving hybrid cars."


In 1994, Huffington supported her then-husband, Michael Huffington, in his failed bid for U.S. senator from California.


Michael Huffington, who revealed he is gay after their 1997 divorce, released a statement Thursday, saying he would not enter the race. He endorsed Republican actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, calling him "a charismatic leader."


Huffington also appeared to take a swipe at his former wife in his statement, saying he had decided not to run out of consideration for their children.


"This week my children told me that they did not want their parents to run in this election -- either one of us," he said.


Arianna Huffington had said she would not run if he did, noting the pressure it would put on their two daughters, ages 14 and 12.

   Holy hormones! What to expect when puberty hitsStory Highlights Your child might be baby-faced today, but sooner or later puberty will strike  Some of the issues parents face: changing bodies, sexual awakening, attitude  Expert: Tell kids that the changes they're experiencing are normal  Talk about changes to come, cede some control to maturing kids Next Article in Health »   By  Denene Millner 



 


 

 
 I saw it -- I'm not blind: The hair peeking from under those arms and the little sprinkle of it Down There, too. The curvy hips and shapely legs and the bubble booty that would make the über-curvy Beyoncé do a double take.  
"The signs of puberty are a teachable moment," says one doctor. "Let children know they're okay the way they are." 
 The changes were hard for me to miss; after all, I still supervised my 8-year-old's nightly supersplashy baths -- the ones she happily shared with her little sister, a gang of doll babies, and a school of rubber fish. Still, when the pediatrician told my husband and me that it was time for us to have a talk with Mari about puberty, we were stunned into silence. How, after all, do you tell a child who still worships SpongeBob, Hubba Bubba bubble gum, and baths for two about boobs, bras, periods, cramps, zits, and PMS? We. Were. Not. Ready. But clearly, we needed to get ready, because our little girl's body was starting to make the long, slow journey toward becoming a young woman's, and despite our collective freak-out, holding out on the info was no longer an option.  Ivor Horn, M.D., a Washington, D.C., pediatrician who counsels her patients' parents about puberty, acknowledges that parents are uncomfortable with such conversations because all too many of us have memories of our own experiences with parents too embarrassed or unwilling to spill. But, argues Horn, it's imperative that we inform our kids about the changes occurring in their bodies -- before they get the crazy version of "facts" from fellow prepubescent playmates in the schoolyard.  "The signs of puberty are a teachable moment," adds Horn, herself a mom of two, ages 7 and 9. "It's important to let children know they're okay the way they are, that you love them that way, that the changes in their body are normal, and they can come to you with any questions." The comforting thing here is that if you and your child are staring puberty in the face and -- like Nick, me, and Mari -- your panties are in a bunch about it, you're not alone. Lucky for us, we're not the first to have kids going through The Change, and we sure as shooting won't be the last. So to help us through, I asked moms in the thick of puberty for useful tips. What to Expect When You Have a Girl Boobies + Bras When to expect it: Between 9 and 13 (there's a wide range of normal here!) What to expect: The estrogen that's being pumped into your tween's body from her ovaries causes breast budding -- small bumps behind the nipples. Eventually the nipples and buds will get bigger, darker, and sometimes even pointy, becoming rounder and fuller over time. Her boobs will feel a little tender, and one breast may be bigger than the other. Let her know that this is totally normal and won't last forever. It's OK to give her acetaminophen if she's particularly sore. At this stage, you might want to get her a cupless or sports bra to help give her support and protect her tender breast tissue from rubbing against material that might irritate her, says Sherrie Strong, owner of a lingerie store in Snellville, Georgia. How to deal: It's going to be hard adjusting to your daughter's new body, particularly if she's filling out quickly and looking more like a woman than a little girl. Try not to make a big deal about it -- she's probably self-conscious enough. Tori (not her real name), a Frisco, Texas, mom of four, simply put her daughter Gabi (not her real name), then 12, in a T-shirt to help her get a visual on why she needed a bra. Ally (not her real name), a New York City mom, gave her daughter, Carmen (not her real name),  now 12, a bra heads-up about two years ago. "I just treated it like getting broccoli," says Ally. "When we went to Target, I'd say, 'Hey, pick out some bras you like and throw them in the basket.' Now she loves them so much she sleeps in them." Parenting.com: How to get your kid to open up to you Tori had a hard time finding a bra that fit Gabi properly. Eventually a friend who works at Victoria's Secret offered to measure her daughter so they'd know exactly what size to buy. Getting fitted is a smart move; go as often as you would have her sized for shoes, says Strong: "Some girls seem to go to sleep an A cup and wake up the next day a C cup." Wearing a bra that fits well will help protect her from backaches, uncomfortable straps, and stretch marks, which come when the tissue in the breast is unsupported, she adds. Menstruation When to expect it: Between 10 and 15, with most typically getting their periods about two years after their breasts start to develop. Many girls also get a vaginal mucus-like discharge about six months before they menstruate for the first time. What to expect: She's likely to have all the symptoms you have when you get your period: backaches, cramps, acne, PMS -- the works. Don't expect it to be regular at first -- it can take as long as two years before she'll establish a cycle. How to deal: My talk with my mom about menstruation went something like this: Me: "Mommy? We learned about periods in health class today. The teacher said we should get this kit. It comes with books and pads and stuff." My mom: "OK." That was it. I don't want this for Mari and her 6-year-old sister, Lila, and you probably don't either. If you haven't already, tell your tween what will happen. No need to get all technical about it, just say, "Every girl's reproductive system -- the part that helps your body make babies when you're a grown-up -- is going to start working. There will be blood. You are not going to die. It's natural and normal. It'll be yucky. And sometimes your tummy will hurt. And you'll have a really bad attitude. But it happens to all of us." One way to start the discussion might be the way Tori did: when her girls discovered her pads and tampons in the bathroom. "My motto is if they ask, I'll answer the best I can. I did tell them how to use pads, and that they'd get cramps, backaches, acne, and all that good stuff."      Though my mom wasn't nearly as communicative, the kit she eventually purchased for me certainly helped prepare me for what was to come. I also remember thinking it was incredibly cool to have my own stash of stuff. You can buy some kits online -- the Dot Girl's First Period Kit (available at http://www.dotgirlproducts.com/) and the Petite Amie My First Cycle Kit For Girls (at http://www.mypetiteamie.com/index.php?q=Home) come with pads, tampons, and booklets for less than $25 apiece -- but it's pretty easy to make one on your own for much less. Check out the Kotex and Tampax Web sites; they're full of information you can print out and put into a cute cosmetics bag with pads and tampons. You can add other items, too, like a heating pad, pain relievers, and sanitary wipes. What to Expect When You Have a Boy Muscles When to expect them: Somewhere between age 11 and late teens (and for some, even early adulthood) What to expect: He won't look like Arnold Schwarzenegger overnight, but your son will start getting more muscular, mostly in his arms and shoulders. The male puberty hormone, testosterone, is working with growth hormones to make him fill out. Don't be surprised if you catch him making Hulk poses in the mirror -- or asking for dumbbells. Parenting.com: 11 big-kid milestones Dede King, a Brownsville, Pennsylvania, mom of five, says that every night before bed, her 10-year-old, Cameron, does two sets of light weights he bought with her permission. "It's kind of humorous that I'm reading him his Boxcar Children story at the same time that he's trying to bulk up to look like a man," King says. How to deal: He might be in a rush to keep up with his pals, but his developing muscles won't be able to withstand heavy weight lifting until he's about 13 years old, and even then it's important for him to have supervision and to increase weight slowly. Explain to him that the best way to build up his muscles is by eating healthfully and doing all the things kids do -- running, jumping, playing -- and doing team sports, says Charles Cappetta, M.D, adjunct associate professor of pediatrics at Dartmouth Medical School. And if he wants to "work out," calisthenics, like push-ups, pull-ups, and squats, are better for him now and still build muscles. Sweating it out five days a week is plenty, no more than one hour a day. Wet dreams + Masturbation When to expect them: Between 10 and 14 for wet dreams; around 12 or 13 for masturbation (though it can begin sooner) What to expect: As his body produces more testosterone, your son may start to ejaculate semen at night. Sometimes an erotic dream accompanies these releases; sometimes it doesn't. If they weren't masturbating before, most boys will figure out how to pleasure themselves around the time they hit puberty. (Girls masturbate, too -- it just seems to be a bigger part of boys' lives.)  Nona (not her real name), a mom from Atlanta, Georgia, suspects her 11-year-old son has been masturbating for at least a year. He "politely goes into his room, closes the door, and goes to town!" she says. "How do I know? Well, he practically jumps off the bed each time I open the door. I'm not quite sure why he hasn't figured out that he can just lock it." How to deal: If you haven't talked to your son about wet dreams and he has one, he might think he's peed in the bed, so give him the 411 and tell him this is perfectly normal. If he's embarrassed by the thought of his mom or dad changing his wet sheets, put an extra set in his closet and show him how to change the bed himself.   Also, try to remember that masturbation is normal human behavior -- even though it's emotionally hard to accept the fact that your child is evolving into a sexual being. The more you remind yourself of this, the easier it will be to discuss it with him, while laying down some rules. Let him know that pleasuring himself is something he should do in private, and that he should never do it in a public place or a heavily trafficked room in the house where people could walk in on him. Parents have a new responsibility, too: It's time to start knocking on the bedroom door before barging in. Parenting.com: How to talk to kids about sex   If you (or your tween) find it too uncomfortable to bring up the subject, try this: Kathy (not her real name), of Greenbrae, California, fills an envelope with pieces of paper, each with a hot-button tween and teen concern like drinking, wet dreams, or shaving written on it, and has her son, now 15, pick one out every couple of weeks. The goal is to vary the level of mortifying subjects so they all get the same casual approach, says Kathy. "We call them Ten-Minute Topics. He actually looks forward to these conversations, and they often go longer than 10 minutes!" What to Expect in Both Attitude When to expect it: 'Tude can start before any physical changes. For girls, between 7 and 14; for boys, between 9 and 15 What to expect: Brace yourself: Hormones won't just change children's bodies -- they'll go straight to their brains, too. Their emotions will go on more roller-coaster rides than the summer crowds at Six Flags. Sensitive. Moody. Intense. Like you when you're PMS'ing, but about 1,000 times uglier. As tweens get older, the influx of hormones triggers abrupt mood swings and irritability. Part of the freak-out comes, too, when tweens see the physical changes their bodies are going through and realize they have no control over them.    Elizabeth Donovan, a child mental-health therapist based in Centreville, Virginia, calls it the "eye-rolling, foot-stomping, you're-so-lame-Mom-and-Dad" stage. Ally calls it hard as hell. "She's a monster," she says of her 12-year-old, fresh off an argument over whether she can "hang out" at a local pizza parlor with her friends -- sans adult supervision. Carmen's push for autonomy on everything from how she dresses to whom she befriends turns into almost daily arguments. "I think the peer pressure is there, but the hormones are also conspiring against us," says her mom. Parenting.com: Are tweens the new toddlers? How to deal: Try not to take it personally -- she's acting crazy because the hormones are making her crazy, and she's looking for more autonomy because she sees this with her friends and on TV. Besides, you're a safe target; your kid knows you won't reject her, no matter how obnoxious she acts.  It's more important now than ever to set boundaries and establish new rules. "What your kid needs right now is a parent who's supportive and understanding, but also firm and consistent," says Donovan. Stay calm, don't get caught up in the arguments, and give your child a cooldown period so that the two of you can think about what you really want to say and how to say it, she suggests.  But by all means, give appropriate consequences for bad behavior. "For example, if she refuses to stop screaming at you, consider taking away a privilege -- something she really wants to do," says Donovan. "The key is consistency. If you say you will take away her trip to the mall, then you must do it; otherwise, she'll believe you don't mean what you say, and the negative behavior will increase." Ally says letting Carmen have her say goes a long way in controlling the blowups. "We do let her vent about how much we're ruining her life," she says. "And even though I really do want to cut her off, I let her talk and I repeat back to her what she says so she sees I'm listening." Another coping mechanism: Laughing as much as she and her husband can when they're alone, says Ally. "We have to -- to keep from losing it." Stinky Underarms + Body Hair When to expect it: For both boys and girls, beginning at age 9 What to expect: Puberty hormones make hair pop out everywhere: Boys will get it under their arms and on their chests, legs, pubic area, behind, and face; girls will get it under their arms and on their legs and pubic region. And thanks to estrogen or testosterone's effect on a tween's sweat glands, your kid will eventually start smelling like a little construction worker after a hard, hot day even if he's not sweating that much.  Talia (not her real name), of West Palm Beach, Florida, says she'll never forget the first time she noticed that her son, Smith (not his real name),  then 10, smelled. "I picked him up from basketball, and all of a sudden it was just like, 'Whoa!' Now he wears Extra for Men." How to deal: When it comes to girls and shaving, choosing the right time to start is a decision (ideally) you both make together. That said, don't be surprised if she pipes up around fifth grade. There's really nothing wrong with her shaving now (as long as you show her how to do it safely), but it can't hurt to try to encourage her to put it off a year or so. Reminding her that once she starts shaving it's usually a lifelong commitment may just do the trick. Beards on boys are generally the last to develop (think high school) -- you've got time on this one! Parenting.com: Why we feel uncomfortable addressing our children's sexuality As for the first time you notice your kid smells, um, different, keep your approach simple: Explain that now that her body is changing, she needs to be vigilant about showering, washing under her arms, and using a deodorant. Just expect your child to forget to use it.  "Smith would run out of deodorant and wouldn't tell us because it wasn't important to him. We had a couple of years of him just not using it, or us having to remind him to wash under his arms with soap and use the deodorant. I struggled with him for a long time as far as hygiene goes." But Talia's aunt gave her some wisdom that got her through the funk years: When he wants attention from girls, he'll remember every day, she said. Smith is 14 now -- and Talia's aunt was right. He's got his own toiletry bag and an interest in a girl he met at school. Bye-bye, funkmaster. Hello, Romeo.

 That night after the pediatrician told us to talk to Mari about The Change, Nick helped Lila take her bath alone so that I could chat with Mari as she took a bath in our bathroom. While she splashed around in the bubbles, I told her about her changing body -- about boobies and periods, hair and curves, and cramps and PMS. I showed her my sanitary napkins and tampons, and told her about how scared I was when I got my first period, and how I wished I could have talked to my mom when it happened. And I assured her that no question she had on the subject was off-limits with me.  She didn't say much -- just nodded her head a bit and promised she'd come to me if she had questions. And then she went back to splashing around in her bubbles, happy to be my little girl, if only for a little while longer.

   Faubert set for loan move to Real MadridStory Highlights West Ham reveal Julien Faubert is set for loan move to Real Madrid  Spanish champions keen to sign wide right midfield player   Faubert has failed to secure regular first team place at Upton ParkNext Article in World Sport »    



 


 

  (CNN)  -- West Ham's out of favor French midfielder Julien Faubert is set for an unlikely loan move to Spanish giants Real Madrid. 
Faubert is set to be given a fresh chance to prove his talent at Real Madrid. 
 West Ham have given Faubert permission to talk to Real after he has failed to feature regularly in their first team this season. The Premier League club's chief executive Scott Duxbury broke the news on his club's official Web site www.whufc.com:  "Julien has struggled to get into Gianfranco Zola's team this season -- and despite the high hopes we had for him when he joined us 18 months ago, he has not had the best of times.  "He had asked the manager about a possible move, and we felt it right to let him talk to Real Madrid. "If it does not happen then we will, of course, welcome Julien back into the squad. "

 Real coach Juande Ramos has been linked with a number of players as he attempts to fill a perceived weakness on the wide right of midfield, with Jermaine Pennant, Aaron Lennon and Antonio Valencia all mentioned. But their interest in Faubert, who joined West Ham from Bordeaux in 2007, took pundits by surprise. Duxbury said Real first contacted him on Friday morning with a view to a loan move ahead of a permanent signing in the summer. "If Julien does go on loan, then we will look to quickly bring in a replacement,"  he added. Faubert spent much of last season on the sidelines with a ruptured Achilles tendon and has struggled to regain his best form.

 New York gubernatorial candidate criticizes gays From Cheryl Robinson, CNN  Paladino: Homosexuality not validSTORY HIGHLIGHTSRepublican Carl Paladino says homosexuality isn't "equally valid" with heterosexuality"There is nothing to be proud of in being a dysfunctional homosexual," his prepared remarks sayA spokesman for Paladino's opponent says comments reveal "stunning homophobia"Remarks come as New York police respond to anti-gay hate crimes against 4 men New York (CNN) -- New York Republican gubernatorial candidate Carl Paladino criticized gays Sunday, saying he didn't want children "to be brainwashed into thinking that homosexuality is an equally valid or successful option," compared to heterosexuality. "It isn't," Paladino said at a stop in Brooklyn, New York. A prepared version of his remarks obtained by CNN from New York affiliate NY1 said that "There is nothing to be proud of in being a dysfunctional homosexual," though Paladino did not wind up delivering that line. "That's not how (God) created us," the prepared remarks continued, though Paladino did not say those words. Paladino distributed copies of his prepared remarks to reporters at the event, an address to a group of Orthodox Jews in Brooklyn's Williamsburg neighborhood. The candidate's remarks came a day after New York police announced the arrest of an eighth suspect in a series of brutal, anti-gay hate crimes against four men.

The incident last weekend involved three victims being held against their will by as many as nine assailants who beat them in a vacant apartment and sodomized two of them, police said. A fourth victim was beaten and robbed in connection with the attacks. "Don't misquote me as wanting to hurt homosexual people in any way," Paladino said Sunday. "That would be a dastardly lie -- my approach is live and let live." "I just think my children and your children would be much better off and much more successful getting married and raising a family," he said. Paladino also slammed his Democratic opponent, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, for marching in New York's gay pride parade in June. "That's not the example that we should be showing the children and certainly not in our schools," he said. Cuomo spokesman Josh Vlasto responded to Paladino's comments Sunday. "Mr. Paladino's statement displays a stunning homophobia and a glaring disregard for basic equality," Vlasto said in a statement. "These comments along with other views he has espoused make it clear that he is way out of the mainstream and is unfit to represent New York." Paladino's remarks also drew fire from gay rights groups. "Carl Paladino's comments would matter if they were coming from a serious political figure, however they are not," said Christopher Barron, chairman of the gay conservative group GOProud, in an email to CNN. "They are instead coming from the imploding campaign of a man with the personal baggage of John Edwards and all the electability of Alan Keyes." But Paladino's campaign manager, Michael Caputo, stood by the gubernatorial candidate's comments on homosexuality. "Carl Paladino's position on this is exactly equivalent to the Catholic Church," Caputo told CNN. "And if Andrew Cuomo has a problem with the Catholic Church's position on abortion and homosexuality, he needs to take it up with his parish priest." CNN's Mark Preston contributed to this report.

  (CNN) -- Lotus will return to Formula One in 2010 after being handed the 13th team franchise on Tuesday, while the seemingly doomed Sauber may also be on the grid following a takeover deal. 
BMW Sauber's Nick Heidfeld may still have a chance to race in Formula One next year. 
 Lotus, which has had legendary drivers such as Jim Clark, Graham Hill, Stirling Moss, Nigel Mansell and Ayrton Senna on its books, will be back on the circuit for the first time since 1994 after gaining the nod ahead of Sauber and Epsilon Euskadi. However, world motorsport's governing body the FIA has given Sauber a "reserve" place following the emergence of a new owner to take over from BMW, which is pulling out of F1 at the end of this season due to financial reasons. The FIA also announced that it is hoping to persuade the other teams to expand the grid to 28 cars next year, thus allowing Sauber -- which has been bought by Swiss-based Qadbak Investments Ltd -- to compete. "BMW Sauber will be entitled to fill any vacancy that arises on the 2010 grid," the FIA said in a statement on Tuesday.

 "In addition, the FIA believes that a good case can be made for expanding the grid to 14 teams."  Qadbak represents the interests of Middle East and European-based families, according to the official F1 Web site, and will be fronted by Swiss national Lionel Fischer. The Lotus name has been resurrected by a partnership between the Malaysian government and a consortium of Malaysian entrepreneurs, and the team will initially be based in Britain -- in Norfolk, near the Lotus Cars factory. Its technical director will be Mike Gascoyne, who has performed the same role for Force India, Toyota, Renault and Jordan in a 20-year F1 career. Lotus has already agreed an engine supply deal with Cosworth, and is expected to select from a shortlist of six drivers by late October to fill its two race seats for next year.

 (CNN) -- The newly-rescued Sauber team have been awarded the 13th place on the grid for the 2010 Formula One season. Motorsport's world ruling body the FIA revealed on Thursday that the Switzerland-based team will take the place of Toyota, who have decided to quit F1. Pete Sauber bought back the outfit from BMW last week after the German car manufacturer also decided to pull out of racing's premier category. The 66-year-old had run his own marque for 13 years before selling a majority holding to BMW in 2005, and he will again be at the helm after agreeing a deal which saved the team's Hinwil headquarters. "The FIA has written to inform BMW Sauber AG that their application for an entry in the 2010 FIA Formula One World Championship has been successful," the governing body said in a statement on its Web site. "Subject to their signing the Concorde Agreement, BMW Sauber will be awarded the 13th entry in the championship, taking the place of the departing Toyota team.  "The FIA has worked closely with the commercial rights holder (Bernie Ecclestone) and the teams involved over recent weeks, and is grateful for their support in achieving the best outcome for the sport."  Sauber have yet to indicate who next year's drivers will be, having finished sixth in the team standings in 2009 with Poland's Robert Kubica and Nick Heidfeld of Germany at the wheel.

 Kobayashi handed F1 drive with Sauber    Kamui Kobayashi has earned a Formula One drive with Sauber on the back of his impressive displays for Toyota. STORY HIGHLIGHTSKamui Kobayashi is handed a drive with the newly-formed Sauber team for the 2010 Formula One seasonKobayashi performed well for Toyota in the final two races of last season while deputising for Timo GlockThe 23-year-old appeared certain to be handed a permanent drive with Toyota -- before their withdrawal  (CNN) -- Kamui Kobayashi has been handed a drive with the newly-formed Sauber team for the 2010 Formula One season. Kobayashi performed superbly for Toyota in the final two races of last season while deputising for Timo Glock, who sustained a leg injury following a heavy crash in qualifying for the Japanese GP.  After the 23-year-old Japanese finished ninth in Brazil and a magnificent sixth in Abu Dhabi, he appeared certain to be handed a permanent drive with Toyota -- before their withdrawal from F1.  "In the final two grands prix of last season Kamui was granted an unexpected chance to show his skills, and he made impressive use of it," team chief Peter Sauber said on their official Web site. 
I am proud to be able to carry on flying the Japanese flag in Formula One."-- Kamui Kobayashi 

"Particularly in the Abu Dhabi race he demonstrated not only that he can drive fast and aggressively, but also his ability to successfully implement a strategy.  "I am convinced he has a great deal of potential and will be able to make the most of it in our team."  Kobayashi, who has previously competed in Formula Renault, Formula Three Euro Series, GP2 and GP2 Asia, winning the latter title last year, is naturally thrilled to be continuing his career in F1.  "Ever since the start of my career I have dreamed of racing in Formula One," said Kobayashi. "Now this dream has come true. I am very happy my two races in 2009 earned me a cockpit place.  "I will do my very best for Peter Sauber's team, and I am proud to be able to carry on flying the Japanese flag in Formula One."

Mexico

 Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- A gubernatorial candidate in the state of Tamaulipas, Mexico, was killed by gunfire Monday morning near Ciudad Victoria, a top government official reported. The candidate, identified as Rodolfo Torre Cantu, belonged to the Institutional Revolutionary Party, known by its Spanish acronym PRI. "This is an absolutely reproachable act that fills all of Mexican society with indignation," Interior Secretary Fernando Gomez Mont said Monday afternoon in a brief televised statement. "All of Mexico should condemn this cowardly act." Three other people, including Torre's campaign manager, also were killed in the ambush, Gomez Mont said. A Tamaulipas state lawmaker, Enrique Blackmore, was among those killed.  Another four were wounded and transported to the Doctor Norberto Trevino General Hospital in Tamaulipas, where they were under heavy guard, the government-run Notimex news agency said. Mexican President Felipe Calderon said that the federal government would give its unconditional support to the investigation of Monday's killing.  "This is an aggression not just against a citizen, but against all of society," Calderon said.  Torre's killing was an attack on the democratic institutions of Mexico, he said.  Calderon said that the fight against drug cartels must continue, and that organized crime cannot be allowed to interfere with elections.  Mexico holds elections Sunday for 12 governorships and state and municipal offices. Torre was considered a front-runner in his race. Election officials in Tamaulipas were to meet Monday to discuss whether Sunday's elections would be postponed because of the killing. In a statement, Torre's political party expressed its condolences for those killed. The assassination will "inevitably contribute to the disturbance of this (election) process that we see as the adequate path to reach robust democracy, as opposed to those who have preferred violence," PRI leader Beatriz Paredes said.  "Nothing will intimidate us," the statement added.  Torre was the second Mexican politician killed this month. Gunmen shot and killed Guadalupe Mayor Jesus Manuel Lara Rodriguez on June 19 as his wife and child watched. No one has claimed responsibility for either assassination.

 (CNN) -- Egidio Torre Cantu, brother of slain Mexican gubernatorial candidate Rodolfo Torre Cantu, was chosen by the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, to take his place on the ballot, a PRI official told CNN.  The naming of the new candidate comes just days before Sunday's elections. Rodolfo Torre, candidate for governor in the border state of Tamaulipas, was gunned down Monday morning near Ciudad Victoria, Mexico. No arrests have been made in the killing, which was presumably carried out by one of the drug cartels fighting for control of the Tamaulipas corridor. It was the highest profile killing of a Mexican political candidate since the 1994 assassination of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio. "This has not been an easy decision," Egidio Torre said after his party officially registered him with the state electoral commission. "The most powerful reason that has brought me here is the loss of my brother, that vital loss, the inconsolable absence of my brother Rodolfo." Egidio Torre has some political experience, having been mayor of Ciudad Victoria from 2000-2001. His election by party leaders as the replacement candidate was surprising to some, as he was not on any of the shortlists that were circulating on the eve of the decision. Although he is the new candidate, the ballots will not be modified and will carry his slain brother's name. Rodolfo Torre was a front-runner in the race for the governorship. Wednesday was also the last day of campaigning before the vote. Three others were killed in the shooting that ended Rodolfo Torre's life, including a state lawmaker, Enrique Blackmore. Mexican President Felipe Calderon responded by asking all political parties to unite behind the common enemy of organized crime. Calderon has led a campaign against drug cartels operating in his country, as violence has escalated to unprecedented levels.
