   A year later, Amazon's Kindle finds a nicheStory Highlights Amazon.com's electronic Kindle reader celebrates its first birthday  Device holds about 200 digital books and can reduce bookshelf clutter  Sales have been steady, but the device so far remains mostly a tech novelty  Oprah Winfrey has praised it, but J.K. Rowling vows no e-versions of "Harry Potter" Next Article in Technology »   By  Zach Pontz  CNN 



 


 

  (CNN) -- It has the curves of a Lamborghini, looks like something an astronaut might take into space and weighs only 10.3 ounces.  
Amazon's Kindle e-reader is wireless and can hold about 200 books, plus newspapers and magazines. 
 Amazon.com's electronic Kindle reader -- a device meant to remove the paper from the page and make reading both more convenient and eco-friendly -- is celebrating its first birthday. Released in November 2007, the Kindle has sold more than a quarter million units. Its texts account for 10 percent of Amazon's book sales despite the fact that 200,000 titles -- a tiny fraction of the books offered on the site -- are available in digital form.  While exact sales figures are hard to come by, recent estimates have put the Kindle's sales on par with other high-profile mobile devices in their first year. Amazon.com says that the Kindle is currently sold out due to heavy demand.   So what has spurred its success? After all, electronic books have been around, in small numbers, for about a decade. Even Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and CEO, has admitted that the book is "elegantly suited to its purpose. It's hard to improve on."   One thing that's helped the Kindle is marketing. Where other readers failed to connect with consumers, the Kindle has excelled. The media-savvy Bezos has hardly been publicity shy, gaining his electronic toy a level of exposure most CEOs couldn't begin to fathom. "You can't discount the prominence of having Amazon behind this," says Paul Reynolds, technology editor at Consumer Reports. "Jeff Bezos is respected for what he's done with Amazon, and if he feels this is a future product in media, people are willing to trust him."

 Second, the gadget has been heralded by Oprah Winfrey, whose influence in the publishing world is immense. It's also been embraced by some prominent writers, including Nobel laureate Toni Morrison and best-selling thriller author James Patterson. Third, with more and more consumers accustomed to reading text on their cell phones and BlackBerrys, the world finally may be ready for an electronic version of a book. "I checked it out on Amazon and thought it was an intriguing idea, a great way to have a lot of books that don't take up a lot of space," says Emily Branch of Florida, who was moved to buy a Kindle after seeing the hosts of "The View" chatting about it. "I figured if I didn't like it I could return it within 30 days," Branch says. "There wasn't a chance of that happening once I got it in my hands though."    One clutter-killing Kindle can hold about 200 books. And while other e-readers such as Sony's Reader must connect through a USB port to upload content, the Kindle is a wireless device, thanks to Whispernet, which is powered by Sprint's high-speed data network.  "I think the Whispernet is what sets the Kindle apart from all the other e-readers on the market," says Leslie Nicoll of Portland, Maine, who co-authored "The Amazon Kindle F.A.Q." book after her tech-loving teenage daughter urged her to get a Kindle. Like Branch, Nicoll says she likes the Kindle's low-impact effect on her bookshelves. "I don't have to worry about giving it to someone else, reselling it on Amazon or finding a place to store it in my house," she says. "For the enjoyment and convenience, it has given me in the past seven months, I consider that it has paid for itself already."  Readers can visit Amazon's online store and upload a new book right to their Kindle. Subscribers also can have electronic versions of The New York Times and other newspapers and magazines delivered automatically to their Kindles in time for reading with their morning cup of coffee.  "The large and tightly interacting collection of Kindle features, that go far beyond those of any other previous e-Book attempt, will cause the Kindle to be the first e-Book to succeed," wrote one reviewer on an Amazon discussion board. But not everything in Kindle world is roses and gumdrops. There's a difference between modest early success and making a centuries-old print format obsolete. The Kindle sells for $359, a steep price for the average reader in the current economic climate.  "I'm not going to pay $360 for that. I can get books for free," says Nikki Johnson, a college student in Atlanta, Georgia, speaking for traditionalists who are wary of giving up their bound paper volumes.  "There's nothing like reading a nice paperback," she says. "There's nothing like holding or carrying a book, having that tangible quality and it being more than just a piece of data." So in an unforgiving economy and in a stubbornly old-fashioned medium, will the Kindle ever expand from a tech novelty to a mainstream accessory? It might be too soon to tell.  Blockbuster writers such as J.K. Rowling, author of the "Harry Potter" series, have said they'll never allow their books to appear on the market in electronic form. Yet future, better versions of e-readers may seduce younger consumers who grew up on PSPs and iPhones. A next-generation model of the Kindle is due in 2009. Early reports indicate the new device will be thinner and will have fixed some current design bugs, such as poorly placed buttons that cause readers to turn pages accidentally. "I think it's certainly a ways away from hitting the mainstream ... because of the price and the experience a reader gets from long-form reading," says Reynolds of Consumer Reports. "Whether these ... are successful, stand-alone devices remains to be seen. From what I've seen and heard, I think the technology is here to stay."

   Amazon: 'Glitch' caused gay censorship errorStory Highlights Amazon: Move was caused by "embarrassing ham-fisted cataloguing error"  Titles from authors such as Gore Vidal, Annie Proulx lost best-seller ranking  Ranking is number that Amazon uses to show how well one title sells  Book titles removed from charts are gay and lesbian-themed Next Article in Technology »   By  Paul Armstrong CNN 



 


 

  LONDON, England (CNN) -- Online retailer Amazon has said a system error caused it to remove a number of gay and lesbian-themed books from its sales charts. 
American novelist Gore Vidal has long been known as a liberal intellectual. 
 On Sunday, a number of distinguished writers, including Gore Vidal, Annie Proulx and E.M. Forster, suddenly lost their best-seller ranking -- which is the number that Amazon uses to show how well one title sells compared with another. As a result, famous novels such as Proulx's "Brokeback Mountain" and Vidal's "The City and the Pillar" were unranked Tuesday morning. However, Playboy: The Complete Centerfolds" by Chronicle Books, which features pictures of over 600 naked women, remains ranked.  Amazon spokeswoman Patty Smith told CNN partner Web site CNET News that the "glitch" was being fixed, but declined to elaborate. "This is an embarrassing and ham-fisted cataloging error for a company that prides itself on offering complete selection," she wrote in an e-mail statement.  "It has been misreported that the issue was limited to Gay & Lesbian themed titles -- in fact, it impacted 57,310 books in a number of broad categories such as Health, Mind & Body, Reproductive & Sexual Medicine, and Erotica," the statement said.  "This problem impacted books not just in the United States but globally. It affected not just sales rank but also had the effect of removing the books from Amazon's main product search."  Craig Seymour, author of gay memoir "All I Could Bare," wrote in his blog, "craigspoplife," that his sales rank was dropped earlier this year, only to be restored after a month. Amazon said his book had been classified as an "adult product."

 "I brought this to the attention of my publisher, and they started looking into it," Seymour wrote. "I also did some snooping around and it turned out that the only books I could find without a "sales rank" had gay content like mine."   Thousands of users have voiced their concerns online, with many accusing the retail giant of blatant censorship. This prompted Amazon to deny the move was part of a strategy to make the chart more "family friendly." It said the changes were caused by a "glitch" in the system.  The ranking removal appeared to depend on how Amazon originally categorized each book.  According to the Guardian newspaper, a paperback edition of British broadcaster and actor Stephen Fry's autobiography "Moab Is My Washpot," which Amazon tags as "gay," is unranked, whereas the original hardback, filed under "memoir," is.   The issue quickly became a hot topic over the weekend among Twitter users. In conversations under the hash tag "#amazonfail," people tagged hundreds of titles affected by the apparent glitch. Others simply mocked the e-tailer. Share your views here "Looks like Amazon did a government style u-turn. Of course it was an error, yes," was the sardonic response from Jonnyp. Houseinrlyeh, meanwhile, said "apologies work best when they contain an actual apology and not just an explanation."   Nara Filippon was one of the many outraged Facebook users to make their feelings known on various discussion boards. After describing herself as a loyal customer she said: "Unfortunately your new policy to ban LGBT books has disappointed me and I won't be buying anything else from your Web site from now onwards." Wendy Sumner Winter, who described herself as a straight college professor, said: "I am sickened to see that the powers-that-be have de-ranked some of my favorite authors and their books, including James Baldwin (are you serious!?), Mark Doty and Paul Lisicky."

 WikiLeaks, Amazon and the new threat to internet speech By Rebecca MacKinnon, Special to CNN      STORY HIGHLIGHTSRebecca MacKinnon says many differ on whether media should publish WikiLeaks cablesWhat's troubling, she says, is that Sen. Joe Lieberman can get Amazon to dump it from serverShe asks: What are private sector's responsibilities to prevent erosion of free speech?Writer: Future of free speech on internet turns on companies' accountability to public interestEditor's note: Rebecca MacKinnon is a Bernard L. Schwartz Senior Fellow at the New America Foundation, co-founder of the international bloggers' network Global Voices Online and a founding member of the Global Network Initiative. Her book, "Consent of the Networked," will be published late next year by Basic Books.  (CNN) -- In the physical world, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is a wanted man. In the virtual world, his website is under attack and on the run. There isn't much question that the person who obtained the WikiLeaks cables from a classified U.S. government network broke U.S. law and should expect to face the consequences. The legal rights of a website that publishes material acquired from that person, however, are much more controversial. There are many prominent Americans -- and a great many ordinary Americans -- who have made their views clear over the past week that WikiLeaks' "cablegate" website should not be considered constitutionally protected speech.  Others, however, believe equally strongly that now that the material is out, news media and website owners have the right to publish the material. What is troubling and dangerous is that in the internet age, public discourse increasingly depends on digital spaces created, owned and operated by private companies. The result is that one politician has more power than ever to shut down controversial speech unilaterally with one phone call. After suffering aggressive cyber attacks last weekend, Assange removed his "cablegate" site from servers in Sweden and purchased a new home for it on Amazon's web hosting service. On Tuesday, Amazon talked on the phone with the office of Sen. Joe Lieberman, chairman of the Senate's committee on homeland security.

Shortly thereafter, Amazon booted WikiLeaks. The senator responded with a statement: "I wish that Amazon had taken this action earlier based on WikiLeaks' previous publication of classified material. The company's decision to cut off WikiLeaks now is the right decision and should set the standard for other companies WikiLeaks is using to distribute its illegally seized material." This is not the first time Lieberman has demanded that an American internet company take down controversial material. Last time, the outcome was different. In 2008, Lieberman wrote to Google CEO Eric Schmidt, demanding immediate removal of "content produced by Islamist terrorist organizations from YouTube."  While YouTube did remove a few videos that violated community guidelines against violence and hate speech, it refused to remove most of them. Google's lawyers determined that the material Lieberman wanted removed, while upsetting to many Americans, was clearly protected under the First Amendment. "While we respect and understand [Lieberman's] views, YouTube encourages free speech and defends everyone's right to express unpopular points of view," Schmidt wrote in his response.  He continued: "We believe YouTube is a richer and more relevant platform for users precisely because it hosts a diverse range of views, and rather than stifle debate, we allow our users to view all acceptable content and make up their own minds." The New York Times editorial page chimed in: "While it is fortunate that Mr. Lieberman does not have the power to tell YouTube that it must remove videos, it is profoundly disturbing that an influential senator would even consider telling a media company to shut down constitutionally protected speech." Amazon's dumping of WikiLeaks at one senator's request brings into stark relief one of the core problems Americans have grappled with since before our country even existed: Where is the right balance between security, on one hand, and civil liberties, on the other?   We have always disagreed passionately. Much of American politics and a large number of constitutional battles center on this question. One might even argue that our political and legal systems are designed to enable this argument to continue indefinitely as new technologies and challenges arise. But the WikiLeaks Amazon case also highlights a new problem for American democracy -- and ultimately for the future of freedom and democracy more globally. A substantial if not critical amount of our political discourse has moved into the digital realm. This realm is largely made up of virtual spaces that are created, owned and operated by the private sector. As far as the law is concerned, Amazon is off the hook. Speech within the kingdom of Amazonia -- run by its sovereign Jeff Bezos and his board of directors with help from the wise counsel and judgment of the company's executives -- is not protected in the same way that speech is constitutionally protected in America's public spaces.  The law gives Amazon the right to set its own rules. The company's terms of service clearly state that it "reserves the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, remove or edit content in its sole discretion." By clicking "agree," the customer has legally consented to "represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the content," and that said content "will not cause injury to any person or entity." Given that citizens are increasingly dependent on privately owned spaces for our politics and public discourse, however, the fight over how speech should be governed in a democracy is focused increasingly on questions of how private companies should or shouldn't control speech conducted on and across their networks and platforms. We are facing new questions on which Americans have no clear consensus, and which were not covered in civics class: How will decisions made by private internet and telecommunications companies about what content they will or won't allow affect the ability of citizens to carry out informed debate on important matters of public concern? What are the private sector's obligations and responsibilities to prevent the erosion of democracy? While Amazon was within its legal rights, the company has nonetheless sent a clear signal to its users: If you engage in controversial speech that some individual members of the U.S. government don't like -- even if there is a strong case to be made that your speech is constitutionally protected -- Amazon is going to dump you at the first sign of trouble. Let's hope that there will always be other companies willing to stand up for our rights as enshrined both in the U.S. Constitution and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights -- and by extension their right to do business with us.  The future of freedom in the internet age may well depend on whether we the people can succeed in holding companies that now act as arbiters of the public discourse accountable to the public interest. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rebecca MacKinnon.

   'Uncontacted tribe' sighted in AmazonStory Highlights The photos are published on the National Indian Foundation's Web site  Government: Men appear strong and healthy, live in communal shelters   "Uncontacted tribes" are thought to have had no contact with outsiders Next Article in World »   Read  VIDEO  PHOTOS    



 


 

  (CNN) -- Researchers have produced aerial photos of jungle dwellers who they say are among the few remaining peoples on Earth who have had no contact with the outside world. 



 Taken from a small airplane, the photos show men outside thatched communal huts, necks craned upward, pointing bows toward the air in a remote corner of the Amazonian rainforest. The National Indian Foundation, a government agency in Brazil, published the photos Thursday on its Web site. It tracks "uncontacted tribes" -- indigenous groups that are thought to have had no contact with outsiders -- and seeks to protect them from encroachment. More than 100 uncontacted tribes remain worldwide, and about half live in the remote reaches of the Amazonian rainforest in Peru or Brazil, near the recently photographed tribe, according to Survival International, a nonprofit group that advocates for the rights of indigenous people. "All are in grave danger of being forced off their land, killed or decimated by new diseases," the organization said Thursday. Illegal logging in Peru is threatening several uncontacted groups, pushing them over the border with Brazil and toward potential conflicts with about 500 uncontacted Indians living on the Brazilian side, Survival International said. Its director, Stephen Cory, said the new photographs highlight the need to protect uncontacted people from intrusion by the outside world. "These pictures are further evidence that uncontacted tribes really do exist," Cory said in a statement. "The world needs to wake up to this, and ensure that their territory is protected in accordance with international law. Otherwise, they will soon be made extinct." 




   The photos released Thursday show men who look strong and healthy, the Brazilian government said. They and their relatives apparently live in six communal shelters known as malocas, according to the government, which has tracked at least four uncontacted groups in the region for the past 20 years.

 Yann Martel, award-winning author of the "Life of Pi," has spent the last three weeks trekking in the Andes mountains in Peru. He's there with Cape Farewell, a British organization that aims to increase awareness of climate change by taking artists and musicians to see its impact first hand. Here he writes exclusively for CNN. PUERTO MALDONADO, Peru -- I am writing these words in Puerto Maldonado, a hot and bustling town in the south-east of Peru. 
The team of 18 artists and scientists prepare to camp overnight near the Humantay Glacier Lake. 
 The town is bustling because its economic prospects look good. It lies near fields of oil and gas, gold mining has been going on in the nearby rivers for years, tourism brings in its share of revenue and -- the final blessing -- the paving of the Inter-Oceanic Highway is nearly complete. This highway links Peru to South America's economic superpower, Brazil, and will make commerce with Puerto Maldonado easier and more appealing. So the future looks bright, right? Not quite. Why? Because Puerto Maldonado sits in the Amazonian basin. The town is surrounded by the greatest biodiversity this planet has to offer. The average hectare of North American forest contains five species of trees. The average hectare of forest in the Amazon boasts over two hundred. A single tree here may be home to over a hundred species of termites. Professor Yadvinder Malhi of Oxford University, an expert on ecology, told me that likely 80 percent of animal species in the Amazon rainforest are still unknown to science. Life here is so abundant it's claustrophobic and overwhelming.

 But it's not indestructible. And that's why I'm here, with others from the Cape Farewell project. Cape Farewell is a British NGO that brings together artists and climate change scientists. The scientists come to work, the artists come to watch, learn and, eventually, each in his or her own way, to react. The aim is to broaden the dialogue about climate change so that it becomes a broader cultural issue, involving each of us in a whole-person way beyond the narrower strictures of politics or science.   Cape Farewell has organized a number of expeditions to the Arctic, that canary in the coalmine when it comes to climate change. Witness of these expeditions can be found on the organization's excellent Web site. This trip to Peru has been the first organized by Cape Farewell to look at the effects of climate change in the tropics. It's been a memorable trip. We started high and dry, at 14,000 feet to be exact, camping near some fast-disappearing Andean glaciers not far from Cusco, and we've been moving steadily downwards in the last three weeks to the low and the very wet.

 On our way, we trekked the Trocha Union, a cloud forest trail that was so rich and dense with vegetation that we regularly stooped through tunnels of it, roots falling around us like static rain. We also traveled by boat down the Madre de Dios river, one of the many tributaries of the mighty Amazon, visiting a number of field stations where scientists from various universities are studying the stupendous wealth of the Amazonian ecosystem. What have I learnt? It's too early yet to say for sure, but I'll venture this: We, all of us, must learn that fine balance between the prosperity of our own species and the well-being of the planet, we must, like hot and bustling Puerto Maldonado, manage our economic assets so that our affairs continue to be bustling without our environment becoming too hot.

 Hiker hopes to complete historic Amazon River trek on MondayBy the CNN Wire Staff   STORY HIGHLIGHTSEd Stafford set out to become the first person to walk all of the river's roughly 4,000 milesHe's hoping to raise international awareness about deforestationStafford started his hike in April 2008A forestry worker from Peru has accompanied him for most of the trip (CNN) -- After hiking along the Amazon River for more than two years, Ed Stafford is suddenly in a rush. The native Brit, who set out to become the first person to walk all of the river's roughly 4,000 miles more than two years ago, is hoping to finish his hike on Monday, in time to catch his scheduled flight home to Leicestershire from Brazil. Despite collapsing from exhaustion on a roadside Sunday morning, Stafford is confident he'll make the plane. "Feeling much better," he wrote in a blog post from northeastern Brazil on Sunday, after catching three hours of sleep. "...will walk all night from now to complete the remaining 85 kilometers." It's the kind of fortitude that Stafford has summoned time and again since setting out from the Amazon's River source in Peru in April 2008, seeking to raise international attention about rain-forest destruction and to help raise funds to combat it. Since then, Stafford and Gadiel "Cho" Sanchez Rivera -- a Peruvian forestry worker who joined him in July 2008 -- have encountered pit vipers, electric eels, anaconda, mosquitoes and scorpions, but very few doubts about whether they'd reach the Atlantic.

"After grabbing something to eat, and replying to emails I finally got my head down at 1:27 a.m.," Stafford wrote in a piece for CNN.com last week, after hiking for 15 straight hours. "We've never walked 55km in a day before so we are satisfied with what we've achieved, if a little stiff." Stafford, a former British army captain, and his hiking buddy have seen their share of setbacks. Stafford contracted cutaneous leishmaniasis, a skin disease, and had to have a botfly removed from his skull. Cho suffered a nasty machete cut. But their biggest challenges were far less dramatic. "Although everyone would like me to say that the hardest thing has been our encounters with (indigenous residents) pointing bows and arrows at our chest, for me that wasn't the hardest part," Stafford said last month, " ... the adrenalin kicks in and you deal with exciting, potentially dangerous moments like that easily." "It's been the mundane that had really challenged me," he said. "... The weight of the rucksack, the basic food, the constant mosquito bites, the constant thorns. The little things that in a two-day expedition wouldn't bother you have been the things that have actually been challenging." The greatest pleasures of the journey, Stafford said, have been the warmth of the Brazilian people, with village children frequently welcoming him and Cho to new towns and their parents offering home-cooked meals. Having never visited the Amazon before starting his expedition, Stafford now says that his quest to save the region won't end with his hike. "I'm committed now to this place for the rest of my life," he wrote on CNN.com this month, "and I intend to take 'Walking The Amazon' around the world and keep alive the stories of the people we've met along the way, the lives in the Amazon and the tale of the jungle." Though he says that deforestation means the Amazon "is changing faster than many of us can comprehend," Stafford has also found reasons to be hopeful about its survival while hiking. "Although (deforestation) is sill going on in the moment," he said, "there's a generation coming through Brazil that are very aware of environmental issue and really do care about the Amazon." As he closes in on the Amazon's mouth, Stafford has found time to nurse less lofty desires. He says the first thing he'll do after touching down in England is grab a pint of beer. And his Peruvian partner, he says, can't wait for a pint of fresh milk.
