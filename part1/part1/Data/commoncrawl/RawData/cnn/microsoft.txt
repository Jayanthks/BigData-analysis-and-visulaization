Will Microsoft ruling affect campaign contributions?

June  7, 2000
Web posted at:  6:31 PM EDT (2231 GMT)


By Ian Christopher McCaleb

WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Some Democratic lawmakers situated in Washington -- most specifically current Vice President and presidential aspirant Al Gore -- shouldn't expect too much in the way of campaign contributions from Microsoft, following Wednesday's federal court ruling that the company be split into two separate entities.





Microsoft officials, including company co-founder and Chairman Bill Gates, are none too pleased with the administration of President Bill Clinton and Vice President Gore, which they hold at least partly responsible for the judge's final ruling.


In April, Gates told a closed-door meeting of the House Republican Conference that the company believed a different administration would likely have treated Microsoft more favorably than did the Clinton-Gore Administration.


This, despite an appearance at the White House by Gates during that very same trip to Washington for the administration's high-profile "New Economy" summit.


On the afternoon of Wednesday, April 5, Gates participated in a discussion panel at the conference. He sat next to the president, and the two appeared to get on well, sharing the occasional private word as others spoke -- belying the bitterness expressed by Gates to Republican majority lawmakers in the House.


Sources on both sides -- administration and Microsoft respectively -- said at the time that the anti-trust case against Microsoft was not discussed at that White House event.


Just a day prior to the beginning of the New Economy summit, a Microsoft source told CNN that Gates would accept Clinton's invitation to attend, saying he would do so "to send a signal" that the sprawling firm remained an economic powerhouse despite the contentious court proceedings.


The White House's invitation to Gates, the source said, "tells us that the White House agrees."


Gates, who until very recently was not known as someone who wore his political leanings on his sleeve, has attempted to match wits with the corporate adversaries whose complaints led to Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's antitrust ruling against the company earlier this year; with Judge Jackson himself; and with the Clinton Justice Department by using the court system to his company's full advantage, and by becoming more politically active.


And what better way to engage in corporate activity than to crack open a few wallets -- including his own.

Cash decline for the Dems, expected boosts for the Republicans

According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Microsoft has contributed $1.1 million dollars in soft money to both major political parties this cycle -- $529,000 to the Democrats, and $607,000 to Republicans.


The software giant gave another $700,000 to individual candidates -- and it is those numbers that tell the story behind the company's newfound political activism.


The Center for Responsive Politics looked at how much Microsoft employees gave to the two presidential candidates -- Gore, and Republican Texas Gov. George W. Bush.


According to the non-partisan political contribution watchdog's database, Gore received $20,000 in contributions from Microsoft employees from Jan. 1, 1999 to Jan. 1, 2000, while Bush received just a shade under $35,000 in the same time period.


The watchdog's latest archived donation information was first made available by the Federal Election Commission on March 1.


Granted, Gore received his money months before Jackson issued his premier antitrust ruling against Microsoft in April of this year, and his popularity with Microsoft insiders is difficult to gauge based on numbers this old.


But consider this: In the same time period, former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's Democratic rival during the primary season who posted no victories before withdrawing in March, received $30,050 in donations from Microsoft employees.


Since that time, Microsoft's lobbying operations have kicked into gear in Washington, and their hardest work appears to center on Bush's campaign efforts.


Gore says the nation's anti-monopoly laws are critical to fostering competition -- something Gates and company may not want to hear in the long run.


But Bush has taken a position that appears to be more sympathetic to Microsoft.
                                              
"You know the fundamental question is, is Microsoft an innovative entity that is providing jobs; are they disrupting an economy that is changing so rapidly? I think the great fear is that Microsoft will be broken up," Bush said recently.
                                        
The Texas governor won't talk about the Microsoft case  now -- at least until it is resolved. But if it is still in the appeals court by the Clinton administration's end, the next president might well be able to influence its outcome.
                                        
"If the case is in play, then the next administration, if it wanted to could try to settle with Microsoft on more generous terms than what this administration has pursued," speculated Bob Litan of the Brookings Institute.


A spokesman for Microsoft says Gates and the company are not even looking for a political solution -- that it is a legal matter, and they'll fight it in court.


But their money is talking all the same.


In May, Microsoft participated in a high-profile Washington fund-raiser for Bush. Lobbyists for the firm sat on the 90-member host committee for the event, which, at $1,000 a head, aimed to raise some $350,000 to $400,000.


Indications are that Microsoft's giving will continue, and the next donation numbers released by the Federal Election Commission will be telling.


Republican lawmakers are beginning to fall in behind Microsoft.  Following Wednesday's ruling, Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles (R-Oklahoma), said, "Today may be a good day for the Clinton administration legislation-by-litigation agenda, but it is a sad day for the American consumer."


It is important to note that the Redmond, Washington-based firm hasn't turned Republican just because of the efforts of the Clinton administration's Justice Department.


Microsoft realizes there are many friendly Democrats out there, and donated some $67,000 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in the first three months of this year.

Microsoft to offer Linux software?




















   Story Tools














SEATTLE, Washington (Reuters) -- In a major strategy shift, Microsoft Corp. will introduce software based on the Linux  open source operating system in 2004 for Web services and server software, market researcher META Group predicted on Monday.


Microsoft, which denied that it had any plans to develop software for Linux, is facing a growing threat from the open source software standard as it gains share in the corporate server market used to manage networks and data.


META Group predicted that Linux will be used on nearly half of new servers by 2007, up from its current share of 15 to 20 percent, making it difficult for Microsoft to ignore Linux as a platform for its database, Web hosting and e-mail server applications.


"We believe that, beginning in late 2004, Microsoft (and its partners) will begin moving some of its (to-date) proprietary application enablers (e.g., .Net components) to the Linux environment; this will gradually include the major Microsoft back-office products, such as SQL Server, IIS, and Exchange," META Group said.

Group: Microsoft will lower prices

In a further shift, META Group said that Microsoft will also re-price or separate its Windows server operating system "so that it can be favorably compared against 'free' Linux."


"I'm unaware of any efforts at this time to move any products onto Linux," said Peter Houston, senior director at Microsoft's server group, adding that there were no plans to detach or re-price its Windows server operating system.


"We have made a bet on Windows, and we believe that customers are getting value from the bet we made," said Houston, "and we're going to continue doing what we've been doing for customers."


Linux advocates argue that Linux offers better security, flexibility and innovation because its underlying code, or blueprint, for programs remains open to evaluation and scrutiny.


Microsoft, which has grown into the world's largest software maker by selling proprietary software that cannot be copied or modified freely, said it is not opposed to open-source software, and points out that its source code is available to approved partners and educational institutions on a limited basis.


Microsoft faced a similar situation a decade ago when its nascent server software was competing head-to-head with market leader Sun Microsystems Inc. , but Microsoft did not choose at the time to write software for Sun's proprietary version of Unix.

Linux use grows

Now Linux, essentially a free version of Unix, is eating away at Sun's share of the business server market.


Sun, a hardware and software maker, is now selling computers running Linux, a strategy that was also embraced by International Business Machines Corp.


Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft has toned down its criticism of Linux recently, after an internal strategy document said that some of its arguments against open source software has "backfired."


Instead, Microsoft has stressed that its software is more affordable when considering the total cost of using Linux, including ongoing personnel and administration costs.

Microsoft fights back

A recent Microsoft-sponsored study by researcher IDC concluded that servers based on Microsoft's Windows 2000 were cheaper to own and operate when used for networking, storing and sharing files, printing and security, while Linux servers were cheaper to operate when used for Web hosting.


"The IDC study shows that the upfront cost is a small part of the total cost to the customer," said Microsoft's Houston.


META Group's report also came to the same conclusion, saying that Linux's total costs of ownership were likely to be higher for mainstream server applications.


"IT organizations must evaluate platform costs from a total-cost-of-ownership perspective," META Group's report said.

Microsoft offers free tool for security checks






 From...































By Matt  Berger
 (IDG) -- DEEP IN THE midst of an effort to beef up the security of its software, Microsoft Monday made available a free tool designed to search out security vulnerabilities hiding in Windows-based computers.
Called the Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA), the tool is intended to provide users with an easy way to check their systems for common problems that arise when computers are configured incorrectly or when users fail to install suggested patches, Microsoft said.

After scanning a system with the tool, users receive a security report card that lists all the holes and vulnerabilities found during the scan. The MBSA does not actually download and install fixes but provides instructions how to do so.
It can be installed on Windows 2000 desktop and server operating systems as well as the Home and Professional Editions of Windows XP, Microsoft said. Users must also have version 5.1 or higher of Internet Explorer.
The MBSA can also be used to scan for security holes on the following software: Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Internet Information Server 4.0 and 5.0, SQL Server 7.0 and 2000, Internet Explorer 5.01 and later, and Office 2000 and XP.

Developed with the help of Shavlik Technologies in St. Paul, Minnesota, Microsoft first detailed the tool at the RSA Security Conference in February.

   Microsoft aiming to recover lost ground in mobileStory Highlights Windows Mobile exec: Microsoft strategy shift will soon pay dividends  New approach focuses on services that help connect the phone to the PC and Web  Windows Mobile was created for handheld computers that didn't connect to a network  New strategy will be announced at a mobile tech conference in Barcelona next month Next Article in Technology »   By Ina Fried 



 


 

 
 (CNET) -- Microsoft has made some stumbles in the mobile world, but a strategy shift made more than a year ago will soon pay dividends, the company's top Windows Mobile executive said in an interview with CNET News. 
Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer discusses his Windows Mobile offerings earlier this month at CES in Las Vegas. 
 Andy Lees, the executive brought over from the server unit a year ago, said that Microsoft's efforts to make sure that its mobile software could run on a wide range of phones resulted in an operating system that failed to take advantage of advances in hardware. "We aimed to go for a lower common denominator," Lees said. Microsoft was also limited by the origins of Windows Mobile, which was developed to power handheld computers that neither connected to a network nor handled voice. "We started out when we were in PDAs (personal digital assistants) and then a phone got strapped to the back of the PDA," Lees said. The company also failed to recognize that phones--even those that were used for business--were still as much personal as they were professional. Meanwhile, Apple and Google have joined the fray with operating systems designed from the ground up to take advantage of the latest in phone technology. But Lees said that Microsoft embarked on a new strategy some time ago that will come to fruition over the next 18 months. The first steps in that strategy, he said, will be announced at the Mobile World Congress conference that takes place in Barcelona in the middle of next month.

 "You are going to see a bunch of announcements at Mobile World Congress but also it is going to be the beginning of a 12-, 18-month period where you are going to see a whole bunch of different stuff," Lees said. Part of Microsoft's new strategy, Lees said, is not relying on operating system upgrades to improve its products. The new approach, while still making money by selling a mobile operating system, places considerable focus on services that help connect the phone to the PC and Web as well as devices such as the Xbox. Microsoft has two separate teams at work on the services piece. One is Microsoft's Windows Live group, while the other is a rather secretive group headed by former Mac unit head Roz Ho--a group that also includes the team Microsoft acquired when it bought Danger. Lees declined to say specifically what Ho is up to, however. But Lees acknowledged the company also needs to improve that core operating system, which is widely seen as lagging that of most of its rivals. For some time now, Microsoft has been working on a significant overhaul of its operating system, known as Windows Mobile 7. However, that project has hit delays, prompting Microsoft to push forward with an interim update, Windows Mobile 6.5, which the company is widely expected to detail next month. Lees declined to comment specifically on either version of the operating system, but promised the company would have more to say on the OS front in Barcelona. Lees also promised that Microsoft would start working more closely with hardware makers. He pointed to deals late last year with LG and Samsung. He noted that the power of the kinds of phones that come out next year will be incredible, well beyond even today's devices. Phones next year will have dual-core processors, super-fast data connections, and graphics power rivaling that of the original Xbox. "That's a phenomenal thing on a phone," he said. The phones of the future will also have location information beyond just GPS sensors. "It will know where it is pointing, it will know which angle it is being held at." Web browsing has been another weak spot for Microsoft. The company made up some ground late last year with a pocket browser that essentially crams the desktop Internet Explorer 6 into a Windows Mobile phone. But it lacks the kind of easy zooming and gesture recognition present on the iPhone or in Palm's Pre. Lees promised that Microsoft would surpass those interfaces by the end of the year. Lees would not confirm details of a rumored rival to Apple's App Store, reportedly known as SkyMarket. "There is some question whether we can more directly connect the developer and the end user," he said. "We're looking at that." Apple dismissed the notion that Microsoft and others are catching up to the iPhone, however. On a conference call with analysts last week, Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer dismissed the growing competition from rivals saying Apple remained "years ahead" in the phone business. "Our competitors are scrambling to try and copy our success," he said.

   Microsoft readies smartphone assault on AppleStory Highlights Microsoft is getting ready to launch an online marketplace akin to Apple's App Store  Microsoft is also readying an upgraded version of its mobile operating system  Announcement expected next week at the Mobile World Congress trade show  Developments were first reported in the Wall Street Journal Next Article in Technology »   By Marguerite Reardon 



 


 

 
 (CNET) -- Microsoft is gearing up to take on rival Apple in the smartphone market. 
Microsoft and CEO Steve Ballmer will launch an online store for smartphone applications, a report says. 
 The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that Microsoft is getting ready to launch an online marketplace akin to Apple's App Store. Microsoft is also readying a more sophisticated version of its mobile operating system called Windows Mobile 6.5, the Journal reported. Smartphones are sophisticated mobile phones that offer users access to the Web and e-mail, as well as, provide phone calling and all kinds of other messaging options. This category of device is the hottest thing going in the mobile market and is seen as the biggest growth engine for mobile devices over the next few years. Microsoft, which only makes the operating software for these devices, holds third place in terms of worldwide market share, according to research firm IDC. Symbian, which powers Nokia's smartphones, is by far the leader, followed by Research In Motion with its BlackBerry devices.  Even though Apple seems to be the most talked about smartphone on the market these days, it's only in fifth place in terms of overall market share for 2008, IDC said. But Apple is quickly gobbling up market share and has become a serious threat to Microsoft and every other company competing in the smartphone market. With the release of the iPhone 3G last summer, Apple has tripled its market share from 3 percent in 2007 to 9 percent in 2008, according to IDC.

 Meanwhile, Microsoft only grew from 11 percent market share in 2007 to 12.3 percent in 2008. Microsoft is facing several challenges as it tries to catch Apple's growth rate. For one, the company's business model is based primarily on licensing software to hardware vendors. While this business model worked fine just a couple of years ago, it's difficult to justify now given that device makers can get free software from Symbian, Google Android, and Linux. The second problem that Microsoft faces is that the company has been almost exclusively focused on business customers. Over the past year, smartphone users have gravitated toward more consumer applications. In addition, to their work e-mail, they want multimedia functionality and social-networking applications on their phones. "Microsoft is in a really tough spot," said Ryan Reith, an analyst with IDC. "It has to change its value proposition. And a big part of that is refreshing its user interface and making the device more consumer-friendly." Reith believes this is why it's critical for Microsoft to develop an application marketplace that can compete with Apple's App Store. The App Store went live last summer and offers thousands of applications for the iPhone and iPod Touch music player. The store has been very successful with users downloading thousands of free and fee-based applications. Microsoft already has a developer community creating applications for Windows Mobile devices. But the problem is that many of these applications have been geared toward business users. And there is not a single destination that makes it easy for users to discover and download different applications. "Clearly smartphones are not just for business users anymore," Reith said. "Microsoft needs to work with the developer community to get more consumer applications out there." Microsoft's executives have gotten the message that consumer functionality is hot. And Andy Lees, head of Microsoft's mobile business unit, told the Journal that the company is about to put more emphasis on multimedia and other consumer functions like music and photos. Microsoft is expected to unveil its new offerings next week at the Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona, Spain. Chief Executive Steve Ballmer will be delivering a keynote speech there on February 16. I will be there next week covering the news from the show, as will my CNET Reviews colleagues Bonnie Cha and Kent German. But even with these enhancements, Microsoft has a tough road ahead of it. Competition in the smartphone market is increasing. And several competitors, including Android and RIM, are launching their own version of an application store. On the handset and operating system side, new devices are coming to market that could provide stiff competition for Windows Mobile devices. For example, smartphone pioneer Palm is coming out with new mobile software and a device called Pre later this year. And even though critics have been writing the company's obituary for the last year, the new device, which was unveiled last month at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, has been getting a lot of buzz. But Microsoft thinks it has the right enhancements lined up to take on these competitors, especially Apple. The Journal also reported that Microsoft is talking about a new synchronized data storage service called My Phone. This new service is supposed to make it easier for people to back up their mobile contacts, calendar appointments, photos and text messages, to a Web site. The service is similar to a service that Apple calls MobileMe. The biggest difference will be that Microsoft will offer My Phone for free whereas Apple charges $99 a year for MobileMe. It's too soon to know how Microsoft's new software and application store will stack up against Apple's offering. But one thing is certain, Apple isn't sitting still either. And if Microsoft or any other competitors want to hasten Apple's rise in this market, they'll have to leap-frog Apple with something truly revolutionary.

  Microsoft apologizes for gaffe in online ad Story Highlights Microsoft apologizes for a gaffe in an ad on its Polish Web site  Ad was altered to replace a black businessman's head with that of a white man  "We are looking into how it happened," says a Microsoft spokesman Next Article in Technology »   By  Patrick Oppmann  CNN  



 


 

  SEATTLE, Washington (CNN)  -- Software giant Microsoft apologized Wednesday for the apparent bad judgment that led to the head of a black model being swapped for that of a white model in an online advertisement. 
A black man in an online Microsoft ad was replaced with a white man, bottom, on the company's Polish Web site. 
 The ad -- which showed three business people, one Asian, one white and one black -- was altered on Microsoft's Web site for Poland to place the head of a white man on a black man's body. "We apologized, fixed the error and we are looking into how it happened," said Lou Gellos, a Microsoft spokesman.  He said that because the company was still reviewing how the swap occurred he could not comment further.   On Microsoft's official page on the social network site Twitter, a posting calls the swap "a marketing mistake" and offers "sincere apologies." The episode drew widespread criticism on the Internet after Engadget, an influential tech blog, published news of the gaffe Tuesday.   The business Web site CNET.com wrote that the change in models may have been made with the "racially homogeneous" Polish market in mind. CNET is a CNN.com content partner.

Microsoft, Google expand search-engine tools - CNN.com

  Microsoft, Google expand search-engine toolsStory Highlights Microsoft and Google released new search products this week  Microsoft Bing's "visual search" features images instead of text  Google's Fast Flip aims to replicate the magazine reading experience online  Products are evidence that search-engine market is diversifying Next Article in Technology »  Read VIDEO  By  John D. Sutter and Brandon Griggs CNN 



 


 

  (CNN) -- Say you're buying a dog. You know the breed you want; you can picture it in your head. But what was the name? A bull terrier? A pit bull? A bull mastiff? 

Bing's "visual search" and Google's Fast Flip produce search results as images. 


 Or what if you're in the market for a new camera? You saw a friend with a credit-card-thin model at a party last weekend. But was that a Canon? A Nikon? A brand you've never heard of? If you're like many people, you'd turn to the Internet for answers. But you type in "dog breeds" or "digital cameras" into Google and punch enter, and a big list of blue links comes up. You don't see the dog you want. You don't find the camera, either -- at least not quickly.    Such quandaries are the driving force behind Bing's new "visual search" function, which lets Web users troll through image catalogues instead of Web pages when they know what something looks like but can't put their finger on the name. The examples are also evidence that the search engine market, once dominated by simple rectangular search bars and the lists of Web pages that follow, is diversifying. People who once were happy with a one-search-fits-all model are finding exceptions, and a number of niche search products are trying to respond to these increasingly diverse needs.   Also this week, Google introduced a test product called Fast Flip, which takes a retro look at Web design by making online news look like something magazine readers will find familiar.

E-books catching on with readers


The future of libraries, with or without books


 The company has other news products -- namely Google Reader and Google News -- but is looking for ways to make news content more visual and to share some of the revenue. The new products come as Microsoft's Bing continues to elbow for more room in an online search market that Google has dominated for years. In June, 65 percent of all Internet searchers were done through Google sites, according to comScore. Microsoft caught only 8.4 percent of searchers in the same period. Fast Flip, an experimental feature of Google Labs, is a Web application that allows users to scan news articles from 39 print and online publishers, including The New York Times, Newsweek, TechCrunch and Us magazine. Users can "flip" through a horizontal stream of screen grabs of articles as they appear on the partners' Web sites, with layout, design and images intact. You can click once on a story to enlarge the page; a second click takes you to the partner's site. Users also can browse popular topics (the economy, Taylor Swift) or search for others of their choosing. Google says the idea behind the new service is to make online news-browsing faster and replicate the reading experience of flipping through a magazine or newspaper.  Unlike Google News, which emphasizes breaking news articles from the past 24 hours, Fast Flip "is more for stories with a longer shelf life," Google spokesman Chris Gaither said. "We think there's a lot of room for innovation in how people consume news articles on the Web," Gaither said. "The easier it is for people to browse articles quickly, the more they'll read."   Loren Baker, editor of Search Engine Journal, says that increases in bandwidth make "visual search" functions more successful today than in previous years, when images would load more slowly. Baker believes that Google Fast Flip could make it easier for people to scan news articles on their netbooks, tablets or even smartphones. "I don't have to sift through my bookmarks. I don't even have to leave Google," he said. "It's almost like a virtual newsstand on my handheld." But not everyone is excited about Google's new product.   "If this is the future of news, I think news is kind of screwed," said Frederic Lardinois, a writer at ReadWriteWeb, a technology blog. Lardinois said the interface is backward-thinking and is hard to use. Fast Flip is in a test phase and will incorporate feedback from users, Gaither said. Google also is seeking to expand the roster of Fast Flip partners, he said. Some tech observers say Bing's hyper-visual search function gives it a new leg up on Google in terms of functionality.  Nova Spivack, a search expert and founder of Twine, said the most important thing about Bing's visual search is that users can sort the images into categories.  By creating different kinds of searches and making them sortable, Bing is catering to high-end Internet users -- which, soon, will be everyone, he said. "I think Bing has realized that everybody is becoming a search geek," he said.  On the dog-breed search example, users can filter the images to include only terriers, or hypoallergenic dogs or toy dogs, or dogs that need a medium level of exercise, so they don't have to scroll through hundreds of photos to find the dog they're searching for.   Mary Jo Foley, editor of the All About Microsoft blog at ZDNet, said she personally finds Bing's visual search useless because she's not a visually minded person. But she said it's an example of search engines diversifying, and that's a good thing for everyone. "I think the idea for Microsoft and Google and Yahoo is to present things in new ways and say, 'What if you could do this? Would you want to do it this way?' " She added: "Not all people search in the same way, and not all people want to get their results in the same way." There are about 50 galleries of images in the new Bing visual search bin, but more will be added, and eventually the idea will be integrated into the main search site, said Stefan Weitz, director of Bing. Right now, users have to go to a separate page to find the visual searches. 





 David Coursey, a blogger at PCWorld.com, said the search works like a "visual dictionary." "I think Bing is onto something," he said. "And if they can figure out how to extend Bing's visual search, it could be very helpful for people who know what something looks like but don't know what to call it."

   $250K Microsoft bounty to catch worm creatorStory Highlights Software giant Microsoft offers $250,000 bounty to catch Conficker author  Industry analysts say is one of the most serious infections they have ever seen  The worm exploits a bug in Microsoft's ubiquitous Windows software  Virus could allow its creators to hijack entire networks Next Article in Technology »   By  Barry Neild  CNN 



 


 

  (CNN) -- Software giant Microsoft is offering a $250,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of hackers behind a powerful computer virus that could lead to millions of PCs being hijacked. 
Experts say a single infected laptop could expose an entire network to the worm. 
 Experts have so far been baffled by the true purpose of the Conficker or Downadup virus, but have described its spread as one of the most serious infections ever seen. The worm exploits a bug in Microsoft Windows to infect mainly corporate networks, then -- although it has yet to cause any harm -- it opens a link back to its point of origin, meaning it can receive further orders to wreak havoc.   Microsoft has issued a patch to fix the bug, however if a single machine is infected in a large network, it will spread unchecked -- often reinfecting machines that have been disinfected. The threat from the virus prompted Microsoft in collaboration with other technology industry names to this week announce a $250,000 reward for information to track down those behind Conficker.

 "As part of Microsoft's ongoing security efforts, we constantly look for ways to use a diverse set of tools and develop methodologies to protect our customers," said George Stathakopoulos, of Microsoft's Trustworthy Computing Group. Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at anti-virus firm F-Secure says the true scope of the virus is not known, but in the past 24 hours his company monitored Conficker signals from two million Internet protocol addresses. "That's a lot," he told CNN. "And one IP address here does not mean one infected computer, it means at least one infected computer.  "Many of those IP addresses are obviously company proxies or firewalls, hiding hundreds of more infections behind it. Unfortunately this also makes it impossible to estimate the total count of infected systems.  "So it's still big. Very big."  Microsoft has previously paid out similar rewards to informants who helped identify the creator of Sasser, another notorious worm let loose in 2004. The perpetrator was tracked to Germany, where he was sentenced a year later.

 Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Can you throw a party on a tweet? That's just what Microsoft did Thursday night, inviting people on a scavenger hunt to join them for a concert in Atlanta. The event promoted the launch of its new phone, the Kin, which has social media at its heart. The inconspicuous concert in a roller derby hall was headlined by hip-hop icon Big Boi from Outkast and drew more than 1,000 people in less than three hours. Microsoft product manager Jeremiah Glodoveza said the experiment exemplified the power of social media to mobilize an audience -- an idea that is the core concept behind the company's new phone, he said. "We believe in social media," Glodoveza said. "We believe in social networking. The Kin is a phone that was purposefully built for people who are navigating their social lives." The concert, which also featured Southern rapper Jay Electronica and Alabama sensation YelaWolf, was the last of seven secret shows held across the country. The idea was showcased May 8 in San Francisco, California, in an auto body shop. The entourage has since popped up in Chicago, Illinois, and New York, throwing free concerts with A-list performances and local artists, all hosted at the most unexpected locations. "We don't disclose the venue until a couple hours before the show, so people are glued to social networks. They're refreshing their screens non-stop," Glodoveza said.  "It's about bringing people together with their passions and having a great moment ... offline," he added. "It's been excellent, actually," Big Boi said. "It started out by dropping clues, just word of mouth and using Facebook and Twitter and things like that to get the word out, and man, it just blew up." Big Boi, who added that he likes keeping in touch with his fans, said he's recently been releasing singles from his solo debut, "Sir Luscious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty," out July 6, to give his fans something to hold on to. "It's caught on like wildfire," he added. Big Boi is certainly not the first entertainer to use social media to create a flash mob of fans.  His good friend, comedian Dave Chappelle -- best known for his sketch-comedy program "Chappelle's Show," which ended in 2005 -- has held similar events for more than a year.  In July, thousands of people showed up in the middle of the night in downtown Portland, Oregon, to watch Chappelle perform. They learned about the show through text message, Twitter and word of mouth. "It works, man. It definitely works," Big Boi said. Microsoft's Glodoveza says the company -- whose new phone combines the users social networks on its home screen to encourage "natural communication" -- hopes to promote more impulsive and spontaneous events like the one held in Atlanta on Thursday night. "It's not purpose-built to be an iPhone competitor. We built a phone from the ground up with social networking," Glodoveza said. "Our motto is, share life as you're living it."

 Microsoft's Skinput turns hands, arms into buttonsBy  John D. Sutter, CNN   Your body as a touchscreenSTORY HIGHLIGHTS Microsoft and Carnegie Mellon University develop a prototype called Skinput  The system turns a person's arm and hand into a virtual keyboard  Users tap their fingers together and touch their forearm to send messages to gadgets  The prototype won't be commercially available for two to seven years

 Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- In Chris Harrison's ideal world, mobile phones would be the size of matchbooks. They'd have full-size keyboards. They'd browse the Web. They'd play videos. And, most importantly, you'd never have to touch them. Sound like too much to ask? Maybe not.  Harrison, a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University and a former intern at Microsoft Research, has developed a working prototype of a system called Skinput that does just that, essentially by turning a person's hand and forearm into a keyboard and screen. "People don't love the iPhone keyboard. They use them. But they don't love them," Harrison said in a interview at the recent Computer-Human Interaction conference. "If you could make the iPhone keyboard as big as an arm -- that would be huge." Using Skinput, a person could tap their thumb and middle finger together to answer a call; touch their forearm to go to the next track on a music player; or flick the center of their palm to select a menu item. All of these sign-language-like movements, which are customizable, would control a gadget in a person's pocket through a Bluetooth connection. When fitted with a pico-projector, the Skinput system could display an image of a digital keyboard on a person's forearm. So, using Skinput, someone could send text messages by tapping his or her arm in certain places -- without pulling the phone out of a pocket or purse.  "You could pretty much do a lot of what you do on your iPhone," said Harrison, who says Skinput "is [like having] your iPhone on your palm."  The system, which has been under development for eight months, won't be commercially available for two to seven years, said Dan Morris, a Microsoft researcher who is working with Harrison on Skinput. Before that can happen, Skinput's sensors need to get more accurate, he said. In a 13-person trial in Seattle, Washington, Skinput was found to be 96 percent accurate. But that test only used five buttons. The system would have to improve for people to make use of a full keyboard, which would be the "holy grail," Morris said. "The accuracy is good, but it's not quite consumer-level yet," he said. Skinput is one of a number of prototypes, ideas and near-products aiming to make computing more natural.  These devices seek to move beyond the mouse and physical keyboard, letting people communicate with their gadgets by gesturing, using sign language or, in the case of Skinput, tapping on their hands, fingers and forearms. The arm as an instrument Understanding how Skinput works makes it seem all the more futuristic. The system turns a person's arm and hand into a wiggling, pulsating instrument, full of vibrations that can be picked up and translated. Skinput users wear an armband -- the prototype version is made of an elbow brace -- that's lined with 10 sensors. These sensors look like tiny diving boards with dumbbells on one end, and they pick up inaudible sounds that range in frequency from 25 to 78 hertz.  When a Skinput user taps a thumb and middle finger together, the impact sends ripples down the skin and through the bones in the person's arm. "They sort of start resonating -- like guitar strings," Harrison said. The diving-board receivers read the sound waves to figure out what gesture the person made, and then relay that information to a phone. Skinput can tell whether a person tapped a middle finger or an index finger, because the two moves sound slightly different to the springy receivers. The system takes one or two minutes to learn the sounds of a particular person's arm, Morris said, and then it can be used however the user likes. Trial and error When they started working on Skinput, Morris and Harrison weren't sure if it would be possible to turn the human arm into a virtual keypad. The pair tried clipping sensors to the ends of peoples' fingers and other strange configurations that made users feel like cyborgs. "We spent a lot of nights in the lab tapping on our arms and wondering if this would ever happen," Harrison said. But the most profound achievement of Skinput is proving that the human body can be used as a sensor, he said. Morris believes Skinput will make computing accessible to people in a way that never would have been possible before. With Skinput, "literally, computing is always available," he said. A person might walk toward their home, Harrison said, tap their palm to unlock the door and then tap some virtual buttons on their arms to turn on the TV and start flipping through channels. "It's almost like magic," he said.

 Microsoft revamps Hotmail, takes on Google and YahooBy  Doug Gross, CNN    The updates to Hotmail are expected to roll out in the next few weeks. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Hotmail service will get a major overhaul, Microsoft announces  The service is world's most popular e-mail, but it has lagged in innovation  The update eliminates clutter, lets users easily choose which messages to look at  It also will let people use programs like PowerPoint without ever leaving e-mail

Email Software

Internet

 (CNN) -- Hotmail, the world's most widely used e-mail service, is getting a major overhaul from Microsoft in a bid to fend off competitors like Google's Gmail. Microsoft says the planned update to Windows Live Hotmail is designed to remove clutter and let users interact with other sites and applications while checking their mail. In the blog post, Microsoft program manager Dick Craddock said the company studied e-mail usage for a year while considering the changes. "People made it clear to us that the No. 1 thing they wanted their e-mail service to address -- whether it was Hotmail or any other e-mail service -- was to help them manage the clutter in their inbox; not just the spam, but all the mail they get that's clogging their inboxes," he wrote. A key feature to the new Hotmail, which will be rolled out over the next few weeks, will be a "sweep" feature that allows users to clean out their inbox in one fell swoop. The single-click feature lets the user select a single e-mail sender, or multiple senders, and automatically delete every message from that sender. Another single click will let users decide which e-mails they want to look at -- from people on their contacts list, from their social networking sites or otherwise. Microsoft's study showed that only about 25 percent of e-mail people get is from members of their contacts list. The rest tends to be business related, from social networks, tracking of purchases they've made online and spam, the post says. Despite the growing popularity of social networks like Facebook as a way to communicate, Craddock wrote that people are getting more e-mail than ever. While it remains on top of the global e-mail market with roughly 350 million users, the decade-and-a-half old Hotmail has been a largely stagnant service compared to third-place Gmail, which has been steadily picking up users. Yahoo is also more widely used in the United States than Hotmail. Gmail has always offered ways to link up with Google's expansive list of internet offerings, most recently its foray into the world of social networking, Google Buzz. By comparison, Hotmail and Yahoo have offered more-basic mail to their users. Hotmail's proposed changes follow some of what Gmail has done. For example, with the new Hotmail, people will be able to open and edit PowerPoint documents in their e-mail accounts, whether they have PowerPoint installed on their computer or not. Hotmail Active View will give people an automatic preview of their incoming mail, including a look at photos they've received -- both attachments and links to photo sites like Flickr. They'll be able to watch YouTube videos, check social networks and perform other outside tasks without ever leaving e-mail. Gmail has similar features. The proposed changes got mostly positive feedback early Tuesday from the tech community -- where Hotmail's vanilla setup hadn't garnered many fans before. "It'll be hard to steal users away from Gmail -- which still has dozens of minor features that Hotmail doesn't (just check the Labs) -- but Hotmail will most likely be a worthy competitor after the new version is launched this summer," Stan Schroeder of social media blog Mashable, wrote on Tuesday. Harry McCracken of PC World wrote that the new Hotmail could be preferable to Gmail in some ways and pick up new users, particularly from flailing AOL. "Hotmail also feels less densely packaged with stuff," he wrote. "I could see some folks preferring it to Gmail, which is beginning to flirt with bloat."

 Microsoft demos 'Milo' game at TED GlobalBy  Rich Galant, CNN | Filed under: Gaming & Gadgets     Peter Molyneux demonstrates a prototypical Microsoft game called "Milo" at the TED Global conference. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Microsoft demos a prototypical game called "Milo" at the TED Global conference  "Milo" on Microsoft's forthcoming Kinect gaming add-on for the Xbox 360  TED is a group dedicated to "ideas worth spreading"

Editor's Note: CNN partners with TED to feature a talk, with added content, on CNN.com every Tuesday.  Oxford, England (CNN) -- "This talk is a little bit insane," confided Peter Molyneux, the head of the European games division of Microsoft, as he prepared to demo a game called "Milo" at the TED Global conference in Oxford on Tuesday.  He asked audience members to cross their fingers as they waited to see if the live demo would work. "Milo" is a story-telling game about a little boy who's unhappy because his family has moved from London to New England and his parents are too busy to listen to what's on his mind. Molyneux said his goal with the game, which is still under development, is to recreate the feeling he had as a 4-year-old child when his father told him a story about a robot. The idea, he said, is to create a real, living boy in a computer. "Most of it is just a trick, but a trick that works," he said, and the demo seemed to work as well. The Kinect camera, which Molyneux said Microsoft is going to introduce in November, is a device somewhat like Wii, but which controls a game relying on the movement of the player's body, with no controller. In the demo, a player on stage interacted with Milo, showing him where to find snails in his backyard, suggesting that he squash a snail, skimming stones in a lake, and cleaning up the boy's room. Molyneux is the founder of Lionhead Studios, which made the role-playing game "Fable" and which was taken over by Microsoft in 2006.  TED Global is a conference run by the nonprofit TED, which is devoted to "Ideas Worth Spreading." It began as a conference focusing on three subjects -- technology, entertainment and design -- but has expanded its scope and now makes more than 700 talks from its conferences available at ted.com.  Molyneux said Milo will get smarter as millions of people play the game. "As a game developer, the only relationship I have with you is through your thumbs," he said, "and that's pretty limiting."  "Milo" aims to help change that relationship.

 First impressions: Microsoft's Kinect gaming systemBy Larry Frum, Special to CNN | Filed under: Gaming & Gadgets   Microsoft's new controller for the Xbox 360 uses physical movements from the players to control action on the screen. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Kinect introduces a gaming system where there is nothing to hold and no buttons to push  Three camera sensors and four mics help Kinect recognize who is standing in front of it  Microsoft says 30,000 North American retailers will have Kinect available on Thursday (CNN) -- With Kinect, the new controller-free system for its Xbox 360 gaming console, Microsoft isn't just trying to revolutionize video gaming. The company wants to change how people interact with all their entertainment choices. Kinect, which goes on sale Thursday, allows players' physical movements to control action on the screen. Unlike the similar Nintendo Wii or Sony Move, there is nothing to hold and no buttons to push.  Three camera sensors and four microphones help Kinect recognize who is standing in front of it. The system recognizes voice commands and reads a player's full range of movements -- not just swings of the arm -- translating them into an avatar's actions within a game. Alex Kipman, director of incubation for Kinect, said Microsoft is trying to break down technological barriers and make game interaction more natural. "We wanted to transform entertainment where technology understands you," Kipman said during a Kinect demo in Washington. "It was our goal to merge really amazing tech with a really amazing experience." 



XBOX Kinect unleashed


Kipman explained that the specific components used to create Kinect have been around for years. He said the real breakthrough was in the proprietary software used to make it all work together. Cloud profiles, featuring information accessed from the Web on an as-needed basis instead of from a local hard drive, help the Kinect and Xbox 360 learn about users and what types of entertainment they might be interested in. Kinect also will help live-stream music, movies and more in real time.

Microsoft Kinect


The much-anticipated system, first unveiled more than a year ago, is Microsoft's entry in the growing era of motion-controlled gaming pioneered by the Wii in 2006. Sony launched Move, a motion-sensing game controller for its PlayStation 3 console, in September. A Microsoft spokesperson said 30,000 North American retailers would have Kinect available Thursday, with 7,000 of those planning to open at midnight. She would not say how many units would be available on launch day. The system will launch with at least 17 games. I spent four days testing out Kinect, which should appeal to casual gamers and families more than hardcore action gamers. Here are my impressions: Getting started Out of the box, the Kinect sensor is 11 inches long and 3 inches high, including the motorized stand it sits on. Connecting to the Xbox is easy. For the new Xbox 360 Slim consoles, it is plug-and-play -- no additional wires. To use on the original Xbox 360 consoles, you will need a power source for the device. After some software downloads, the Kinect calibrates itself to the room automatically. It is actuated by specific gestures (waving your hand at the Kinect) or by using a specific key word for voice commands ("Xbox"). "It is technology that understands you," Kipman said. "Kinect looks at 48 points on the body to figure out what it should do. It always knows who is in charge." The Kinect should go at or as near eye level as possible so it can read all your movements. Also, it requires a clear space to play so nothing impedes its view of the player and nothing gets bumped or knocked over. Someone playing alone will need to be at least 6 feet back, while two players should be about eight feet from the screen. Kinect comes bundled with "Kinect Adventures," an introductory game that teaches you how to use the device. Hovering your hand over game menu options activates those choices. Five different adventures require the player to move and react to different scenarios. "Rallyball" will get you reacting to things being thrown at you. "River Rush" and "Reflex Ridge" get you dodging and steering. "Space Pop" requires using your arms to propel you in a weightless situation. "20,000 Leaks" will stretch you out as you try to stop water from rushing in through cracked glass. All of these adventures teach players how to use their movements to control the action on the screen. The gestures will come in handy for other Kinect games. Fun with wild animals "Kinectimals" was demonstrated at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles in June, where it received high marks for its cuteness factor -- and lower marks for being, well, a little bizarre. In the game, players get to adopt a virtual pet. Among the 40 choices are a Bengal tiger, lion, panther, cheetah or leopard cub. By using voice commands and body gestures, kids can teach their cub to do tricks, feed and brush their baby animal, or just play games with it. It is definitely a game geared toward younger players. I play a lot of first-person shooter games, but I'll admit there is something neat to rubbing a tiger cub on its belly -- even if it is virtual. Full-body sports "Kinect Sports" cranks up the action with six different games at four different skill levels. From the outdoors to the table top, different sports challenge players to really get involved with the action. Full body movements mimic those that would be needed to really play the sport. Want to score a goal in soccer? Kick the ball. Want to knock out your opponent in boxing? Throw a punch. "The only skill you need is life skill," Kipman said. "If you know how to bowl, you can bowl in our game." The action and movements are lifelike and will get players moving. For example, while you won't actually have a javelin in your hand, you will need to run in place up to the line and throw. The escalating skill levels make it easy for players to learn what to do and master those actions before moving up to more challenging opponents. Wheel-free racing "Kinect Joy Ride" offers different game modes that let you race cars, do stunts or even crash into objects -- and each other. But it doesn't feel quite right because, with Kinect, there is nothing to feel. You control your car by grabbing an imaginary steering wheel. There is no accelerator or brake; the game does that for you automatically. Turning your hands left or right steers the car, but there is no tactile feedback to give you the sensation of running off the road or colliding with a light pole. This isn't a "Grand Turismo" title by any stretch of the imagination. But a racing game should have a feel to it -- this one just leaves you grasping for air. Get your body moving Two other initial titles, "Your Shape: Fitness Evolved" and "Dance Central" are where Kinect really shines. "Your Shape: Fitness Evolved" features workouts created by Men's Health and Women's Health magazines. Players are scored on how well they match the movements of instructors who demonstrate exercises.  There are Zen exercises for relaxation, or cardio boxing if you want to blow off steam in a different way. There are also personalized exercise plans to help lose weight, tone the body or get more energy. The game offers a good workout. Kinect helps correct postures and actions so users can get the most benefits out of the exercises being done. In this way, it really does work well. "Dance Central," made by the creators of "Rock Band," aims to get you moving to the beat, but realizes we all aren't ready to strut our stuff on the dance floor. The game combines today's dance hits performed by pop stars with moves that seem clunky at first but get more involved and intense as the difficulty ratchets up. Like "Guitar Hero," you have to match your movements to those on the screen to get a perfect score. Beyond games Because it has cameras, Kinect also offers the ability to connect via video with other Kinect users -- or those who use Microsoft's Live Messenger program on their PCs. It also works with the other entertainment features for the Xbox 360, such as on-demand ESPN, music from Zune.com and movies from Netflix. "It is all about your choice, your content when you want it," Kipman said. The bottom line I didn't get to test out the 11 other games that Microsoft says will use the new controller. But my experience with the initial six titles shows where Kinect will shine and where it will stumble. Games that feature full-body movement make best use of what Kinect can offer. Syncing up your movements with the movements on the screen is a lot easier and more natural with Kinect than with a normal controller. It's also hard to compare the Kinect to Sony's Move -- the two systems are like apples and oranges. I was pleasantly surprised and amused by Kinect's ability to record video while you are playing. While I was doing hurdles in "Kinect Sports'" track and field, my kitten decided to join the fun and began jumping as I jumped. Needless to say, the resulting video of us provided many laughs after the game. But games that would be better enhanced with a physical device in hand feel flat. On Kinect, they're just not up to the demands that players make from those types of games. You will probably not enjoy racing games and first-person shooter games as much with Kinect that you do with regular controllers. Right now, the Kinect can understand languages from the United States, United Kingdom, Mexico, Japan and Canada -- with more to roll out in the near future. Kipman said they will be constantly refining voice-recognition software to help the system recognize dialects in each language. Prices range from $399 for a 250GB Xbox 360 Kinect bundle to $299 for the 4GB bundle and $149 for the Kinect box by itself, without the console. Is it worth it? That may depend on whether you have kids -- and what kind of gamer you are.

 Microsoft gives up on the Kin, eyes Windows Phone 7By  Doug Gross, CNN | Filed under: Mobile   The Kin phones are geared to a younger audience, but sales have been sluggish.

Microsoft Windows 7

 (CNN) -- Less than two months after rolling out its Kin smartphones, Microsoft is giving up on the teen-friendly devices amid reportedly sluggish sales. The decision, even as the company was hitting TV hard with ads promoting the phones, will allow Microsoft to shift resources from the Kin team to the upcoming Windows Phone 7 series. "Microsoft has made the decision to focus on the Windows Phone 7 launch and will not ship KIN in Europe this fall as planned," said a written statement from a Microsoft spokesman.  Teaming Kin staffers with Phone 7 staffers will allow "incorporating valuable ideas and technologies from KIN into future Windows Phone releases," the statement said. "We will continue to work with Verizon in the U.S. to sell current KIN phones." Just this weekend, Verizon -- the Kin's wireless provider -- slashed prices on the two version of the phone, dropping the lower-end Kin One to $29 and the Kin Two from $99 to $49. The move demonstrates the challenges Microsoft faces in gaining traction in the rapidly growing smartphone market. While Microsoft still dominates the PC software industry, it has watched rivals Apple and Google leap ahead in the mobile category with their popular iPhone and Android operating systems. Announced on April 12, the Kin phones were designed for a "social generation." They feature a touchscreen, a built-in Zune music player, integration with social media sites like Twitter and a visual time line that lets users view social media updates from their friends on multiple sites. Content created on the phones is automatically saved and available, through cloud computing, on any Web browser. Complaints about the phone centered on the cost of its mobile contract, which rivals that of more advanced devices like the iPhone and Android. Microsoft is not releasing sales figures for the Kin, but multiple reports have said they were anemic, possibly falling short of 10,000. The iPhone 4, by contrast, sold 1.7 million units in its first three days. Microsoft's series of phones for the Windows 7 operating systems is expected out by this year's holiday season. Phones running the system will be made by companies like Qualcomm, Samsung, LG, HTC, HP, Dell, Sony Ericsson Toshiba, and Garmin-Asus, Microsoft has said.

Consumer Electronics

 (CNN) -- Microsoft's new smartphone, the Kin, is shooting for a place in the hearts -- and pockets -- of a plugged-in "social generation," the company announced Monday. From the ability to easily download photos from the Windows phone to a home screen that's constantly updated with feeds from services like Facebook and Twitter, Kin is clearly designed for young users for whom social networking is a way of life. "Self-expression is super important to them," said Robert Bach, president of Microsoft's entertainment and devices division. "What they are, what they're doing, they want to share the journey every day. It's like constantly publishing a magazine about their life." The Kin name, Bach said, is for a phone "that knits together a tight community of kindred spirits whose lives are shared and who broadcast all the time." Two phones, the Kin One and Kin Two, will be available next month in Verizon stores. Verizon will be the exclusive wireless provider in the United States, and Vodafone will be the provider internationally. No prices for the phones were announced at Microsoft's rollout event in Redmond, Washington, on Monday afternoon. The Kin One is compact with a roughly square shape, designed to fit easily in a pocket. The Kin Two has a more traditional rectangular shape and is equipped with additional features, like more memory, a high-resolution camera and the ability to shoot high-definition video. The Kin One has 4 gigabytes of memory, while Kin Two has 8. The camera is 5 megapixels in the Kin One and 8 megapixels in the Kin Two. Kin One has a 2.1-inch screen, while Kin Two's is 3.5 inches. Both phones are designed by Sharp Corp. and come with both touchscreen capability and a slide-out keyboard.  The Kins will not run the Windows Phone 7 operating system rolled out by Microsoft in February. But they will share some features, including programs to integrate search engine Bing and music-and-video site Zune. The phones, unlike Apple's iPhone, Android phones and others, will not run applications designed by outside developers. In addition to regular social-network feeds, the Kin will allow users to select "best friends" and give higher priority to any posts by the people on that list. Videos, photos, text messages and links to Web pages can be shared by clicking and dragging them to what Microsoft is calling "The Kin Spot." Their photos, videos and social-network posts will be compiled into a digital timeline, letting the user scroll back and view their posts in chronological order. And content created on the phone will be automatically saved and available, through cloud computing, an any Web browser -- making photos, videos and other content easier to save and share, according to Microsoft. Setting the tone for a product geared toward teens and 20-somethings, Microsoft began its announcement with a video featuring a rock soundtrack, quick-cut editing and a litany of hip young subjects talking about their smartphone needs.

 Microsoft Launches Outlook Facebook Integration 

By Ben Parr, Mashable.com | Filed under: Social Media   Microsoft's Outlook Social Connector syncs social networking feeds with your Outlook contacts. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Outlook Social Connector syncs social networking feeds with your Outlook contacts  New Facebook status updates will pop up in realtime within Outlook  Outlook will only pull data from e-mails connected to Facebook accounts
RELATED TOPICS

Microsoft Corporation

Microsoft Windows Live Messenger

MySpace Inc.

 (Mashable.com) -- Microsoft is announcing today that it has integrated Facebook and Windows Live Messenger into Outlook, bringing the streams of millions of Facebook users into inboxes across the world. Last year, Microsoft launched Outlook Social Connector, a plugin that syncs social networking feeds with your Outlook contacts, giving you immediate data on what they are doing and thinking. It started last year with LinkedIn integration, but soon the company announced MySpace and Facebook were coming. Today, Outlook completes the cycle with not only Facebook integration, but support for Windows Live Messenger as well. Not only that, but the company is releasing the plugin for Outlook 2003 and 2007 users as well, bringing Facebook, MySpace, LinkedIn and Windows Live Messenger to millions of business and personal inboxes worldwide. Last week, we got a sneak peek at the new Outlook at Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Washington. Here's what you can expect from the new Facebook integration, as well some features that you can expect in the near future: Facebook + Outlook = Realtime Contact Data Facebook and Microsoft worked together to get the launch of Facebook's integration in Outlook Social Connector right. Facebook's Strategic Partner Manager Rick Armbrust told us that they worked closely with the Office team to make the experience more social. One of the things he immediately highlighted was the pulling of Facebook profile pictures into Outlook. The entire experience is a step above the Outlook-LinkedIn integration, which itself was pretty strong. Not only does it pull Facebook profile photos so that you can associate a name to a face, but it pulls the news feeds of your contacts into your inbox. When you're looking at someone's e-mail, you'll also get a glance at their status updates, picture uploads and wall posts, among other activities. When you combine that with LinkedIn, MySpace, Windows Live Messenger, and Outlook data, you get a very detailed history of your interaction with your contacts, as well as an at-a-glance look at their activities and interests. Knowing that a potential client just returned from a trip to Hawaii can be all that you need to have the upper hand against your competition. Microsoft Group Product Manager Paco Contreras told us that there's another new feature to the Facebook integration: realtime updates. Thanks to a new update to the social connector platform, also being released today, updates from your contacts will automatically be pushed to your inbox. There's no need to refresh anything: new Facebook status updates will pop up in realtime within Outlook. The Facebook integration does have limitations, though: except for friend requests, Outlook can only pull data from Facebook. There is no "liking" posts or updating your status via Outlook, at least right now. Microsoft says that the next step is to provide a richer social experience by integrating the ability to push data to other social networks, improving the look and feel of Outlook Social Connector, and adding other social networks from other regions. The Social Inbox Microsoft has known for a while that social technologies are going to dominate the web. That was made evident by its $240 million stake in Facebook and its many partnerships and attempts at social media (some of which have bombed). However, Outlook Social Connector has always felt like one of the company's smarter social media plays. Facebook's Rich Armbrust probably put it best: "What's unique is that it's bringing social elements and context from Facebook form your colleagues and your friends into the Outlook experience, which is pretty unique given that there are so many that use Outlook as their primary communiction tool." E-mail isn't inherently a "social" experience (it's not a one-to-many platform), and attempts at integrating social into the inbox (think Google Buzz) have mostly fallen flat. However, social data can be incredibly useful in the business world, especially when you need to understand what your client or colleague is thinking or doing right now. While we'd still love to see Twitter integration in Outlook, Facebook is far larger and, in most cases, has far more useful information. Microsoft's also learned a few lessons from the privacy fiascos Facebook and Google have undergone in recent months. Outlook will only pull data from e-mails connected to Facebook accounts. If your business e-mail isn't linked to your Facebook, your data stream won't appear in Outlook Social Connector. It gives users a choice, although most people do choose to add their work e-mails to Facebook in order to join their company's Facebook network. If you want to learn more about the announcement, Microsoft has also released a short video articulating Outlook's new features.© 2013 MASHABLE.com. All rights reserved.

 Microsoft co-founder pledges to donate majority of fortuneBy  the CNN Wire Staff | Filed under: Web  STORY HIGHLIGHTSPaul Allen will give most of his estate to charityHe is worth an estimated $13.5 billionAllen has donated more than $1 billion over the past 20 years (CNN) -- Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen has pledged to give away most of his fortune to charity. "[M]y philanthropic efforts will continue after my lifetime," Allen said in a statement Thursday.  "I've planned for many years now that the majority of my estate will be left to philanthropy." Allen's commitment comes as two of America's richest men, Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, have invited fellow billionaires to give half their wealth to charity. The unusual initiative is being promoted through the website, "The Giving Pledge," and is aimed at members of the Forbes 400 -- a list of the richest Americans. Philanthropist Eli Broad, worth an estimated $6 billion, was the first to make the promise. During his lifetime, Allen has donated more than a billion dollars through personal giving and his foundation. The 57-year-old billionaire was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in November 2009, more than 25 years after he was treated for Hodgkin's disease, a spokesman at his company Vulcan Inc. said at the time. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, like the less-common Hodgkin's disease, is a cancer of the lymphatic system. Hodgkin's lymphoma is distinguished from the other by the presence of a certain type of cell. Allen, who co-founded Microsoft with Bill Gates in the mid-1970s, was that company's chief technologist until he left in 1983, the year he was treated for Hodgkin's lymphoma, according to the website for his Paul G. Allen Family Foundations. In March, Allen ranked 37th on the Forbes list of the world's billionaires. His net worth was $13.5 billion, according to the magazine. Among Allen's business interests are the professional sports teams he owns, the NFL's Seattle Seahawks and the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers. He also is part owner of Major League Soccer's Seattle Sounders FC.

Navy taps into Microsoft's popular Flight Simulator product




January 26, 2000
 Web posted at: 10:24 a.m. EST (1524 GMT)


by Bob Brewin


 From...


 (IDG) -- Armchair jet jockeys play Microsoft Corp.'s Flight Simulator on their PCs to capture a bit of the thrill of the real thing, which replicates an actual flight experience closely enough that the Navy is making its customized version of Flight Simulator standard issue for all student naval aviators.

The Navy built a software shell that enabled it to configure Flight Simulator for its T-34C training aircraft. The new CD-ROM-based Naval Micro-Simulator Training Aid features the instrument panel from the T-34C as well as a display, which includes scenery from areas surrounding naval aviation training bases in Corpus Christi, Texas, and Pensacola, Fla. Cadets who used the Navy version of Flight Simulator in a test run this summer "had significantly higher flight scores...and fewer below average unsatisfactory flight scores," according to Scott Dunlap, head of the Assessment Project Office for the Chief of Naval Education and Training. Dunlap emphasized that the Navy views the PC-based simulator as an adjunct to, not a replacement for, more complex full-motion flight simulators. Besides student aviators, the Navy plans to issue the CD-ROM to students at the 69 colleges and universities that host Navy Reserve Officer Training Corps units. The Navy micro-simulator CD-ROM also includes a simulation of a nuclear attack submarine distributed by Electronic Arts Inc. that Dunlap said would provide submarine junior officers the ability "to think about the ship as a whole, as part of a total weapons system" rather than focusing on the narrow concerns of their specific specialties or assignments.

Microsoft issues fixes for Win2000 security holes




February 1, 2000
 Web posted at: 8:58 a.m. EST (1358 GMT)

by Douglas F. Gray


 From...



 (IDG) -- Microsoft managed to beat itself to the punch last week, issuing the first patches to fix security holes in the much delayed Windows 2000 operating system -- several weeks before its official release date.  Two security bugs were detected in Microsoft Index Server, search engine software found in both Windows NT and Windows 2000. The first could allow a malicious user to view, but not change, add or delete, files from a Web server, while the second could reveal the physical location of Web directories on the server, according to a security bulletin issued by Microsoft last week. The bulletin also said that the two glitches were unrelated except for the fact that they both were found in the Index Server.

Index Server is a tool designed to allow users to perform full-text, online searches via a Web browser. It was designed to search Word, PowerPoint and Excel documents as well as standard HTML (hypertext markup language) documents, according to information from Microsoft's Web site.

 The first bug, or the Malformed Hit-Highlighting Argument "vulnerability," as Microsoft calls it, allows users to request information beyond their security access via a specific type of malformed request.  "It's highly possible that someone could take advantage of the vulnerability," said David Litchfield, security analyst at U.K.-based Cerberus Information Security, who originally spotted the bug. "But it depends on what the ultimate end of the attacker is," he noted. "If he's trying to look for sensitive files on the Web server. . . or view the source of active server pages, he can do that."  Microsoft's patch, which he has installed on his system, does eliminate the problem, Litchfield said.  More information regarding both security bugs, including the patches, can be found at Microsoft's homepage.

Microsoft's fortune rides on Windows 2000, analysts say





February 8, 2000
 Web posted at: 8:43 a.m. EST (1343 GMT)

by James Niccolai
 (IDG) -- With the launch of its Windows 2000 operating system on Feb. 17, Microsoft will try to move up the software food chain by beginning its assault on the lucrative midrange server business. At stake for the company will be its ability to keep growing at the fairytale rate it has enjoyed for the past half decade, industry analysts said. The new OS will also play a key role in determining whether Microsoft retains its dominant role in the computing industry in the years to come, analysts said. As the focus of IT computing shifts from local networks to the Internet, Microsoft will try to hawk Windows 2000 as a reliable platform on which companies can build e-commerce sites and other types of Web-based applications and services.

"Windows 2000 is an operating system that is so critical for the overall success of Microsoft that it is hard to state it strongly enough," said Daniel Kusnetzky, a program director with research firm International Data Corp. (IDC) in Framingham, Mass., echoing an opinion expressed by several analysts. Since it launched Windows NT 4.0 in 1996, Microsoft has bulldozed aside competitors in the departmental server business -- most notably Novell and IBM -- to help it report financial results that have wowed investors and sent its stock price soaring. The software vendor shipped more than 2 million copies of Windows NT in 1999, up almost 400,000 from 1998, to give it the lion's share of new server OS unit shipments, according to recent figures from IDC.  But its rate of growth in the server OS market, while still strong, is tapering out, analysts said. Because Microsoft already owns such a large slice of the market for file, print and other low-end types of server, achieving the giant percentage gains it has enjoyed in previous years has become almost impossible.  "Microsoft has gotten to a size where it's almost impossible to outgrow the market," Kusnetzky said. "The surprising 60 to 70 percent growth period is over." Microsoft could reverse that trend by selling its new OS in the type of midrange servers used to manage thousands of PC clients, run massive databases and serve up busy e-commerce Web sites. Currently dominated by Unix vendors like Sun Microsystems and Hewlett-Packard, the midrange market promises higher returns on sales and is one that Microsoft has long coveted. Issues of scalability, however, not to mention highly-publicized concerns over the stability of Windows NT, have kept the software vendor for the most part locked out. With Windows 2000 Microsoft hopes to change that. The company claims that the millions of dollars and years of work hours it has invested in the product have produced an OS that is reliable, scalable, manageable and secure enough for demanding enterprise applications. It points to success stories like Dell -- a close ally of Microsoft -- which uses Windows NT to conduct millions of dollars' worth of business through its online store, as proof that its software is reliable. Microsoft is already using Windows 2000 on 300 servers that run its heavily trafficked Web site, as are a few early adopters like Barnes & Noble. Analysts said feedback from Windows 2000 beta testers has been favorable, once they became accustomed to its differences from NT. "Windows 2000 brings a lot of technology to the table. It looks a lot more stable and reliable than Windows NT, and that's the biggest thing Microsoft has going for it," said Al Gillen, a research manager with IDC. "After six years of development it ought to be ready by now," said Laura DiDio, a senior analyst with Giga Information Group. The experiences of beta testers may tell only part of the story, however. Winning in the data center will require Microsoft to create software that performs at its best heterogeneous environments, and that means high levels of interoperability -- something the company hasn't exactly excelled at, analysts said. And where Windows software dominated many LAN environments, Microsoft will need to accept a diminished role if it wants to play in the enterprise computing room.  "Their challenge is to become a good corporate citizen, which means not always being the star of the show but being a supporting player," IDC's Kusnetzky said. "That might mean sometimes standing under the spotlight; at other times it means taking a seat in the orchestra pit." Delivering products in a timely fashion will be another factor. Microsoft originally said it would deliver Windows 2000, formerly called Windows NT 5.0, back in 1997. The version of Windows 2000 aimed at higher-performance servers, called Windows 2000 DataCenter, isn't due to ship until mid-year. This month three versions of the OS will debut: Windows 2000 Professional, the desktop client; Windows 2000 Server; and Windows 2000 Advanced Server. The company has hyped its operating system so much that expectations are sky high, and after numerous delays Microsoft may get only one chance to prove itself, analysts said. IT managers responsible for choosing the critical server environments that keep their businesses up and running won't look kindly on teething problems, and a string of early, publicized failures could cause a major setback. "Unless Microsoft can prove that Windows 2000 is all of those things -- highly interoperable, consistent and reliable -- they can damage themselves and lock themselves out of the computer room for the next decade," Kusnetzky said. Continuing Microsoft's financial success isn't the only thing that makes Windows 2000 a vital release for the company. In a computing environment that has changed rapidly since the release of NT, in which the Internet, electronic commerce and Web-based services look set to predominate, Windows 2000 will be key to helping Microsoft expand its sphere of influence and remain a dominant player in IT computing, analysts said.  Microsoft last month unveiled an initiative called Next Generation Windows Services. Along with Windows DNA 2000, NGWS aims to provide software and tools that allow companies to build new types of services for e-commerce and accessing information and services over the Web. Microsoft hasn't provided specifics about NGWS, but technologies in Windows 2000 are likely to be wedded closely to the new initiative, said Larry Perlstein, a research director with Dataquest in San Jose, Calif.  New members in Microsoft's BackOffice family due later this year, including SQL Server 2000 and Exchange 2000, are also closely tied to features in Windows 2000, in particular a new directory services feature called Active Directory. Such close ties between Windows 2000 and other products in the pipeline intensify the pressure to make Windows 2000 a success, said Carl Howe, a senior analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass., who sees Windows 2000 as "the future of the company." Microsoft could have picked a quieter year to release its new OS. It will face several distractions over the next 12 months, including its ongoing Java lawsuit with Sun, not to mention any fall-out it may incur from the U.S. government's antitrust action. At the same time, while it tries to break new ground at the high end of the market, it faces a potential rival at the low end in the form of Linux. Analysts interviewed for this story were unanimous that Microsoft's position isn't likely to be eroded in the near term. While customers won't jump to its new operating system overnight, many expect to upgrade their desktop and server NT environments quickly starting at the end of the year, and demand for the company's software at the departmental level will continue to grow at a healthy clip, Giga's DiDio said. "The anticipation and the pent up demand for this product is tremendous," she said. The jury is still out, however, on its ambitions at the high end of the market and its efforts to become a leader in providing software and services for new types of Web-based applications. Microsoft has deep pockets and a giant pool of programming talent and has shown a deft ability in the past for identifying new markets and moving into them, Dataquest's Perlstein noted. IDC's Kusnetzky was more cautious. "Microsoft has presented a grand vision that is so all-encompassing it will be very hard for any software product to live up to it," he said. "It's going to be a significant challenge."

Microsoft's fortune rides on Windows 2000, analysts say





February 8, 2000
 Web posted at: 8:43 a.m. EST (1343 GMT)

by James Niccolai
 (IDG) -- With the launch of its Windows 2000 operating system on Feb. 17, Microsoft will try to move up the software food chain by beginning its assault on the lucrative midrange server business. At stake for the company will be its ability to keep growing at the fairytale rate it has enjoyed for the past half decade, industry analysts said. The new OS will also play a key role in determining whether Microsoft retains its dominant role in the computing industry in the years to come, analysts said. As the focus of IT computing shifts from local networks to the Internet, Microsoft will try to hawk Windows 2000 as a reliable platform on which companies can build e-commerce sites and other types of Web-based applications and services.

Microsoft CEO says Internet is backward


 From...



March 16, 2000
 Web posted at: 8:07 a.m. EST (1307 GMT)

by Michael Vizard
 (IDG) -- Returning to the venue where he launched his Microsoft career 21 years ago, company president and CEO Steve Ballmer on Tuesday told a gathering of industry executives that the Internet is 100 percent backward from the way it will be 10 years from now. 


  MESSAGE BOARD





Microsoft



 


 Speaking at the PC Forum conference, Ballmer said the Internet now is in the control of Web site producers, rather than in the control of end-users. To change that paradigm, Microsoft will evolve as a company to deliver client software that is tightly integrated with Web services.
"Web sites and clients will integrate with intelligence in both places," Ballmer said.

 This level of integration, he said, will raise new questions about what the definition of an operating system is when Web services need to span clients and servers.   "It's not clear where the business boundaries are in the new economy," Ballmer said. "But at the end of the day it has to be about making sure there are opportunities for us and our partners."   Microsoft will spend more than $4 billion on research and development this year, much of which will be focused on developing "megaservices" that will make it easier for end users to control exactly what content they want to access from any number of Web sites.   "The goal here is to make it easy for users to create their own 'myWorld' on the Internet," Ballmer said. "There is huge change yet to come and there is still a lot of hard R&D work that needs to be done."

Report: Microsoft hack a U.S. security risk


 From...






by Dan Verton 

(IDG) -- Although Microsoft Corp. has denied that the hacker who penetrated its network in October gained access to any of the company's source code, a recent report by a Washington-based think tank is warning that the compromise may hold grave national security implications. 


In a report released this month titled "Cyber Threats and Information Security: Meeting the 21st Century Challenge," the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) concluded that the government and the private sector should be concerned about the "trustworthiness" of future Microsoft products in the aftermath of the hack into the company's network. Former Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre, a longtime cybersecurity proponent in the defense and intelligence communities, heads the CSIS.




  MESSAGE BOARD





Security on the Net



 




"It is doubtful that the millions (sometimes billions) of lines of code required to power Microsoft's products could readily be sanitized," the CSIS report states. "With most military and government systems powered by Microsoft software and more generally reliant on [commercial, off-the-shelf systems], this recent development can pose grave national-security-related concerns," the 73-page report concludes. 


Microsoft, however, strongly disagrees with the analysis.

"The CSIS quote sensationalizes the incident and misstates the facts in a number of important ways," a Microsoft spokesman said. "Most important, Microsoft has repeatedly stated that after tracking the intruders and investigating their activities, there is no evidence and no basis to believe that they had any access at all to Windows or Office source code. That is, we have no reason to believe that the intruders were able to see Windows or Office source code, much less modify it. Microsoft's current and future products remain intact and secure, and customers can use them with confidence."


Microsoft security personnel discovered the hack in October when they noticed that passwords were being remotely sent to an e-mail account in Russia. The hackers then posed as Microsoft employees working off-site rather than at the company's Redmond, Wash., headquarters to gain access to sensitive areas within Microsoft's internal network (see "Microsoft stung by hack attack," link below).


Government systems aren't the only ones at risk, according to CSIS. "Whoever stole proprietary secrets at the heart of the ubiquitous Windows program can hack into any PC in the world that uses it and is connected to the Internet," the report states. Such security concerns could hold serious implications for the dozens of private-sector companies that own and operate the nation's critical infrastructure.


Although initial reports alluded to the possibility that the hacker may have gained access to the source code of some of the company's future products, including Windows Me, Windows 2000 and Office, a Microsoft spokeswoman said that no source code was compromised or stolen and that every possible step has been taken to ensure the integrity of the code for future users.

Microsoft delays deadline for new licensing program




 From...




July 6, 2001
 Web posted at: 4:50 p.m. EDT (2050 GMT)
























By John Fontana

 (IDG) -- After howls of protests and threats of platform defections from user organizations, Microsoft has pushed back the deadlines for enrollment to its new licensing program by five months so enterprises can build the cost of the program into next year's budget cycles.


The news will come as a welcome relief to IT executives who were scrambling to figure out how to pay for the new program, called Software Assurance, which will replace all of Microsoft's upgrade options.



The original Oct. 1 deadline for enrollment in Software Assurance will now be extended to February 28, 2002.



However, the move does not mean Microsoft is abandoning the new licensing model, which has been criticized as a vehicle to resuscitate flat revenues over the past year in the Redmond giant's desktop application division and provide a buffer as more applications move to the Web.



"Microsoft is saying 'we made a mistake,'" says Chris LeTocq, principal analyst with Guernsey Research. "They listened to IT executives."



Those executives were saying they could not afford the new licensing model this year.

Some enterprises were looking at as much as a $5 million fee to get all their software in line with the program, which will still officially kick-off on Oct. 1.



Under the program, enterprises don't need to actually deploy the software, but they must have the license.



"Never in my career have I seen the customer base so angry at Microsoft," says Rob Enderle, an analyst with the Giga Information Group. "They were calling Microsoft things you wouldn't want your family to hear." Now, Enderle says, "users won't have to do anything draconian" under the pressure of Software Assurance. "There is less of a panic, but I suspect that customers won't soon forget this."



Microsoft admitted it heard IT executives loud and clear. The decision comes just a week after the company responded to industry complaints and pulled its Smart Tags feature from the upcoming version of Windows XP.



"There has been a lot of interest in Software Assurance, but customers have said they want more time to plan and budget," says Simon Hughes, program manager for worldwide licensing and pricing at Microsoft. "Our response has been to extend the transition period."



Microsoft intended to formally announce the news last Thursday, but the ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals in the company's antitrust trial scrubbed that effort.



Under the new deadlines, Open and Select volume-licensing customers can get their non-current licenses in line with Software Assurance by purchasing Upgrade Advantage before March 1, 2002. If companies make that move before October 1, 2001, they can get up to two years additional coverage under Upgrade Advantage.



Upgrade Advantage, the upgrade option for Open and Select customers that Software Assurance replaces, gives enterprises the rights to the current version of software. That is important because users must be on current versions of Microsoft software to be eligible for Software Assurance.



For example, a user on a version of Office older than Office XP gets the rights to Office XP and up to two years of upgrade coverage and a path to move into Software Assurance.



At the end of the Upgrade Advantage cycle, however, enterprises still have to buy into Software Assurance, which is priced at 29 percent of the full-retail price of the licensed software. For example, a $368 Office license would carry nearly a $107 fee for Software Assurance.



Those same Open and Select customers can enroll their current licenses, such as Windows 2000 Professional, Office XP and .Net Enterprise Servers, for the same 29% fee in Software Assurance between October 1 and February 28, 2002. The original deadline was January 31, 2002.



In addition, Enterprise Agreement and Subscription options for customers with more than 250 PCs will be available from October 1 and include Software Assurance.



The protests over Software Assurance arose because the program and the 2001 deadline to enroll were announced after enterprises had set budgets for this year. That meant enterprises likely had to either raid existing budgets or trim workforce to enroll.



For example, enterprises contemplating an upgrade after the October 1 deadline to the recently released Office XP faced the prospect of spending as much as $300 more per user to purchase new licenses for the suite of software. Those costs were about double the fee it would cost the same user to upgrade before the October 1 deadline.



Software Assurance was announced in May and requires enterprises to maintain current licenses for software.



Critics say the program is a response to customers that have not been upgrading to new versions of software, most notably Office, and a way for Microsoft to rectify that loss in licensing revenue. Microsoft has reported nearly $7 billion in revenue in the past three quarters this year for its desktop applications division, roughly equal to the same three quarters last year. The revenue accounts for 37 percent of its business, so that means 37 percent of Microsoft revenue has not grown over the past year.



Microsoft contends the changes are being made to simplify the alphabet soup of upgrade options. The company claims that organizations that upgrade on cycles of three years or less will see a reduction or no change in licensing costs.



A study by Guernsey Research shows that enterprises on a two-year upgrade cycle will save 19 percent in licensing costs, but that enterprises on a three-year cycle will see a 40 percent increase in costs.

SAN FRANCISCO, California (Reuters) -- Computer security experts say the recent "SQL Slammer" worm, the worst in more than a year, is evidence that Microsoft's year-old security push is not working.


"Trustworthy Computing is failing," Russ Cooper of TruSecure Corp. said of the Microsoft initiative. "I gave it a 'D-minus' at the beginning of the year, and now I'd give it an 'F."'


The worm, which exploited a known vulnerability in Microsoft's SQL Server database software, spread through network connections beginning January 25, crashing servers and clogging the Internet.

Public reminded of risks

It hit a year and one week after Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates sent a company-wide e-mail saying Microsoft would make boosting security of its software a top priority.


Microsoft placed responsibility on computer users who failed to install a patch that had been available since at least last June.


"The single largest message is: keep your system up to date with patches," Microsoft Chief Security Officer Scott Charney said.


But the philosophy of patching is fundamentally flawed and leaves people vulnerable, Cooper said. For example, Microsoft didn't follow its own advice as executives confirmed that an internal network was hit by the worm.


"Microsoft was completely hosed (from Slammer). It took them two days to get out from under it," said Bruce Schneier, chief technology officer of Counterpane Internet Security, a network monitoring service provider. "It's as hypocritical as you can get."

Fix could have nullified problems

"We should have done a better job" in protecting the company's own network, Mike Nash, corporate vice president of Microsoft's security business unit, said. "We understood some things customers were facing and it, in some ways, helped us. It was a learning course."


There was another misstep on Microsoft's part that illustrates the problems with patches, Cooper said.


In October Microsoft released a fix for a different SQL Server problem that if installed in the expected manner would have made patched systems vulnerable again, he said. "If I followed their advice I'd have been vulnerable."


Microsoft spokesman Rick Miller said administrators were given the option with the fix to install it so the patch was intact. He also said he knew of no customers who installed the fix and were still hit by the worm.

Implementing fix proves complex

VIEW RESULTS





















But, most people installing the fix would not necessarily have known how to install it in a safe way, Cooper countered.


Microsoft released a service pack that would have fixed the problems the week before Slammer hit. But not only are there too many patches to keep up with, people are reluctant to install them for fear they will interfere with their systems.


Microsoft admits making a mistake with the SQL fix and has "egg on our face" over being hit by the worm, Miller said.


"What this demonstrates and what we readily acknowledge is the patch management process is too complex," he said. "Microsoft is committed to reorganizing our patch system and delivering high-quality patches in a streamlined way."

Demanding better products

Nash defended the Trustworthy Computing initiative, saying the company's security process and culture have changed. For instance, all Windows developers have received special security training, he said.


However, the fruits of that may not show up until future versions of products are released, said Richard M. Smith, a Cambridge, Massachusetts-based computer security consultant. "I'd rather they focus on the problems we have today."


"The problem is the whole patch regime has lots and lots of problems," he said. "It would be much better if the software shipped from Microsoft with fewer problems to begin with."


The solution: install patches, along with firewalls and other security software and services, as well as demand better products from Microsoft, the experts said.

Thinking of switching

In the meantime, Schneier said he was thinking of switching from Windows to the Macintosh platform because of all the security issues. "My wife has a Mac and she doesn't worry about viruses, trojans, leaks..., " he said.


A Consumer Reports survey last year found that virus infection rates on Macs are half what they are on Windows, noted Smith. "Is that because Macs are safer? I think the answer is yeah."

  Google vs. Microsoft: What you need to knowStory Highlights The escalating Google vs. Micosoft battle is mostly over who'll be King of Tech  Top execs at each company dream of ways to steal the others' pots of gold  Chrome OS will compete with Windows, while Office 10 will include free online versions  Here's how the two tech giants stack up in four key areas of competition Next Article in Technology »   By Ryan Singel 



 


 

  (WIRED) -- In less than a week, Google announced an operating system to compete with Windows, while Microsoft announced that Office 10 will include free, online versions of its four most popular software programs -- a shot at Google's suite of web-based office applications. 
The fight between Microsoft and Google is over who'll be seen as the world's most important tech company. 
 And not more than a month and a half ago, Microsoft unveiled its new search engine Bing, which it hopes will steal market share from Google and finally make it real money online. From the news of it, it's a full-blown tech battle, complete with behind-the-scenes machinations to sic government regulators on each other. It is, however, not a death match -- it's more of an fight to see who will be the King of Technology, since both companies pull in their billions through completely different siphons and are unlikely to severely wound one another any time soon. Google pulled in $22 billion in revenue in 2008, 97 percent of which came tiny text ads bought by the keyword and placed next to search results or on pages around the web. Google makes a negligible amount of money bundling its online apps for businesses, charging $50 a head annually -- but mostly it just gives its online text editor, email and spreadsheet programs away. By contrast, Microsoft sold $14.3 billion worth of Microsoft Word and PowerPoint and other business applications over the last nine months, making a profit of $9.3 billion. It made a further $16 billion in revenue in 2008 through sales of its operating systems, which range from XP installations on netbooks, to Vista, to Windows Mobile to its server software. Google now plans its own range of operating systems, starting with Android, an open-source OS for small devices like smartphones, and Chrome OS, a browser-focused, open-source OS that will run on notebooks and desktops.

 Clearly top executives at each company look over at the others' pots of gold and dream of ways to steal them, or at least make it harder for the other guy to make money. In fact, they even dislike each other enough to spend money to make the other one lose revenue -- take for example, Microsoft's behind-the-scenes campaign to scuttle last year's proposed Google-Yahoo advertising deal or its ongoing attempts to derail the Google Book Search settlement. But in reality, the competition is really about creating universes or ecosystems that it hopes consumers will want to live their technology lives inside. And it's about ego -- a fight to be recognized as the world's most important technology company. Microsoft would love for everyone in the world to be using its Internet Explorer browser to search through Bing to find a story from its MSN portal to email via Hotmail or Outlook to a friend. Add in a smartphone running Windows Mobile and an Xbox in the living room for the kids, and you have a Microsoft family. And though it is much joked about, Microsoft is the dominant platform for software developers of all types, whether they are making small business software, massive online role-playing games or photo-editing utilities. Google's ecosystem looks different. It starts with a Google Chrome browser (oddly running only on Windows) with a default homepage set to Google News or a customized Google homepage. From there you might go to Gmail and then click on a Word document sent to you as an attachment which Google will quickly -- and safely -- open for you in its online word processor. But most importantly, Google wants you to search and travel around the web, hitting web pages that run Google-served ads and Google tracking cookies. You might think that Google is a really cool company to give away all this free technology, while never thinking about the persistent and silent data collection Google is undertaking to profile you in order to deliver you to advertisers for a premium. So how do the two stack up in four key areas of competition? Browsers: Internet Explorer in all its variations still retains close to 70 percent of the market (depending on who is counting and how). That dominance remains, even though Microsoft's latest offering IE8 lags behind all the other major browsers in features and advanced web capabilities. Firefox, Opera, and Apple's Safari have all driven browser innovation over the last five years, but most people have not been convinced to leave IE behind, despite other alternatives being safer and more advanced. Why does it matter? Well, IE installations come with a default home page, don't they? Google's Chrome browser, on the other hand, is a handsome, whiz-kid of a browser. It's sleek and nimble, and it revolutionizes how tabs are handled. The address bar is the search box (Google as default, naturally). Each website opened runs as its own browser instance and has very low permissions to read and write to files. The sandboxing of tabs means that if a single website hangs or crashes, the rest are unaffected. Meanwhile, lower permissions make it harder for a hacker to bust into your computer through your browser. Chrome also has less than 2 percent of the browser market share. Online Search: Google's name now means search to most users. Google's search engine means money to Google. In June, it delivered 78.5 percent of search results pages delivered to U.S. web users. In the first three months of 2009, Google pulled in $5.2 billion in revenue, a majority of which came from AdWords, an auction-based service that triggers ads based on the keywords in a search query. Microsoft recently debuted Bing, a new search engine it hoped would fare well in comparison to Google. It's got some fine innovations, and shows the company is thinking very hard about better ways to present information to users by finding ways to synthesize data, rather than just retrieving links. Still, despite these improvements, a $100 million ad campaign, and generous press coverage that treats Bing like an underdog, Bing gained only a point in June to get Microsoft 8.2 percent of all searches. Operating Systems: Microsoft has been making operating systems since 1979 and has spent 28 years perfecting MS-DOS and Windows NT, the frameworks that Windows have been built around. Microsoft is estimated to run on about 90 percent of all laptops and desktops in the world. By copying its competitors' best features, leveraging questionable licensing arrangements and using its base of accustomed users to buy it time against innovators, Microsoft has held on to its lead in the OS market for almost 30 years. That's despite challenges from Digital Research, Apple and IBM. Microsoft's newest version, Windows 7, will be available in the fall. Early reviews say the OS boots quickly and sleeps fast, and avoids much of the confusing interface decisions that have made many dislike Vista, the successor to Windows XP. Microsoft also dominates in the business world, where nearly every medium to large company standardizes around Microsoft Office. Microsoft is also at work on version 6 of its operating system for handheld devices, which it first launched in 2000. Its OS advantages are immense. It has millions of users who know nothing else and who like Windows. There are millions who are attached to games or the thousands of desktop apps that are only available on Windows. Thousands of devices just plug in and work on its hardware. And familiarity with Microsoft software is a requirement for a huge number of office jobs. By contrast, Google first stepped into the OS game in 2007 when it announced its Android operating system for small devices. Google estimates that some 18 phone models will be running its system by the end of the year. Last week, Google announced, but did not show off, a new OS to compete with Windows, dubbing it Chrome OS. That name signifies that Google's OS will be for the web and browser-based. It hopes to convince developers to write software that runs inside a browser, instead of on top of the OS as developers for Windows and Apples' OS X do. It will also let web developers extend the power of their websites by expanding the capabilities of the browser, allowing websites to lean on the browser for storage and processing help. Advertising: Google is largely powered by its innovative auction-based text ads on its own site, but then expanded into serving ads on other people's sites with the Adsense program. It bought the ad-serving and behavioral-profiling giant Doubleclick in 2007 for more than $3 billion, and has ventured into mobile, print, radio and television ads. Microsoft has struggled to replicate Google's online advertising success. Despite owning MSN.com -- a portal that is second only to Yahoo as a destination -- Microsoft has not made money on the internet. To turbocharge its ad-delivery technology, it paid more than $6 billion in cash in 2007 for aQuantive, a full-service online advertising concern. Instead, Microsoft's online ad business lost $1.2 billion in 2008, double what it lost in 2007. The company expects 2009 revenues to be higher than the $3.2 billion it took in last year, but has not said it would make a profit. Contrary to what some might have you believe, the benefits of the Google-Microsoft competition are immense. Microsoft had largely grown complacent until Google came along to shake up categories. Gmail's massive online storage capability and fancy programming made Microsoft hustle to upgrade its popular, though not user-friendly, web e-mail service. Google Maps led to Microsoft's Live Maps, which now bests Google's efforts in some ways. Google has been winning the fight for the last few years, showing that it is still nimbler than the software giant from the Northwest. But the pendulum may be slowing, or even poised to swing the other way. With the innovations in Bing and the promise that Microsoft's online Office offerings will be free and more fully featured than the Google equivalent, Microsoft is taking on Google where it matters for users: on the field of innovation. And that will make for an interesting race, no matter which horse you prefer to ride.

Analysis: Microsoft wants some of Google's good thing - CNN.com 



















 

  





  













  Analysis: Microsoft wants some of Google's good thingStory Highlights Deal with Yahoo gives Microsoft a greater share of search market  Combined, Microsoft and Yahoo are better poised to take on Google   Yahoo has effectively outsourced its search operation   Google also is challenging Microsoft on its own turf: operating systemsNext Article in Technology »  Read VIDEO  By Steve Mollman For CNN 



 


 

  (CNN) -- Microsoft knows a good thing when it sees it. And what Google has going on with its search advertising business is a good thing -- which, of course, is why Microsoft wants a bigger piece of it. 
Combined, Microsoft and Yahoo will try to erode Google's dominance in search. 
 To that end, it struck a deal Wednesday to power the searches on Yahoo's various properties. The deal will increase the market share of Microsoft's search platform, Bing. The boost will help. In June, according to estimates from comScore, Microsoft's share in the U.S. search engine market was 8.4 percent, and Yahoo's was 19.6 percent, compared to 65 percent for Google.   So Bing will soon have close to a 30 percent market share, making it a stronger alternative to Google, and Microsoft will move closer to enjoying the "self-reinforcing, positive feedback loop" that has powered Google's rise to dominance.  Watch more on search engines » That loop, as described by Gartner analyst Neil MacDonald, is essentially what the software giant is after. It works like this: the more people use the search service, the more advertisers are willing to pay because more people are using it. And the more paying advertisers there are using the service, the better and more relevant the ads that come up.   Plus, the more the search engine is used, the better it becomes, thanks to contextual learning algorithms. Business 360: Contending Google's throne As for Yahoo, its stock took a hit after the announcement and many observers predicted the deal was the beginning of the end for the firm.

Microsoft, Yahoo strike deal to take on Google


Google eyes Microsoft's stronghold


   Jason Calacanis, CEO of the human-powered search engine Mahalo, wrote a blog posting entitled "Yahoo committed seppuku today." "The once proud warrior of the Internet space laid down its sword, knelt at the feet of Microsoft and gutted itself today," wrote Calacanis. But not everyone sees it that way. MacDonald sees a "very focused, smart deal" on both sides. Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz was astute, he says, in realizing that the company was about a "collection of media properties and the experience the user has," and that "you don't have to own search to make that experience compelling."   Yahoo will not receive an up front payment from Microsoft as part of the deal. Instead, it will receive 88 percent of search revenue generated via its sites during the first five years of agreement, according to yesterday's announcement. The company estimates that the agreement will add about $275 million annually to its operating cash flow and that it will be able to save about $200 million by basically outsourcing search. Search data will be shared between the two companies. They will continue to compete in other areas, including e-mail, instant messaging, and display advertising ("coopetition" like this is fairly common in both media and technology fields, notes MacDonald). Google isn't sitting still while Microsoft moves in on its territory. It's working on a Chrome operating system, slated to come out next year, that will compete with Microsoft's Windows. And its suite of online applications already puts up a fight against the Office juggernaut. Of course that's a feeble fight at the moment, but then so is Microsoft's fight in the search arena. One or both of these fights might become less lopsided over time, but we'll have to wait and see. For now Google and Microsoft have seemingly insurmountable leads in their respective strongholds. Not addressed in the deal is the challenge presented by the growth of real-time search -- Twitter being a perfect example -- which can make both Google and Bing look downright outdated in certain cases. For instance by typing #Bing into Twitter you can see what people around the world have been saying and sharing about this deal in the past 5 seconds. Meanwhile the ever growing juggernaut of Facebook also challenges the central place held by Google -- and by Bing, if Microsoft has its way. These search engines use impersonal algorithms to draw an atlas of the Web, but Facebook wants users to get their information about the world through their filter of friends and colleagues -- just as in real life. When a Facebook user taps his or her "social graph" to find the best dentist, they never leave the world of Facebook -- and Google and Bing are left out in the cold. And Facebook has far more details on its users, who use their real names. 





 Microsoft, at least, is an investor in Facebook, thanks to a deal struck a few years ago. Google, much to its chagrin, is not. But it is, clearly, right in Microsoft's sights.

  Microsoft researcher converts his brain into 'e-memory'Story Highlights Microsoft researcher Gordon Bell argues we will soon have searchable memories  Bell details his ideas in a new co-authored book called "Total Recall"  Bell has been recording almost every detail of his life digitally for a decadeNext Article in Technology »   By  John D. Sutter CNN 



 


 

  (CNN) -- For the past decade, Microsoft researcher Gordon Bell has been moving the data from his brain onto computers -- where he knows it will be safe. 

Gordon Bell wearing a SenseCam, which automatically records photos throughout the day. 


 Sure, you could say all of us do this to some extent. We save digital pictures from family events and keep tons of e-mail.    But Bell, who is 75 years old, takes the idea of digital memory to a sci-fi-esque extreme. He carries around video equipment, cameras and audio recorders to capture his conversations, commutes, trips and experiences. Microsoft is working on a SenseCam that would hang around a person's neck and automatically capture every detail of life in photo form. Bell has given that a whirl. He also saves everything -- from restaurant receipts (he takes pictures of them) to correspondence, bills and medical records. He makes PDF files out of every Web page he views. In sum, this mountain of data -- more than 350 gigabytes worth, not including the streaming audio and video -- is a replica of Bell's biological memory. It's actually better, he says, because, if you back up your data in enough places, this digitized "e-memory" never forgets. It's like having a multimedia transcript of your life. By about 2020, he says, our entire life histories will be online and searchable. Location-aware smartphones and inexpensive digital memory storage in the "cloud" of the Internet make the transition possible and inevitable. No one will have to fret about storing the details of their lives in their heads anymore. We'll have computers for that. And this revolution will "change what it means to be human," he writes.

Microsoft's SenseCam


   Bell, who, along with fellow researcher Jim Gemmell, is the author of a new book called "Total Recall," talked with CNN about the advantages and drawbacks of recording one's life in painstaking digital detail. The following is an edited transcript. CNN: What have you learned about yourself through this process? That's been a really hard question to answer. ... The main driver of the recall turns out to be a [computer] screensaver or something where I go looking for [a digital memory] and I find something else. I guess it's the rich set of connections and people that I've been involved with. CNN: What do you use to record your memories? In a way, most of what happens during the day is sort of routine -- what you've done before. So I carry the SenseCam only when I think there's an episode or a sequence or a certain set of events that I want to capture and have automatically photographed. But I tend to always carry a camera with me. I live next to a fire station and I've got lots of photos of the hook and ladder coming out of the house. And I like food so I tend to photograph wonderfully presented food all the time. To me those are very pleasant memories.  CNN: If we rely on computers instead of our brains, will humans become mentally sluggish? That's certainly one of the concerns. I tend to counter that theory. To me, I feel a lot freer. In a way I feel like I still remember all that stuff, but I generally remember that [the computer is] remembering something for me so I can find it.  People have no memory of phone numbers now because of the cell phone -- their address book is in a cell phone. So I don't think they're getting any worse or any less facile about that. What an e-memory does, to me, is gives me a really wonderful free feeling.  CNN: If we all record audio of our lives, do you think conversations will become stilted and fake? I think there will be a lot of court cases and lawyering around all of that. I'm personally less hung up about that. Certainly, people my age and Baby Boomers are. But the current X-Generation, [they think] this is pretty natural. CNN: Are you on Facebook and Twitter? Yeah, I'm on Facebook and Twitter and occasionally I will tweet something. Somehow my problem is that I don't think I have anything interesting to tweet about. CNN: Should all of our memories and observations be public? Absolutely not. Our own memories are our own private thing, and how much you choose to have on Facebook or blogs, that's your thing. CNN: What does your family think about your effort to record everything? Gradually, everybody is getting this idea. ... Think of it: You are a librarian for your life. Somebody has to be the family librarian. CNN: Are you worried about losing your memory? ... Forgetting is not a feature, it's a flaw. I don't think forgetting is an important feature of human memory. I think it's important to be able to remember things accurately. CNN: Are there any memories you deleted? No. When we were scanning stuff I had written a memo about a company, an unpleasant company -- probably the only company I was ever ashamed to be a part of. ...  I put a note on that file that said, "Don't ever scan or copy this!" My assistant who was doing the scanning ran across this and said, "What do you want me to do with this?" And I said, "Well, gee. This is my life." I said, "It's OK, just go ahead." So it's all there. CNN: Do you think it's possible for people to turn away from new technologies? Or are advances like "Total Recall" inevitable?  I think it's inevitable because so much content is being created. Virtually everything is coming in digitally -- everything from your photos to your videos to your music. ... I will love that day when the world is just bits. It's the ultimate in green, by the way.

 A vision of computing from Microsoft's future thinkerBy  Kevin Voigt, CNN   The future of computersSTORY HIGHLIGHTSCraig Mundie, Chief Research and Strategy Officer for Microsoft has an ambitious vision for computing Suggests that in a few years computers will be at least 50 times as powerful as today Told CNN that in the next decade more natural interface with computers will be commonplaceCloud computing will allow wider range of computing possibilities   Singapore (CNN) -- In the next 10 years, the way people interact with computers will wildly change. Hand gestures will be as common as the click of a keyboard, and an assortment of documents will be selected not with a mouse, but with a scan of the eye.   "Today, most people's interaction is through a screen -- whether they touch it, type it, point or click, it's still just graphical user interface," says Craig Mundie, chief research and strategy officer of Microsoft.  "While that's very powerful and has a lot of applicability, I think it will be supplemented in dramatic ways by what we call a natural user interface," Mundie said in an interview with CNN on the sidelines of November's Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation CEO summit in Singapore.  Mundie sat with CNN to discuss his vision of what computing will look and feel like in the decade to come. Much like Nintendo's Wii and Sony Playstation 3 are adding physical interactivity to game play, Mundie believes the next decade will see a revolution in the way people physically use computers. "This will be the ultimate aggregation of the ability of the computer to emulate human senses of sight, hearing, speech, touch, gesture and couple them together in a different way for people to interact with a machine."  



Video: The future of computers


Few people in the world are more influential in creating that future than Mundie, who took over the reins as head of the world's largest computer science research department when Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates announced his transition away from day-to-day work at the company he founded.  As such, Mundie keeps his eyes fixed toward the future of computing. With an annual budget of $9.5 billion, Microsoft spends more than any other company on research, Mundie said. His department's budget wasn't cut during the downturn. "I tell people my time horizon is between three and 20 years in the future," he said. What will fuel the increase in interactivity is powerful new multiprocessor computers which are expected to be widely on the market by 2012.  "With that we should get a significant performance gain, in some cases more than a factor of 100," he said.  "So what you ask yourself then is, what do you do with a machine that is 50 to 100 times faster? To me, you start to move the basic model of how people interact with computers," Mundie said.  
You might sit there and look at a catalogue of movies to watch and just flip your hand like you were turning pages in a book and they would flip on the screen.--Craig Mundie

The first major commercial application of that technology is expected next year, when Microsoft is scheduled to release a new line of its Xbox consoles that eliminates the need for hand-controllers altogether -- essentially, the players become the controllers.  "Sometime next year the Xbox team will announce this new type of camera which allows you to sit on that sofa along with up to three of your friends, or stand and move around, and have the Xbox system calculate in real time the angular position of the 22 major joints in your body," Mundie said.  "You might play games that way. You might sit there and look at a catalogue of movies to watch and just flip your hand like you were turning pages in a book and they would flip on the screen and point at the one you want to play," he said.  Moving into 'the cloud' Also adding to the firepower of computers in the next decade, Mundie believes, is the evolution of "cloud computing" -- the move of computing power from home PCs and laptops and onto the Web.  "I think of 'The Cloud' as taking the publishing abilities of the Internet and adding programmability to it," he said. "And so these high scale things -- coupled with these new devices, which are smarter, perhaps more anticipatory in how they interact with you -- this will create a new computing platform which will allow us to attack a new range of problems that in the past have really eluded us."  Mundie envisages a day in the near future where you have a discussion on how to lower your carbon footprint -- with your house.  "You want to be able to make a contract with your house that says, look, this is the policy I want with my family about how green I want to be. I don't like to be super uncomfortable but you can mess around with the air conditioning a little bit," he said.  "And if I bought an electric car, make sure you charge it up to meet my driving requirements but don't charge in the expensive part of the day.  "You should be able to describe the problem or the policy you want and the computer should be able to somehow implement that," he said.  "It sounds a bit Star Trek-ish to some people but I really think we're within a few years of starting to see the introduction of these kind of things -- largely as a function of the increase in computing power both locally and in terms of the backbone of the Internet in the cloud."  On a broader level, he believes environmental computing will be able to give policy makers real-time analysis of carbon emissions and its global impact on the environment. Creation of 3-D science work stations and healthcare applications are considered strong business opportunities in the next decade, he added.  Mundie has applied his vision of a high-tech living to his own home, which he completed 18 months ago is tricked out with state-of-the-art computer controls, communication and automation with screens of various size dotted in every room.  "There is a uniform graphical interface that allows you to control almost anything in the house," he said. "You can control the drapes, lights, the fireplaces and audio systems."  His wife's request?  "Her specification is I had to deliver one-button television," he said. "And so I did that."

 Blogging from the Olympics on Microsoft's dimeBy  Doug Gross, CNN    Blogger Amber Johnson shows off tickets to watch her son's namesake, skier Bode Miller, compete. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Pair of bloggers are covering the Winter Olympics like pros after winning Microsoft contest  Amber Johnson, "Crazy Bloggin' Canuck," counts Bode Miller medal win among highlights  Student Dylan Derryberry says chance to see international reporters work was 'amazing'  Microsoft hooked bloggers up with credentials, laptops, smartphones and Office 2010

Blogs and Blogging

 (CNN) -- Forgive Amber Johnson if she knocked you over while sprinting through the Olympic Village near Vancouver, Canada, last week. She was on her way to blog about skier Bode Miller winning a medal. And as someone who named her 3-year-old son Bode, she didn't want to miss it. "I'm literally sprinting," said Johnson, who had shown up at the wrong media center for Miller's press conference. "I have these clogs on. I was a disaster, running through the Whistler village yelling at people to get out of the way." Johnson, a Denver, Colorado, writer and native of Canada whose Crazy Bloggin' Canuck blog focuses on life as a mom of two, was one of two bloggers who have covered the Winter Games in person after winning a contest hosted by Microsoft. The Olympic Blogathlete contest was designed to showcase Microsoft's Office 2010, currently in beta format, which adds blogging, photo and video tools to the program's traditional spreadsheet and other workplace functions. But Anthony Sprauve, spokesman for Microsoft Office, said it was also a chance to highlight what he called a different kind of Olympics. "This is really probably the first real digital Olympics," he said. "A lot of people are obviously still watching on television. But they're watching on the Internet, webcasts, they're following athletes' blogs and Twitter updates. "They're staying on top of what's going on in real time." For Dylan Derryberry, the other blogger and a sophomore journalism student at Colorado Mountain College, the trip to Vancouver has been an interesting look at how international journalism works. "Obviously, this entire experience is an amazing opportunity," he said. "Journalism is constantly moving forward, especially in technology ... and all of this is great for a college student, especially in journalism." Derryberry, whose CMC Mountain Times blog focuses on student life, and Johnson received full media credentials and tickets to several events at the Vancouver Games. The contest required active and established bloggers to submit writing samples and essays on why they'd like to cover the Games. A panel of judges, including gold medal-winning skater Bonnie Blair, selected five students and five "mom bloggers" as finalists and those 10 campaigned for online votes for the top spot. Microsoft hooked them up with Olympic-branded Acer Aspire laptops, loaded with Office 2010 and Windows 7, of course, and Windows 6.5 smartphones they used to post to Twitter and their blogs. Johnson is a Winter Games diehard whose parents met at a curling center in Canada.  Her Olympic highlights have included spending time with Blair as the speedskater watched Apolo Anton Ohno -- who would break her U.S. record for most Winter Olympic medals. She also met the cast of NBC's "Today" show, even though, as she wrote on her blog, "Matt Lauer ruined my moment in the spotlight" by standing in front of her during live shots. Then there was Wayne Gretzky.  A big hockey fan (who cheers for most U.S. athletes, but is still broken up over Canada's loss to the United States) Johnson was taken off guard when introduced to the hockey legend. "Did I tell The Great One I still remember when the Oilers beat the Islanders to win the Stanley Cup, their first of five in seven years? Of course not," she wrote in a blog post titled "Tutorial on what not to say when meeting Wayne Gretzky." "I instead blurted out, 'I have to confess to you I'm a Calgary Flames fan" -- a nod to the Oilers' arch-rival. The Olympic-torch lighter's response? A forgiving, "That's OK." Johnson is already back in Denver. Derryberry, whose early highlights include being one of only two U.S. fans watching the aforementioned hockey match in a bar full of rabid Canadians, arrived this week and will be in Vancouver through Sunday's closing ceremonies.

 Whither Natal? Microsoft's unique E3 challenge 
By Ben Kuchera , Ars Technica | Filed under: Gaming & Gadgets   Peter Molyneux and Project Natal at E3 2009 STORY HIGHLIGHTS Project Natal is Microsoft's motion control hardware  Sony has similar tech coming out  Natal will likely launch this holiday season 
RELATED TOPICS


Microsoft Xbox 360

Project Natal

Nintendo Wii

Sony PlayStation

 Microsoft has been more than coy about its upcoming motion control hardware, known at the moment as Project Natal. Some members of the press, more fortunate than we are, have seen it, although their coverage could only include images of the writers, not the hardware or the game itself. In some demos last year Peter Molyneux helped the reporters play with the creepy virtual boy, Milo, who could name the color of the writer's shirt, among other parlor tricks. In other words, there just isn't much information or hands-on impressions to be had with Project Natal, and the main challenge Microsoft faces at this year's E3 is not only to make the hardware real for the press and the readers at home, but to convince readers that this is something they need to buy this holiday season. That may be a bigger challenge than everyone assumes. Sony had the right idea at GDC At an invite-only press event during this year's Game Developers Conference, Sony gave a short presentation on the power of the PlayStation Move with a few gameplay videos and demonstrations, and then set the press free in a large, warehouse-like space next door in order to simply play with the hardware. There were no smoke and mirrors here; we just played games, chatted up Sony representatives, and held what seemed to be final or near-final hardware in our hands. The next day even more games were shown in the Sony lounge, where drinks flowed like water and everyone was able to play as much as they wanted. It was a party-like atmosphere, which was perfect for the more lighthearted games on display. We were given a private demo of the newest SOCOM title, played with the PlayStation Move. Our time with the hardware left us with some things we liked and some things we didn't, but it was clear that the technology was ready to go. What Microsoft has planned Microsoft is demanding a lot of our time at E3 this year. On Sunday, June 13, there will be a Project Natal demonstration featuring Cirque du Soleil. That should certainly be interesting, but how much of the hardware and games we'll see is an open question. Microsoft's press conference takes place that Monday morning, and then there is yet another Natal event Monday evening. The company certainly has plenty of time to show off its newest hardware to the press, and we're expecting Natal to launch this holiday season. An event as big as E3 in June means that we should be given the whole suite of details: price, release date, and games that will launch alongside the hardware. The early tech demos sound promising. Gizmodo wrote this last June: "But turning my air steering wheel, I felt completely in control. A lot of that was the software-it registered even the smallest pivots of my elbows that sent my forearms right or left-but the way it responded exactly how I expected it to is what made it feel so natural. Which is the real key here. It feels natural." Engadget had similar praise: "As soon as we stepped into line in front of the box, the avatar immediately took on our stance and movements. And we mean really took them on-little gestures with our arms, the posture we had, front and back movements-it tracked with complete accuracy. We did notice a bit of stutter during some finer movements, but overall the effect was impressive (and more than a little eerie)." The groundwork is there, but Microsoft runs the risk of having hardware that looks good and promising, but without a single game that will cause gamers to reach for their wallets. Microsoft is clearly planning a Natal onslaught at E3-but we know next to nothing about the hardware and the launch could be mere months away. Microsoft has quite the challenge: make the hardware real, show that it can work well outside of the perfectly controlled settings where previous demos had taken place, and announce a game-or even more ideally, games-that will make gamers feel like they need one now. It may sound simple, but it's a tall order for such ambitious hardware. We'll be at E3, taking in the full range of Microsoft events, so keep your eyes here for coverage. Until then, the speculation will continue.COPYRIGHT 2011 ARSTECHNICA.COM

 Microsoft game lets kids tickle tigersBy  John D. Sutter, CNN | Filed under: Gaming & Gadgets  Game lets you 'pet' wild animalsSTORY HIGHLIGHTSMicrosoft unveiled first games for its remote-control-free video game system"Kinectimals" lets uses interact with virtual animalsIn demo, a little girl tickles Skittles, a baby tigerOnline reaction already strong to Kinectimals (CNN) -- Microsoft on Monday unveiled the first games for its remote-control-free video game system, Kinect for Xbox 360. Several of the titles were pretty generic: a dancing game, a race car game, an adventure game and a fitness game. And then there was "Kinectimals." A demo of this bizarre but cuddly game showed a little girl tickling and playing with "Skittles," a virtual tiger cub. She threw sticks for the tiger to fetch and called it to the screen, where it licked the television and wagged its tail for her. "Come here Skittles!" she called to her virtual friend. The game features 40 wild animals and 30 types of interactions, according to Microsoft. Kids just wave their hands and talk to the TV to interact with these virtual pets. Microsoft Kinect, an add-on for the Xbox 360 that goes on sale on November 4, has a camera that watches their movements and a microphone to listen to their voices. Video gaming 'history' to be made this week at E3 The game has caused a bit of an uproar online, with some bloggers saying it's the start of a new era of kid interaction with video games and others saying the idea of a kid playing with a tiger, virtual or not, is just a little too strange. "Technically, this game is incredibly impressive. The AI [artificial intelligence] seems extremely reactive and the Kinect set-up works seamlessly as far as we can see," writes Robert Evans in a post on i4unews.com. "That doesn't stop the weird cat-animal thing onscreen from being creepy as hell, though. Hopefully the other Kinectanimals [sic] have less disturbing faces."

Chad Concelmo, from the site destructoid.com, wrote that he was initially skeptical of the game. But then the girl who giving the Kinectimals demo told her pet tiger, "I love you Skittles," and Concelmo writes that his "heart melted." "That little girl completly [sic] sold me on it," he writes. "I want to tickle a tiger. I WANT TO TICKLE A TIGER!" He continued: "The game is obviously adorable, but it looks to work pretty well! The interaction with the baby tiger seemed accurate and, most importantly, a lot of fun! I am actually looking forward to trying Kinectimals out on the show floor now! Thanks, cute little girl!" On gameinformer.com, Tim Turi writes that some of the tiger's moves were "disgustingly cute." "When she jumped, the tiger mimicked her, often to disgustingly cute results," he wrote. "Fetch, jump rope, and playing dead were also among the critter's repertoire. When the two were done playing, surrogate hands appeared on the beast as the girl gave her furry friends a rub down. The tiger responded realistically, folding its ears back, closing its eyes, and moving contentedly." Here's how Microsoft describes the game in a news release:  "A wide-eyed Bengal Tiger cub cocks its head to the side and playfully peers at you. Memories of your first trip to the zoo come rushing back. 'Kinectimals' invites children, their parents and animal lovers of all ages to build lasting friendships with some of the world's most exotic creatures. "Just like real pets, your 'Kinectimals' will come running when they hear your voice, respond to commands like 'jump,' 'roll-over' and 'play dead,' and purr with joy when you scratch them behind the ears." The "Kinectimals" debut also sparked conversation on Twitter. One user, @ActiveNick, posted, "My future kid's first word's probably won't be 'mommy' or 'dada', it'll be 'Xbox, start Kinectimals' :)" Another user, apparently unable to contain his reaction with words, simply posted a photo of his amused-yet-terrified face during the "Kinectimals" demo.  Take a look at the video demo at the top of this post and let us know what you think. Is "Kinectimals" creepy or cool? Would you let your kid play?

Personal Computers

 (Wired) -- For several years, Denise Carlevato has studied millions of mouse clicks and keystrokes made by anonymous computer users from all over the world. Her objective: to make Microsoft Office better fit the way millions of people work. Months before Microsoft rolled out the latest version of its productivity suite, Office 2010, 9 million people downloaded its beta version to test the software and provide feedback.  As part of the program, Microsoft collected 2 million comments from beta testers. An additional 600 people participated in Microsoft's Virtual Research Lab, where Carlevato and her colleagues could observe how people were using new features. In a sense, it was a massive, controlled crowdsourcing project. That's just what you have to do to cater to as broad an audience as possible, says Carlevato, who has worked as a Microsoft usability engineer for 10 years. "We do our darnedest to make sure the features we put into our product are the things people ask for," Carlevato told Wired.com. "We know from watching them work that they really need it." Though some tech observers have predicted Microsoft's downfall after falling behind in the smartphone game and being one-upped by Apple in market capitalization, many agree that reports of the software titan's inevitable demise are greatly exaggerated.  Microsoft as a whole remains hugely profitable, and Office has consistently been the most lucrative part of Microsoft's business, raking in billions of dollars each quarter, even exceeding sales of Windows. And although Google offers a competitive productivity suite, Google Docs, for free, Microsoft still has a major advantage: 67 percent of U.S. online consumers regularly use Office, while only 4 percent use Google Docs, according to Forrester Research. "In some ways, the 'Office versus Google Docs' debate doesn't merit a lot of consideration -- it's still no competition," said J.P. Gownder, a Forrester analyst. "In terms of usage and penetration, Google Docs remains a failure --- so far, anyway." But staying in the lead with productivity software isn't easy, and to retain the loyalty of millions, Microsoft goes to great lengths to determine what customers want.  For Office 2010 beta, Microsoft included a feature called "Send a Smile," a comment box for testers to submit feedback and suggestions for improvement.  Of the 2 million Send a Smile comments, 81,000 included the senders' e-mail addresses so the engineers working to improve Office could follow up with them. To analyze the Send a Smile feedback, Microsoft built a database and programmed algorithms to classify and tag comments under certain categories, while filtering out biased feedback and useless drivel. From that point, researchers manually read every single comment to determine necessary tweaks and additions to Office. A major new feature birthed from customer feedback was an online broadcasting tool for users to share PowerPoint 2010 presentations by simply sending around a URL, according to P.J. Hough, corporate vice president of Office Program Management. "We were making many decisions not based on what others were doing, but on what customers wanted us to do," Hough said. "We did research on customers that led us to the path." Microsoft also invites select users to participate in its Virtual Lab, where they are instructed to perform specific tasks such as formatting a section of a Word document, or changing the background color of a PowerPoint presentation. After lab participants completed each task, Carlevato and her colleagues analyzed their history to observe the actions they took. The Virtual Research Lab is especially useful when users struggle to finish a task, because researchers can examine why they are becoming confused or taking too long and work to resolve the problem. This is what usability researchers call "unarticulated needs," said Carlevato. Going beyond virtual testing, Microsoft engineers also worked one-on-one with human subjects at the University of Washington to create the brand-new Office web apps suite released in mid-June. A group of 26 students testing an early version ofOffice web apps met with engineers every two weeks to discuss features they wanted or didn't like in the web-based suite. Microsoft's product planner Char Popp helped lead the field trial, and she said it was crucial to work in a human environment with live feedback, because this was the very first version of Office web apps. "While the team was building it and giving insights and information, it was still all like a big jigsaw puzzle," she said. "Toward the end when this all came together I had the opportunity to go out and see how the web apps were actually going to live with real people." Early reviews of the Office web apps (including Wired's) weren't stellar, citing some missing key features and elements, but Microsoft stressed that this was a version-one product, and it would continue to collect feedback to improve the service. "With any release as big as Office you can't do everything all at once," said Hough, who added that any unaddressed shortcomings are "part of our engineering road map." Fortunately for Microsoft, there are360 million Windows Live users with access to the Office web apps who can help crowdsource the solutions.Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT!
