Total revenue from print and digital books in the trade category, which excludes textbooks and journals, declined 2% to $14.6 billion. The figures are based on how much publishers collected, not how much retailers charged and consumers paid, but they still give a snapshot into trends in the business.If growth has stalled at just 21% of total dollar sales for ebooks, where Amazon has the strongest position, the online retailer may have less leverage in negotiations with publishers than most in the industry once expected -- or feared. Another beneficiary could be Barnes & Noble (BKS), which announced plans this week to spin-off its Nook ebook unit.U.S. publishers collected $3 billion in revenue from ebook sales growth last year.MoreThe slowdown, after years of exponential growth, could help explain why major publisher Hachette, owned by French media company Lagardere, has been holding out against Amazon, according to Robert Picard, director of research at the University of Oxford's Reuters Institute and an expert on media economics."The conflict is a result of the maturation of online book sales distribution and publishers’ starting to find effective ways to directly distribute themselves or in cooperation with other publishers," he says. "Some, like Hachette, are now willing to challenge Amazon."But before publishers get too giddy, they should consider another way to look at last year's sales. In 2013, for the first time, publishers’ revenue from online sales of all kinds, at $7.5 billion, exceeded sales from physical locations, which totaled $7.1 billion, Bookstats reported. Splitting the market that way, Amazon is far in the lead and still gaining.Which, in turn, may help explain why Amazon is adopting the tough tactics against Hachette that are used more commonly by physical retailers. Amazon has reduced its inventory of the publisher's books, creating shipping delays for customers, and has cut discounts and yanked pre-orders for upcoming titles.The end result of the talks will likely spill over into future negotiations with Penguin Random House, owned by German media giant Bertelsmann, CBS’s (CBS) Simon & Schuster unit, News Corp’s (NWSA) HarperCollins, and Macmillan, which is owned by German publisher Georg von Holtzbrinck.Anomalies in the dataThere also may be anomalies in the data showing the supposed ebook slowdown. The industry reports have never made much headway in tracking sales of self-published works but two additional factors appear to have skewed ebook revenue last year. One was the court-ordered price cuts that followed publishers' settling price fixing charges in the fall of 2012. The other was the lack of a so-called “Young Adult” super blockbuster like "The Hunger Games" or an ebook phenom, such as the “I don’t want you to know I’m reading this” "Fifty Shares of Grey" trilogy.While total ebook revenue was unchanged, the number of ebooks sold rose 10% to 513 million. That represented 22.1% of all trade books sold last year, up from 19.7% in 2012. With higher volume and flat revenue, the average amount publishers received per ebook declined to $5.93 from $6.57 last year (again, that’s not how much consumers paid but how much publishers collected from retailers). So ebooks are still growing and taking a greater share of the total marketplace. But, thanks to antitrust regulators busting artificially high ebook prices, revenue was down.Story continuesThe changing composition of best sellers also may have hurt ebook sales last year. The final volume of Suzanne Collins’ "Hunger Games" trilogy came out in 2012, prompting sales of some 28 million books in the series that year. Many consumers older than young adult bought the books, and they tend to prefer the ebook format for the YA genre, helping push ebooks to almost 50% of unit sales for "Hunger Games."And the "Fifty Shades" trilogy sold 30 million copies in the United States in 2012, also with a much higher than typical proportion of those sales in the ebook format. Half of the publisher’s revenue from the trilogy came on ebooks versus 20% for most titles. Adjust both trilogies' 2012 ebook sales to a more typical ratio and 2013’s ebook sales suddenly look a whole lot better, with unit sales increasing about 15%. Revenue growth would also improve, although that is more difficult to estimate.And looking beyond the publishers' association data, other surveys show interest in ebooks continuing to mount. A January survey from the Pew Research Internet Project found that 28% of U.S. adults read an ebook in the past year, up from 23% in the 2012 survey and 17% in 2011. And 32% of adults said they owned a dedicated e-reader, up from 24% last year and 19% in 2012. As negotiations between Amazon and Hachette drag on, the battle may turn on which side's data proves the strongest.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextMueller Report Book Editions Shoot to Top of Best-Seller Lists at Amazon, Barnes & NobleVarietyThreats, Bullying and Misinformation: Inside Spotify's Battle With SongwritersRolling StoneZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance1 Big Reason Why Disney Stock Is Just Getting StartedMotley FoolAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceWhy it's so hard for some Americans to get high-speed internetYahoo FinanceJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNWhy MedMen Could Be the Best Pot Stock in the U.S… or the WorstMotley FoolWhat's next for Trump following the Mueller Report?Yahoo Finance VideoSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBC57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatchWarren Buffett shares his keys to successYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceThis 1 Assumption Could Totally Destroy Your RetirementMotley Fool

The country's second-largest bookstore abandoned last-ditch attempts to save the business this week after few bidders stepped up.The nearly 400 Borders stores still open could start liquidating and selling off assets as soon as Friday. The plan is for all to be shutdown for good by September, leaving nearly 10,000 employees without jobs.There were many missteps that caused this business to fail from holding too much debt, opening too many stores as well as jumping into the e-reader business to late. But above all, there was one "disastrous move" that put the final nail in Borders' coffin, says retail expert Howard Davidowitz of Davidowitz & Associates."I think the biggest thing Borders did wrong is when they turned over their online business to Amazon," Davidowitz tells The Daily Ticker's Aaron Task and Breakout's Jeff Macke in the accompanying interview. "That move finished them off because they gave away the future."Speaking of future: Where does this leave the future of the U.S. bookstore and Barnes & Noble?With a $1 billion market cap, Barnes & Noble (BKS) faces an uphill battle against Amazon's (AMZN) massive $100 billion valuation. But Davidowitz is not willing to put the last big-box book chain down for the count just yet."I don't believe in inevitable things because I have seen a lot of great changes done in the retail business," he says, pointing to his favorite retailer Wal-Mart (WMT). Not only did Sam Walton change his business from a small variety store model to a discount retail chain, he grew his single Arkansas store into America's largest retailer and employer.Davidowitz is not giving up on the U.S. bookstore either."The retail business is a business of change," but there is still a room for the bookstore in the hearts and lives of many Americans who use them as a place for meetings, gatherings and to just hang out with friends. Davidowitz says the bookstore is going nowhere soon, but we can expect to see a lot fewer of them.As for the 10 million square feet of empty retail space, Davidowitz predicts the big multi-level stores will likely lay vacant for some time, which will put pressure on small developers and community banks in those areas.

Most of the smaller Borders' stores will be gobbled up by retailers that are currently thriving, like Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY), he says.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextHyundai hires former Ghosn ally Munoz as global COO, Americas headReutersHere's how long you'll live — and how much of that will be healthy yearsMarketWatchNatural Gas Price Prediction – Prices Tumble as Supplies IncreaseFX EmpireThe 5 Best Places to Retire in North CarolinaInvestopediaState defends South Dakota pipeline protest legislationAssociated PressZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceWhy it's so hard for some Americans to get high-speed internetYahoo FinanceJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNWhat's next for Trump following the Mueller Report?Yahoo Finance VideoSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBC57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphWarren Buffett shares his keys to successYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

REUTERS/Amazon.com/Handout via ReutersMoreIf you saw "Skyfall" — the latest James Bond installment — you likely marveled at the breathtaking opening scene in which 007 chases a bandit across the rooftops of Istanbul on a motorcycle. Filming it all was a remote-controlled helicopter resembling a weed-wacker with an overhead projector attached — the latest in aerial filming technology.But for now, such unmanned aerial-filming contraptions are effectively banned in the United States — the birthplace of the motion-picture industry — along with virtually all other commercial uses of unmanned aircraft, or drones. That’s because the U.S. government has stalled in its efforts to regulate and manage the use of drones, a breakthrough technology fostered largely by the U.S. military. As a result, nations including Europe and China are gaining an edge over the U.S. in yet another industry.Online retailing giant Amazon (AMZN) drew fresh attention to the commercial potential of drones recently, when CEO Jeff Bezos unveiled an unmanned “octocopter” that, theoretically, could deliver small packages to customers’ doorsteps — a service he dubbed PrimeAir. Amazon-watchers considered the move something of a publicity stunt meant to burnish Amazon’s reputation for customer service, and Bezos himself said it could be four or five years before such drones are actually flying.A behind-the-scenes glimpseBut a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the Federal Aviation Administration’s efforts to regulate drones suggests Amazon’s octocopters may never take off. “Nothing they’re contemplating right now fits with that vision,” says a source familiar with the FAA’s policy efforts. “I don’t see it happening.”The fortunes of Flying-Cam, the aerial filming company that worked on "Skyfall" and worked on movies including the "Harry Potter" and "Mission Impossible" franchises, illustrate the difficulty of fostering a commercial drone industry in the U.S. Flying-Cam, which has offices in Los Angeles, Brussels and Hong Kong, began using small remote-controlled aircraft outfitted with cameras in the 1980s. Such innovations earned company founder Emanuel Previnaire an Academy Award for technical achievement in 1995. But in 2011 Flying-Cam’s U.S. business was effectively grounded when the FAA notified the film industry that flying unmanned aerial systems (UAS) for commercial use was illegal until regulations were finalized.In 2007 the FAA had quietly clarified its position on what constitutes an aircraft, as non-military UAS were morphing from recreational playthings into genuine aircraft able to fly hundreds of miles, reach elevations above 10,000 feet and carry a sizable payload. This was a de facto ban on the commercial use of drones until the FAA came up with formal rules governing their use. Since many companies were unaware of the change, the FAA began to tell industry officials that the use of drones was not yet legal as it became aware they were using them.Virtually overnight, Flying-Cam and other companies in the same business were grounded in the U.S. “Everything has been shut down until they regulate it,” says Haik Gazarian, director of operations for Flying-Cam. “The most tragic part is, an industry that was shining in many ways has been reduced. We’re not able to do these sequences in the U.S. We have to take the whole thing outside.”Story continuesFlying-Cam laid off more than 30 workers and other companies doing the same type of work have gone bust. Flying-Cam is picking up more overseas business, meanwhile, largely because regulators in countries such as England, France and China have developed new rules that allow and even encourage the commercial use of drones. Flying-Cam recently shot aerial scenes for the forthcoming films "Transformers: Age of Extinction" in Hong Kong and "Smurfs II" in Paris, for instance. And the production for a Sony PlayStation advertisement was recently moved from L.A. to Budapest so the director could include such aerial shots.Directors are still free to commission manned helicopters for aerial filming, but unmanned systems have several advantages. Since they tend to be much smaller, they can penetrate tight spaces and fly far lower than big choppers that would disrupt a set with rotor wash and noise. Lower flying also allows drones to get more-intimate aerial shots with the background in sharper focus.A safer droneDrones are probably safer than manned helicopters, too, which is an unhappy irony of the de facto ban. They can take off, fly and land completely within the boundaries of a movie set, with no need for helipads or use of public airspace to transit to or from a shoot. Most smaller drones run on batteries, so there’s no flammable fuel on board if there’s a crash. And movie sets tend to have strict safety rules, including tight security governing who can enter.To be fair to the FAA, the proliferation of UAS does represent a bona fide safety issue and even a potential new avenue for terrorists hoping to attack U.S. targets. The rapid transformation of UAS is comparable to other manifestations of the digital revolution. GPS guidance systems have become cheap and ubiquitous, while advanced avionics are common enough to incorporate into affordable off-the-shelf UAS. Without new rules, virtually anybody could fly a drone wherever they wanted, for any reason. The FAA, in fact, believes there are still plenty of businesses using UAS beneath the radar, as it were, despite the ban.Following the 2007 policy clarification, the FAA said it would publish a draft regulation for small UAS — those weighing less than 55 pounds, such as the Flying-Cam machine — by late 2011. That would spell out the rules and make it legal to use them for those who complied. But FAA insiders say the draft was so restrictive — requiring small drones to have the same sort of airworthiness certification as large passenger-carrying planes, for instance, and UAS operators to have licenses and other credentials similar to those of commercial pilots — that the FAA never finalized the regulation.In 2012, Congress passed a law requiring the FAA to publish final regulations allowing certain commercial UAS use by Sept. 30, 2015. The agency says it will release draft rules next year, and it recently published its first annual "road map" laying out necessary steps. Congress also ordered the FAA to selectively approve certain UAS for use by energy firms off the Alaska coast, which the agency did this summer. Both types of UAS the FAA certified had already been approved for military use, an advantage Flying-Cam and most other companies hoping to use UAS — including Amazon — doesn't have. Law-enforcement organizations and other public agencies also receive permission from the FAA to fly UAS in the national airspace for surveillance and other purposes.The FAA has also drawn several important distinctions between different types of UAS. “Model” remote-controlled aircraft can be flown for recreational use pretty much without limits, although “guidance” from the FAA, dating to 1981, recommends they remain below 400 feet, stay clear of populated areas and full-scale aircraft, and aren’t used for business purposes. The FAA, however, is concerned some businesses will try to operate UAS by claiming they’re abiding by  guidance aimed at modelers.The agency anticipates many commercial uses once the regulatory framework is in place, including cargo delivery (as Amazon contemplates), private security, communication, news coverage, disaster response, and monitoring of power plants and other types of infrastructure, as well as aerial photography.There are a few other key distinctions the FAA must grapple with. The easiest UAS to regulate will be those flying within the line-of-sight of the operator on the ground, as most model aircraft do. Next are those flying beyond line-of-sight but still controlled in real time by a human. After that, the FAA will have to figure out what to do about fully autonomous UAS that are programmed to fly a specific route on their own, with the capability to identify and avoid problems.Flying-Cam’s aircraft are line-of-sight UAS that fly limited distances over the perimeter of a movie set or shooting locale. Amazon’s would have to be more advanced, since it would make no sense to launch an aircraft to deliver a package to a doorstep so close to the launch site. That would raise challenges the FAA hasn’t even begun to grapple with: UAS could crash near schools, malls or other populated areas, collide with other aircraft (including other UAS), run into powerlines or even bump into houses.There’s also the problem of “link loss,” which occurs when an interference disrupts the flow of data needed for a UAS to fly properly, essentially leaving the aircraft uncontrolled. When that happens, some UAS continue on the last heading they were directed to take, while others spin in circles or return to their starting point — usually without any eyes or ears allowing them to detect obstacles on their own. In August 2010, a U.S. Navy drone lost contact with its controllers while flying over southern Maryland, and nearly penetrated restricted airspace near the U.S. Capitol before the link was reestablished and the plane turned around.Gazarian and many other businesspeople have met with the FAA and pressed their case for the limited use of commercial UAS. So far, nothing. “We can’t even handle the simpler cases,” says a frustrated FAA official. “This is taking ridiculously long. We’re hurting a lot of industries.” Bezos may think he can make the federal bureaucracy move faster, just as he has revolutionized package delivery at Amazon. If he pulls that off, he may edge James Bond aside in the pantheon of heroes.Rick Newman’s latest book is  Rebounders: How Winners Pivot From Setback To Success. Email him at Newmanomics@yahoo.com.

Bezos explained the growth narrative tied to Amazon’s e-commerce channels, AWS, future expansion into new areas through an iterative approach, and efforts to make smart bets to remain innovative, but also the willingness to lose money if in the event an experiment doesn’t work.The founder of Amazon has managed to keep an innovative culture going while they continue to disrupt e-commerce. Bezos anticipates that Amazon can continue to grow its e-commerce footprint in various markets outside the United States where there has been minimal market penetration of e-commerce in general.Amazon stock is hovering just under $1T and remains stuck in a tight range. Earnings could catalyze the stock near-term, but what remains important is the visionary stature of the company when compared to various other technology peers.While, there have been a number of publicity failures tied to Amazon’s HQ search this past year, Bezos made no mention of the HQ search in his annual letter, but instead directed much of the focus on their ability to grow their e-commerce business, AWS and the minimum wage increase to $15.Jeff Bezos mentions in his shareholder letter the importance of 3rd-party sellers and how it has contributed to its total e-commerce revenue and volumes when compared to eBay:> Something strange and remarkable has happened over the last 20 years. Take a look at these numbers: Third-party sales have grown from 3% of the total to 58%. To put it bluntly: Third-party sellers are kicking our first party butt. Badly. And it’s a high bar too because our first-party business has grown dramatically over that period, from $1.6 billion in 1999 to $117 billion this past year. The compound annual growth rate for our first-party business in that time period is 25%. But in that same time, third-party sales have grown from $0.1 billion to $160 billion – a compound annual growth rate of 52%. To provide an external benchmark, eBay’s gross merchandise sales in that period have grown at a compound rate of 20%, from $2.8 billion to $95 billion.Not to point daggers at anybody, but Bezos basically stated that their third-party retail sales (which is very similar to eBay’s listing marketplace) grew at annual growth rate of 52% versus eBay at 20%, and it’s representative of 58% of Amazon’s total retail sales. These are the key metrics that define Amazon’s e-commerce growth narrative, and it’s likely where Amazon will continue to invest resources, so they can attract more third-party retail sales at the detriment of eBay.It’s likely that Amazon’s 3rd-party retail will continue to dominate in comparison to eBay (where historically that wasn’t always the case) but has now become an established reality given Amazon’s 3rd-party retail represents $160 billion in sales on the platform versus eBay at $98 billion in total platform sales.The divergence in narrative between Amazon and eBay will continue, as eBay as a stand-alone website property hasn’t gone much further into enhancing features for eBay sellers. What has helped Amazon at beating eBay? Well, Bezos explains in his letter:> We helped independent sellers compete against our first-party business by investing in and offering them the very best-selling tools we could imagine and build. There are many such tools, including tools that help sellers manage inventory, process payments, track shipments, create reports, and sell across borders – and we’re inventing more every year.This paints a somewhat gloomy narrative both by the numbers but also the internal efforts to supply core competencies tied to Amazon’s distribution and ecosystem that eBay cannot provide. While its been a well-established fact that Amazon can continue to execute, there was one more hint or clue in the annual shareholder letter that points to Amazon’s future.Bezos believe that further expansion into global retail will require a combination of e-commerce and brick-and-mortar initiatives:> Amazon today remains a small player in global retail. We represent a low single-digit percentage of the retail market, and there are much larger retailers in every country where we operate. And that’s largely because nearly 90% of retail remains offline, in brick and mortar stores. With Amazon Go, we had a clear vision. Get rid of the worst thing about physical retail: checkout lines. No one likes to wait in line. Instead, we imagined a store where you could walk in, pick up what you wanted, and leave.What’s interesting about Bezos is the fact that he believes that Amazon is “small player in global retail.” What this points to though, isn’t the fact that he thinks Amazon can service every customers with online-only sales, but how he transitions the idea to Amazon Go, where he believes that a technology-driven approach to checkout lines, and a seamless buying/selling experience could be globally disruptive and it’s where Amazon could continue to deploy resources (where they only have 10 stores in the United States in Seattle, Chicago and San Francisco).The brick-and-mortar transition for Amazon has been slow, and more iterative in nature. But it could play into Amazon’s global ambitions of being a relevant retailer both online and offline (which can also) be integrated into its online-based business. The execution on the AWS front has been strong, but efforts by Bezos to outline expectations tied to retail shouldn’t be ignored either, because this is Amazon’s bread-and-butter business.If Amazon were to surprise shareholders with more efforts tied to retail, it would double-down on its incumbency advantage. Based on the dialogue from Bezos within the shareholder letter, it’s safe to presume that on-going efforts to disrupt retail whether online or offline remains one of Amazon’s biggest priorities.

During this time, some stocks have thrived while others have struggled.GOBankingRates researched historical prices to see what $1,000 invested in your favorite companies in 2008 would be worth 10 years later, as well as what the compound annual growth rate is to give you a sense of what the yearly return for each has been over time.Keep reading to learn about the fastest growing stocks since 2000, and see which companies have produced impressive growth rates during the past decade.SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY): $1,923.47Share Price May 1, 2008: $138.39 Share Price May 1, 2018: $266.24 Compound annual growth rate: 6.76 percentPerhaps the easiest route to investing in stocks is to simply invest in ETFs that track major indices. If you can’t beat the market, and almost everyone can’t, why not join it?In this case, the S&P 500 ETF from SPDR is among the most popular options for ETFs that track the S&P 500, which is generally considered the benchmark by which the performance of most stocks are judged.So, the roughly $2,000 that your $1,000 investment 10 years ago would be worth now is one of the best ways to gauge just how well some of these companies have performed.Apple (AAPL): $7,407.06Share price May 1, 2008: $24.99 Share price May 1, 2018: $185.16 Compound annual growth rate: 22.17 percentApple is one of the most iconic and well-known brands in the world, thanks in part to a few key reinventions and rebranding strategies. A decade ago, Apple was a tech firm less than one year into its release of the iPhone. Today, it’s a consumer goods giant that has ridden the smartphone revolution to its status as the most valuable company in the world, closing in on a valuation of $1 trillion.Netflix (NFLX): $74,394.38Share price May 1, 2008: $4.52 Share price May 1, 2018: $326.26 Compound annual growth rate: 53.87 percentNetflix shares have been prone to large gains and losses as it has grown into a dominant media company. But like Apple, Netflix wasn’t exactly the company it is today 10 years ago. In May of 2008, Netflix was primarily a mail-order DVD rental company that had just rolled out a streaming service that was capped at 10 hours of free viewing a month for the base membership.If you predicted that streaming was the wave of the future — like CEO Reed Hastings did — every $1,000 you invested in Netflix would be worth almost $75,000 today.Alphabet (GOOGL): $3,626.72Share price May 1, 2008: $292.13 Share price May 1, 2018: $1,059.46 Compound annual growth rate: 13.75 percentAlphabet is the holding company for technology giant Google. Over the years, the company has expanded into many different businesses. These range from office productivity products to phones, virtual assistants and entertainment services.Walt Disney Co. (DIS): $3,158.94Share price May 1, 2008: $32.45 Share price May 1, 2018: $102.48 Compound annual growth rate: 12.19 percentWith its TV shows, networks, movies and theme parks, Disney has evolved into a massive media conglomerate. Its share price stagnated in 2016 and 2017, in part due to poor subscriber numbers at subsidiary ESPN. However, plans to launch its own streaming service might help Disney stock recapture its mojo.Coca-Cola Company (KO): $1,438.09Share price May 1, 2008: $29.31 Share price May 1, 2018: $42.14 Compound annual growth rate: 3.70 percentCoke is an iconic brand and one of Warren Buffett’s favorite investments. However, the declining popularity of sugary soda drinks might be eating into the company’s profitability in the long run.Walmart (WMT): $1,468.90Share price May 1, 2008: $58.20 Share price May 1, 2018: $85.47 Compound annual growth rate: 3.92 percentWalmart is the world’s biggest retailer but it suffered a scare from competitors like Amazon in 2015, which, along with internal factors, correlated with a decline in stock value. That put a real damper on its returns for this time period, making this the first stock listed here that underperformed the S&P 500 over the last decade. So, one of the things to avoid at Walmart might actually be its stock.Story continuesTransocean Ltd. (RIG): $83.36Share Price May 1, 2008: $146.95 Share Price May 1, 2018: $12.25 Compound annual growth rate: -22.00 percentIt turns out being associated with one of the most catastrophic oil spills in history can have a negative effect on your shares. Transocean stock was riding high through the first half of 2008, but it went into a free fall when markets crashed later that year. The hits kept coming when, in 2010, the Deepwater Horizon accident occurred. If you failed to pull your $1,000 out of Transocean stock at any point in the last decade, you would be left with less than $100 today.Trex Company, Inc. (TREX): $23,582.58Share Price May 1, 2008: $4.50 Share Price May 1, 2018: $106.14 Compound annual growth rate: 37.17 percentTrex Company makes wood/plastic composites used in making outdoor decks — which, apparently, is a pretty great business to be in as the company has been growing at over 35 percent a year in the last decade. Although growth has been mostly consistent, 2017 was the biggest year for Trex stock: It gained roughly 70 percent last year.Microsoft (MSFT): $3,376.59Share price May 1, 2008: $28.50 Share price May 1, 2018: $96.22 Compound annual growth rate: 12.94 percentMicrosoft’s stock has performed well over the past few years, but it pales in contrast to its performance during the 1990s, when it helped create a number of “Microsoft millionaires.” These days, it’s still considered one of the safest stocks to invest in — especially for first-time investors.Nike (NKE): $4,152.34Share price May 1, 2008: $16.70 Share price May 1, 2018: $69.34 Compound annual growth rate: 15.30 percentNike continues to be an innovator and leader in the sports apparel and equipment industry. By sponsoring a number of high-profile athletes and teams, the Nike symbol is one of the most recognizable around. However, in 2016 the stock hit some headwinds and took a hard tumble that it didn’t fully recover from until the end of 2017.General Electric (GE): $428.76Share price May 1, 2008: $32.80 Share price May 1, 2018: $14.07 Compound annual growth rate: -8.12 percentLike much of the overall market, General Electric’s stock plummeted during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. For GE, the culprit was mainly its financial division, GE Capital. The stock recovered nicely coming out of that period, but major missteps in 2014 and 2017 have turned it into a long-term underperformer. In fact, General Electric stock was even more efficient at losing you money over the last ten years than the S&P 500 was at making it.Don’t Miss: The Classic Brands You Love Are in TroubleAmazon (AMZN): $20,406.42Share price May 1, 2008: $78.40 Share price May 1, 2018: $1,600.14 Compound annual growth rate: 35.20 percentA $1,000 investment in Amazon would have provided a substantial return for the long-term investor. A leader in e-commerce, Amazon consistently adds new products and services for consumer and business customers. This might be the reason many experts say this is one stock you’ll want to hold onto for a very long time.Pfizer (PFE): $1,732.59Share price May 1, 2008: $20.17 Share price May 1, 2018: $34.93 Compound annual growth rate: 5.65 percentThinking about investing in the healthcare sector? Pfizer is a good stock for beginners to try. The company is a major biopharmaceutical company whose stock provides consistent growth. On the downside, it has lagged the performance of both its industry group and the S&P 500 index over multi-year periods.McDonald’s (MCD): $2,771.11Share price May 1, 2008: $59.54 Share price May 1, 2018: $165.00 Compound annual growth rate: 10.73 percentMcDonald’s is in an industry where it must regularly reinvent itself. Faced with changing consumer trends and an onslaught of competitors, the company has responded by retooling its menu, adding all-day breakfast and changing to fresh beef in some of its burgers. Investors are probably hoping it works; McDonald’s stock has beaten the S&P 500 consistently since 2005.Starbucks (SBUX): $7,197.57Share price May 1, 2008: $7.98 Share price May 1, 2018: $57.45 Compound annual growth rate: 21.82 percentStarbucks has taken the way we drink coffee and turned it into a lifestyle, both domestically and internationally. After being hit hard during the financial crisis, the stock rebounded nicely the following years. Starbucks ran into trouble recently, though, after two African-American men were arrested at a Philadelphia location, prompting a wave of negative publicity.Find Out: How to Cut Your Annual Starbucks Bill Without Giving Up Your CoffeeChesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK): $62.70Share Price May 1, 2008: $49.22 Share Price May 1, 2018: $3.13 Compound annual growth rate: -24.19 percentBetween the financial crisis and then the massive drop in oil prices in late 2014, it really hasn’t been a good decade for investors in Oklahoma City-based oil and gas producer Chesapeake Energy Corporation. Chesapeake Energy stock used to trade for nearly $50 a share. Today, you can get a single share for just over $3, leaving you with a paltry $62.70 from a $1,000 investment in May of 2008.FedEx (FDX): $2,542.33Share price May 1, 2008: $95.59 Share price May 1, 2018: $243.12 Compound annual growth rate: 9.78 percentFedEx and other shipping competitors have benefited from the boom in e-commerce retailers such as Amazon, but the company has been hot since well before the rise of Amazon and others. FedEx stock has outperformed the S&P 500 since the start of 2001.Learn: How to Know When to Sell StocksOracle (ORCL): $2,193.15Share Price May 1, 2008: $21.01 Share Price May 1, 2018: $46.07 Compound annual growth rate: 8.17 percentOracle’s returns aren’t terribly impressive when weighed against the S&P 500, but they are still ahead of the index. What’s more, it hit a major milestone in late June of last year when it finally surpassed its all-time high from 2000 prior to a steep sell-off in the midst of the tech bubble bursting, having traded below that level for over 15 years.The Boeing Company (BA): $4,010.52Share Price May 1, 2008: $84.86 Share Price May 1, 2018: $340.43 Compound annual growth rate: 14.90 percentBoeing stock has been one of the stronger performers in the Dow Jones for some time, but much of those gains have been since the start of 2017. The stock has almost doubled since the start of last year.The Mosaic Company (MOS): $228.61Share Price May 1, 2008: $120.56 Share Price May 1, 2018: $27.56 Compound annual growth rate: -13.72 percentThe Mosaic Company is a basic materials company that produces concentrated phosphate and potash fertilizers. Of course, in the last decade, Mosaic Company stock has just been producing a lot of disappointed investors as it dropped to under a fifth of its May 2008 value. Maybe they could take pictures of everyone who lost money and piece them together into one big collage of sorts.Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI): $5,194.05Share Price May 1, 2008: $13.55 Share Price May 1, 2018: $70.37 Compound annual growth rate: 17.91 percentFrom the start of 2010 to the start of 2013, Activision Blizzard stock held painfully steady. The stock opened 2010 at $11.23 a pop and ended 2013 at $18.29 a share. That makes the massive gain over the 10-year period all the more impressive, considering it essentially broke even on the first half of that period. Since the start of 2013, the stock is up a whopping 530 percent.Use These: 6 Best Long-Term InvestmentsEstee Lauder Companies, Inc. (EL): $5,864.41Share Price May 1, 2008: $22.81 Share Price May 1, 2018: $133.79 Compound annual growth rate: 19.35 percentThere’s no need to slap makeup on results like these, Estee Lauder’s nearly 20 percent annual return over the last decade might have investors blushing at how well they’ve done. The company grew at a rapid rate after the 2008 crash, had one hiccup in 2016, only to roar back in 2017, nearly doubling its value from the start of 2017 to March 2018.Salesforce.com, Inc.

But, with a recurring $8 here and $10 there, the cost of living “over-the-top” can quickly catch up to the average cable bill, which comes out to $103 per month.Last week, streaming music platform Spotify and online TV service Hulu announced a $13 monthly package, which includes Spotify Premium and Hulu’s cheapest option (which includes limited commercials). In light of this partnership, Yahoo Finance decided to ask readers what their dream bundle would look like. Respondents were asked to select two services/apps out of 24 different choices. The options included Amazon Prime (AMZN), Apple Music (AAPL), Blue Apron (APRN), Bonobos, Bumble, ClassPass, FreshDirect, GlamSquad, HelloFresh, Hotel Tonight, Hulu, Lyft, MealPal, MoviePass, OpenTable (BKNG), Netflix (NFLX), Rent The Runway, Seamless (GRUB), SoulCycle, Spotify (SPOT), StitchFix (SFIX), The New York Times (NYT), Tinder (MTCH) and Uber. The dynamic duoOf the 383 people who participated in the survey, 93 individuals, or 24.3% of all respondents, voted for a discounted bundle that combines Amazon Prime and Netflix.Readers all repeated variations of the same sentiment — “they are by far the best,” “super entertainment bundle,” “it would be perfect and you would have everything you need,” “They are the two services I use the most and derive the greatest value from!”Both Netflix and Amazon Prime hit major milestones this week. Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos finally disclosed how many people pay for Prime membership — a whopping 100 million. Netflix announced it added 2 million U.S. subscribers in the first quarter of 2018. The streaming behemoth now has 125 million subscribers around the world. Though investors and analysts wonder just how much more Netflix can grow in an already saturated market.It’s undeniable that Amazon Prime and Netflix dominate household media consumption and Prime’s added e-commerce bonus tempts families who are still holding out.One respondent noted, “They both have shows I would watch but I wouldn’t pay for them separately. I would also take advantage of Prime Shipping.”Netflix dominatesIn total, respondents created 68 different combinations from the choices. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Netflix dominated respondents’ picks, with the streaming service appearing in the four most popular combinations. A Netflix and Spotify Premium bundle came in a distant second to  Amazon Prime/Netflix, with 16.7% of all respondents wanting that bundle.  When asked why they chose the two, one person said, “Because I listen to Spotify all day long, and I watch Netflix all night long.” Other comments included, “I already pay for Spotify, it would be nice if I got some sort of discount when having Netflix as well. I typically just subscribe when a show comes out I want to watch” and “I use both Netflix and Spotify daily and if I could get around paying $25 a month for both that would be amazing.” A Netflix and Hulu marriage was the third most popular bundle, with 10.7% choosing the direct competitors as their ideal pairing.Comments included, “Hulu could do the TV part and Netflix could deal more with the movie side. Netflix could offer their shows on Hulu,” “I want to expand my movie and TV access, as I only have internet, and no cable. What you can’t see on one you can see on the other. It’s TV without a cable subscription.”Other comments echoed the fact that the two services actually complement each other. “They’re in the same category, but the content is different enough that we pay for both. Plus, Hulu comes with the option to add premium channels. I’m always flipping back and forth between shows on Hulu and Netflix”, one person commented. “Netflix and Hulu w/Live would be all the TV I ever need,” another added.Story continuesHulu, which is jointly owned by Time Warner, 21st Century Fox, Comcast, and Disney, has 17 million paying subscribers in the U.S. across its video-on-demand and new live TV services.Seven percent of respondents chose a Netflix and Apple Music bundle, most citing that they are current Netflix subscribers but are also part of the Apple ecosystem and would be interested if there was a discount. Apple Music costs $10 per month, or $15 for a family subscription which covers up to six people.MoviePassFive percent of respondents chose Amazon Prime and Spotify. A Netflix and MoviePass deal came in sixth place, with 3.9% choosing the movie lover’s package — “home entertainment and a night out at the movies… the best of both worlds,” as one reader put it. MoviePass and Amazon Prime was another popular combination. MoviePass, dubbed the “Netflix of cinema” has been constantly rejiggering its business model, slashing subscription fees to as low as $8 a month for unlimited movie-viewing in select theaters (3D and IMAX are not included). The latest option is $10 for four movies per month. What consumers wantWhile none of these combinations are necessarily down the pipeline, Spotify has been an industry leader when it comes to partnering with services that share a similar target demographic. Last fall, Spotify and Hulu offered students a $4.99 monthly bundle to access Spotify Premium and Hulu’s entry-level subscription. “The idea of being able to bring your favorite music together and an over-the-top channel that allows you to see most of what you want to see anyway, that’s fantastic. It’s very smart,” said Susan Lyne, president of BBG Ventures, and a former executive at ABC Entertainment and Martha Stewart Omnimedia.Last winter, the New York Times partnered with Spotify, offering its All Access digital subscribers a free membership to Spotify Premium. That offer is no longer being offered to new customers.“Our offer with Spotify was always marketed as a special, limited-time offer — it was available for a full year (Feb. 2017 – Feb. 2018).  Customers who subscribed to this option, and have not canceled, continue to receive Spotify Premium with their Times subscription,” a New York Times spokesperson told Yahoo Finance.Even if not at a discount, one easy startup idea would be a service to actually streamline payments for all of these monthly subscription services. As Morgan Housel, partner at venture capital firm Collaborative Fund, opined, wouldn’t it be nice to have a one-stop shop to pay for all of these services? I’d like to manage all of my subscriptions in one product. Pay once price a month for Netflix, Spotify, Prime, Adobe, newspapers, etc. One credit card charge, one password. Someone do this. — Morgan Housel (@morganhousel) April 19, 2018 While we are trying to extricate ourselves from cable TV, it’s clear that consumers are seeking ways to bundle their ever-increasing subscription fees.—Melody Hahm is a senior writer at Yahoo Finance, covering entrepreneurship, technology and real estate.

Fortunately, most of the time, investors are content to sit back and let time do the heavy lifting.Every now and then, however, an uninterrupted market-wide rally (such as the one we saw in 2017) followed by a couple of major corrections (such as the ones we've seen in 2018) inspires a more active approach. Buying every dip last year was a bulletproof strategy; steering clear of this year's big dips would've left most investors far better off.But broadly speaking, investors shouldn't embrace that short-term mindset. Buy-and-hold is a time-tested strategy that helps investors avoid trying to time the market (which even experts can't reliably do) and making poor emotional decisions.With that as a backdrop, here are a dozen stocks to never sell. Many buy-and-holders are looking to reset their portfolios as the new year begins. If you hold any of the stocks, don't stop ... and if you're looking to buy, be ready to commit. Each company has plenty to success that their history of success should continue for years to come. And each operates in an industry that won't go away anytime soon.SEE ALSO: 101 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2019 and Beyond3MGetty ImagesMarket value: $116.8 billionDividend yield: 2.7%3M (MMM, $198.32) shareholders aren't strangers to prolonged periods of tepid performance. The stock made no net progress whatsoever from late 2003 to late 2012.But it still was a worthwhile holding during that time. How? 3M's quarterly dividend grew from 33 cents per share at the beginning of that timeframe to 59 cents by the end, and it was never suspended or cut. Better yet, 3M earned more than it dished out during that period; it could afford its payments.3M is an income-driving machine, even when it's not a growth name.The company's strength is its highly diversified product lineup, which gives 3M plenty to sell in any economic environment. From Post-Its to sandpaper to circuit breakers to dentistry supplies, 3M never lacks for opportunity; much of its product base includes goods that its customers don't think twice about buying regardless of the economy's condition.The next several years should be above-average ones, if the company's forecasters are on target and its leaders are on their game. 3M expects per-share profit growth of between 8% and 11% for the next five years on organic local-currency sales growth of between 3% and 5%. That's huge for an income-oriented company of this size and age.SEE ALSO: The 27 Best Mutual Funds in 401(k) Retirement PlansAltriaStory continuesGetty ImagesMarket value: $101.9 billionDividend yield: 6.0%"When building a portfolio of forever stocks, you are usually facing a decision of buying a stock for income or for growth potential," says Joseph Conroy, financial planner with at Maryland-based Synergy Financial Group. But he also notes that cigarette company Altria (MO, $53.36) "appears it might be able to offer both."The outlook doesn't exactly jibe with an increasingly effective smoking-cessation movement. But Altria is finding a way to survive. Revenues have mostly held steady since 2010. Income, while erratic, is trending upward, fueling the stock's steadily rising dividend.Nevertheless, the cigarette industry's glory days of growth are behind it, and the future still looks fuzzy for e-cigarettes. What might Altria have in mind for its next era?Conroy says, "There is one untapped market place that will be a huge growth factor for (Altria)," Conroy says. "The inevitable legalization of marijuana will create an amazing amount of market share opportunity for the company. The infrastructure is in place ... Philip Morris (USA) can practically flip a switch and be in production of numerous cannabis products.""While waiting for that eventual day to come," he says, "you are getting paid a healthy 5% dividend yield and an attractive P/E ratio of around 11."Investors won't have to wait. A couple days after Conroy's remarks, Altria announced it bought a 45% stake in Canadian cannabis company Cronos Group for $1.8 billion, with an option to up its stake to 55%.SEE ALSO: 19 Best Stocks to Buy for 2019Amazon.comGetty ImagesMarket value: $814.0 billionDividend yield: N/AAmazon.com (AMZN, $1,641.03) is a bird of a different feather to be sure, as it's not valued based on any of the classic rules of stock-picking. But the e-commerce giant has a history of making up its own valuation rules so effectively that even the most traditional of investors can comfortably hitch onto this name.Amazon's staying power is anchored in its diversity, its reach and the mountain of consumer information it collects and leverages. From grocery stores to bookstores to its own brand of consumer goods to its own apparel brand names - and more - a huge swath of the world does at least some business with Amazon on a regular basis. Not everything it does is wildly (or at all) profitable. But once someone is brought into the ecosystem, Amazon presents all sorts of other alternative monetization paths.It's not a cheap business model. Amazon.com was barely profitable for years, and losses were never unusual or surprising. The company never has been more profitable than it is right now, and even so, newcomers will be paying more than 90 times the company's trailing income and 60 times analysts' estimates for next year's profits.But sales growth is unstoppable, and AMZN stock has been a similarly unstoppable investment. It's not immune to the occasional short-term setback (see: now), but its longer-term trend has mostly reflected the past decade-plus of uninterrupted quarterly sales growth.SEE ALSO: The 5 Best Investments You Can Make in 2019American States Water CompanyGetty ImagesMarket value: $2.5 billionDividend yield: 1.7%American States Water Company (AWR, $66.58) isn't exactly a high-flying growth stock that inspires splashy headlines. In fact, it's the diametrical opposite of that. It's a utility name that boasts slow growth. It's not even cheap, at 40 times its trailing-12 month earnings. And its yield has been dialed down to a modest 1.7%.But just try to go one day without using any water. The value of a reliable supply of potable water becomes crystal clear.There are cheaper companies with better growth rates, even if that growth is uneven. No other industry, however, can say they operate what is effectively a legal monopoly with (literally) no alternative. Consumers can install solar panels as an alternative to relying on piping in power from a utility company. Many consumers are dropping landlines altogether and making their mobile phone their one and only phone. Short of drilling a well in their backyards, though, and hoping for the best, consumers will buy water from their one local provider.American States Water's top and bottom lines are well positioned for long-term growth, too. Rate increases ultimately have to be approved by a localized utility board, but requests from utility providers rarely are denied in the end, even if most are initially fought.The rate increase trend is particularly reliable for water supplies. Circle of Blue, an industry information resource, reports eight consecutive years of nationwide water rate increases.SEE ALSO: 10 Top Utility Stocks to Buy for Safety and DividendsAmgenGetty ImagesMarket value: $125.3 billionDividend yield: 3.0%A biotech stock you can buy and forget? Really?Yes, but only because Amgen (AMGN, $194.09) is anything but your typical biotech company. It has a great deal of built-in diversity that rounds out the wild revenue swings that single-product and other more focused biopharma stocks tend to dish out. No single drug makes up more than one-fourth of its revenue, and only two drugs generate more than a tenth of its sales. All told it makes and markets 15 different therapies, addressing multiple markets.Those are just the drugs that are approved. Amgen has eight Phase III trials underway, seeking to expand its existing portfolio, and another five Phase II trials. Throw in the five biosimilar drugs in the works that don't have to follow the full developmental path the FDA requires of most new drugs, and the company has plenty of revenue lined up for the foreseeable future.Still, isn't biotech an inherently risky investment? It certainly can be, but given Amgen's sheer size and $30 billion worth of liquidity, Amgen is equipped to muscle out the competition and outright acquire some competitors it can't keep contained.SEE ALSO: The 7 Best Biotech Stocks for Investors Who Hate RiskAppleGetty ImagesMarket value: $804.7 billionDividend yield: 1.7%Even for all its recent troubles, Apple (AAPL, $169.60) really is one of the market's most proven names, and it would be even if it wasn't a behemoth. Jason Escamilla, Chief Investment Officer with San Francisco based ImpactAdvisor, says, "With Apple, you a well-run growth company with extraordinary profit margins at a reasonable valuation."Those haven't been the prevailing talking points of late. The company recently announced it would stop reporting unit sales of its flagship iPhone. Some analysts are interpreting the decision as a sign that Apple knows it's finally starting to run out of new customers to sell the smartphone to. Moreover, Apple has gotten caught up in America's trade war with China.These headwinds are being offset by higher iPhone prices, however, and perhaps more important, by major revenue growth from its Services arm. Sales of apps and digital content shot 27% higher to a record $10 billion in the company's quarter ended Sept. 29. That's roughly 16% of Apple's total sales, and the organization has yet to reach its full stride on that front.Apple always seems to find something to sell, and it excels in most markets it chooses to address.There's a certain philosophical advantage in owning Apple over other investment opportunities too. Escamilla adds, "As a long-term investment, it is further de-risked when you consider the company's demonstrated preference for buying back shares over pursuing low-margin and higher-risk growth." Apple has repurchased nearly $73 billion of its own stock over the past four quarters.SEE ALSO: 10 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying (And 6 He's Selling)Johnson & JohnsonGetty ImagesMarket value: $392.9 billionDividend yield: 2.5%Admittedly, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ, $145.26) is tough to like right now. Recent reporting suggests the company had known for years that its talcum powder contained the known carcinogen asbestos, underscoring what many have suspected for quite some time now. JNJ shares tumbled nearly 10% on the day Reuters made the allegation, but if the development turns into a full-blown legal liability, it could put even more pressure on J&J shares.Yet, as difficult as it may be, one has to look at the bigger picture. This is the same company that's been making baby shampoo for decades. It's also the name behind Band-Aid brand bandages, Tylenol, Listerine and more - all consumer products that hold up against cyclical headwinds.Investors should also recognize J&J is waist-deep into the pharmaceutical business. Last year it sold $36.3 billion worth of prescription drugs, led by arthritis and colitis treatment Remicade. It sold $6.3 billion worth of that prescription medicine, followed closely by $4 billion worth of Stelara. Even fewer investors recognize that Johnson & Johnson also operates a medical devices arm, which added $26.6 billion to last year's top line. From laparoscopic surgery equipment to wound closure to glucose monitors, Johnson & Johnson has solutions.It's a rare mix of diversity that keeps JNJ in good position to keep the top line growing regardless of the regulatory or economic environment. Whatever litigation may arise from the asbestos allegation still won't change the fact that the company is well-diversified.EDITOR'S NOTE: This frame has been updated to include new information about Johnson & Johnson's talc scandal.SEE ALSO: 7 Health Care Stocks to Buy for Robust ReturnsJPMorgan ChaseGetty ImagesMarket value: $342.0 billionDividend yield: 3.2%"Being a value investor, I like the financial sector and especially JPMorgan Chase (JPM, $101.36)," says Glen Smith, managing partner of Glen D. Smith & Associates and advisor with Raymond James.JPMorgan is the nation's biggest bank when measured by total assets, sporting nearly $2.2 trillion worth as of the Federal Reserve's latest look. It's also much more than just a run-of-the-mill banking operation. JPMorgan offers wealth management, brokerage services, merchant services, underwriting and more. This breadth gives JPMorgan plenty of opportunity to grow.And it largely has. While the bank finally struggled to fully shake off the echoes of 2008's subprime meltdown and revenue continued to lose ground through 2016, JPM finally found its form. JPMorgan has broken records on the top and bottom lines in each of the past three quarters. Smith expects more of the same, too, saying, "We expect interest rates to climb, and as rates go up financials should profit more as the spread between what the banks generate on short-term notes and what they pay out to the customer continues to widen."JPMorgan's appeal goes well beyond the foreseeable future. While it has become a head-turner of late, it's also on firmer footing than many of its peers.SEE ALSO: The 7 Best Bank ETFs for American BullsRealty IncomeGetty ImagesMarket value: $19.6 billionDividend yield: 4.0%Real estate is no less cyclical than stocks, though the ebb and flow of real estate values aren't necessarily synchronized with the stock market. So investors aiming for a little more stability might want to blend real estate investment trusts (REITs) into their portfolios.Chris Kuiper, equity analyst with CFRA Research, thinks Realty Income (O, $65.66) is a top all-weather way of adding real estate exposure to a portfolio. The company owns, develops and manages almost exclusively free-standing buildings that are leased to high-quality tenants such as convenience stores, dollar stores and drug stores - such as top customer Walgreens (WBA).7-Eleven and FedEx (FDX) are a close second and third in terms of rent revenue, making up a tenant base that Kuiper says is "very insulated from the rise of e-commerce as well as recessions.""The company pays out a monthly dividend and has done so consecutively for the past 579 months at a 4.6% compound average annual dividend growth rate since it listed in 1994," says Kuiper, who also likes Realty Income for dividend investors. "The total stock return has delivered a 15.9% compound annual return, far outpacing the S&P 500."SEE ALSO: 12 Alternative Strategies for High Yield and StabilityUnileverGetty ImagesMarket value: $149.0 billionDividend yield: 3.3%Unilever (UN, $55.27) does double duty for North American investors.

On the other hand, it brings some much-needed international exposure to a portfolio. Unilever is a dual-headquartered company based in the U.K. and Netherlands.

Unilever had and has a firm grasp of what was working, and what would work, in terms of product mix and product development. In 2009, for instance, the company tweaked its marketing message for its Bertolli frozen dinners, appealing to consumers who'd stopped eating out in the wake of a rough recession.

Fortunately, most of the time, investors are content to sit back and let time do the heavy lifting.Every now and then, however, an uninterrupted market-wide rally (such as the one we saw in 2017) followed by a couple of major corrections (such as the ones we've seen in 2018) inspires a more active approach. Buying every dip last year was a bulletproof strategy; steering clear of this year's big dips would've left most investors far better off.But broadly speaking, investors shouldn't embrace that short-term mindset. Buy-and-hold is a time-tested strategy that helps investors avoid trying to time the market (which even experts can't reliably do) and making poor emotional decisions.With that as a backdrop, here are a dozen stocks to never sell. Many buy-and-holders are looking to reset their portfolios as the new year begins. If you hold any of the stocks, don't stop ... and if you're looking to buy, be ready to commit. Each company has plenty to success that their history of success should continue for years to come. And each operates in an industry that won't go away anytime soon.SEE ALSO: 101 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2019 and Beyond3MGetty ImagesMarket value: $116.8 billionDividend yield: 2.7%3M (MMM, $198.32) shareholders aren't strangers to prolonged periods of tepid performance. The stock made no net progress whatsoever from late 2003 to late 2012.But it still was a worthwhile holding during that time. How? 3M's quarterly dividend grew from 33 cents per share at the beginning of that timeframe to 59 cents by the end, and it was never suspended or cut. Better yet, 3M earned more than it dished out during that period; it could afford its payments.3M is an income-driving machine, even when it's not a growth name.The company's strength is its highly diversified product lineup, which gives 3M plenty to sell in any economic environment. From Post-Its to sandpaper to circuit breakers to dentistry supplies, 3M never lacks for opportunity; much of its product base includes goods that its customers don't think twice about buying regardless of the economy's condition.The next several years should be above-average ones, if the company's forecasters are on target and its leaders are on their game. 3M expects per-share profit growth of between 8% and 11% for the next five years on organic local-currency sales growth of between 3% and 5%. That's huge for an income-oriented company of this size and age.SEE ALSO: The 27 Best Mutual Funds in 401(k) Retirement PlansAltriaStory continuesGetty ImagesMarket value: $101.9 billionDividend yield: 6.0%"When building a portfolio of forever stocks, you are usually facing a decision of buying a stock for income or for growth potential," says Joseph Conroy, financial planner with at Maryland-based Synergy Financial Group. But he also notes that cigarette company Altria (MO, $53.36) "appears it might be able to offer both."The outlook doesn't exactly jibe with an increasingly effective smoking-cessation movement. But Altria is finding a way to survive. Revenues have mostly held steady since 2010. Income, while erratic, is trending upward, fueling the stock's steadily rising dividend.Nevertheless, the cigarette industry's glory days of growth are behind it, and the future still looks fuzzy for e-cigarettes. What might Altria have in mind for its next era?Conroy says, "There is one untapped market place that will be a huge growth factor for (Altria)," Conroy says. "The inevitable legalization of marijuana will create an amazing amount of market share opportunity for the company. The infrastructure is in place ... Philip Morris (USA) can practically flip a switch and be in production of numerous cannabis products.""While waiting for that eventual day to come," he says, "you are getting paid a healthy 5% dividend yield and an attractive P/E ratio of around 11."Investors won't have to wait. A couple days after Conroy's remarks, Altria announced it bought a 45% stake in Canadian cannabis company Cronos Group for $1.8 billion, with an option to up its stake to 55%.SEE ALSO: 19 Best Stocks to Buy for 2019Amazon.comGetty ImagesMarket value: $814.0 billionDividend yield: N/AAmazon.com (AMZN, $1,641.03) is a bird of a different feather to be sure, as it's not valued based on any of the classic rules of stock-picking. But the e-commerce giant has a history of making up its own valuation rules so effectively that even the most traditional of investors can comfortably hitch onto this name.Amazon's staying power is anchored in its diversity, its reach and the mountain of consumer information it collects and leverages. From grocery stores to bookstores to its own brand of consumer goods to its own apparel brand names - and more - a huge swath of the world does at least some business with Amazon on a regular basis. Not everything it does is wildly (or at all) profitable. But once someone is brought into the ecosystem, Amazon presents all sorts of other alternative monetization paths.It's not a cheap business model. Amazon.com was barely profitable for years, and losses were never unusual or surprising. The company never has been more profitable than it is right now, and even so, newcomers will be paying more than 90 times the company's trailing income and 60 times analysts' estimates for next year's profits.But sales growth is unstoppable, and AMZN stock has been a similarly unstoppable investment. It's not immune to the occasional short-term setback (see: now), but its longer-term trend has mostly reflected the past decade-plus of uninterrupted quarterly sales growth.SEE ALSO: The 5 Best Investments You Can Make in 2019American States Water CompanyGetty ImagesMarket value: $2.5 billionDividend yield: 1.7%American States Water Company (AWR, $66.58) isn't exactly a high-flying growth stock that inspires splashy headlines. In fact, it's the diametrical opposite of that. It's a utility name that boasts slow growth. It's not even cheap, at 40 times its trailing-12 month earnings. And its yield has been dialed down to a modest 1.7%.But just try to go one day without using any water. The value of a reliable supply of potable water becomes crystal clear.There are cheaper companies with better growth rates, even if that growth is uneven. No other industry, however, can say they operate what is effectively a legal monopoly with (literally) no alternative. Consumers can install solar panels as an alternative to relying on piping in power from a utility company. Many consumers are dropping landlines altogether and making their mobile phone their one and only phone. Short of drilling a well in their backyards, though, and hoping for the best, consumers will buy water from their one local provider.American States Water's top and bottom lines are well positioned for long-term growth, too. Rate increases ultimately have to be approved by a localized utility board, but requests from utility providers rarely are denied in the end, even if most are initially fought.The rate increase trend is particularly reliable for water supplies. Circle of Blue, an industry information resource, reports eight consecutive years of nationwide water rate increases.SEE ALSO: 10 Top Utility Stocks to Buy for Safety and DividendsAmgenGetty ImagesMarket value: $125.3 billionDividend yield: 3.0%A biotech stock you can buy and forget? Really?Yes, but only because Amgen (AMGN, $194.09) is anything but your typical biotech company. It has a great deal of built-in diversity that rounds out the wild revenue swings that single-product and other more focused biopharma stocks tend to dish out. No single drug makes up more than one-fourth of its revenue, and only two drugs generate more than a tenth of its sales. All told it makes and markets 15 different therapies, addressing multiple markets.Those are just the drugs that are approved. Amgen has eight Phase III trials underway, seeking to expand its existing portfolio, and another five Phase II trials. Throw in the five biosimilar drugs in the works that don't have to follow the full developmental path the FDA requires of most new drugs, and the company has plenty of revenue lined up for the foreseeable future.Still, isn't biotech an inherently risky investment? It certainly can be, but given Amgen's sheer size and $30 billion worth of liquidity, Amgen is equipped to muscle out the competition and outright acquire some competitors it can't keep contained.SEE ALSO: The 7 Best Biotech Stocks for Investors Who Hate RiskAppleGetty ImagesMarket value: $804.7 billionDividend yield: 1.7%Even for all its recent troubles, Apple (AAPL, $169.60) really is one of the market's most proven names, and it would be even if it wasn't a behemoth. Jason Escamilla, Chief Investment Officer with San Francisco based ImpactAdvisor, says, "With Apple, you a well-run growth company with extraordinary profit margins at a reasonable valuation."Those haven't been the prevailing talking points of late. The company recently announced it would stop reporting unit sales of its flagship iPhone. Some analysts are interpreting the decision as a sign that Apple knows it's finally starting to run out of new customers to sell the smartphone to. Moreover, Apple has gotten caught up in America's trade war with China.These headwinds are being offset by higher iPhone prices, however, and perhaps more important, by major revenue growth from its Services arm. Sales of apps and digital content shot 27% higher to a record $10 billion in the company's quarter ended Sept. 29. That's roughly 16% of Apple's total sales, and the organization has yet to reach its full stride on that front.Apple always seems to find something to sell, and it excels in most markets it chooses to address.There's a certain philosophical advantage in owning Apple over other investment opportunities too. Escamilla adds, "As a long-term investment, it is further de-risked when you consider the company's demonstrated preference for buying back shares over pursuing low-margin and higher-risk growth." Apple has repurchased nearly $73 billion of its own stock over the past four quarters.SEE ALSO: 10 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying (And 6 He's Selling)Johnson & JohnsonGetty ImagesMarket value: $392.9 billionDividend yield: 2.5%Admittedly, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ, $145.26) is tough to like right now. Recent reporting suggests the company had known for years that its talcum powder contained the known carcinogen asbestos, underscoring what many have suspected for quite some time now. JNJ shares tumbled nearly 10% on the day Reuters made the allegation, but if the development turns into a full-blown legal liability, it could put even more pressure on J&J shares.Yet, as difficult as it may be, one has to look at the bigger picture. This is the same company that's been making baby shampoo for decades. It's also the name behind Band-Aid brand bandages, Tylenol, Listerine and more - all consumer products that hold up against cyclical headwinds.Investors should also recognize J&J is waist-deep into the pharmaceutical business. Last year it sold $36.3 billion worth of prescription drugs, led by arthritis and colitis treatment Remicade. It sold $6.3 billion worth of that prescription medicine, followed closely by $4 billion worth of Stelara. Even fewer investors recognize that Johnson & Johnson also operates a medical devices arm, which added $26.6 billion to last year's top line. From laparoscopic surgery equipment to wound closure to glucose monitors, Johnson & Johnson has solutions.It's a rare mix of diversity that keeps JNJ in good position to keep the top line growing regardless of the regulatory or economic environment. Whatever litigation may arise from the asbestos allegation still won't change the fact that the company is well-diversified.EDITOR'S NOTE: This frame has been updated to include new information about Johnson & Johnson's talc scandal.SEE ALSO: 7 Health Care Stocks to Buy for Robust ReturnsJPMorgan ChaseGetty ImagesMarket value: $342.0 billionDividend yield: 3.2%"Being a value investor, I like the financial sector and especially JPMorgan Chase (JPM, $101.36)," says Glen Smith, managing partner of Glen D. Smith & Associates and advisor with Raymond James.JPMorgan is the nation's biggest bank when measured by total assets, sporting nearly $2.2 trillion worth as of the Federal Reserve's latest look. It's also much more than just a run-of-the-mill banking operation. JPMorgan offers wealth management, brokerage services, merchant services, underwriting and more. This breadth gives JPMorgan plenty of opportunity to grow.And it largely has. While the bank finally struggled to fully shake off the echoes of 2008's subprime meltdown and revenue continued to lose ground through 2016, JPM finally found its form. JPMorgan has broken records on the top and bottom lines in each of the past three quarters. Smith expects more of the same, too, saying, "We expect interest rates to climb, and as rates go up financials should profit more as the spread between what the banks generate on short-term notes and what they pay out to the customer continues to widen."JPMorgan's appeal goes well beyond the foreseeable future. While it has become a head-turner of late, it's also on firmer footing than many of its peers.SEE ALSO: The 7 Best Bank ETFs for American BullsRealty IncomeGetty ImagesMarket value: $19.6 billionDividend yield: 4.0%Real estate is no less cyclical than stocks, though the ebb and flow of real estate values aren't necessarily synchronized with the stock market. So investors aiming for a little more stability might want to blend real estate investment trusts (REITs) into their portfolios.Chris Kuiper, equity analyst with CFRA Research, thinks Realty Income (O, $65.66) is a top all-weather way of adding real estate exposure to a portfolio. The company owns, develops and manages almost exclusively free-standing buildings that are leased to high-quality tenants such as convenience stores, dollar stores and drug stores - such as top customer Walgreens (WBA).7-Eleven and FedEx (FDX) are a close second and third in terms of rent revenue, making up a tenant base that Kuiper says is "very insulated from the rise of e-commerce as well as recessions.""The company pays out a monthly dividend and has done so consecutively for the past 579 months at a 4.6% compound average annual dividend growth rate since it listed in 1994," says Kuiper, who also likes Realty Income for dividend investors. "The total stock return has delivered a 15.9% compound annual return, far outpacing the S&P 500."SEE ALSO: 12 Alternative Strategies for High Yield and StabilityUnileverGetty ImagesMarket value: $149.0 billionDividend yield: 3.3%Unilever (UN, $55.27) does double duty for North American investors.

As of 3 p.m. sharp, the virtual doors have been opened for Amazon Prime members, allowing them to shop more than 100,000 discounted products. (Seriously! That's a very real number.) With all of those deals at your disposal and so little time in the day, we sifted through them so you don't have to. With our beauty expert eyes, we've pulled together several beauty essentials that you should definitely stock up on. Your beauty routine deserves it. And for any other tips you may need for shopping Amazon Prime Day, click here.1. Clarisonic Mia 2 Cleansing Brush (Was $169, Now $110)Whether you consider yourself a Clarisonic aficionado or a total novice to the whole electronic beauty tools thing, we have a good feeling you'll be impressed by just how hard the Mia 2 brush goes to work. Meant to deeply cleanse and exfoliate the skin, the travel-friendly brush has two-speed options, a timer, and a protective case that's perfect for packing.2. Solimo 5-Blade Razor (Was $8, Now $6)If you're a shaver — all or the time or some of the time — this no-frills 5-blade razor is a great, low-budget option to stock up on. They're hypoallergenic and come with two razor refills, made with comfort-coated blades and rounded razor cartridges for the closest shave possible. According to reviewers, these make for a smoother, cheaper replacement for the typical drugstore buys.3. Crest 3D White Professional Effects Whitestrips Kit (Was $44, Now $28)As a multi-year Best of Beauty and Reader's Choice winner, you don't just have to take our word for these teeth-whitening strips. If you can commit to wearing them for 30 minutes a day for 20 days, the strips are designed to get rid of stains and leave you with a smile as shiny as professional bleaching could achieve for a fraction of the cost. They're easy to apply and leave behind zero mess, so what are you waiting for?Story continues4. 100% Pure Coffee Bean Caffeine Eye Cream (Was $26, Now $24.70)This natural beauty pick has some major de-puffing powers — the caffeine in its formula shrinks puffy morning eyes in a matter of a minute (Allure editors can attest to this). As if that's not reason enough, the ingredients list is filled with aloe extract, rose hydrofoil, and green tea extract which all make for a super hydrating and nourishing eye cream.5. Braun FaceSpa KitNeed a total bathroom overhaul? Look no further. This system includes an electric facial cleansing brush with four different brush head options — including a normal brush, extra sensitive brush, exfoliation brush, and a beauty sponge — to tackle your complete skin care regimen. You'll also find a facial epilator that not only removes facial hair by the root, but cleanses the skin pore-deep at the same time.6.

(Photo by Dan MacMedan/WireImage) MoreIt’s Oscar season and once again, it looks like your best bet to watch an Oscar nominated movie at home is going to be on DVD or Blu-ray.Streaming movies online has countless advantages over getting a polycarbonate platter in the mail, but selection is often not among them. That’s especially so at Netflix (NFLX), which must wait its turn before subscribers can watch the award season’s top films on its flat-rate plans.That’s because the movie industry still makes more money through purchases and rentals than streaming films.But even if you limit yourself to rentals and purchases at Amazon (AMZN) and others, where the selection should be about even between physical and digital, DVDs and Blu-ray discs retain some advantages.This year’s nominees, sort-of playing on AmazonWatching many of the Academy Award nominees that debuted only recently still requires going to a theater. Home viewing — well, legal home viewing — is only an option for a handful of contenders in the big five categories of best picture, best director, best actor, best actress and best (original and adapted) screenplay.Good luck watching ‘Hidden Figures’ at home any time soon.MoreFor example, among the nine best picture nominees, only the crime drama “Hell or High Water” is available as a digital download (for rent or purchase) or as a disc at Amazon.Two other dramas, “Hacksaw Ridge” and “Manchester by the Sea,” will land on Amazon as downloadable purchases on Feb. 7 and in disc form on Feb. 21. The sci-fi hit “Arrival” arrives in physical form Feb. 14, but Amazon doesn’t show a digital due date.Home viewing of best picture nominees “Fences,” “Hidden Figures,” “La La Land,” “Lion” and “Moonlight,” meanwhile, requires an indefinite wait.I found one best original screenplay possibility, “20th Century Women,” listed only on Amazon as a free Appstore app whose sales pitch included the line “Now you this request cold Android all 4K-Ultra-HD-3DMovies.” It vanished after a query to Amazon PR.Not so much luck on NetflixNetflix subscribers will have to wait even longer to watch this year’s Oscar contenders, especially folks without a DVD subscription. Best actress nominee “Florence Foster Jenkins” (Meryl Streep), best actor nominee “Captain Fantastic” (Viggo Mortensen) and best original screenplay nominee “The Lobster” are only available via DVD through Netflix, but you can digitally rent or purchase them on disc at Amazon. ‘La La Land’ is up for a host of awards, but watching it at home before the Oscar’s is going to be tough.MoreThat pattern prevails for last year’s nominees, as well. Of eight 2016 best-picture contenders, only two are on Netflix’s streaming menu: “Spotlight” (which won my own Oscar for “best depiction of newsroom slovenliness”) and “The Big Short.” The other six — “Bridge of Spies,” “Brooklyn,” “Mad Max: Fury Road,” “The Martian,” “The Revenant” and “Room” — are DVD-only at Netflix. You can buy downloads or discs of all of them at Amazon, and all but “Bridge of Spies” and “Brooklyn” are available as digital rentals there. “Room” is also free to stream for Prime subscribers.Given the choice between buying a digital file tied to “digital rights management” software and a disc that you can loan or resell, physical media should warrant paying a little more. Especially if the disc itself comes with digital versions to watch on a computer or tablet.Story continuesHow this worksThe explanation for this is not any Hollywood hostility toward Netflix, but the intersection of copyright law and the movie industry’s “release window” strategy of selling movies in one channel at a time to maximize profits.“The windows were never set up for the benefit of the consumer,” said Michael Goodman, director of research for Strategy Analytics. “In a perfect world, everything would be released day and date” — simultaneous digital and theatrical debuts.‘Manchester by the Sea’ will soon be available as a DVD, but there’s no word on when it’ll land on streaming services. (Photo: Roadside Attractions) MoreOnce physical sales do start, however, Netflix can rent discs without permission, just as used bookstores don’t need a publisher’s say-so to operate.That’s courtesy of a legal principle called the “first sale doctrine,” holding that a copyright holder’s control over a creative work’s distribution doesn’t extend to a particular purchased physical copy. That doctrine doesn’t cover digital files “sold” subject to a terms-of-use license. So Netflix must negotiate with studios to stream their films — and studios still make more money from rentals and purchases than streaming via a subscription. “The consumer price-per-view of a movie streamed 18 months after release is measured in cents, whereas the same film purchased as a recent release, on whatever format, is measured in dollars,” wrote Richard Cooper, an analyst with IHS Markit. Neither analyst expects this to change, even as studios have begun experimenting with selling digital downloads a few weeks before DVD and Blu-ray sales start. The result, for streaming viewers, can be a frustrating Venn diagram in which convenient, legal and comprehensive barely overlap.“It’s kind of balkanized,” Goodman said. “I do this professionally, and I have to see who the studio is and cross-reference to see who they have an distribution agreement with.” More from Rob:President Trump’s tech policy is a mysteryHow carriers will keep D.C. online during the inaugurationWhat you should really know about every major hacking storyOutgoing FCC chair: Don’t go backward on net neutralitySelfie drones and more fly into CES 2017Faraday Future’s FF91: Electric speed at a vaporous priceEmail Rob at rob@robpegoraro.com; follow him on Twitter at @robpegoraro. ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextGM Stock Could Take Off if It Takes a Hint From Disney+Motley FoolDon't Miss Out on the Netflix of 5G StocksInvestorPlaceWhere Will Netflix Be in 5 Years?Motley FoolNetflix Says New Competition Isn't Material: Is It Right?Motley FoolNetflix might have more Beyoncé specials planned after 'Homecoming'EngadgetZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley Fool1 Big Reason Why Disney Stock Is Just Getting StartedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraph內地熱門城市樓價回升星島日報Illinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatchAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin Rivet3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolBeyoncè's Netflix deal reportedly worth $60 million: VarietyMarketWatchWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceThe Boeing 737 MAX Is 1 Step Closer to Flying Again -- but Don't Expect to See It SoonMotley FoolThis 1 Assumption Could Totally Destroy Your RetirementMotley FoolWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo Finance

The data shows there's still room for improvement, though.23% of U.S. Amazon Prime subscribers said they would definitely cancel their membership if Prime Video wasn't included in their subscription, according to a recent survey from Loop Capital Markets. Seen another way, 23% of members signed up for Prime principally to stream video.Those survey results are in line with leaked data about Amazon originals that indicates they contributed about 5 million new Prime members between 2014 and 2017 -- roughly one-quarter of all new members during that period, according to estimates.With Amazon spending billions on new originals and licensed content every year, it has the potential to attract a lot more Prime members to the service with a few big hits.Amazon Prime Video on a tablet, smartphone, and Fire TV,MoreImage source: Amazon.Amazon is no NetflixNetflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) had nearly 55 million U.S. subscribers as of the end of last year. By comparison, Amazon Prime had some 90 million members in the U.S.Nonetheless, Netflix remains significantly more popular than Prime Video in the United States. eMarketer estimates Netflix draws 50% more viewers than Prime Video. Loop Capital found the most-watched Prime Video original had fewer viewers than the fifth most popular Netflix original.Netflix has some of the best originals on television (streaming or linear), and it's paying quite a bit to make them. The company expects to spend up to $8 billion on content this year on a profit-and-loss basis, and even more in terms of its total cash outlays. Amazon's budget was just $4.5 billion last year, according to estimates.But Amazon could improve viewership by focusing on quality over quantity. More respondents said they'd watch more Prime Video if it had better content than said they want more content.That's what Netflix has been doing. Despite its ballooning budget, it's focused more on producing and licensing high-quality content versus simply licensing more content. CEO Reed Hastings noted, "When you spend on the big items they go much, much further than a whole lot of substitutable content," during the company's first-quarter earnings call in 2016.Can Amazon create more must-have content?Amazon has had a few hits in its first few years of developing content -- The Man in the High Castle and The Grand Tour -- but very few of its series are considered on the same level as Netflix or HBO originals.Amazon is taking steps to change that. It paid $250 million for the rights to produce a Lord of the Rings series. It's also committed to keep investing in video this year (although it's not clear how much of that investment will go to content targeted toward an international audience).Amazon has found Prime members that watch video renew their subscriptions at a higher rate and spend more on average. Additionally, developing a few tentpole series could help Amazon attract a whole new group of subscribers to its $99 per year loyalty program. Ultimately, that ought to provide a boost in sales since Prime members spend more on average than non-members, a pattern that's held true even as Prime membership has grown.To be sure, Amazon's 90 million Prime households represent the upper end of Netflix's 60 million to 90 million long-term goal for U.S. subscribers. But since Prime offers so much more value than Netflix, it has the potential to reach many more customers. While Amazon continues to grow quickly and take share of the online retail market, it still has room to improve.

The Fed chairman added that he doesn’t think a U.S. recession is in the cards this year and that the economy is on “solid” footing.Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 all finished at the highs of the session amid Powell’s comments. Boeing and Caterpillar were the standout Dow performers on the session, rising 2.6% and 2%, respectively.Boeing was boosted by a bullish Morgan Stanley upgrade calling for a 30% pop in the stock. Considering the aerospace giant is fresh off revealing a 20% dividend hike and a new $20 billion buyback program — among having a strong $417 billion worth of commercial plane backlog — the price target hike makes sense.  Highlight: Boeing shares have been upgraded by Morgan Stanley. "Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg was very bullish on the upgrade cycle 4 or 5 months ago," says @briansozzi.https://t.co/ObzMOMFjVy pic.twitter.com/5NKE8cNb9z— Yahoo Finance (@YahooFinance) January 10, 2019 All in all, the market’s overall resilience on Thursday is notable as several prominent retailers reported mixed holiday sales results.Here is what you missed in the world of finance on Thursday.Retail bloodbath.After a blistering start to the holiday shopping season on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, retailers such as Macy’s and Kohl’s hinted strongly Thursday that sales weakened in mid-December and trailed off after Christmas. Sales appear tepid into January, too, despite the stock market’s rebound from the now infamous “Christmas Eve Massacre.”Shares of Macy’s and Kohl’s dropped 17.6% and 4.8%, respectively, on the day.The clear holiday winners were Target and Costco. Target’s holiday sales rose 5.6%, the retailer said on Thursday. Costco said same-store sales gained 6.1%. Costco shares rose slightly on the session. Target’s stock fell 3%.The million dollar question after seeing these results: Has the U.S. consumer pulled back as a result of the stock market’s steep drop in December?Amazon spying zombie Sears and Kmart stores?Yahoo Finance’s Krystal Hu reports that Amazon is looking to open Whole Foods stores in former Sears and Kmart locations. Doing so could get Whole Foods into more rural locations on the cheap.The idea shouldn’t come as a complete shock.

3 growth stocks that could put amazon's returns to shame

And even if you had bought shares of the e-commerce juggernaut a mere five years ago, you still would have seen the value of your investment climb more than 600%.Of course, the reasons for Amazon's astronomical rise are clear in hindsight. But are there any other stocks on the market today that could put Amazon's returns to shame?We asked three top Motley Fool contributors to weigh in to that end. Read on to learn why they like JD.com (NASDAQ: JD), OrganiGram (NASDAQOTH: OGRMF), and Denison Mines (NYSEMKT: DNN).Two line charts indicating stock market gainsMoreIMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Consider this "Amazon of China"Steve Symington (JD.com): Chinese e-commerce leader JD.com, the so-called "Amazon of China," is a $46 billion business as measured by market capitalization, as of this writing. But it's dwarfed by the $942 billion juggernaut Amazon has become.So how can JD.com potentially rival the size -- and, most importantly, the shareholder value-creating ability -- of its American counterpart? While its biggest rival, Alibaba,  serves as more of an online marketplace like eBay, JD.com delivers products purchased through its JD Mall platform directly to Chinese consumers. And JD is forsaking bottom-line profits in favor of investing heavily in its logistics, warehousing, and delivery infrastructure to build a sustainable Amazon-esque advantage in the Middle Kingdom. Better yet, shares of JD have fallen nearly 40% from their 52-week high set in January, most recently pulling back amid economic tensions and trade war concerns between the U.S. and China. JD's long-term story remains firmly intact, however, and I think the stock could easily trounce Amazon's returns for patient investors who buy now.This "budding" small-cap has a real shot to outpace Amazon Sean Williams (OrganiGram Holdings): Trying to top Amazon is a very difficult task, considering just how much cash flow the king of e-commerce can generate. But if any industry has a shot, it's marijuana. The company that I believe could wow investors in the years to come is Atlantic-based grower OrganiGram Holdings.Back in July, I had the pleasure of conducting an email interview with the CEO of OrganiGram Holdings, Greg Engel. And while I was already a fan of what the company was doing, relative to its cannabis peers, I felt even more positive about its future following some of his explanations and answers.In particular, I don't believe there's a marijuana grower that's using its growing capacity more efficiently than OrganiGram. The company has a three-tiered growing system that it estimates will yield 113,000 kilograms of cannabis-equivalent product despite only 490,000 square feet of growing space at its Moncton, New Brunswick, facility. Meanwhile, I can think of other grow sites that have in excess of 1 million square feet of growing capacity and are up to 30,000 kilograms lighter in expected annual yield than OrganiGram.That leads to the next point: location. The company has chosen to expand its capacity entirely at Moncton. Though OrganiGram is sort of forgotten, given its Atlantic-based roots -- most growers are located in British Columbia and Ontario -- its single site helps the company centralize and lower its costs. That should give it a genuine shot at some of the lowest per-gram grow costs in the entire industry.Story continuesInvestors will also appreciate OrganiGram's focus on alternative cannabis products, such as cannabis oil. Though most folks are paying attention to dried cannabis production, its higher-margin oils, which Engel expects will comprise half of all medical marijuana sales, could be crucial in jump-starting the company's operating margins.Even though OrganiGram won't be up to peak production until the second half of 2020, I expect this company to turn heads and surprise a lot of people.High risk, high reward and little downsideReuben Gregg Brewer (Denison Mines): Compared with Amazon, Denison Mines, with its $270 million market cap, is an afterthought of a company. Its main asset, the Wheeler River uranium project, is a mine that isn't even built yet. In fact, it's only just entering the pre-feasibility stage, meaning it's still largely on the drawing board and awaiting more approvals.   But it could be a very big mine when it's ready, ranking in the top five globally. And while uranium prices are low today, that's a good thing for Denison and its investors, since the stock can be bought for around $0.50 a share. That limits the downside to, literally, 50 pennies. And the upside could be huge. That's because today's oversupplied uranium market looks set to flip to being undersupplied in just a few years, as the 57 nuclear power projects under development today get completed. Supporting this outlook are production curtailments at some of the largest uranium miners in the world, in an effort to balance current supply with current demand, Cameco included.     DNN ChartMoreDNN data by YChartsSo Denison could end up with a mine opening right when prices are heading higher. The last time uranium prices were peaking, meanwhile, Denison's stock was up over $12 a share. If the miner's stock price follows that path again, the upside here could be huge. And with no debt on the balance sheet, it seems well positioned to make it through the costly construction process. For more aggressive investors, Denison is a low-cost option on higher uranium prices.The bottom lineIt might seem Amazon has set the bar impossibly high, and nobody can know for sure whether these three stocks will go on to jump over it. But between JD.com's Amazon-esque position in China, OrganiGram's efficiency and focus on alternative cannabis products, and the potential for Denison Mines to benefit as uranium prices rise, we think chances are high that they could do just that.

Read on to learn why they like JD.com (NASDAQ: JD), OrganiGram (NASDAQOTH: OGRMF), and Denison Mines (NYSEMKT: DNN).Two line charts indicating stock market gainsMoreIMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Consider this "Amazon of China"Steve Symington (JD.com): Chinese e-commerce leader JD.com, the so-called "Amazon of China," is a $46 billion business as measured by market capitalization, as of this writing. But it's dwarfed by the $942 billion juggernaut Amazon has become.So how can JD.com potentially rival the size -- and, most importantly, the shareholder value-creating ability -- of its American counterpart? While its biggest rival, Alibaba,  serves as more of an online marketplace like eBay, JD.com delivers products purchased through its JD Mall platform directly to Chinese consumers. And JD is forsaking bottom-line profits in favor of investing heavily in its logistics, warehousing, and delivery infrastructure to build a sustainable Amazon-esque advantage in the Middle Kingdom. Better yet, shares of JD have fallen nearly 40% from their 52-week high set in January, most recently pulling back amid economic tensions and trade war concerns between the U.S. and China. JD's long-term story remains firmly intact, however, and I think the stock could easily trounce Amazon's returns for patient investors who buy now.This "budding" small-cap has a real shot to outpace Amazon Sean Williams (OrganiGram Holdings): Trying to top Amazon is a very difficult task, considering just how much cash flow the king of e-commerce can generate. But if any industry has a shot, it's marijuana. The company that I believe could wow investors in the years to come is Atlantic-based grower OrganiGram Holdings.Back in July, I had the pleasure of conducting an email interview with the CEO of OrganiGram Holdings, Greg Engel. And while I was already a fan of what the company was doing, relative to its cannabis peers, I felt even more positive about its future following some of his explanations and answers.In particular, I don't believe there's a marijuana grower that's using its growing capacity more efficiently than OrganiGram. The company has a three-tiered growing system that it estimates will yield 113,000 kilograms of cannabis-equivalent product despite only 490,000 square feet of growing space at its Moncton, New Brunswick, facility. Meanwhile, I can think of other grow sites that have in excess of 1 million square feet of growing capacity and are up to 30,000 kilograms lighter in expected annual yield than OrganiGram.That leads to the next point: location. The company has chosen to expand its capacity entirely at Moncton. Though OrganiGram is sort of forgotten, given its Atlantic-based roots -- most growers are located in British Columbia and Ontario -- its single site helps the company centralize and lower its costs. That should give it a genuine shot at some of the lowest per-gram grow costs in the entire industry.Story continuesInvestors will also appreciate OrganiGram's focus on alternative cannabis products, such as cannabis oil. Though most folks are paying attention to dried cannabis production, its higher-margin oils, which Engel expects will comprise half of all medical marijuana sales, could be crucial in jump-starting the company's operating margins.Even though OrganiGram won't be up to peak production until the second half of 2020, I expect this company to turn heads and surprise a lot of people.High risk, high reward and little downsideReuben Gregg Brewer (Denison Mines): Compared with Amazon, Denison Mines, with its $270 million market cap, is an afterthought of a company. Its main asset, the Wheeler River uranium project, is a mine that isn't even built yet. In fact, it's only just entering the pre-feasibility stage, meaning it's still largely on the drawing board and awaiting more approvals.   But it could be a very big mine when it's ready, ranking in the top five globally. And while uranium prices are low today, that's a good thing for Denison and its investors, since the stock can be bought for around $0.50 a share. That limits the downside to, literally, 50 pennies. And the upside could be huge. That's because today's oversupplied uranium market looks set to flip to being undersupplied in just a few years, as the 57 nuclear power projects under development today get completed. Supporting this outlook are production curtailments at some of the largest uranium miners in the world, in an effort to balance current supply with current demand, Cameco included.     DNN ChartMoreDNN data by YChartsSo Denison could end up with a mine opening right when prices are heading higher. The last time uranium prices were peaking, meanwhile, Denison's stock was up over $12 a share. If the miner's stock price follows that path again, the upside here could be huge. And with no debt on the balance sheet, it seems well positioned to make it through the costly construction process. For more aggressive investors, Denison is a low-cost option on higher uranium prices.The bottom lineIt might seem Amazon has set the bar impossibly high, and nobody can know for sure whether these three stocks will go on to jump over it. But between JD.com's Amazon-esque position in China, OrganiGram's efficiency and focus on alternative cannabis products, and the potential for Denison Mines to benefit as uranium prices rise, we think chances are high that they could do just that.

3 stocks that could put amazon's returns to shame
3 Stocks That Could Put Amazon's Returns to ShameYahooSearchNo matching results for ''Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsGive feedback on the new search experienceCancelSign inMailFinanceWatchlistsMy PortfolioScreenersMarketsIndustriesVideosNewsPersonal FinanceTechU.S. Markets closedS&P 5002,905.03+4.58(+0.16%)Dow 3026,559.54+110.00(+0.42%)Nasdaq7,998.06+1.98(+0.02%)Russell 20001,565.75-1.85(-0.12%)Crude Oil64.000.00(0.00%)Gold1,277.90+1.90(+0.15%)Silver14.97+0.01(+0.07%)EUR/USD1.12470.0000(-0.0000%)3 Stocks That Could Put Amazon's Returns to ShameAnders Bylund, Chuck Saletta, and Leo Sun, The Motley FoolMotley FoolJanuary 20, 2018ReblogShareTweetShareOnline retailer and cloud-computing pioneer Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) has delivered fabulous returns for long-term shareholders. Investors in the 1997 initial public offering have scored a heart-stopping 75,000% return so far -- including a 380% gain in the last five years alone. This juggernaut is not slowing down.So what would it take to outperform Amazon in today's stock market? We took that question to a handful of your fellow investors here at The Motley Fool, and they were quick to shoot back a few intriguing ideas.Read on to see why they think Chinese e-tailer JD.com (NASDAQ: JD), retail giant Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE: WMT), and fiber-optic components maker NeoPhotonics (NYSE: NPTN) can do better than Amazon for new investors today.A young man, tablet in hand, celebrates good news with a fist pumpMoreThis could be you, checking out your returns on these investments. Image source: Getty Images.Don't overlook this Chinese e-tailerLeo Sun (JD.com): Most investors see Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) as the undisputed king of the Chinese e-commerce market. However, its biggest rival JD.com -- which is often compared to Amazon -- might have more room to run.Alibaba's Tmall controlled 51.3% of the Chinese e-commerce market in the second quarter of 2017, according to Analysys International Enfodesk. JD.com came in second with a 32.9% share. But back in 2014, Tmall controlled 54.6% of the market, while JD.com controlled just 17.7%.JD.com's growth is attributed to two major tailwinds. First, JD.com gained ground as smaller B2C (business to consumer) marketplaces flopped. Second, Chinese consumers retreated from dodgy C2C (consumer to consumer) marketplaces like Alibaba's Taobao and prioritized quality and authenticity over low prices. JD.com capitalized on that shift and touted its reputation as a quality-oriented B2C marketplace that cracks down on counterfeit goods, while publicly chastising Alibaba's quality-control issues.The company also partnered with Wal-Mart, Tencent, flash-sale site Vipshop, and other companies in data-sharing or order-streamlining deals to widen its moat against Alibaba. It also launched a drone delivery service for rural areas last year.JD.com's revenue rose 44% last year, but it posted a net loss. However, it squeezed out profits over the past four quarters, and analysts expect it to post its first annual profit this year as its revenues grow another 39%. Therefore, this stock still looks primed for some big gains over the next few years.Future returns are what matter to investorsChuck Saletta (Wal-Mart): Amazon's past investment returns have been impressive, but what matters to investors is how well their shares will perform in the future. On that front, Amazon's retail archrival Wal-Mart looks like it might be a much stronger investment today than Amazon.The table below shows a handful of key measures for both companies. Wal-Mart wallops Amazon from the perspectives of revenue, earnings, and balance-sheet strength, yet Amazon has more than twice the market capitalization of Wal-Mart. That gap is likely not sustainable, and thus Wal-Mart may actually be positioned for stronger future returns than Amazon.   Company   Market Cap   Trailing Revenue   Trailing Earnings   Debt-to-Equity Ratio       Wal-Mart   $309 billion   $495 billion   $11.4 billion   0.64     Amazon   $623 billion   $161 billion   $1.9 billion   1.75   Data source: Yahoo! Finance.While Amazon's tremendous growth rate justifies something of a premium valuation, it's hard to accept that every dollar of Amazon's revenue should be worth six times Wal-Mart's (twice the market cap for one-third the revenue). That's especially true given that Wal-Mart's profit margin rate and absolute dollars of profit are well ahead of Amazon's. Thus, while bulls on Amazon point to its ability to reinvest cash into growing its business, the reality is that Wal-Mart is also willing to invest in fighting back to growth.Story continuesIndeed, Wal-Mart's recent investments in its e-commerce platform and its buy-online, pick-up-in-store program are generally acknowledged as key drivers of its recent growth. As consumers get used to combining the convenience of online ordering with the speed of in-store pickup at Wal-Mart, Amazon may find itself in the unusual spot of needing to invest merely to catch up.Temporary trouble in big ChinaAnders Bylund (NeoPhotonics): If you want to reach for huge returns, you have to accept a little risk. NeoPhotonics makes optoelectronic components for use in high-speed optical networking equipment, and it's deep in the doldrums right now. The future doesn't even have to be all that great in order to give NeoPhotonics investors a fantastic return on their investment -- a simple return to normal market conditions would be plenty.The company was firing on all cylinders at the end of 2016. Fourth-quarter sales came in 23% above the year-ago period's, clients were clamoring for NeoPhotonics' latest and fastest modules that could handle 100 gigabits of data per second, and share prices reached multiyear highs.Then an important part of NeoPhotonics' distribution network in China filed for bankruptcy, throwing a large spanner into the works. On top of that, sector peers have reported generally slow business in China and North America, as telecoms and their equipment providers hammer out plans for the next wave of infrastructure upgrades.So revenues plunged 35% lower in the next quarterly report, and the company has delivered a string of negative operating profits ever since. Share prices came crashing down, falling as much as 75% below those late-2016 highs before stabilizing.Today, NeoPhotonics has mended its Chinese infrastructure and introduced even faster networking modules. Management expects to a quick return to predictable revenue growth, including positive earnings by the middle of 2018.There's a substantial helping of downside risk here. NeoPhotonics burned $32 million of free cash in the third quarter of 2017. The company raised $30 million of new long-term debt in that quarter, and the cash balance is running low at just $71 million. But if management's rosy forecast works out as expected, that should be enough to see NeoPhotonics through these lean quarters to a fresh stretch of explosive growth.The optical networking industry will remain important and valuable for the long run, notwithstanding the slowness of 2017. Newer, faster, and better networks are coming soon, and all of them will need fiber-optic components to connect everything to the internet at large.Let's just hope that NeoPhotonics sticks around until the big bounce starts -- or gets picked up by a more fortunate rival along the way. Either way, this unprofitable stock offers a tempting risk-reward balance today.

3 Top Stocks to Buy for 2018 and BeyondYahooSearchNo matching results for ''Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsGive feedback on the new search experienceCancelSign inMailFinanceWatchlistsMy PortfolioScreenersMarketsIndustriesVideosNewsPersonal FinanceTechU.S. Markets closedS&P 5002,905.03+4.58(+0.16%)Dow 3026,559.54+110.00(+0.42%)Nasdaq7,998.06+1.98(+0.02%)Russell 20001,565.75-1.85(-0.12%)Crude Oil64.000.00(0.00%)Gold1,277.90+1.90(+0.15%)Silver14.97+0.01(+0.07%)EUR/USD1.12470.0000(-0.0000%)3 Top Stocks to Buy for 2018 and BeyondDaniel Sparks, The Motley FoolMotley FoolDecember 14, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareThe new year represents a great time to invest in stocks. Not only is it when many people are setting New Year's resolutions, but it's also a good reminder of the limited-time investors have to make qualifying IRA contributions. Of course, the challenge for those who are considering investing in stocks as the New Year comes and goes is deciding which stocks to invest in.For patient investors willing to invest for the long haul, a great place to start their search is with established and profitable market leaders. Three good examples of quality companies who have carved out strong leadership positions in their markets are Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN).Here's why these stocks represent compelling long-term investments -- and why you should consider buying them today.A business person drawing a five-star ratingMoreImage source: Getty Images.AppleAs the world's most valuable publicly traded company, some investors might assume there's little upside left for the tech giant. But this couldn't be further from the truth.Not only is Apple still growing, with management guiding for all-time record quarterly revenue in its first quarter of fiscal 2018 of $84 to $87 billion (up 7% to 11% compared to the year-ago period), but earnings per share are rising even more sharply -- a trend that looks poised to continue thanks to the company's hefty free cash flow that enables it to spend billions repurchasing its shares. Apple's earnings per share in the trailing 12 months has risen 11% year over year, and EPS in Apple's most recent quarter jumped 17% year over year.Best of all, investors can buy Apple at a conservative valuation. The stock currently has a price-to-earnings ratio of just under 19. This compares to an average P/E of 25 for stocks in the S&P 500.Walt DisneyUnlike Apple, Disney has struggled to grow revenue and EPS recently.  Revenue and EPS in the trailing 12 months are both down about 1% year over year. However, year-to-year volatility of the company's studio entertainment business is one of the main reasons for this decline -- and a 10,000-foot view of the segment suggests the pullback in segment operating income is only temporary. Last year, Disney benefited from the blockbuster success of the Star Wars franchise, making comparisons in fiscal 2017 difficult. But thanks to Disney's large portfolio of powerful movie franchises and an ever-growing pipeline of new releases, the company has proven time and time again it can set new records.Chris Hemsworth as Thor in Thor: RagnarokMoreStory continuesChris Hemsworth as Thor in Thor: Ragnarok. Image source: Walt Disney.Looking ahead, Disney is positioning itself to better monetize its content while simultaneously removing some of the volatility of its studio business. By launching its own streaming services -- an ESPN service early next year and a Disney-branded service in the second half of 2019 -- Disney can bring its content directly to consumers, offer a better experience, and raise prices over time as it builds out its content libraries.Of course, investors who buy Disney are taking on some risk by betting management can turn around declining operating income at ESPN. Disney CEO Bob Iger suggests this won't be a problem as the company capitalizes on the opportunities provided by an evolving media landscape. But it's possible that headwinds at ESPN prove to be more permanent than management anticipates.Helping account for some of the risk of reinvigorating its ESPN business, Disney also trades conservatively, with price-to-earnings ratio just under 19.Amazon.comAmazon's growth has surprisingly reaccelerated recently, proving the company's aggressive investment strategy is paying off. Revenue in its third quarter climbed 34% year over year, or 29% year over year when excluding sales from Amazon's recently closed acquisition of Whole Foods. Revenue in Amazon's second and first quarter of 2017 and its fourth quarter of 2016 increased 25%, 23%, and 22% year over year, respectively, driving home how nicely growth has reaccelerated. And looking to Amazon's fourth quarter, the company has guided for revenue to rise a wild 28% to 38% year over year.Amazon boxes in Amazon fulfillment centerMoreImage source: Amazon.com.This acceleration in revenue growth comes as Amazon has been investing aggressively in its international expansion, new fulfillment centers, digital content, and its highly profitable Amazon Web Services business. With growth reaccelerating, investors should be encouraged by management's ongoing commitment to making ambitious investments in its growth areas -- something management remains committed to.Investors will have to pay a significant premium to buy into Amazon's growth story. The stock has a price-to-sales ratio of 3.5, compared with an average price-to-sales ratio of 2.8 in the specialty retail industry -- an industry that includes peers like eBay, Best Buy, and Alibaba.Of course, investors who buy Amazon are betting the e-commerce giant can boost its profit margin over time and significantly increase its earnings. This expectation is particularly evidenced by the stock's price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 300. Fortunately, Amazon has already demonstrated its adeptness at multiplying profits over time; its trailing-12-month net income of $1.9 billion dwarfs its net income of $600 million in 2015 and its loss of $241 million in 2014.Durable investmentsMost importantly, all three of these companies possess significant competitive advantages. Apple boasts industry-leading pricing power and profitability thanks to its powerful brand. Disney commands pricing power and customer loyalty by wielding its globally renowned intangible assets and its reputation for quality entertainment. And Amazon's economies of scale in both e-commerce and commercial cloud services is unmatched.Combining their strong competitive advantages with expectations for further growth at all three companies, these are the sort of stocks that have a good shot at beating the market over the long haul.

But the company continues to choose new opportunities. Amazon is willing to try its hand at almost any sort of business, does well at the bulk of them - and threatens to destroy dozens of other companies with its success.The latest foray into unfamiliar territory? The June acquisition of PillPack turns Amazon into a mail-order pharmacy, with a twist. PillPack packs all pills it dispenses into individual bags, each with a unique time and date to be consumed by the customer.That's not Amazon's first venture outside its space. Amazon's also a grocer, a fashion venue, a peddler of handmade crafts and even a video game developer, just to name a few.As a result, Amazon has become at best a headache, at worst a survival threat, for any rival organization in its past. Indeed, in November, we tallied up 32 companies that looked like potential victims of Amazon's never-ending expansion. Today, we're looking at 49 companies Amazon could kill - a few updates of the original list, but also an alarming number of new outfits that have fallen into Amazon's crosshairs - as well as one confirmed kill.SEE ALSO: Millionaires in America: All 50 States RankedAdvance Auto Parts, AutoZone, O'Reilly AutomotiveGetty ImagesThe unchecked growth of Amazon didn't faze auto parts suppliers like O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), AutoZone (AZO) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP) for a long time. Car parts are too heavy, bulky and specialized to be handled like a consumer-centric commodity. And besides, when mechanics (DIYers or the real thing) need a part to use in a repair, they usually want it quickly. The big three names in the auto parts retailing game haven't needed to worry.But times have changed, helped along by inventory-management technology and delivery networks that are willing and able to handle goods they simply couldn't before. That's why Amazon was willing to enter the fray in January 2017.It didn't take long for brick-and-mortar operators to notice. AutoZone shares fell 27% during the first half of 2017, reflecting a first-quarter revenue and earnings miss. O'Reilly hit a similar headwind in Q2 2017 as well, as did Advance Auto Parts.All three stocks have since recovered, as the market realizes Amazon hasn't yet unleashed the same havoc realizing Amazon hasn't unleashed the same kind of havoc on the auto parts retailing industry that it has on other consumer-facing markets. Give it time though. The fact that a little more than half of this trio's business, on average, comes from consumers rather than mechanics, it's a perfect opportunity for Amazon to become a disruptor.SEE ALSO: The Best and Worst Presidents (According to the Stock Market)Albertsons, Kroger, Walmart GroceryStory continuesGetty ImagesAmazon's purchase of Whole Foods Market sent shockwaves through the organic-grocery business, but just as vulnerable (albeit in a different way) are more conventional grocers such as Kroger (KR), privately owned Albertsons and the grocery arm of Walmart (WMT).Yes, Whole Foods and Kroger somewhat overlap, particularly since Kroger has stepped up its organic and whole foods offering. But it's not the brick-and-mortar alternative that should worry Kroger shareholders the most. More concerning is that consumers are increasingly comfortable with the idea of ordering their potato chips, laundry detergent and ground coffee from Amazon.com, just like they order office supplies or books.Recent numbers from industry research outfit One Click Retail tell the story. Since the end of last year, Amazon has sold 18% of all groceries purchased online in the United States, making it the biggest online grocer despite more recognizable names in the business also offering online ordering. The firm estimates the company sold $650 million worth of groceries in the second quarter of this year, up 40% on a year-over-year basis. Beverages, of all things, are likely to be Amazon.com's best-selling grocery category.As time rolls on, more people raised in the internet era are becoming comfortable with the idea of not shopping in an actual grocery store. This shift plays right into Amazon's hand.SEE ALSO: 25 Stocks Every Retiree Should OwnAudiobooks.com, PlaysterGetty ImagesMusic isn't the only audio Amazon.com can digitally deliver. It's also the owner of Audible, which boasts the largest audiobook library in the world. It's a direct threat to (among others) Audiobooks.com and Playster.Don't dismiss this market's importance. Although audio books only generated $2.5 billion worth of revenue in the United States last year, the size of the market is not only growing, it's accelerating. In the first quarter, the industry's revenue was up 32% year-over-year, extending a longstanding hot streak.What was largely missing from the audiobook landscape for a long time was a central name, playing the role Netflix (NFLX) played within the streaming video arena in mainstreaming the audio books.Amazon largely has become that player.Audible controls about 41% of the audio book market, as of the most recent look. And, like Netflix, being the first to become the dominant, defining force in a particular market leaves little room for a second or third player ... which is all Playster and Audiobooks.com are in a position to enjoy from here. But playing second fiddle to Amazon in any business is a problem, especially when Audible can be sold as part of an Amazon Prime package.SEE ALSO: 45 Smart Financial Moves You Can Make in an Hour or LessBarnes & Noble, Joseph-Beth BooksellersGetty ImagesBookstore chain Barnes & Noble (BKS) and Joseph-Beth Booksellers were the first major victims of the rise of Amazon. Remember: Initially, Amazon.com was an online bookstore, and the advent of e-readers - then tablets - made e-books commonplace, further displacing physical bookstores.One end result for B&N is 11 consecutive years of declining sales, and the 12th appears to be underway. Another end result: nine straight years of net store closures.The matter may get worse, too. CEO Demos Parneros was terminated after only 14 months on the job during which he presumably couldn't drive any measurable change. A statement from the company only said Demos had violated corporate policies, and further made a point of saying it wasn't a matter of fraud or misreporting of results.Such a disruption here only exacerbates the underlying problem.Global Data Retail analyst Neil Saunders explains the challenge bluntly and succinctly, saying, "People may drop in for a browse but they won't make a dedicated trip to a bookstore. They don't have the need and they don't have the time. The way people shop changed, and that's been detrimental for Barnes & Noble." Ditto for tiny Joseph-Beth, which has four stores left in the U.S.SEE ALSO: 25 Dividend Stocks That Analysts Love MostBeam, Dailymotion, Hitbox, Mixer, YouTube Gaming and MoreGetty ImagesThere are a number of specific gaming companies that, with the exception of YouTube Gaming, won't ring any bells with investors. But within video gaming circles, Hitbox, Mixer, Dailymotion, Beam and a whole slew of other non-descript names are plenty familiar. All of these organizations have developed platform that let gaming fans pay to watch other people play video games.Yes, it's a real thing. Last year nearly 700 million people watched someone else play a game, though some suggest the figure is actually closer to 1 billion, depending on how it's measured.What does that have to do with Amazon?Amazon.com is the owner and operator of Twitch, which is the world's most popular destination to watch other individuals play video games. Not unlike YouTube, the maker of the video and Amazon split any subscription revenue created by a particular gamer's channel, so that player has an incentive to do well and grow his or her audience.It's possible there's room for more than one player in the game-streaming space. It's unlikely there's room for more than one dominant player. For the same reason Facebook (FB) became the place where the world can gather online, the biggest crowd attracts the best game players, and the best game players attract an increasingly bigger crowd.SEE ALSO: 53 Best Dividend Stocks for 2018 and BeyondBest BuyGetty ImagesThere's no denying that electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY) pulled off a miracle.The deeper Amazon.com waded into the consumer electronics market, the more trouble Best Buy found itself in. By 2012, chatter about Best Buy's impending doom was common. Many presumed the company would follow in Circuit City's footsteps to bankruptcy, as Amazon was simply too competitive.A funny thing happened on the road to oblivion. Turnaround artist Hubert Joly took the helm that year and began working on a turnaround plan to save Best Buy. It worked, at least according to Joly. He flatly said earlier this year, "We have turned around the business, it's about where we go from here. We have not only survived but thrived and I don't believe this is a winner-takes-all market."Last quarter's numbers suggest there's some truth to the matter. Company-wide revenue was up 6.8%, and same-store sales grew 7.1%.Hold off on the victory lap. Best Buy wasn't facing the most difficult of comps last quarter, and it remains to be seen whether there's a growth trajectory in place or if Best Buy is simply lifting the revenue plateau to a slightly higher level. It will take a few more quarters to know for sure. In the meantime, Amazon is undoubtedly going to push back, reminding Best Buy that it's tough to fight a sustained war against a bigger army.SEE ALSO: 15 Consumer Stocks That Deliver Dividend Growth Like ClockworkBlender, Godot, HeroEngine, Unity and MoreGetty ImagesMajor video game publishing outfits such as Activision-Blizzard (ATVI) and Electronic Arts (EA) will be forced to face off with Amazon at some point in the future. Both those companies are big enough and well-grounded enough to hold their own, however.The same can't be said for all the smaller, "indie" game developers and game-engine providers such as HeroEngine, Unity, Blender, Godot and more, which eventually could feel the pressure from Amazon.Confused? You're not alone. Though most investors - and even most gamers - don't know it, Amazon has a hand in the video game development arena. It owns a game engine called Lumberyard, allowing developers and designers free access to this solid technology licensed from a company called Crytek. Games such as Crucible and Star Citizen are some of the early AAA games the Amazon platform has produced.You've heard little about this because the whole effort still is in its infancy. It's possible not even Amazon really knows where it's going. So it's not entirely clear who should be worried about Amazon's potential push.Given Amazon's sheer size and strength, though, any of the smaller players in the highly fragmented game development industry should fear what Amazon may try to do once it feels Lumberyard is ready to promote in a big way.SEE ALSO: RBC Capital's 10 Best Tech Stocks to Buy for 2025Blue Apron, Hello Fresh, PlatedGetty ImagesNo one disputes Amazon.com has mastered the art of delivering anything and everything that isn't perishable, but what about pre-packaged meals? Yep, the e-commerce company can do that too. It got into the business in the middle of last year, and it has since stepped up its game. Its entry into the race is a direct threat to the likes of rival meal kit outfits Blue Apron (APRN), Hello Fresh and Plated.The marketability and viability of the so-called "pure plays" in the business were never all that strong. They're all subject to the changing - usually rising - price of food, and it takes massive scale to make meal kits cost-effective enough to turn into a sustainable business. Blue Apron, for instance, is one of the biggest names in the business yet still is nowhere near profitability.Another unsavory reality of the meal kit biz: Roughly three-fourths of Blue Apron's and HelloFresh's customers stop buying them (on a regular basis anyway) within about six months. The idea is creative, but not necessarily one with longevity.To the extent there is a viable meal kit market, though, Amazon.com has an edge. Two edges, actually. One of them is the fact that Amazon regularly serves more than 300 million customers, enough of whom will test drive a meal kit. The other edge is that Amazon doesn't have to turn a profit selling pre-packaged meals. It can extract a profit from those customers by selling them other products and services.SEE ALSO: Why Blue Apron Was a Bust in My MarriageDuracell, Energizer HoldingsGetty ImagesEnergizer Holdings (ENR), which of course is the name behind Energizer batteries, clearly is one of the most recognizable names in the business, as is Duracell, which is held by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B).Batteries currently sold under Amazon's "Basics" label don't exactly inspire deep brand loyalty.Don't dismiss the potential of Amazon's entry into the seemingly boring business. In the United States alone, the battery business (including the automotive component of the market) is worth roughly $17 billion per year, and Amazon already outsells all other battery brands in the U.S. As of last year, Amazon.com sold a little more than 30% of all consumer-electronics-sized batteries for use in the United States, versus Energizer's market share of around 12%. Duracell is holding up a little better, sporting roughly 21% of last year's non-rechargeable battery business in the U.S.It's unlikely either brand will ever be wiped out completely. But Amazon doesn't even really promote its Basics battery other than as an add-on purchase at its website, and yet it already has proven disruptive to the two biggest brands in the business.SEE ALSO: The 25 Best Low-Fee Mutual Funds You Can BuyEducents, Teachers Pay TeachersGetty ImagesTeachers Pay Teachers is an unconventional, though brilliant, business idea. Rather than proverbially re-create the wheel, teachers can create structured classroom handouts and materials, then sell them to other (often overworked) teachers who may not have the time to do so for themselves.It's not exactly clear how big the market is. Owler provides an estimate of $5.8 million in annual revenues for Teachers pay Teachers, but the ecosystem of the money its 80,000 contributors earn is much larger. Last year, they collectively banked more than $100 million. For perspective, the textbook market in the United States alone is worth roughly $11 billion per year.Amazon's increasingly disruptive role in the middle of that melee is its relatively new Amazon Inspire site, which is "an open collaboration service that helps teachers to easily discover, gather, and share quality educational content with their community."The problem for Teachers Pay Teachers, Educents and all their peers? Amazon Inspire is free to use.That may or may not always be the case, but as long as it's free, it's a threat to for-profit sites in the same arena. Conversely, should Amazon eventually opt to make it a profit center, it's apt to turn up the heat on promoting Amazon Inspire. That could prove highly disruptive to the other venues that have commercialized DIY classroom materials.EtsyGetty ImagesEtsy (ETSY) was, and is, a brilliant idea.Some things are just not meant to be made or sold in bulk. Handmade one-of-a-kinds still have a place in consumers' hearts, but makers of these goods are facing an increasingly tough time in just being able to show their wares to an increasingly distracted market. By bringing a huge number of artisans under one roof and then promoting the entire collection, Etsy has successfully melded an old-school idea with the new.But Amazon noticed, and responded. In 2015, the e-commerce giant launched Amazon Handmade, taking a stab at Etsy.Amazon's disruption of Etsy has been hit and miss. Etsy's revenue grew 30% year-over-year last quarter, and the company upped its full-year revenue guidance, too. Clearly Etsy is doing something right under the relatively new leadership of former eBay (EBAY) executive Josh Silverman.Still, Amazon may slowly but surely taking a toll - or at least forcing Etsy to take a toll on itself. In July, Etsy upped the transaction fee it charges merchants from 3.5% to 5.0%, inciting enough grumbling among some of its sellers that it's a legitimate fear many of them will look elsewhere ... such as Amazon. Amazon Handmade charges considerably more, but also boasts considerably more marketing firepower.Amazon appears to be playing the proverbial long game, planning to win the war by attrition.SEE ALSO: 20 Small Towns With Big Millionaire PopulationsFedEx, United Parcel ServiceGetty ImagesRide-hailing services Uber and Lyft were long thought to be potential victims of Amazon. Whispers that Lyft was aiming at parcel delivery were circulating, and Uber was waist-deep into the package-shipping business. Amazon was using contractors to deliver packages as well, though, and the foray into people transportation would have been an easy one.Amazon's focus is elsewhere, however. Rather than expands its network of delivery drivers, earlier this year it doubled down on building its own delivery chain using contractors. Called Amazon Delivery Service Partners, the company is encouraging individuals with an entrepreneurial spirit to build their own business by delivering Amazon-ordered parcels. Such a venture takes aim at the likes of United Parcel Service (UPS) and FedEx (FDX).The Amazon Delivery Service Partners venture isn't a direct, immediate threat to the existence of FedEx and UPS. Indeed, some of these deliveries may well be ones that those bigger logistics outfits don't want to do.Amazon isn't a company that thinks small, however. With a fleet of 32 delivery jets in operation and a growing fleet of trucks on the road, the next natural step is bridging the two and completely cutting out middlemen like FedEx and United Parcel Service from many of its delivery chains.GameStopGetty ImagesGameStop (GME) historically has made its money by serving as the middleman, but the game publishing industry's move toward downloads and away from discs and cartridges is increasingly making the venue less of a destination for gamers.Jefferies analyst Stephanie Wissink explained the problem in July, noting "We've observed meaningful valuation expansion across retailers where margin rates base, pricing power returns (inventory & markdown clean-up), and sector participation/consumption is healthy." Wissink added, however, that "GME has not participated in this reversal ... due in part to leadership turnover, lack of an articulated vision & direction, and overriding fears around software profit dependence."Don't misunderstand. GameStop also sells game downloads via its own website. Amazon does too. Neither venue is completely out of the loop when it comes to this paradigm shift underway within the gaming business.But Amazon.com induced 2.8 billion unique visits just over the course of the first half of the year. It simply draws a bigger crowd, and the gamers among them know they can buy downloads via the site. GameStop's website simply doesn't attract nearly as many people.The premise is evident in the numbers. Revenue has been drifting lower since 2011, and more often than not since 2012, the organization has reported slight declines in per-share profits. Its first quarter revenue was off to the tune of 5.5%, cutting profits roughly in half year-over-year.SEE ALSO: 10 Roughed-Up Stocks to Buy for a Recovery RallyHachette Books, Penguin Random HouseGetty ImagesInitially, the rise of Amazon.com was not only not a threat to book publishers; it was a benefit, making it easy for consumers to purchase a book rather than require a visit to an actual bookstore.Technology never stops marching forward, though. The development of e-books and e-readers has quelled the need for printing and shipping while simultaneously positioning Amazon.com as an e-book hub. For the crowd that still prefers the feel of paper and the look of a volume on a bookshelf, Amazon's Create Space can arrange for a book to be printed on-demand - even just one at a time.With that option on the table, traditional book publishers like Penguin Random House and Hachette Books are struggling to justify their new role as a middleman that doesn't bring any real value to the table. Amazon can do the marketing job too, or at least offer a platform that will allow an author to promote a book as effectively as a publishing house often does.The paradigm shift toward self-publishing continues to get traction too, democratizing the space in a way that accelerates that shift. Jeff Bezos noted in his most recent letter to shareholders that that more than 1,000 independent authors earned more than $100,000 using Kindle Direct Publishing last year. For 2017, Amazon paid out more than $200 million to its authors.The numbers prompt one key question: Who needs an old-school publisher?InterActiveCorp, YelpGetty ImagesMost consumers have heard of online business directory and review repository Yelp (YELP). Ditto for Angie's List, which was owned by InterActiveCorp (IAC) but later spun off into ANGI Homeservices (ANGI). What most consumers don't yet realize, however, is that Amazon is quietly encroaching into that market.It's called Amazon Home Services, and it looks a lot like Angie's List. Homeowners looking for anything ranging from tech support to housecleaning services to yardwork can browse Amazon's curated list of service providers and read reviews regarding their previous work. Angie's List and Yelp offer similar information. And while Yelp also serves up information about a variety of other consumer-facing businesses such as restaurants or retail stores, there's no denying that Amazon Home Services is a viable alternative source of information on many fronts.Given that Amazon already connects consumers with restaurants near them, adding reviews to the mix wouldn't be a major technical hurdle.Nothing is wrong with Yelp yet, at least not given its most recent quarterly earnings report. Sales were up 12% year-over-year, and per-share profits grew from 9 cents to 12 cents. But the company hasn't yet faced Amazon in a full-on fight.SEE ALSO: The 10 Best Tech Stocks of All TimeJo-Ann FabricsGetty ImagesEven something as mundane and common, yet garment-specific, as fabric could be upended by Amazon.At first glance, it doesn't appear Amazon has given its fabric and material business any particular special attention. Many of the sewing and craft supplies the website offers are featured on the same basic page used to sell all sorts of other goods, and the featured seller, Fabric.com, appears to be the beneficiary of the usual handoff Amazon makes when a customer needs something that can't be sold en masse.But take a closer look at the website that Amazon.com redirects you to when you click on the sizeable at the top of the "Fabrics" page. You're buying fabric by the yard from Fabric.com, but Fabric.com is wholly owned by Amazon.It's a very un-Amazon-like business, though the company knows something most consumers and investors don't: The fabric and sewing supply retailing market is worth about $4 billion per year, and globally, the textile market is expected to be worth more than $1 trillion by 2025.That's more Amazon-like! Amazon's edge in the arena is that it has the much-needed scale that most textile outlets and retailers don't. That's a problem for Jo-Ann Fabrics.Lululemon Athletica, Under ArmourGetty ImagesIf you own any activewear sporting the Goodsport, Rebel Canyon or Peak Velocity labels, you're actually wearing one of Amazon's homegrown house brands. The company got into the business for itself late last year.The foray was a modest one - more of an experiment than something meant to make a splash. It largely was meant to fill gaps left unfilled by the athletic apparel names that weren't offering the entire breadth of their lineup at Amazon.com. Most everything Amazon does, though, starts small and eventually gets big enough to become disruptive.It's a shot at names such as Lululemon Athletica (LULU) and Under Armour (UAA), which are well-recognized brands but fiscally struggling companies. Under Armour has been saddled by debt, while Lululemon is finding that an increasingly competitive environment isn't driving profits any higher despite rising revenue.Nike (NKE) is vulnerable too, but being the biggest and most respected name in the business, it could just as easily benefit from the fact that Amazon has put other activewear manufacturers on the defensive.It certainly wouldn't be a significant stretch to wreak some significant havoc in the semi-specialized apparel arena. Morgan Stanley noted earlier this year that Amazon.com already generates more U.S. apparel revenue than any other retailer, garnering 8.6% of the market for itself in 2017. And last year, online apparel sales grew 7% to make up more than 20% of the market, while in-store purchases fell 3%. Amazon is well-positioned to leverage its own athletic apparel into the equation.SEE ALSO: 5 Companies That Are Defying AmazonOffice Depot, StaplesGetty ImagesReminder: Office Depot (ODP) and OfficeMax are now one and the same company, having merged back in 2013 as a means of defending itself from the slow disintegration of the office supply business.Amazon.com - and Amazon Business in particular - put that disintegration into motion.It still wasn't enough. That's why Office Depot and privately held Staples sought a merger of their own a couple of years later, explaining that unless the two retailers worked as one, neither would survive. The Department of Justice didn't buy into the argument, however; it feared that whittling down the number of large brick-and-mortar office supply outfits would harm consumers.Little has changed since then. Office Depot managed to top its second-quarter earnings estimates, catapulting ODP shares higher, but a closer look at the Q2 report reveals that not all of the tepid growth was even organic. It was driven by acquisitions and new initiatives. Perhaps worse, the lackluster year-over-year results appear to be the new normal.Staples doesn't have to disclose its quarterly results, but it's difficult to see how it could be faring much better than ODP. Neither can compete with Amazon's prices, and low prices are everything to business customers.Pandora, SpotifyGetty ImagesWhen consumers mull their digital music options, Amazon Prime generally isn't a name that comes to mind. The race for online-radio mindshare has largely been won by the likes of Spotify or Pandora (P) ... or increasingly, Apple (AAPL), which was recently cultivated its own subscription-based service to complement the a la carte nature of its iTunes store.However, a wide swath of consumers are grooving to Amazon's beat. As of Q1, Amazon Music boasted 12.7 million regular/monthly users. That pales in comparison to the "Big Three" of Apple, Pandora and Spotify. But considering how little effort Amazon.com puts into music, that user base could ramp up quickly if Amazon turns up the heat.Amazon's exposure to the digital music market may actually be much bigger than it seems on the surface, too. That's because you also could include the number of Amazon Prime subscribers that take advantage of the Prime Music offer available to Prime members. There's no firm figure on how many people listen to some sort of online audio via Amazon, but the company said the number is in the "tens of millions."One small tweak in its music platform, then, could make Amazon alarmingly disruptive.SEE ALSO: 10 Apple Products That Changed Everything (And 10 That Didn't)Rite AidGetty ImagesRite Aid (RAD) actually earned a spot on Amazon's list of likely victims a few months ago - back when rumors were merely swirling that the e-commerce outfit was toying with the idea becoming a drug dispenser. Little had come of the possibility at the time, but obviously much has changed.Aside from the threat that Amazon's acquisition of PillPack poses to the Rite Aid, the remaining piece of Rite Aid that wasn't sold to Walgreens (WBA) still needs help in reinvigorating sales and profitability. A partner/buyer appears to be a means to that end, but finding a suitable, willing suitor is proving tough to do. The latest would-be partner was grocery chain Albertson's, though such a pairing may not exactly have been of any benefit to investors. Proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services penned a report on the matter just a few weeks ago. It wrote, "The merger combines two low-margin, over leveraged companies, both of which are facing heightened competitive environments."Shareholders agreed, prompting management to kill the deal and leaving Rite Aid in need of a lifeline that doesn't appear to be on the horizon.Amazon is largely responsible for the "heightened competitive environments" both parties are facing. Amazon not only owns PillPack and Whole Foods Market, but it's also selling all sorts of consumable dry goods via its online platform.SearsGetty ImagesIn all fairness, Amazon has been making things tough for all brick and mortar retailers. Sears (SHLD) is the wounded and sickest member of the herd, though, and therefore the prey most vulnerable to Amazon.com.Revenue has been shrinking since 2006, and the company hasn't turned a full-year profit since 2011. In retrospect, hedge-fund-manager-turned-CEO Eddie Lampert should have fixed as many of its poorly performing stores as he could rather than simply shed them in an effort to raise much-needed cash. Or, maybe Sears (and Kmart) were and still are simply unfixable.The irony? Sears has actually partnered with Amazon on multiple occasions in an effort to drive sales. In October of last year, Kenmore - a Sears-owned brand of home appliances - unveiled a new line of smart refrigerators that work with Amazon's artificial intelligence assistant Alexa. In July of last year, Sears listed a slew of Kenmore branded goods at the Amazon.com website. In May of this year, Amazon began selling tires to consumers that ultimately would be installed at a Sears Tire Center.The struggling retailer may only be feeding the beast that will eventually eat it, however. Amazon also is selling tires that Monro will install, and Amazon.com sells Maytag and Frigidaire home appliances too, even if those other brands aren't featured as prominently.Sears, and Kmart, are just too deep into the Amazon quicksand now to fight their way out.SEE ALSO: 12 Retailers That May Soon Disappear ForeverSprouts Farmers Market, The Fresh Market and Trader Joe'sGetty ImagesIt's not exactly a secret that people across the U.S., and around the world for that matter, are increasingly concerned about what they're eating. Chemicals and pesticides are completely out of fashion, as is genetically modified produce. En vogue are organic goods, and where at all possible, locally sourced foods.It's a trend that initially sprang life for outfits like Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) and Trader Joe's, which historically have been the go-to options for health-conscious consumers. Now that rival grocer Whole Foods Market is an Amazon holding, it can benefit from Amazon's strong marketing reach.That's not the only edge Amazon has on its organic-grocery rivals, however.Unlike Trader Joe's and Sprouts, Amazon isn't all that concerned about turning a profit in the grocery biz. Indeed, the company is almost annoyingly coy about how its grocery business is doing, offering no meaningful details of its performance. Being in the business is simply another means of connecting with consumers, pulling them further into the Amazon ecosystem, where they can be monetized in other ways.More than that, though, Amazon's ambition of dominance-at-all-costs has allowed it to become the low-price leader in the whole foods and organic grocery market. Unable to compete with the giant, The Fresh Market announced in July it was closing a total of 15 stores.TargetGetty ImagesAmazon.com has proven problematic for the likes of Walmart (WMT) and Costco (COST), and more recently, vice versa. All three companies are big enough and different enough from one another that they'll be able to at least defend their turf.Target (TGT) is in a tougher situation, however. It has neither the size of Walmart, the pricing power of Costco nor the sheer online presence of Amazon.com. It's trapped somewhere in the middle, which within the world of modern retailing is the last place any organization wants to be.You can see this idea at work in the company's most recent earnings report. Although fiscal Q1's same-store sales grew nicely, investments in Target's online presence and customer-attraction efforts - such as deliveries and price-cutting - crimped margins from 7.1% a year earlier to 6.2% this time around. Morningstar's analysts foresee more of the same heavy spending ahead, and Target isn't in a position to outspend its competition.There is one plausible, albeit low-percentage, ray of hope on the horizon. More than once, Amazon has been rumored to be interested in acquiring Target. Such a maneuver would instantly give the organization a retail footprint that could prove more problematic for Walmart than Target is on its own. But simply hoping for a buyout is never a good enough reason to buy or stick with a stock.SEE ALSO: The 15 Best ETFs for a Prosperous 2018W. W. GraingerGetty ImagesSupply outfit W. W. Grainger (GWW) has held up better than many investors presumed it would when Amazon announced it was tiptoeing onto its turf last year with a platform called Amazon Business. Indeed, GWW shares are up more than 120% from their August 2017 lows, largely driven by slow and steady revenue and earnings growth that analysts didn't think Grainger would achieve.How did GWW manage it, and against a bigger foe that cares little about profits? Macquarie analyst Hamzah Mazari explained earlier this year, "Close to $2.5 billion of their revenue, out of their total $10 billion, was uncompetitively priced, so they cut their price to be more in line with the market ... in the fourth quarter they showed volumes were up double digits."It has worked so far. But Grainger isn't well-equipped to fight a price war, and CEO D.G. Macpherson has already hinted that gross margins around 38% would be the new norm. That compares unfavorably to gross margins of 44% achieved in 2013. And Grainger will only hit that 38% number if Amazon does something very un-Amazon-like and doesn't start a price war within this business sliver.Toys R UsGetty ImagesLast but not least, a eulogy for Toys R Us.After a poor showing for 2017's busy holiday shopping season, the privately held toy company finally decided to call it quits in March 2018. It didn't even bother seeking a buyer that might be looking for a cheap way to scoop up a recognized name, or garner some cheap retailing square footage.Not every observer entirely blames Amazon.com for the demise of Toys R Us. In many regards (and like so many other brick-and-mortar retailers), Toys R Us became sloppy on its own - operationally and fiscally - and never fully realized it until it was too late. Greg Portell, lead partner at retail consultant A.T. Kearney, commented in June, "If you're going to have that breadth of inventory, you need someone in the store to help you find it, help you experience it. It's hard to sell toys in a cold, warehouse environment."If not Amazon, another player would have continued to chip away at the once-iconic toy store chain.Still, the fact that Amazon.com is rumored to be preparing the printing of a traditional holiday toy catalog this year sends a clear message. That message: Amazon isn't stopping now. With the biggest pure-play threat out of the way, it's going to be even easier for the company to go after other toy sellers such as Target and Walmart.SEE ALSO: Best Online Brokers, 2018EDITOR'S PICKSMillionaires in America: All 50 States Ranked53 Best Dividend Stocks for 2018 and BeyondBest Online Brokers, 2018Copyright 2018 The Kiplinger Washington EditorsReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read Next2 Stocks You Can Buy and Hold ForeverMotley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopedia2 Top Stocks You Can Buy on SaleMotley FoolWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolWalmart Wants to Take On Amazon in Digital AdvertisingMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolCould CarGurus Be the Next Top Auto Stock?Motley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceFiat Chrysler Recalls 320,000 VehiclesFortuneAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolKey Financial Ratios to Analyze the Auto IndustryInvestopediaWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCThe Boeing 737 MAX Is 1 Step Closer to Flying Again -- but Don't Expect to See It SoonMotley FoolTech, green features, power mix to boost luxury car salesAFP

However, as we move through a period of uncertainty and change where tariffs and trade wars could affect some of these very same companies, investors need any edge they can get to make money in the years ahead.Technology may be that edge. It's already playing a large role in the success and failure of many of this country's biggest consumer stocks, and tech looks to be an even greater determinant of who wins and loses five to 10 years from now.RBC Capital Markets recently took out its futurist cap, producing a study entitled "Imagine 2025," which highlights the six themes it feels will drive business growth over the next seven years - and the stocks that will benefit as a result.The themes mostly revolve around technology, but RBC also has addressed non-tech issues such as climate change, population growth, urbanization and others to develop a list of 69 companies it feels will lead the way through 2025.The following are five of the best consumer stocks to buy right now. What makes them stand out from the rest is that each utilizes one or more of RBC's "Imagine 2025" themes to deliver better-than-average shareholder returns.SEE ALSO: 20 Dividend Stocks to Fund 20 Years of RetirementStitch FixCourtesy Daniel G. Wells III via Wikimedia CommonsMarket value: $3.3 billionIf there's a consumer stock that has used artificial intelligence more appropriately than Stitch Fix (SFIX, $33.75), I'd love to know about it.Stitch Fix provides a subscription service for adults that customizes monthly delivery of clothing, meeting subscribers' styles and tastes as identified both in an initial questionnaire and through ongoing feedback from customers. And the longer a customer belongs to the service, the better Stitch Fix gets at delivering the right goods, thanks to its AI."In our over 15 years of covering consumer stocks, a common thread among our strongest companies is the ability to inspire and create desire," KeyBanc analyst Edward Yruma wrote in a recent note to clients. "In many regards, Stitch Fix serves as the modern archetype of the heyday department store -- helping consumers understand what is new and interesting, offering a wide selection, and offering a very personalized edit."A recent headline to pay attention to: In July, Stitch Fix launched a service for kids that will include eight to 12 items per delivery at $10 to $15 for any article of clothing the subscriber opts to keep. Shares jumped 9% on that particular bit of news - a warm reception.SEE ALSO: 7 Top Tech Stocks That Could Catch Fire SoonAmazonStory continuesGetty ImagesMarket value: $937.9 billionAmazon.com's (AMZN, $1,919.65) overarching goal of securing as much of our disposable income as possible now and in the future means the company's fingerprints are all over the six themes that RBC feels will drive business growth.Thanks to Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud business, continues to provide Amazon with the profits to reinvest in e-commerce - the less profitable side of Bezos' empire, but the one that ultimately should get it to a trillion dollars in market cap, and possibly even a second trillion dollars down the road.Leading the charge will be Amazon Prime, its monthly or annual membership that gives Amazon customers free two-day delivery, Prime video streaming, etc. In May, the company raised the annual fee from $99 to $119 in the U.S."The Prime membership price increase is a solid margin tailwind," wrote MKM Partners analyst Rob Sanderson. "Prime is thought to be at around 55 million households in the U.S., (which will result in) about $1 billion of incremental profit contribution (annual basis) beginning Q3."The combination of AWS and Prime is an unbeatable one.SEE ALSO: 10 Top Nasdaq Stocks to Buy NowAppleGetty ImagesMarket value: $1.0 trillionApple (AAPL, $209.75) sells a lot of iPhones -- estimates suggest it sold 42.1 million of them in the June quarter alone. But Apple's Services division, which includes the App Store and iTunes, is enjoying double-digit revenue growth each quarter, providing a strong one-two punch."Apple Services in total represent about 15 percent of total company sales and is the second largest contributor to margin dollars," Citigroup analyst Jim Suva wrote in early July. "We note Apple's internal goal to double Service revenues from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2020 seems reasonable."Apple's revenue diversification is impressive. Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Wamsi Mohan sees augmented reality contributing as much as $8 billion annually to Apple's top line."We think AR apps will command a price premium," Mohan wrote in a July 10 note to clients. "We reiterate our Buy on strong capital returns, continued strong growth in Services revenues and AR providing yet another competitive advantage."Among consumer stocks, Apple and Amazon bring some of the most impressive weapons caches to the table.SEE ALSO: 10 Apple Products That Changed Everything (And 10 That Didn't)LululemonCourtesy Elvert Barnes via FlickrMarket value: $17.1 billionAthleisure mainstay Lululemon (LULU, $129.47) announced Calvin McDonald as its CEO in late July. By the time Sephora's North America leader takes over the top role Aug. 20, the top job will have been empty for six months.Chairman Glenn Murphy, formerly CEO of Gap (GPS), had to make sure the man or woman hired would be able to fix the toxic corporate culture former CEO Laurent Potdevin encouraged in the four years he was in charge. Analysts generally are happy with McDonald's hiring."On the qualitative front - today's high caliber hire at the helm accelerates the turning of the tide at LULU in our view with the management bench moving from a point of investor contention to among the Best-In-Class," wrote JPMorgan analyst Matt Ross July 23 in a client note. "A CEO from Sephora/LVMH, CFO from VF Corp, COO from J Crew, Sun Choe at CMO (hired 11/2016), three seasoned regional heads in place (Americas, Europe, Asia), and Chairman of the Board Glenn Murphy remaining a key advisor to the team."Corporate quality flows from the top. Given that, you ought to be very excited about the future if you're a LULU shareholder.SEE ALSO: The Best and Worst Presidents (According to the Stock Market)Macy'sGetty ImagesMarket value: $12.8 billionJeff Gennette's success in the top job at Macy's (M, $41.82) comes from the fact he's not a bean counter, but rather a merchant.As technology has crept into the retail shopping experience, retailers straddle a fine line between using tech to help customers find what they want more quickly and turning off the customer by over-automating the process. Give people what they want in an attractive shopping environment, and they'll come back."He has a feel, he has an eye, he's a merchant. The stores have a better look and feel," Jim Cramer said on Squawk on the Street in May. "It's not in the numbers. It's about good-looking merchandise."Also, don't forget consumer spending is growing amid a still-flourishing economy."Historically, this is a very cyclical business and investors looking to benefit from the improving consumer spending environment, and the strong fashion cycle, should consider Macy's more closely," Susquehanna analyst Bill Dreher wrote in a May note to clients.Macy's, left for dead after years of stock losses, is suddenly a consumer momentum play, up nearly 60% in 2018.

The apps, or “skills” in Amazon’s parlance, could do everything from tell knock-knock jokes to offer the latest price of Bitcoin.On Thursday, Amazon finally opened up the world of Alexa skills to ordinary customers, albeit in a limited manner. Now anyone with an Echo speaker or Spot clock can teach Alexa some new tricks using Amazon’s “blueprints,” or prewritten types of apps that can have customized content supplied by customers–no computer coding necessary. Many are oriented towards kids. Here are a few examples of how you can use the blueprints to create (mostly) useful skills for your Alexa-enabled devices.Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.1. Help study with vocal “flashcards”Have kids studying for a biology quiz? Or maybe you’re getting ready to take the bar exam. The flashcards blueprint lets you create a list of questions and answers (and hints, if you want). Then Alexa can offer the quiz, either in “review mode,” revealing both questions and answers, or in “test mode,” asking the questions and confirming whether the answers are correct. Alexa even has encouraging messages to throw in, like, “Great job studying hard. You’re going to ace this test,” which can also be customized.2. Leave important information for the babysitterYou can certainly go the old-fashioned route, leaving a written list of important items and emergency contacts for the babysitter. But why not impress your millennial childminder with an Alexa-enabled babysitter helper app. The babysitter blueprint has places to add items like a child’s schedule, allergies, emergency contacts, and answers to basic questions like, “where are the diapers?” There’s also a blueprint for the petsitter.3. Cheer up family members with the compliments skillPretty straightforward: Fill in the blueprint with a list of compliments. Amazon offers a few canned phrases, such as, “You light up the room,” but you can do better. Then name the skill, which will trigger Alexa to offer one of the compliments. Not so into complimenting your little brother? There’s a similar blueprint to write a burns skill.4. Play a game of modern MadLibs with the story skillThe blueprints include a variety of genre stories, like a fairy tale about a magical princess or the story of an alien invasion, that require listeners to offer names and other bits (such as a favorite dessert) that Alexa incorporates. But the entire text of the stories can be customized, tweaked, or wholesale rewritten.5. Test party guests with a trivia quiz about the birthday boy or girlAnother one for the kids, the blueprints include a quiz skill to work at a birthday party by asking trivia questions about the guest of honor. In addition to reading the questions, the skill lets the birthday celebrant rate the answers and offer sound effects (crowd cheers, annoying buzzers and the like) based on the rating.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolWalmart Wants to Take On Amazon in Digital AdvertisingMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceNatural Gas Price Prediction – Prices Tumble as Supplies IncreaseFX EmpireWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolShould We Be Delighted With CVR Energy, Inc.'s (NYSE:CVI) ROE Of 22%?Simply Wall St.'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceCrude Oil Weekly Price Forecast – Crude oil running into resistanceFX EmpireAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCThe Boeing 737 MAX Is 1 Step Closer to Flying Again -- but Don't Expect to See It SoonMotley FoolRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

From Amazon's first annual report as a public company in 1998 to the letter he wrote in advance of the company's May 17 annual meeting this year, he's set a consistent tone: Build culture, take risk and focus on the long term.Chamath Palihapitiya, a venture capitalist and early Facebook employee, said at the Sohn Investment conference that  Amazon is on its way to becoming a $3 trillion company  in a decade.If true, it would be in large measure due to the business philosophy of Bezos. The "Amazon Way," as it has become known, has attracted some controversy, but it can be relevant to businesses of all sizes.In honor of his birthday today, here are five lessons to take away from his success. 1. Obsess over customers, not competitorsBezos makes the point that tech companies especially obsess over competitors: They wait and see what rivals introduce, then try to match and one-up it. By listening to customers instead, Amazon built its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business, which was designed to solve the problems with too-expensive in-house application hosting and open-source products that weren't robust enough to easily support fast-growing or already-large companies. AWS is now an over $10 billion business."Many companies describe themselves as customer-focused, but few walk the walk. Most big technology companies are competitor focused. They see what others are doing, and then work to fast follow," he wrote in a 2015-dated letter.The moral: To get ahead of the market, you have to think for yourself.2. Take risks for market leadershipIt took Amazon three tries to get its business as a selling and fulfillment platform off the ground. First it tried Amazon Auctions, a more-or-less direct aping of the model that put eBay on the map. That morphed into zShops, and finally into Amazon Marketplace, which accounts for nearly half the units sold on Amazon.com."Given a 10 percent chance of a 100-times payout, you should take that bet every time," Bezos wrote in his very first annual letter (1997). "Failure and invention are inseparable twins. To invent you have to experiment, and if you know in advance that it's going to work, it's not an experiment." Moral: Make bold, rather than timid, investment decisions. Even if they don't work out, you'll learn something for the next time. 3. Make employees think like ownersWhen Bezos wrote this in the first Amazon annual letter, Bezos had 614 employees, up from 158 a year earlier. It has 230,000 now and plans to hire 100,000 full-time employees over the next 18 months.One key component of the approach has been to use stock options in hiring.

From Amazon's first annual report as a public company in 1998 to the letter he wrote in advance of the company's May 17 annual meeting this year, he's set a consistent tone: Build culture, take risk and focus on the long term.Chamath Palihapitiya, a venture capitalist and early Facebook employee, said at the Sohn Investment conference that  Amazon is on its way to becoming a $3 trillion company  in a decade.If true, it would be in large measure due to the business philosophy of Bezos. The "Amazon Way," as it has become known, has attracted some controversy, but it can be relevant to businesses of all sizes.In honor of his birthday today, here are five lessons to take away from his success. 1. Obsess over customers, not competitorsBezos makes the point that tech companies especially obsess over competitors: They wait and see what rivals introduce, then try to match and one-up it. By listening to customers instead, Amazon built its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business, which was designed to solve the problems with too-expensive in-house application hosting and open-source products that weren't robust enough to easily support fast-growing or already-large companies. AWS is now an over $10 billion business."Many companies describe themselves as customer-focused, but few walk the walk. Most big technology companies are competitor focused. They see what others are doing, and then work to fast follow," he wrote in a 2015-dated letter.The moral: To get ahead of the market, you have to think for yourself.2. Take risks for market leadershipIt took Amazon three tries to get its business as a selling and fulfillment platform off the ground. First it tried Amazon Auctions, a more-or-less direct aping of the model that put eBay on the map. That morphed into zShops, and finally into Amazon Marketplace, which accounts for nearly half the units sold on Amazon.com."Given a 10 percent chance of a 100-times payout, you should take that bet every time," Bezos wrote in his very first annual letter (1997). "Failure and invention are inseparable twins. To invent you have to experiment, and if you know in advance that it's going to work, it's not an experiment." Moral: Make bold, rather than timid, investment decisions. Even if they don't work out, you'll learn something for the next time. 3. Make employees think like ownersWhen Bezos wrote this in the first Amazon annual letter, Bezos had 614 employees, up from 158 a year earlier. It has 230,000 now and plans to hire 100,000 full-time employees over the next 18 months.One key component of the approach has been to use stock options in hiring. "We will continue to focus on hiring and retaining versatile and talented employees, and continue to weight their compensation to stock options rather than cash," Bezos wrote in the 1997 letter. "We know our success will be largely affected by our ability to attract and retain a motivated employee base, each of whom must think like, and therefore must actually be, an owner.''Moral: Whether it's stock, bonuses or profit sharing, give workers a stake in the success of the company.4. Build a culture that's right for your companyAmazon's own culture is famously breakneck-paced, and notoriously cost-conscious, as befits a company that has run only a small profit, or a loss, under generally accepted accounting principles for most of its life as a public company."We never claim that our approach is the right one — just that it's ours," Bezos wrote in the 2015 letter.

Investors want to see which party will seize control of the House and Senate before making any significant buy/sell decisions. That doesn’t leave us short of top stock trades to choose from though.Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow #1: Advanced Micro Devicestop stock trades for AMD and AmazonMoreAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) jumped more than 8% at one point Tuesday after it was announced that the company will supply chips to Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) data center, possibly impacting Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe stock bounced off $16 support and held the 200-day relatively well despite a violent selloff. This is exactly what we’re looking for.  8 Cheap Stocks That Are Leading the Blue Chips  In any regard, shares are now back above $20 and at a key level. Can they hold above this mark and get back above channel support (blue line)? If it can, the 21-day near $23 and channel resistance near $24 are in the cards. If it can’t, $18 and the 200-day are back on the table.Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow #2: CVS Healthtop stock trades for CVS earningsMoreA top and bottom-line beat propelled shares of CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) higher by 5% on Tuesday. If it can make it to $78-ish, CVS will fill the gap from last month.Will it act as resistance?That much is unclear. The stock has been trading pretty well since its lows last week, a perfect touch of the 200-day moving average. Should CVS consolidate for a few days, look to see that it stays over its 50-day moving average. Below and its 200-day is back on the table.Should CVS clear $78, look for a retest of downtrend resistance (black line). Over it and a fresh breakout could occur.Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow #3: Toyota Motortop stock trades for ToyotaMoreContinuing the better-than-expected earnings theme in the auto industry, Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) gave a solid outlook, raising its full-year expectations.The $114 level held as support, but investors will want to be mindful of Toyota until it can close above the 50-day and downtrend resistance. I will keep this on my watchlist to see if it is able to. A break below $114 and more lows could follow.Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow #4: Mylantop stock trades for MYL earningsMoreShares of Mylan (NYSE:MYL) are surging more than 17% on Tuesday after the company beat on earnings and missed on revenue expectations.What a move.Unfortunately, if you missed today’s 17% gain, you might be out of luck for a while. Although MYL could push its way through downtrend resistance at $38, the 200-day moving average at $38.50 and resistance between $39.50 and $40, I have my doubts it will.While that represents about 10% of potential upside, there’s no telling which resistance point will kick MYL down. I’d rather give the stock a few days to see if it can consolidate above the 100-day moving average. If not, see if range support near $35 and the 50-day can hold and go long there for a better risk/reward.Story continuesTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow #5: Eli Lillytop stock trades for LLY earningsMoreMidterms are overshadowing a number of big earnings reports, the last of which on the list includes Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY). Despite beating on earnings and revenue expectations, shares are down 4%.The chart is simple. After such a big run, shares are set to make a decent move in one direction or the other. Above $108 and we should get a test of channel resistance near $112.50 (blue line). Above it and the $116 highs are on the table.  10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy Ahead of Black Friday  Below $105 and the 100-day is the next line in the sand. Below it and the 200-day is in the cards.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

That’s got investors wondering, are stocks consolidating before another rally or are we in the midst of a dead cat bounce?We’ll try to navigate this tricky landscape as best we can as we eye our top stock trades for Wednesday.Russell 2000 ETF (IWM)top stock trades for IWMMore Click to Enlarge One reason this market is tricky? Because a few weeks ago, market participants were under the belief that the Federal Reserve would continue hiking interest rates at a time where the yield curve was about to invert and the economy would eventually tumble into a recession.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAfter printing a monstrous jobs report on Friday and after the Fed came out with a more dovish tone on the same day, investors are rethinking their outlook for the U.S. After a big rally in stocks though, many names are coming into key levels as we’re only about a week and a half away from earnings. Then there’s President Trump’s speech on Tuesday night regarding “the wall.” Like I said, tough sledding.The Russell 2000 ETF (NYSEARCA:IWM) has been one of the leaders when it comes to market direction. Meaning its direction has been the early tell on what the overall market is doing. Lately, it’s been strong and that’s a good sign for bulls. However, it’s coming into a big-time prior support level now.$145 was a key level through 2018. Some may say that the February and April bounces were a result of the 200-day moving average. I would say that it was likely that both levels played a role.  The 7 Best Stocks in the Entrepreneur Index  In any regard, the IWM has rallied eight of the last nine sessions while rallying about 12.5% in that time. To see $145 and the 50-day moving average act as resistance would come as little surprise at this point. If it does, I would love to see the 21-day moving average act as support.Union Pacific (UNP)top stock trades for UNPMore Click to Enlarge Up over 8.5% on Tuesday, Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) is making waves after announcing a new COO.After the stock’s massive gap-up, it leaves traders who weren’t in the trade in a tough spot. Do you chase up here or take a pass? I would love to see a $5 pullback into the mid-$140s. UNP has a chance to find support from the 50-day and 200-day moving averages down near this level.On the upside, it could run into the backside of a few prior uptrend support lines between $150 and $155. Ultimately though, I’m more interested in how UNP handles $157.50.Salesforce (CRM)top stock trades for CRMMore Click to Enlarge Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) has been bouncing back with a vengeance and bulls sure are happy to see it. While CRM has been extra volatile, it’s hard to ignore a best-in-breed cloud play.I’m not a big head-and-shoulders guy, but this one has similar makings of a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders setup. Although I would feel better about a healthy pullback down to the $135 to $138 area before recharging higher, the $147 level is proving it will be pivotal. A push through the “neckline” could spark a breakout rally.Story continuesConsidering the last few months though, I would be more inclined to take profits in CRM and wait for a pullback than bank on a breakout.Tilray (TLRY)top stock trades for TLRYMore Click to Enlarge Shares of Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) had been stuck in a big downtrend since September. All of its large rallies were met with sellers at downtrend resistance (black line), while buyers have buoyed the stock near downtrend support (blue line).Jumping 12.5% on Tuesday, the stock is popping over downtrend resistance for the first time in months. It’s also over the 21-day moving average. Bulls can use a stop-loss at ~$75 and target the $95 to $100 range.Amazon (AMZN)top stock trades for AMZNMore Click to Enlarge We flagged this one coming into the new year, along with the rest of FAANG. The chart for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is practically identical from that article.After going from ~$1,300 to $1,650 in just a few trading sessions, I am not a buyer of AMZN stock up 27%. If downtrend resistance doesn’t slow AMZN, I expect the 200-day moving average to slow its roll.So where will it pullback to? That’s a tough question because it depends on what the overall market is doing. I would love to see $1,540 to $1,600 hold up as support, but that represents a decline of just 3% to 6%. In a market like this, we can see that in just a day.But where to buy Amazon isn’t my main concern, it’s not buying it at this point. Wait for a better setup before chasing Amazon $350 off the low and into resistance.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

Like the full-size Echo, it responds to your commands and questions from across the room—but it’s a tiny, sawed-off one that costs $50. The only difference is that because you don’t have the big cylinder, the sound quality is tinny. It makes a fantastic second Echo—say, for the upstairs.Well, now here’s Google (GOOG, GOOGL) with its own version of the Dot, called the Google Home Mini. Also puck-shaped, also $50. (Google will also be releasing the Google Home Max, a beefier version with better sound.)The new Google Home Mini (right) has clearly been inspired by the Amazon Echo Dot (left).MoreThe Dot and the Mini are 90% identical. They both work great. Each has a Microphone Off switch, so you can be sure that it’s not listening for its trigger word. Both can now distinguish who is making the request, so that it can respond to commands like “Play my party playlist” and “What’s next on my calendar?” with the right person’s music or info. Both now let you make free speakerphone calls to actual phone numbers (although the Google’s call quality is awful).There are, however, a few differences to note.In this corner: The Google Home Mini.The sound is much better. Neither assistant pod will be mistaken for a concert hall. But there’s no question that Google’s built-in speaker is richer than Amazon’s.It talks to Chromecasts and Android TVs. If you spring $35 for a Chromecast (a little receiver stick that plugs into a modern TV’s USB jack), or if you have a TV that runs Android TV, you can perform a nifty trick. You can say, “Ok Google, show me a video about how to remove contact lenses” or “Show me funny cat videos” or “Show me the trailer for the new Avengers movie,” and it appears on your TV instantly. As you can see in the video above, it’s quite magical.It will someday have a tap-to-talk feature. The top of the Mini is supposed to be touch sensitive. As designed, you could tap it to issue a command (instead of saying “OK Google”), or tap it to pause music. But just as the Home Mini was shipping, a reviewer discovered a bug in which that button thought that it was being pressed all the time, transmitting everything anyone said in the room to Google’s servers. So Google responded by shutting off that top button’s features altogether.Google will presumably restore the tap-the-top feature once they get their act together.MoreAnd now, in this corner: The Amazon Echo Dot.Works with more home-automation products, like internet-controlled thermostats, lights, security cameras, and so on. It’s a huge list. Google’s improving on this front, but Amazon’s had a several-year head start.It has an audio output jack. Lots of people love plugging in their nice speakers or sound systems to an Echo Dot, thanks to the standard miniplug on the side (the Google offers nothing similar). That makes it easy to control your music by voice—one of the most luxurious features ever.It’s much easier and more reliable to adjust the Echo Dot’s volume (left) by turning its ring instead of tapping the sides.MoreYou can see feedback across the room. The Dot’s LED ring glows in different colors and patterns to communicate different things—for example, it glows when it’s transmitting sound back to Amazon. You can see it from the side, and therefore from across the room. The Google’s four LEDs are visible only when you’re looking down on the device, which isn’t nearly as useful.You can order stuff. Of course, this is exactly what Amazon hopes you’ll do, but it’s still cool. “Alexa—order more paper towels.”If you’re a Google Play subscriber, maybe the convenience of speaking your desires for music tips the balance for you toward the Google Home Mini. (The argument about “Buy a Google Home if you keep your calendar in Google Calendar” doesn’t really hold water, since the Echo can consult or add events to the calendar systems of Google or Apple (AAPL) or Microsoft (MSFT).Otherwise, though, the Echo Dot is still the better micro-assistant. (Especially when it’s on sale for $40—for example, on the typical Black Friday, which is in a couple of weeks.)There will be a lot of people unwrapping these little guys this holiday season.MoreBoth of these devices are delicious enhancements to almost anyone’s home. Over time, you’ll find more and more ways that they’re useful—and for only 50 bucks!Correction: The originally posted version of this story referred to the volume ring of the Echo Dot. That was a feature of the first-generation Dot; the current second-generation Dot has volume buttons on the top instead of the ring.More from David Pogue:The Fitbit Ionic doesn’t quite deserve the term ‘smartwatch’Augmented reality?

Here’s one way to tell: Go to your order history and count how many of the last 10 items you needed and how many you just wanted. Or check your credit card statements. When I did this, I was shocked at how frequently “Amazon.com” showed up on my bill. I couldn’t even recall what I could’ve possibly ordered and wondered if I was a victim of identity theft. But it turns out I was only stealing from myself.It’s not easy to resist the personalized convenience and instant gratification that this online retail giant has to offer. In fact, Amazon is responsible for more than half of all of 2016’s online sales growth, according to a study by Slice Intelligence. And with its recent announcement of its plan to acquire Whole Foods for $13.7 billion, Amazon is set on taking over the grocery industry.Before your spending spirals out of control, check out these 6 foolproof ways to conquer your Amazon addiction1. Begin by setting up what I like to call “the check yourself before you wreck yourself” payment plan. Under your account settings, turn off one-click ordering everywhere and you won’t have the ability to one-click shop on any of your devices.2. Delete all your payment methods. Each time you go to pay, you’ll have to put in your credit card information. Annoying? Yes, it makes shopping a lot more deliberate and bit more time-consuming. If you can wait a few a days, leave your items in your cart and revisit your decision to buy everything later. I do this all the time and end up removing half the things I originally placed in my cart3. Set a spending limit by giving yourself an Amazon Allowance. It’s essentially a pre-paid gift card that you can give to others, or email to yourself – either on a one-time or recurring basis. When you go to check-out, it’ll show up as the only saved payment method. It’s also a great way to keep your kids’ spending under control on a daily, weekly or monthly basis.4. Buyers beware of the dangerous “Dash” buttons. For those of you who don’t know what it is, it’s the one-click shopping button on steroids placed all over your house. Out of Gatorade? Running low on Huggies diapers? Hit the button and these wi-fi connected devices enable you to order more. Sure, it’s super convenient – and that’s the point. It’s also a neat trick to make it all-too-easy for you to shop non-stop. Not only does it keep you from looking at prices, but you’re not comparison shopping for better deals either. It’s a big nightmare for parents with young kids. If your Dash buttons aren’t hidden, you might get a surprise delivery of paper towels that your kids pushed for.5. Another gimmick to avoid: the lightning deals, or what Amazon likes to call their “Gold Box” deals. The original prices can be inflated on the day of these flash sales to make the discounts look more attractive.6. To ensure you’re getting the best deal, don’t check out until you’ve checked the price history on a third-party site like camelcamelcamel.com.What are some of your Amazon savings hacks?

Online shopping is growing significantly faster than brick-and-mortar stores.Online retailers brought in nearly half a trillion dollars in the U.S. over the past year with about 9% of total sales, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. And online sales are growing between 15% and 17% per year, compared to about 5% for the overall retail industry.Globally, the trend is even stronger. Some 1.66 billion online shoppers spent $2.3 trillion in 2017. By 2021, sales could more than double from today's levels.It's no surprise, then, that some of the world's largest internet companies are e-commerce companies. Meanwhile, many brick-and-mortar stores are moving aggressively into online retail to take advantage of the trend and protect their businesses.In this article, we'll explore the seven largest e-commerce companies in the world, many of which present interesting investment opportunities to take advantage of the megatrend in online shopping.A man holding a credit card while using a laptop computer.MoreImage source: Getty Images.What is e-commerce?E-commerce, by its broadest definition, is any transaction of goods and services done over the internet. More colloquially, it refers to buying an item or service online with an electronic payment method, such as a credit or debit card or a digital wallet service. The item could be physical (a vinyl record), digital (an mp3 download), or a service (a music streaming subscription).When talking about e-commerce companies, there's a broad range of businesses involved in making online stores work. Payment networks and digital wallet services ensure payment processing. Shipping and logistics companies make sure packages are delivered. And online stores connect buyers and sellers.For the purposes of this article, we're focusing primarily on online stores. But those stores may operate in any one of the several flavors of e-commerce:Business-to-Consumer (B2C): This is the kind of e-commerce that comes to mind when most people hear the word. B2C e-commerce is when a business sells a good or service to an individual consumer. Some examples of B2C e-commerce operations include Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Walmart's (NYSE: WMT) online stores, JD.com (NASDAQ: JD), and Alibaba's (NYSE: BABA) TMall.Business-to-Business (B2B): A business selling a good or service to another business. This can be done in the form of wholesalers like those found on Alibaba.com. It could also be businesses that offer software-as-a-service to other businesses to help manage their companies. Software-as-a-service is a term used to describe a software product offered to customers on a subscription basis and generally accessible through the internet.Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C): C2C e-commerce businesses create a marketplace to connect buyers and multiple sellers online. eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) originally got its start as an auction clearinghouse for consumers to sell their unwanted items to other consumers, and it's a prime example of C2C e-commerce. Amazon also offers a marketplace for consumers to sell unwanted items, and Alibaba operates similar online marketplaces in China. In the context of this article, consumer-to-consumer e-commerce companies are businesses that merely facilitate e-commerce through their platform.Consumer-to-Business (C2B): A consumer-to-business transaction is when a consumer sells an item to a business. Instead of listing an item on a marketplace like eBay, C2B e-commerce companies buy items directly from consumers. They might then turn around and sell them on an online marketplace. An example would be companies that buy used smartphones, including eBay and Gazelle. Which e-commerce company is the biggest?There are several different ways one could measure the size of an e-commerce business. How many customers does it have? How much revenue do they generate? How much is the company itself worth?Perhaps the most universal way to compare online stores is with a metric called gross merchandise value, or GMV. (Gross merchandise value is also sometimes referred to as gross merchandise volume, or gross merchandise sales.) GMV is a measure of the total value of all items sold on an online store or marketplace.GMV is a lot different from revenue. eBay operates as a marketplace, and it doesn't sell items directly to consumers. As such, its revenue is a small percentage of its GMV. Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) makes it easy for other businesses to sell goods on their own websites, so it also generates a small amount of revenue compared to GMV on its platform.Amazon, meanwhile, splits its sales about 50/50 between its own retail operations and sales from third-party merchants on its marketplace. As a result, its revenue is a significantly higher share of its GMV. Online stores that exclusively sell their own inventory (think brand retailers) will produce practically the same amount of revenue as GMV.Here's a table of the world's largest e-commerce companies sorted by GMV:   Company   GMV (TTM)   Type(s) of E-commerce       Alibaba   >$768 billion   B2B, C2C     Amazon   $239 billion   B2C, C2C     JD.com   $215 billion   C2C, B2C     eBay   $93 billion   C2C, C2B     Shopify   $33 billion   C2C     Rakuten   >$31 billion   B2C     Walmart   >$19 billion   B2C, C2C   Data source: Alibaba, Amazon, JD.com, eBay, Shopify, Rakuten, Walmart.Story continuesAlibabaAlibaba first started its business online in 1999, launching Alibaba.com and 1688.com. Its flagship site operates as a global wholesale marketplace, while 1688.com handles similar transactions within China.Alibaba's core commerce business also consists of:Taobao: Alibaba's consumer-to-consumer marketplace serving mainland China, enabling small businesses and entrepreneurs to reach individual consumers. Founded in 2003, it's now the world's biggest e-commerce website. It generated $428 billion in gross merchandise volume in Alibaba's fiscal 2017.Tmall: A spinoff from Taobao dedicated to business-to-consumer e-commerce in China. It's the second-largest e-commerce website in the world after Taobao, generating $340 billion in GMV during fiscal 2017.AliExpress: Aimed at international shoppers, enabling small businesses in China to sell to customers all over the world, particularly the U.S., Russia, Brazil, and Spain. Alibaba doesn't report GMV on AliExpress.Even just looking at Alibaba's success with its Taobao brands, Taobao, and Tmall, Alibaba is an absolute giant compared to the rest of the competitors. Add in its wholesale marketplaces, which are the go-to source for finding manufacturers and suppliers in Asia to source white-label products, and Alibaba's share of all the commerce transacted on the internet is even bigger. With a growing international presence anchored by AliExpress and other investments in retail, Alibaba is by far the world's largest e-commerce company.A truck with Amazon's Prime logo on it.MoreImage source: Amazon.AmazonAmazon is the largest online retailer in the United States. Amazon started as an online bookstore, but it quickly expanded to all sorts of different verticals, including electronics, fashion, and home goods.Perhaps its most innovative and successful contribution to online retail is Amazon Prime. Amazon Prime is a subscription service that provides shoppers with unlimited 2-day shipping from Amazon. The company has continually added new benefits such as video and music streaming, exclusive access to certain items, early access to deals, free ebooks, unlimited cloud storage for photos, and more. As a result, Amazon now has over 100 million Prime members worldwide.Amazon has also hit a homerun with its Fulfilled by Amazon service. FBA allows third-party merchants to use Amazon's warehouses, fulfillment center network, and logistics capabilities to fulfill orders. Items sold through FBA are Prime-eligible, which is increasingly important to attracting customers on Amazon. Fulfilled by Amazon allowed the online store to grow Prime-eligible items from 20 million to 100 million over the last three years.Overall, Amazon's GMV totaled about $239 billion over the last 12 months. Consider that $116 billion of that is sold directly by Amazon, with the other $123 billion coming from third-party sellers on its marketplace. Amazon kept about $37 billion in fees for facilitating third-party sales. That's a much higher take rate than most marketplaces, but Amazon has much higher costs associated with its third-party sellers using services such as FBA.JD.comJD.com is very similar to Amazon, but operating in China. The company has built out an unparalleled logistics network with over 500 warehouses and 7,000 delivery stations. Unlike Amazon, though, JD.com operates the entire logistics operation itself, not handing off packages to third parties for last-mile delivery. That enables JD.com to ship 90% of orders to customers by the next day. Amazon is notably investing in its own delivery network.JD operates a first-party retail segment just like Amazon's, but it also partners with international brands, including Walmart, to help them reach Chinese consumers. JD operates more like an online mall in that way than a centralized retailer. Walmart is notably a 5% stakeholder in JD.com after the American company sold its Chinese online store, Yihaodian, to JD.com in 2016.JD launched JD Plus in 2016, its version of Amazon Prime. Plus members enjoy free shipping up to 60 times per year, free ebooks, special discounts, faster accrual of loyalty points, and iQiyi's premium service. iQiyi is China's largest online video platform. The company now claims over 10 million JD Plus members, and members renew at an 80% rate.JD's strong logistics network and growing list of domestic and international retail partners (170,000 and counting) is helping it grow GMV rapidly. GMV increased 30% in the second quarter of 2018, outpacing Amazon by about 11 percentage points. At that rate, JD.com could overtake Amazon by 2019.eBayeBay started as an online auction house in the 90s for people to sell collectibles and used goods to one another. Today, 80% of items sold on the platform are new, and 89% of items are sold at a fixed price.eBay is taking steps to make its platform look and operate more like Amazon. It's encouraging sellers to offer free guaranteed 3-day shipping. It's combining product listings from sellers with the same item, enabling consumers to find the best price more easily. It also launched a Best Price Guarantee, offering customers a 110% rebate on the difference between an item they bought on eBay and an identical listing on a competitors' website. eBay is operating more and more like a business-to-consumer retailer instead of a marketplace for other businesses.The moves are starting to pay off. GMV growth (on a currency-neutral basis) started accelerating in 2018, growing 7% in the first half of the year. Still, that growth is considerably slower than other companies on this list, and slower than the overall growth of the e-commerce industry.While eBay turns around its GMV growth, it's also working to increase its profit margin. It moved to intermediate payments itself by starting to cut ties with former subsidiary PayPal. The company will handle all of its payments in-house by 2021, which the company expects to provide significant value to sellers on the platform. That could result in both higher profits and better GMV growth.eBay offices in BerlinMoreImage source: eBay.ShopifyShopify is very different than the other companies mentioned in this article. Instead of operating its own centralized marketplace, Shopify provides a platform for small merchants to sell items on their own websites and on other third-party marketplaces including Amazon and eBay. At the core of its business, Shopify provides an easy way to manage a retail business from one central location, tracking sales and inventory, helping fulfill orders, and helping customers create their own websites.Shopify charges a subscription fee to use its service, offering several different tiers suitable for businesses of all sizes. Its 600,000 merchants range from one-person entrepreneurs with a single product all the way up to multibillion-dollar brands with hundreds of products.However, more and more of its revenue is coming from what it calls merchant solutions. Shopify offers payment processing, shipping services, and cash advances to merchants. In the second quarter of 2018, merchant solutions accounted for 55% of total revenue for Shopify, and the segment is growing faster than its subscription business. While these services have much lower profit margin than its subscription offerings, they support subscriptions by locking merchants into Shopify's ecosystem.Merchants are increasingly looking for an alternative to Amazon, as the marketplace becomes more and more crowded. Shopify is one of the top alternatives for businesses looking to establish a brand and take more control of their inventory and sales with their own websites. The growth of merchant solutions outpacing subscription revenue is a sign that there's strong demand for an alternative to Amazon, but entrepreneurs still want a bit of hand-holding. Shopify is in one of the best positions to offer that service.Rakuten Rakuten is very similar to JD.com and Amazon. The Japanese e-commerce company operates an online mall for big brands in Japan, but it also owns several e-commerce operations in other countries, including the U.S., France, Brazil, and the U.K., which are more unbranded marketplaces like Tmall, eBay, or Walmart's marketplace.Rakuten has put a major focus on its delivery network, launching its One Delivery initiative last year. Rakuten hopes to improve delivery speed at a lower cost by relying on its own network as well as third parties in a similar manner as Amazon in the U.S. Amazon itself has made good progress in the Japanese market thanks to the growth of Prime and its shipping benefits. Amazon is the largest online retailer in Japan, according to some estimates.In order to combat the growth of Amazon, Rakuten is also investing outside of retail and logistics. It operates Japan's largest internet bank and its third-largest credit-card company. It recently started building a wireless network to improve the profitability of its MVNO business. It also owns a travel agency, insurance company, matchmaking service, and golf-reservation system, among 60 or so other businesses. It's also a major investor in Lyft and Pinterest, and it owns 100% of Viber. The goal is to create an ecosystem of services that can provide everything customers need in order to promote its brand.Rakuten's profits have been hurt by its heavy investments recently, and GMV growth isn't nearly as strong as others on this list. Domestic GMV grew just 11.1% year over year in the second quarter of 2018. What's more, the profitability of its core retail operations is declining as it invests in logistics and other efforts to stave off Amazon. Operating income from domestic e-commerce is declining despite modest improvements in revenue.Rakuten's global transaction volume, which includes its international operations as well as credit-card payments, digital transactions, and other retail operations increased slightly faster, at 16.4%. Still, Rakuten's growth is relatively slow.WalmartWalmart is the world's largest brick-and-mortar retailer, generating revenue of nearly half a trillion dollars per year. But just a small portion of that revenue comes from online sales.The company has been investing heavily in e-commerce over the past few years. It acquired Jet.com in 2016 along with a string of small U.S.-based e-commerce companies. It's also rapidly expanding its online grocery operations following Amazon's big push into groceries in 2017. As a result, Walmart has seen strong online sales growth over the past couple of years. It generated $11.5 billion in sales in the U.S. in 2017, and it expects to hit 40% online sales growth this year.Walmart's most recent e-commerce investment is its acquisition of a 77% stake in Flipkart, one of the leading e-commerce companies in India. The move puts Walmart neck-and-neck with Amazon in India, another market where Amazon has grown to overtake native competition. India holds massive growth potential for online shopping, and Walmart's Flipkart stake gives it tremendous exposure to the market. Walmart says Flipkart's GMV in 2017 was about $7.5 billion.Not all of Walmart's e-commerce investments have paid off. In 2017, the company made the decision to wind down its first-party e-commerce operations in Brazil. It also ended up selling an 80% stake in its brick-and-mortar business in the country as operations struggled during the Brazilian recession.Walmart has largely grown its e-commerce sales through acquisitions and the expansion of grocery pickup and delivery. It's unclear how long the momentum can last as it finishes its grocery rollout and laps its acquisitions. The Flipkart acquisition will provide significant growth in one of the fastest-growing e-commerce markets in the world, but it doesn't protect Walmart's brick-and-mortar operations from ceding sales to online competitors in the 26 other countries in which it operates.Investing in e-commerceThese seven companies each offer various opportunities to invest in e-commerce. Amazon offers global scale. Alibaba and JD.com offer access to the rapidly growing Chinese market. Shopify offers access to a growing number of small retail entrepreneurs. Walmart offers exposure to India with its Flipkart acquisition, but provides stability with its massive brick-and-mortar operations. eBay and Rakuten are growing more slowly than the competition, but eBay is finding ways to improve the profitability of its core business, while Rakuten is investing in other areas outside of retail to drive profit growth. For investors interested in e-commerce, these seven companies provide a great start.

Individuals and families want a simple, affordable and high-quality experience that helps them stay well,” Bertolini said in an emailed statement to Yahoo Finance. Bertolini says Aetna’s merger with CVS Health will achieve a similar mission. “Our combination with CVS Health will help address those needs at the local level, and I am encouraged to see other companies working toward the same goal,” he said.Yahoo Finance’s Julia La Roche interviews Aetna chairman and CEO Mark Bertolini. (Cindy Ord/Getty Images)MoreShares of insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies have been trading lower following the announcement from the trio of industry titans.Meeting the needs of consumersBack in December, CVS Health (CVS) said that it was buying Aetna in a $69 billion deal that could reshape American health care.“Today, increasing numbers of consumers are taking on more and more responsibility for paying for their health care as the burden of costs is being shifted to them,” the companies said in a statement. “Together, CVS Health and Aetna will be a trusted community partner who will help consumers better manage the cost of the health care they need.”Prior to the deal announcement, Bertolini and CVS’s CEO Larry Merlo have both separately spoken publicly about problems in U.S. health care, and they both advanced solutions they’ve had in mind.Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett has also spoken out about the rising health care costs impeding the U.S. economy.“The ballooning costs of health care act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,” Buffett said in Tuesday’s announcement. “Our group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable. Rather, we share the belief that putting our collective resources behind the country’s best talent can, in time, check the rise in health costs while concurrently enhancing patient satisfaction and outcomes.”— Julia La Roche is a finance reporter at Yahoo Finance. Follow her on Twitter.BERTOLINI: CEOs who manage a bottom line are making a ‘big mistake’Aetna CEO: Obamacare can’t be repealed, but it can be fixedAetna CEO: 2 reasons why health care costs are so highHow 2 life-threatening events changed the way Aetna’s CEO views health carePODCAST: Aetna’s CEO Mark Bertolini on the future of health careReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextThe Best Places to Retire to AbroadInvestopedia5 Top Healthcare Stocks to Buy in 2019Motley FoolYou can capture a dividend above 5% and still enjoy stock-market growthMarketWatchWere Hedge Funds Right About Souring On Omega Healthcare Investors Inc (OHI)?Insider MonkeyWhy the health-care stock selloff may actually be a good thingMarketWatchZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolA Look At The Fair Value Of Westlake Chemical Corporation (NYSE:WLK)Simply Wall St.Wedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Walmart WMT, Amazon AMZN and Kroger KR.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:                                               Akamai Technologiesis one of those companies that’s not necessarily a household name, but that virtually everyone interacts with on a daily basis without even being aware of it.Akamai’s “Intelligent Platform” is a distributed cloud computing network of over 240,000 servers worldwide which gathers real-time data on net traffic and congestion and uses complex proprietary algorithms to ensure the most efficient content delivery possible.   An estimated 15-30% of all web traffic is routed through Akamai’s network.Akamai’s customers take advantage of this vast network to have content delivered from server locations that are geographically closet to the end user, ensuring the best performance and user experience possible.  Akamai also provides advanced cloud security services.Akamai has been steadily growing revenue and earnings and has beat the Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimate in each of the past 4 quarters, including a strong Q1 one report in which management raised guidance for 2018.  Q1 revenues were $669M, with $353M coming from the Web Division and $316M from the Media and Carrier division, increases of 16% and 6% respectively, over the year-ago period.  Net earnings were $0.79/share beating estimates of $0.70 by 13%.The real bonus for investors was that the company raised guidance for both Q2 and FY2018.  CEO Dr. Tom Leighton stated “We are pleased with the results of our first quarter performance, which featured continued outstanding growth in our security business, substantial improvement I our media business, marginal expansion and accelerated revenue growth overall.”Akamai is clearly firing on all cylinders. Revenues next quarter are expected to be in the range of $658M - $670M and earning between $0.79/share and $0.83/share.  Full year earnings guidance is now $3.15/share to $3.25/share, up from previous guidance of $2.90 - $3.01/share.Akamai shares are up 17% in 2018, handily beating the Internet Services industry as a whole, which has declined 5%.Bear of the Day:After nearly collapsing during the financial crisis in 2008, American International Group was once of the most high-profile beneficiaries of U.S. government intervention in the Troubled Asset Relief Program, commonly referred to as TARP.Having decided that the failure of AIG, with its large and diverse basket of assets and liabilities would cause catastrophic damage to the U.S. financial system and economy, the U.S. became AIG’s largest shareholder, at one point owning 61% of the company’s shares.  The program mandated significant changes to AIG’s structure, including a new corporate governance structure, and a reduction in exposure to risky derivative securities.By 2012, the U.S. Treasury and federal Reserve had not only recouped all of the $182 billion they had staked to the bailout, but after selling all of its remaining shares, actually posted a profit of nearly $23 billion on the transaction.Thanks to the austerity measures levied on the company while under government ownership, AIG has never returned to the high-flying status it enjoyed before the crisis. The size of the company was cut by nearly 50% in terms of assets and its exposure to derivatives was lowered by over 90%.Although a much safer and more stable company, the huge insurer is a mere shadow if its former self in terms of profits.  Even in an environment of low interest rates, a rising stock market and softening regulations that should benefit financial companies, AIG has underperformed, with shares up just 34% in the past 5 years versus an average of better than 50% for the insurance industry. 2018 has been even worse, with the stock down 7% YTD.Story continues3 Retail Stocks to Buy Ahead of Quarterly EarningsIs Walmart (WMT) Still Cheap Right Now?Shares of Walmart opened higher on Monday just a few trading days after the company reported solid first-quarter earnings results. With that said, Walmart’s stock price had sunk over the last few months, which means now might be a great time to consider buying the retail giant at a relatively cheap price.Walmart’s overall revenues climbed roughly 4.4% from the year-ago period to hit $122.7 billion in the first quarter, with comp sales up 2.1%. Meanwhile, the company’s adjusted earnings surged by 14% to reach $1.14 per share, which also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.12 per share.Investors should also have been pleased to see that Walmart’s U.S. e-commerce sales popped by 33%, despite increased competition from Amazon and other online sellers. Now, let’s take a look at Walmart’s price movement before we dive into why the company’s current valuation looks rather enticing.Recent Price MovementWalmart stock was up roughly 8% over the last year before Monday’s gains. However, shares of Walmart had sunk 9.8% during the last 12 weeks and 4.8% over the last four weeks as investors reacted negatively to the company’s slower fourth-quarter e-commerce growth.   Furthermore, shares of Walmart sat at their 52-week high of $109 per share in late January. Walmart stock opened Monday at $84.14 per share, which means shares of Walmart are much cheaper than they were to start the year just based on price alone.Still, investors need to know a little more before they can say that Walmart stock is currently offering a ton of value.ValuationComing into Monday, Walmart stock was trading at 16.9X forward 12-months earnings estimates. Walmart stock has traded as high as 23.8X over the past year, with its median resting at 17.9X. The company is also currently trading just slightly above its year-long low of 16.4X, which it rested at briefly in early July of last year.Walmart stock is also trading directly in line with the S&P 500’s average of 16.9X. Furthermore, the company compares favorably to the “Retail – Supermarkets” industry’s current average forward P/E ratio of 16.3. This industry includes the likes of Kroger other large U.S. grocery chains.Based on the last year alone, investors should be able to say with some conviction that Walmart stock is rather attractive at its current valuation, and pretty cheap compared to where it has traded recently.Growth OutlookLastly, it is worth considering Walmart’s current growth prospects. The company is projected to see its second-quarter earnings climb by 12.9% to touch $1.22 per share, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. For the full-year, Walmart is expected to hit $4.86 per share, which would mark a nearly 10% surge from a year ago.Meanwhile, Walmart’s revenues are only projected to pop by 1.8% in Q2, while full-year revenues are projected to climb by 2.08% to reach $510.74 billion. Investors might be a bit less pleased to see these top-line projections, but it is worth considering just how hard it is to post massive top-line growth when the company is expected to pull in over $510 billion.Our 2% full-year growth estimate would mean Walmart expanded its top line by $10 billion.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

REUTERS/Shannon StapletonMoreBy Siddharth Cavale(Reuters) - U.S. grocer Albertsons Cos Inc said it would buy drug store chain Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) to create a company with $83 billion in annual revenue, giving it more clout to compete with bigger chains in an industry fearing the entry of Amazon.Com (AMZN.O).The deal is the latest in a wave of consolidation in the drug retailing sector, which is looking to cut costs amid weak reimbursement rates and lower generic drug prices. At the same time, Amazon's foray is widely expected to disrupt the industry, prompting drug chains to beef up their businesses.Backed by private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, Albertsons hopes the deal will help it become a formidable competitor to CVS Corp (CVS.N) and Walgreens (WBA.O), and give its private equity owners a way to exit their decade-long investment in the grocer.Cerberus first took a stake in Albertsons in 2006 and scaled it through acquisitions including that of Safeway in 2014. It planned to sell its stake through an IPO in 2017, but dropped the plans after Amazon bought grocer Whole Foods Market in May."The new company will have an expanded footprint and be ranked first or second in 66 percent of the top metropolitan areas in the United States and will be ranked first or second in 70 percent of pharmacy locations," Albertsons and Rite Aid said in a joint statement on Tuesday.Albertsons owns about 2,300 supermarket stores mainly on the east and west coasts of the United States and also operates about 1,800 pharmacies. Rite Aid owns about 2,569 drug stores, after it sold 1,932 pharmacies to Walgreens for $4.38 billion.Albertsons said it would convert its existing pharmacies to Rite Aid stores and let existing Rite Aid outlets operate as stand alone pharmacies.Together, the combined company will operate about 4,350 pharmacy counters and 320 clinics across 38 states and Washington.Within three years the combined company is expected to deliver annual run-rate cost savings of $375 million, with more than 60 percent within the first two years, the companies said.The combined company is expected to generate pre-tax earnings of about $3.7 billion within three years, they said.Rite Aid's shares, which initially surged by as much as 25 percent premarket on Tuesday, were trading up 2.3 percent at $2.18 in afternoon trading.TOUGH MARKETThe deal follows Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) move to team up with Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) to form a not-for-profit company to provide health care for their employees, challenging the existing U.S. healthcare system.The threat of Amazon making further inroads has jolted U.S. drug store chains into action after several years of declines in traffic and sales at front-end stores.Larger rival CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) reached a $69 billion deal to buy insurer Aetna Inc (AET.N) last month, while Walgreens is also reported to have made a takeover approach for drug distributor AmerisourceBergen Corp (ABC.N)."Drug retailing has had its own challenges with reimbursement pressure and weak front-end sales as evidenced in Rite-Aid's weak profits over the last couple of years," said Mickey Chadha, a vice president with credit ratings agency Moody's."Competing with much larger and more diversified drug retailers like CVS and Walgreens will be a formidable challenge," he said.Based on the enterprise value of both Albertsons and Rite Aid, the combined company is valued at $24 billion, an Albertsons Companies' spokeswoman told Reuters.Rite Aid shareholders can elect to get either one Albertsons common share plus about $1.83 in cash, or 1.079 Albertsons common shares for every 10 shares they hold.Shareholders of Rite Aid, which had a market cap of $2.33 billion at midday Tuesday, will own between 28 percent and 29.6 percent of the combined company, while Albertsons' shareholders will own the rest based on the elections, the companies said.Depending on whether Rite Aid shareholders choose to be paid in cash and Albertsons stock or only stock, the deal values Rite Aid at between $1.30 and $2.65 per share, Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken said.(Additional reporting by Shalini Nagarajan and Vibhuti Sharma in Bengaluru;

On Wednesday, eHarmony launches on Amazon Echo, making it the first dating app to integrate with a major artificial intelligence system, the company boasts in a press release.The integration means that eHarmony users can ask Alexa to read them their matches and messages, on an Amazon Echo or Echo Dot — or Alexa can show them their matches, visually, on the new Amazon Show device, which has a seven-inch touchscreen.Amazon Echos and Echo Dots on a table. (Reuters)MoreAlexa will provide a “human element to eHarmony,” says eHarmony CEO Grant Langston. The term for apps on Alexa is “skills,” and Langston adds that, “The eHarmony skill for Alexa surfaces pertinent information, like location and occupation, that some people might gloss over if they are just quickly swiping at attractive pictures.”Amazon is singing the same tune: “We think voice can provide a more natural and friendly interface for engaging with apps like eHarmony’s” says an Amazon spokesperson.Grant Langston, who has been eHarmony CEO for just over a year, told Yahoo Finance in a July interview that he expects further consolidation in the online dating industry. “There are a lot of apps that are very small, VC-run properties that, in some cases, have a good idea but they don’t know how to monetize it,” he said. “I think there is some sense that a rollup, consolidation—pick your word—is coming. It’s hard to know exactly how that happens.”To set up the eHarmony integration, Echo owners must enable the eHarmony “skill,” then link their eHarmony account in the Alexa app. When using the skill, eHarmony says, Alexa will also offer up verbal witticisms like, “Oh my, you have a lot of new matches.”Unless you don’t have a lot of new matches.—Daniel Roberts is a writer at Yahoo Finance, covering tech and media.Read more:Amazon could face antitrust scrutiny as it gobbles up more companiesAmazon’s NYC bookstore is not really for selling booksWhy Amazon will have success selling workout clothesAmazon Prime Day is a raw deal for e-book buyersAmazon crushes earning expectations on the strength of Web ServicesReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextThe best lawnmowers to buy right nowThe TelegraphAmazon Music Is Available for Free NowRolling StoneGoogle Allows YouTube App on Amazon's Fire TV Once AgainIndiewireWhat to Watch this weekend: The season premiere of Bosch and Tonya Harding on Worst Cooks in AmericaEntertainment WeeklyGet this $20 Alexa smart speaker instead of a $50 Echo DotBGR NewsZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

This has led to an increased rivalry in these regions, as both Alibaba stock and Amazon compete against each other in Southeast Asia and South Asia.If Alibaba gains a significant market share in these regions, it would provide the company with a much bigger growth runway than Amazon. This will also increase the bullish sentiment toward the stock.Alibaba and Amazon need to establish their presence in international markets to diversify their revenue base and have better growth potential.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn the one hand, Alibaba has tried to partner with startups who have already scaled up their operations. On the other hand, Amazon has mostly tried to build its business from the ground up.The jury is still out over which business model will be successful in the long term. However, Alibaba and the companies it has partnered with are already showing strong signs of a successful market penetration.Make or Break Moment for Both GiantsAlibaba and Amazon are investing huge piles of cash to ramp up their operations in South Asia and Southeast Asia. Together, these two regions are home to one-third of the total world population and have a nominal GDP of close to $6 trillion. The average GDP growth in this part has been 6%-8% in the past few years, which has allowed rapid growth of the middle class. There is also a significant increase in internet users due to cheaper smartphones and better networks.  10 Super Safe Growth Stocks to Buy for Long-Lasting Dividends  Alibaba was a latecomer in investing in these regions compared to Amazon. Amazon started its Indian operations in 2013. It has committed to invest $5 billion to build up its operations. Recently Amazon is reported to increase this investment by another $2 billion after Walmart’s acquisition of Flipkart, which is Amazon’s main rival. Alibaba has mostly focused on Southeast Asia by getting majority control of Lazada and Tokopedia.In India, Alibaba has relied on local startups to scale up their operations and directly compete with Amazon and Walmart. Alibaba has a significant stake in Paytm, which is a leading digital wallet and financial services company in India.Paytm recently notched a big win when it was reported that Buffett has built a stake in the company for $300 million. This values the company at a whopping $10 billion. Alibaba has also invested close to half a billion dollars in the leading online grocer, BigBasket. One of the latest investment has been in Zomato, which is a food delivery and restaurant search app. Alibaba is planning to enter the e-commerce segment of India through Paytm Mall in which it has invested over $600 million along with Softbank.Alibaba has recently bought Pakistan’s main e-commerce company, Daraz, for an undisclosed sum. It has purchased a 20% stake in Bangladesh’s bKash, which is the leading mobile financial services company. This investment pattern across South Asia and Southeast Asia shows that Alibaba is relying heavily on local startups to build its presence in these regions.Besides e-commerce, it is also looking to replicate the success of Ant Financial in payments ecosystem of these regions. The banking presence in these regions is still relatively low which should help mobile payment services to expand their presence.The level of investments will only increase in the near term as both Alibaba and Amazon try to increase their market share and expand their presence in e-commerce, payments, media, logistics and other services. If Alibaba or Amazon is able to gain a decisive market share across a broad spectrum of services in South Asia and Southeast Asia, it will show the long-term potential of their business model.Why Alibaba Has a Significant Lead?Although Alibaba was a latecomer to these regions, it has built up its presence by good investments and partnerships. By focusing on local startups Alibaba has been able to prevent any regulatory obstacles and also leverage local talent. Amazon’s strategy of building operations from scratch is not only more time consuming but could eventually cost more. Even after five years of operations, Amazon is yet to trounce the market leader Flipkart in India. Now that Flipkart has been bought by Walmart, it would be even more difficult for Amazon to increase its market share.Story continuesOn the other hand, Alibaba’s investments in Paytm have paid off as the company is already in a dominant position in the payments ecosystem within India. Alibaba is now using Paytm Mall as a springboard to enter e-commerce segment in India. The investment in Big Basket has also been very successful as it now holds a significant share in online grocery business.Besides the success of individual investments, Alibaba has a huge support due to Softbank’s investment in South Asia and Southeast Asia. In many segments, the investments of Alibaba and Softbank are complementary. The size of Softbank’s investment portfolio is also important. For example, Softbank has invested close to $8 billion in Indian startups in the past few years. This gives Alibaba an option to make an entry in various segments at a later stage.Future TrajectoryIf Alibaba gains a significant lead in South Asia and Southeast Asia over Amazon, it will have an oversized impact on the stock of both the companies. Both these regions have a lower GDP compared to Europe, North America and China. But they are growing at a faster rate and have a rapidly growing middle class.Also, this is more of a neutral ground where the two giants have fought away from their home base. Amazon will always have an upper hand in U.S. and Alibaba will have an edge in China. However, it is also important to see how these two companies perform in regions where neither has a home team advantage.Both the giants are planting the seeds for a future expansion in Europe. This would be another neutral ground. The winner in South Asia and Southeast Asia should get a significant confidence boost to invest aggressively in Europe to replicate its success.Investor TakeawayEventually, it will come down to the business model and execution. Amazon’s bottom-up approach of building its operations has taken a long time and can face regulatory hurdles due to lack of partnerships with local players.Currently, Amazon has a minor lead in India and Alibaba has a lead in Southeast Asia.In another 18-24 months, we should see one of these two giants cementing their position in South Asia and Southeast Asia.There is a very high probability that Alibaba will come out on top, which can also boost the bullish sentiment for its stock. I have a “strong buy” rating for Alibaba.More From InvestorPlace  8 Semiconductor Stocks Powering Down    7 Trucking Stocks to Buy as Retail Markets Shift Into Higher Gear    7 Dividend Stocks to Buy Amid This Tough Market Environment    5 Stocks That Could Be the Next Amazon   Compare Brokers The post Alibaba Is Quietly Undermining Amazon’s Influence appeared first on InvestorPlace.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

Gangemi buys books and watches TV series on Amazon, but it bothers her when she needs to pay extra for certain programs, not to mention Amazon delivery service isn’t great in the rural area where she lives. Amazon Prime’s price hike comes after blockbuster first-quarter earnings results, which sent the stock (AMZN) soaring to record highs. The increase will take effect for new users in May and apply to existing members in June. For the lucky subscribers whose membership expires in May, they can still enjoy the old $99 price for one final year. While Wall Street sees the move as a positive, the $20 increase has become a deal breaker for many current Prime members who are now rethinking renewals. According to a recent Yahoo Finance survey, among almost 7,000 current Prime members, 45% said they will discontinue their membership once the price goes up to $119 a year. Twenty percent were unsure. For those who are willing to pay more, the vast majority cite “fast and free delivery” as the top reason for staying. A recent poll from DealNews, a comparison shopping website, revealed similar results: Almost half of Prime users surveyed said they won’t pay the new price. Respondents to the Yahoo Finance survey said they just don’t shop enough on Amazon or they don’t use perks like Prime video often enough to justify the higher upfront cost. Some even said they would turn to other retailers like Walmart (WMT)  to find competitive prices and services after dropping Prime.  Easier said than done45% of Amazon Prime users surveyed say they will discontinue the service when the price goes up. (Yahoo Finance Survey)MoreBut the actual membership dropout rate could be much lower than the initial survey results show, according to Lindsay Sakraida, director of content marketing at DealNews. She said emotions and psychology come into play in people’s responses. Amazon’s Prime membership price increase came one week after the e-commerce giant announced they have 100 million Prime members globally. The company’s first quarter 2018 earnings also beat analysts’ expectations, sending Amazon stock soaring to nearly $1,600 per share. “Some feel it’s greedy for Amazon to increase the price. There is a perception that they’re doing very well and they don’t need to do that to take advantage of people,” said Sakraida. Crossing the $100 threshold also pushes people to re-evaluate their expenses. For some people, they may adjust and opt for a monthly Prime membership, which was also increased to $12.99 from $10.99 earlier this year. Sakraida said people may take a closer look at the monthly option especially during major shopping holidays like Black Friday and Prime Day. “If they quit, they can always subscribe again for a shorter period of time if they need it,” she said.Wall Street isn’t worriedAmazon announces the first price increase for Amazon Prime on a wildly successful earnings call. (TechCrunch)MoreAnalysts are bullish on the Amazon Prime price jump. In a note last week, Goldman Sachs said the price increase could add $1.5 billion of incremental gross profit in 2019 and help Amazon offset potential higher shipping costs from USPS. “The strength and stickiness of these businesses (high consumer value proposition) enable Amazon to continue investing to deepen its competitive moat and expanding its addressable market,” analysts wrote in the note.Story continuesWhile Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData, expects some people to drop Prime, he believes it’s unlikely that Amazon’s overall Prime subscriber base will decline. “The increase in fees will boost Amazon’s overall revenue from Prime subscriptions. This will be immediately beneficial to both the top and bottom lines,” he told Yahoo Finance. It’s common for subscription service providers to use a lower price to get customers to sign up and then gradually raise the cost. Even at $119, Saunders said the higher price doesn’t cover all the benefits consumers get from a Prime membership. “There is definitely future scope for further membership-fee increases,” he said.Krystal Hu covers technology and economy for Yahoo Finance.

Alphabet earnings: What to expect [Video]YahooSearchNo matching results for ''Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsGive feedback on the new search experienceCancelSign inMailFinanceWatchlistsMy PortfolioScreenersMarketsIndustriesVideosNewsPersonal FinanceTechU.S. Markets closedS&P 5002,905.03+4.58(+0.16%)Dow 3026,559.54+110.00(+0.42%)Nasdaq7,998.06+1.98(+0.02%)Russell 20001,565.75-1.85(-0.12%)Crude Oil64.000.00(0.00%)Gold1,277.90+1.90(+0.15%)Silver14.97+0.01(+0.07%)EUR/USD1.12470.0000(-0.0000%)ReblogShareTweetShareAlphabet earnings: What to expectJP MangalindanChief Tech CorrespondentYahoo FinanceJuly 22, 2018All eyes on Wall Street will be looking to Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) on Monday when the Mountain View, California-based tech giant reports second-quarter earnings after the markets close. Heather Bellini, a Goldman Sachs analyst, estimates earnings per share of $2.23 from Alphabet on revenues of $32.1 billion. Bellini’s is one of the few updated estimates that factors in the record-setting $5.1 billion fine from EU antitrust regulators, who ruled on Wednesday that Google had abused its dominance by forcing device makers to install its search engine and Chrome browser on Android devices. Google, for its part, has said it plans to appeal the ruling.A drop in the bucket for AlphabetIf the penalty ultimately stands, it’s a relatively small amount for Alphabet, which had $102.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities stashed away as of March.  UBS analyst Eric Sheridan does not expect the ruling, which imposes several restrictions on pre-installed Google apps, to significantly slow or deter the download and usage of many Google apps. Alphabet is set to announce second-quarter earnings on Monday after the markets close. Source: Getty ImagesMore“In the Apple App Store, Google has 9 of the top 50 apps, despite no relationship with the underlying OS,” Sheridan pointed in a report out on Wednesday. With that in mind, analysts will be looking closely at how Google executives address the penalty on its second-quarter earnings call, given CEO Sundar Pichai’s recent blog post cautioning the decision will “upset the careful balance” Google has struck with its popular Android OS. Pichai’s broad language sparked conversations among tech pundits and analysts that changes could be coming for device makers, third-party app makers and even possibly consumers.Watch out for AmazonAlso worth a look: Google’s stance on the competitive front. In a note published on Friday, Piper Jaffray Senior Research Analyst Michael Olson wrote that he foresees strong, continued growth with Google’s so-called bread and butter — ads via search — but also pointed out Amazon as a growing competitor to watch. Story continuesIn more recent years, Amazon (AMZN) has become more aggressive in building out its ads business, which generated nearly $2 billion in ad revenues during the first quarter — up 139% year-over-year. That remains a small amount versus Google’s own advertising-generated revenues, which amounted to $26.6 billion during the company’s own first quarter. But Amazon’s ad business is currently growing at a faster clip, fueled by aggressive sales efforts and the company’s vast troves of retail data. “From a competitive standpoint, all eyes should be on Amazon as its product search impacts the use case of Google search due to advances in Amazon’s ad business, and as Alexa becomes a gateway to information, but there is room for Google search revenue to continue to grow, especially for intangible products/services that do not lend themselves as readily to ‘Amazonification’ (e.g. insurance),” Olson wrote.

In the last several years, Amazon has expanded its efforts so employees with artistic streaks have more creative outlets to let loose, including the Amazon Symphony and the a cappella group Vocally Self-Critical — a riff off of Amazon’s now retired 10th principle of the same name. “About this time last year, one of our oboists looked through our employee directory and looked through people’s interests, particularly in classical musical instruments, and he just sent out this massive email, asking ‘Hey, who wants to start an orchestra?’” recalls Beau Curran, a technical account manager on Amazon’s digital music operations team and an oboist in the Amazon Symphony. “The first day of rehearsal, we were really wondering whether we’d just end up with a saxophonist and a keyboardist, and that would be our orchestra.” The 80-person Amazon Symphony performed a winter concert at the Seattle tech giant’s headquarters in early December. Source: Yahoo FinanceMoreTo Curran and Amazon Symphony conductor Fred Clarke’s surprise, about 200 employees expressed interest in the group, with 80 instrumentalists now rehearsing weekly on-campus and performing at least twice a year. The company, for its part, contributes a budget sponsored by Amazon business teams, as well as rehearsal and performance space. It also opened up its large employee meeting center on-campus for the groups to perform their winter concert. The joint performance drew over 500 people and raised more than $18,000 in donations and ticket sales for Mary’s Place, a nonprofit that operates a shelter for homeless families in a building at Amazon’s Seattle headquarters. Alexander Simms, an Amazon software engineer, joined the company in 2016 after his three-month internship at the company ended, in part because the company had an a cappella group. (Yes, really.) “At the end of that internship, I actually heard that Amazon had an a cappella group called Vocally Self-Critical, which is a great pun that nobody gets anymore,” explains Simms, referring to the now defunct Amazon principle, which was folded into another leadership principle, Earn Trust. “It definitely influenced my coming back.”“Amazon’s culture allows you to be creative in and outside of your job role, and that’s something I really enjoy,” says Alex Rogers, a marketing program manager at Amazon. Source: Yahoo FinanceMoreAlexandra Rogers, head of global customer insights and strategy for Amazon Prime Now and a member of Vocally Self-Critical, expressed a similar sentiment.“It’s amazing to be involved in Vocally Self-Critical and get to spend the day working on data and creatively putting it together and synthesizing insights and then get to come sing,” Rogers says. “Amazon’s culture allows you to be creative in and outside of your job role, and that’s something I really enjoy.” The Amazon Symphony and Vocally Self-Critical follow other efforts by Amazon over the years, including the Expressions program. The five-year-old program is focused on employee programming and team-building projects that let Amazonians express themselves in different ways, from crochet night to a snow globe-making classes. Two years ago, Amazon opened the Expressions Lab — a facility dedicated to those classes and projects — now peppered with workshop tables, paint canvases, computers and 3-D printers. It also rolled out (literally) an Expressions cart, which gets wheeled around Amazon’s Seattle headquarters at least three times a week so employees anywhere around campus can briefly take part in activities.Story continuesTwo years ago, Amazon opened the Expressions Lab — a facility dedicated to those classes and projects — now peppered with workshop tables, paint canvases, computers and 3-D printers. Source: Yahoo FinanceMoreFor those hard-working Amazonians, such opportunities may prove short but welcome diversions. As recently as 2015, the company was criticized for some tough working conditions at its corporate headquarters and fulfillment centers. Since then, the company has offered more employee programs and more flexible work arrangements, like 30-hour salaried work weeks for some teams.Which is not to say working at Amazon still isn’t tough, but now there are more options and outlets for employees to take advantage of to make working at Amazon work for them.Click here to read more about why Yahoo Finance chose Amazon as its company of the year and here to learn more about Amazon’s plans for Alexa.

Although PillPack expects sales to exceed only about $100 million this year, Amazon's huge customer base and existing shipping infrastructure could allow the company to scale up quickly.Amazon could also negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies, giving them the ability to offer cheap generic drugs even to customers without health insurance, according to industry experts. But it will face deeply entrenched competition dominated by pharmacies run by CVS Health, Walgreen Boots Alliance and Walmart Inc, and pharmacy benefits provided by CVS, Express Scripts UnitedHealth Group."Amazon's acquisition of PillPack is a warning shot in what is about to become a major battle within the pharmacy space," said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail.The value of the deal was not disclosed. Bloomberg reported it to be $1 billion, citing a person familiar with the matter.Pharmacy chains and drug wholesalers lost about $14 billion in market value on Thursday, while Amazon gained about $5.5 billion.Shares of CVS closed down 6.1 percent, while Walgreen fell 10 percent. Shares of drug wholesalers McKesson Corp, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen all fell.JOINT VENTUREThe news comes just a week after a joint venture of Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co named a CEO who will be tasked with significantly cutting healthcare costs for its estimated 1 million employees and dependents.Although brick-and-mortar stores might feel the effects of Amazon's competition, the biggest battles will likely be fought by mail-order pharmacies, which generally serve patients with chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease that may require drugs to control blood pressure, cholesterol and other problems.PillPack said it has tens of thousands of customers across the country. But its expectation of over $100 million in 2018 revenue pales compared with larger rivals. CVS last year had about $45.7 billion in revenue from its mail order pharmacy business, accounting for about 15 percent of its pharmacy claims.Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) negotiate prescription drug pricing for employers and health plans and run large mail-order pharmacies, offering incentives to patients to fill prescriptions with them.Doctors and PBMs have long said patients not properly taking their medicines is one of the main causes of increased healthcare costs, leading to hospitalizations and more severe health issues. Companies like PillPack and Express Scripts that offer care management services to improve patient compliance are seen as increasingly important in helping control rising costs.With Amazon's announcement Mizuho analyst Ann Hynes, in a note, said pending health insurer/PBM mergers of Aetna Inc with CVS and Cigna Corp with Express Scripts "are even more critical now."NOT WORRIEDWalgreen CEO Stefano Pessina, on a conference call after reporting quarterly results, said he was "not particularly worried" about the PillPack deal."The pharmacy world is much more complex than just delivering certain pills or certain packages," Pessina said.That said, Pessina added, "We know that we have to change the level of our services to the customers, and we are working quite hard on that direction."Some analysts played down the immediate threat."I believe they bought this to learn about the market and to determine if they are able to make larger investments," said Morningstar analyst Vishnu Lekraj.Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Steven Halper noted that PBMs typically require health plan members to use their own mail order pharmacies.Story continuesHe said PillPack could be kicked out of current PBM networks, "especially if Amazon has designs of significantly ramping its prescription volume."Express Scripts dropped PillPack from its network in April 2016, alleging that it had misrepresented itself as a retail pharmacy. The two reached an agreement a month later.PillPack holds pharmacy licenses in all 50 states. It is an in-network pharmacy for some PBMs and for major Medicare Part D plans, a federal drug benefit to help Medicare beneficiaries pay for self-administered prescription medicines.PillPack had attracted interest from Walmart Inc, which was looking to buy it for less than $1 billion, CNBC reported in April.

One way it plans to do that is by introducing the ability for Alexa to translate languages in a more sophisticated manner, beyond the basic words and short phrases it can already translate in different languages including Spanish, German, French and Italian. Amazon wants to turn Alexa into a multilingual assistant who can help in almost any situation. Amazon did not comment immediately.For instance,  if a person from the U.S., who only speaks English, attends a wedding in Tokyo and doesn’t speak Japanese, Alexa would be able to help that person hold a conversation in Japanese. Alexa would have an understanding of the Japanese culture, which is generally more formal and conservative than American culture and would incorporate its knowledge into translations. For example, asking the virtual assistant, “Alexa, what do I say to the father of the bride at a wedding in Japan?” would solicit a different response and tone from Alexa than if you asked the assistant ”What do I say to the master of ceremonies at a wedding in Japan?” The understanding being that remarks you make to the father of the bride would be more formal and reverential than to the wedding’s master of ceremony.In another scenario, Alexa could help a traveler entering a restaurant for the first time in India with the question, “Alexa, I just entered a restaurant in New Delhi. Who should I talk to and what do I say to get a table?” “The cross-culture, cross-language piece is going to be big for Amazon and Alexa, and it has a lot of potential,” one source familiar with the matter told Yahoo Finance.Big ambitions for AlexaSources also told Yahoo Finance that Amazon would like to get Alexa to a point where it’s translating languages for users through any device on-the-fly. In other words, Alexa could one day translate what the father of the bride at that wedding in Japan says into your native language as he’s speaking in real-time. Alexa would also one day be able to translate conversations with multiple people speaking in different languages at one setting. Such a move makes sense for Alexa, which Amazon has long said would evolve into a versatile “Star Trek”-like super computer that accomplishes virtually anything you throw at it with a simple voice command. (It should be noted that one of the “Star Trek” super computer’s most compelling features across the numerous TV series included the ability to translate virtually any language in real-time.)“To truly realize that vision, you’ll want a number of things: you’ll want to have it everywhere, be able to talk to it from anywhere, be able for it to do all of the things you would want an intelligent assistant do for you, and ultimately do it in a very conversational way,” Amazon Vice President of Alexa Al Lindsay told Yahoo Finance during an onstage interview last November.Amazon is already well on its way to making that vision a reality. Tens of millions of Alexa-enabled devices have been sold since the first Echo speaker went on sale in 2014, and according to eMarketer, Amazon Echo will account for 67.9% of the voice-enabled speaker market in 2018.Race to translate languagesIf and when Amazon eventually rolls out such language-translation features, Alexa will enter an area that companies like Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Samsung have tackled with mixed results. In October, Google initially made waves when it claimed its Google Pixel Buds, with the help of Google Assistant, could translate up to 40 languages spoken in real-time, but the actual execution proved lacking. Samsung’s Bixby assistant, fares somewhat better: it uses augmented reality to translate text from more than 100 languages in real-time, but it doesn’t translate actual conversations yet.

The point of having access to multiple Alexa voices is so developers can build skills (apps) in which users interact with a variety of voices instead of just one.For instance, if coders were to create interactive audio stories for Alexa, they could use the new voices to represent different characters, Amazon said.The new Alexa voices are part of the company's Polly service, which developers use to build skills (apps) for Alexa that can recognize text and convert it to a voice that can beam out of an Alexa-powered device like the Amazon Echo smart speaker.Amazon said that developers who are accepted to test the voices will be able to use them for free, but that will likely change when the voices are available to the general public to be used outside of a preview.It should be noted that developers can already add multiple voices to their skills, but it's a more complex process that involves recording a voice as an audio file.Amazon currently has a number of different voices with different dialects and accents developers can currently bundle into their skills, according to the company's website.Some of the voices include: Ivy, a female voice that speaks in mannerisms akin to U.S. English speakers; Hans, a male voice that speaks in German; and Naja, a female voice that speaks Danish. It’s unclear when developers will be able to embed eight non-U.S. English speaking voices into their skills.Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter.Last week, unveiled at its annual developer conference six new voices for the company's competing Google Assistant, including a forthcoming voice that's based on audio recordings from musician John Legend. See original article on Fortune.comMore from Fortune.comApple CEO Tim Cook Says Apple Music Has Over 50 Million UsersAmazon Is Getting Closer to Picking a Site for HQ2Amazon Echo Dot Kids Edition Review: Fun for the Whole FamilyAmazon Prime Members Are Getting New Discounts at Whole FoodsAmazon and Fidelity Labs Collaborated on a Virtual Reality Financial AgentReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceNatural Gas Price Prediction – Prices Tumble as Supplies IncreaseFX EmpireSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolCrude Oil Weekly Price Forecast – Crude oil running into resistanceFX Empire'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloomberg5 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy in 2019Motley Fool

Amazon is accused of illegally poaching sellers to its marketplace through eBay's internal messaging system, according to the Wall Street Journal. Amazon and eBay are head to head competitors when it comes to both sellers and consumers. Amazon focuses more on its buyers and invites them to check the website and make purchases based on their own needs. Whereas, eBay relies on its sellers to make a profit through their sales on eBay’s marketplace.With its quarterly report coming out soon, will this incident make any difference to how investors view Amazon?Let’s list out the different accusations eBay set out in the lawsuit against Amazon and see if they will have any impact on the company.1.       EBay accused Amazon of having perpetrated a scheme over the years to infiltrate and get all of the information on eBay's internal member email system.2.       The scheme is so widespread that it: involves Amazon representatives spanning over many different countries, all targeting eBay employees.3.       The accounts that were used to send messages came from devices linked to Amazon IP addresses, as the scheme was coordinated through Amazon's headquarters.4.        Amazon intentionally interfered with contractual and economic relations. They also committed fraud and violation of the California penal and business professions codes.These are only some of the main points and it seems as though eBay had a lot more to say in relation to their competitor. Currently, Amazon has not said anything in response to this situation, but note that it is investigating the claim. Both companies’ shares were down through afternoon trading Thursday. However, does all of this really make any difference to Amazon in the long run?  We are aware that Amazon dominates the e-commerce space day by day. According to the Wall Street Journal, roughly 50% of U.S. online sales come from Amazon. It is certain that no matter what there will be rivalry and competition between companies within the same industry. EBay has made efforts throughout the years to catch up to Amazon with an easier to navigate website and selling 80% new products.Plus, Amazon has faced many lawsuits in different areas over the years, so it is no surprise the company has not said anything yet as they are aware of how to handle these situations. Yes, it is deteriorating to a company to face a lawsuit and all of these accusations which may or may not be true in the short-run. However, if we look at this from a long-term perspective, the most Amazon will have to do is settle for monetary relief and, as stated in the lawsuit, permanently stop misusing eBay’s messaging system. Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

It's a far sunnier report than one quarter ago, when the company missed on revenue. Amazon (AMZN) stock surged more than 11% in after-hours trading thanks to the earnings, and was still surging at the time of writing. This was Amazon's fourth-straight profitable quarter.Revenue came in at $29.1 billion, up 28% from last year and beating expectations of $27.99 billion; earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.07, way above expectations of 58 cents. And revenue for Amazon Web Services (AWS) came to $2.57 billion, edging out estimates of $2.53 billion.It is the latter figure that's most compelling. Amazon is crushing it in cloud-computing. AWS provides storage services to General Electric (GE), Netflix (NFLX), Instagram (FB) and Spotify, to name just a few of the major players that pay to use it. AWS revenue is up 64% from the first quarter of last year, and its operating income is up 170%. That is staggering.AWS is also a profit machine: It accounted for 56% of the company's profit this quarter and is the most profitable business at Amazon. As analyst Jan Dawson pointed out on Twitter, AWS generated more operating income in the quarter than Amazon's entire U.S. e-commerce business, with less than one eighth the revenue.In a story last year, The Atlantic called AWS "the piece of infrastructure that has enabled the current tech boom." It looked like hyperbole, but less so now. It has a murderer's row of clients, and those clients are willing to pay up to use it.There were other highlights in Amazon's earnings: International sales hit $9.57 billion for the quarter, a rise of 23% from $7.75 billion one year ago, showing huge growth outside the U.S. (That being said, its international division is still not profitable.) And the company had some bragging to do about its own devices: On its earnings call, Amazon said its own devices are the best-selling hardware items on Amazon. It sold twice as many Kindle Fire tablets as it did in the first quarter of last year, and CEO Jeff Bezos pointed to Fire sales as a big contributor to overall sales growth, though Amazon does not break out earnings for its hardware.In its shareholder letter, Amazon mentions that Amazon Studios, "acquired the rights to several high-profile films" and names the seven films, which include one directed by Woody Allen. After each movie finishes its run in theatres, each "will become available exclusively to Prime members through Prime Video." This simple statement of fact is a reminder that Amazon is eager to compete with Netflix, HBO and Hulu in the original-content streaming game.Finally, on a personal wealth note, the earnings were especially nice for Bezos, whose net worth jumped by more than $6 billion.--Daniel Roberts is a writer at Yahoo Finance, covering sports business and technology.Read more:Facebook flies after pulverizing earnings expectationsTwitter's earnings can't stop disappointing investorsFor Netflix earnings, better-than-expected isn't good enoughReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchEasy Come, Easy Go: How Carrizo Oil & Gas (NASDAQ:CRZO) Shareholders Got Unlucky And Saw 78% Of Their Cash EvaporateSimply Wall St.Investors Who Bought Toro (NYSE:TTC) Shares Five Years Ago Are Now Up 133%Simply Wall St.Do You Like The Travelers Companies, Inc.

Bezos, however, gave no hints about HQ2's location on Thursday.For the city that ends up as Amazon's home away from home, its housing market is likely to be transformed by the tech giant's presence, and not necessarily for the better. Seattle, Amazon's current base of operations, has seen a rapid increase in average prices of rentals and homes driven in part by an influx of workers, and critics say it has contributed to gentrification there.Amazon also opposed a so-called head tax, which was initially approved by Seattle's city council earlier this year and would have introduced an annual corporate tax of roughly $275 for each full-time employee. The tax was intended to raise funds to help fight homelessness in the city, where Amazon is one of the biggest employers. But city officials blocked the tax in June, and many viewed Amazon as having got its way after signaling that it could take its business elsewhere.NOW WATCH: An environmental group is testing giant floating pipes to clean up oceansSee Also:Jeff Bezos is the richest man in modern history — here's how he spends on philanthropyJeff Bezos is launching a $2 billion fund to support homeless families and education using Amazon's methodsAmazon HQ2 might be headed to Washington, DC, so we asked local startups what they thought about the move — here's what they saidSEE ALSO: Insiders are buzzing that northern Virginia could soon be awarded Amazon's HQ2 as Jeff Bezos makes a high-profile visit to Washington, DCReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextMueller, National Enquirer, Venmo Credit Cards: CEO Daily for April 19, 2019FortuneZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolState defends South Dakota pipeline protest legislationAssociated PressSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphIn Ukrainian candidate's hometown, a cry for changeAssociated Press'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergButina Shouldn't Serve Any More Time in Prison, Her Lawyers SayBloombergAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo Finance3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceInvesting in General Electric Is All About These 3 Key ThingsMotley FoolMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceCardinal Timothy Dolan on the Catholic ChurchWSJRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

Amazon’s new Hub offers apartment tenants a locker for packages. (Amazon)MoreAn urban living situation without lobby personnel presents a significant problem for people who are not home during the day to accept packages. For Amazon, a one-stop dropoff for packages also represents potential cost savings.While this is the first time Amazon has ever commented on the Hub, over 500,000 residents across the country already use these systems, according to the company.Amazon is marketing this to landlords as a modern amenity, addressing the frustrating problems of packages blocking lobbies and hours of building personnel dealing with the sorting and storage of packages. For tenants, it also adding a layer of convenience.Residents of a building with a Hub get a notification when a package has arrived, with a code to open the locker the package is in. (Amazon)More“Building on Amazon’s expertise in locker solutions, the Hub addresses frustrations from property owners, carriers and residents concerning package delivery,” Patrick Supanc, director, Amazon Worldwide Lockers and Pickup, said in a press release. “It offers a single, convenient location for package drop-off and gives property managers time and resources back to focus on other priorities.”According to Amazon, property companies AvalonBay, Fairfield Residential, Pinnacle, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, WinnResidential, and Equity Residential have all participated in the program thus far.The company also told Yahoo Finance that more and more hubs are installed each month.A 2017 Wall Street Journal article, reporting on the early stages, noted that the system does not solve the problem for oversized packages that cannot fit in the lockers. The article also noted that the Hub costs between $10,000 and $20,000 to install with no monthly fee. Amazon declined to comment on cost.Amazon has long experimented with various solutions to the urban last mile, from special lockers where a person can collect a package, up-to-the-block package tracking, a special front-door lock system, and providing customers with photographs of packages discreetly left by carriers.—Ethan Wolff-Mann is a writer at Yahoo Finance.

It's now clear why.Amazon is reportedly testing its own ad product that will show display ads on other publishers' websites to draw consumers back to Amazon. The e-commerce giant previously purchased product listing ads from the Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary on behalf of its advertising customers. Now, it'll sell these new ads directly to advertisers instead of acting as an intermediary with Google.That's a major step for Amazon's ad business, which management described as "a multi-billion-dollar program and growing very quickly," on the company's recent earnings call.During that discussion, one analyst called into question Amazon's ability to increase its ad load, or the number of ads shoppers see, without hurting the customer experience. Amazon's solution? Expand beyond Amazon.com.Closeup of hands typing on a laptop computer.MoreImage source: Getty Images.A massive opportunityLast year, Google generated $17.6 billion in gross ad revenue from its network members. That revenue come from sites or apps using Google's AdSense or AdMob products, with which Google shares its ad revenue. Google paid out a whopping $12.6 billion, but still kept nearly $5 billion in net revenue for itself. For reference, that's bigger than Amazon's entire ad business last year.And that revenue from network members is extremely high-margin. Google simply provides the tools for publishers to display AdSense ads on their sites or AdMob ads on their mobile apps, but it doesn't have to maintain the sites or apps like it does with its owned and operated properties.Amazon could quickly start taking share of the digital display ad market with its new ad product. The company's ads will show web browsers items in which they've previously expressed interest, but didn't purchase, which can produce high conversion rates.Additionally, Amazon has developed a technology for website publishers called a header bidding wrapper to help them maximize the value of their ad inventory by collecting bids from multiple suppliers. It's allowed smaller supply-side platforms to compete with Google in recent years. As such, Google has seen the growth in network members revenue slow while its revenue share increased.Winning twiceAmazon may be able to offer better incentives to both advertisers and web publishers for using its ad products because it has the opportunity to win twice with these ads. The first is just the same as Google: When someone clicks on the ad, Amazon gets paid.But that ad will take web browsers to Amazon's marketplace, where they can purchase the advertised item as well as pretty much anything else you can think of. Whenever someone purchases an item on Amazon, Amazon wins again -- even for third-party merchants.Amazon collects certain fees from its third-party merchants for services like Fulfillment by Amazon or just a simple product-listing fee. Last quarter, third-party seller services revenue increased 39% year over year on a constant currency basis. Third-party sales are an increasingly significant part of Amazon's total revenue.Google has far fewer opportunities to win twice like Amazon can with its advertisements. That puts it at a potential disadvantage when it comes to how much revenue it can share with network members or what kind of pricing it can offer publishers. Amazon, on the other hand, has lots of levers it can pull to take share of the third-party display ad market quickly and keep ramping up its ad business by stepping outside of Amazon.com.

Founded in 2000, the company aims to take private consumers to space.MoreBlue Origin is a privately funded aerospace manufacturer and spaceflight service company based in Kent, Washington, and is the brainchild of Amazon AMZN CEO Jeff Bezos. Founded in 2000, the company aims to take private consumers to space.Blue Origin made headlines earlier this week when it performed a successful high-altitude emergency abort test. The company launched its “New Shepard” rocket and capsule to a record-high altitude, and then simulated a catastrophic failure in the escape pod’s motor. The motor is located at the bottom of the crew capsule and is meant to quickly lift it away from the rocket in the event of an emergency. Even after igniting the engine at record altitudes, both the capsule and rocket were able to land and be recovered safely.Out of this World Bezos, who was named Time magazine’s “Person of the Year” in 1999, turned his attention to space the following year when he quietly founded Blue Origin.Blue Origin came under fire in 2011 when it reported a failure in its suborbital rocket, which went out of control and had to be destroyed. Still, Bezos and his team continued to work hard, and each of the nearly dozen tests that have taken place since then have been successful.Until Blue Origin relaunched New Shepard, no space rocket had ever been used twice. It marked what could historically be remembered as a key turning point in space exploration. For Bezos, it was the ultimate sign that his dream of lowering the cost of access to space is on the right track. Today, it remains an expensive endeavor, which Bezos reportedly funds by annually liquidating $1 billion in Amazon assets.A growing amount of people believe in Bezos’ dream as well. NASA first gave the company $3.9 million in funding in 2009 and then $22 million in 2011. Since then, NASA has continued to provide it with support. The company is also currently in the running to receive military funding from the U.S. Air Force for support of new orbital-class rockets. Its proposal puts it up against Orbital ATK, United Launch Alliance, and Tesla TSLA founder Elon Musk’s SpaceX. The contract is expected to be announced in late 2019.   A 21st Century Space Race?Space exploration was initially a government-only venture. But the turn of the 21st century has given rise to multiple public and privately-owned firms which seek to bring regular citizens to the great beyond.On the public side, large firms such as Boeing BA and Lockheed Martin LMT already have exposure to space-related ventures and are investing to expand their offerings. Boeing collaborated to help create the International Space Station, which saw its first component launched into orbit 20 years ago — ISS is expected to operate for another decade. These firms also invest in GPS technology, satellites, and other space-related technology. Meanwhile, European power Airbus EADSY is developing the Gaia scope, a billion-pixel camera that the company hopes will allow it to create a detailed 3-D map of the Milky Way.Other players in the burgeoning industry include Virgin Galactic, Rocket Lab, Made in Space, and Orbex. In Britain, Orbex raised $40 million in funding and plans to develop a launch vehicle using a government-backed spaceport that will be built in Northern Scotland with the help of Lockheed Martin. Virgin also plans to launch from the UK, and like Blue Origin, hopes to take customers into space.It would be incorrect to assume that space-related activity is only taking place in America and Europe. Ten private rocket companies have formed in just the last three years, according to the China Global Television Network. Russia’s space program has fallen on hard times due to budget restrictions, meaning that it will not be as active as it was during the first space race. Regardless, the 21st century iteration of the race appears to have already begun.Looking Forward“The first trillionaire there will be is the person who exploits the natural resources on asteroids,” astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson said three years ago on NBC. He went on to say that “there’s this vast universe of limitless energy and limitless resources.”There is no timeline yet for any of these seemingly sci-fi endeavors. But in the meantime, investors can take a look at the companies currently helping advance the field.Story continuesWill You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

The launch shows how eager the biggest enterprise players are to get ahead in the blockchain game even if their customers are still trying to pinpoint exactly what blockchain can do for them (and some investors are starting to temper their initial excitement).In a blog post about how to use Blockchain Templates, AWS vice president and chief evangelist Jeff Barr acknowledged the lack of clarity by referencing a 1970s “Saturday Night Live” sketch about (http://snltranscripts.jt.org/75/75ishimmer.phtml)Shimmer Floor Wax, a floor polish that is also a non-dairy dessert topping.“Some of the people that I talk to see blockchains as the foundation of a new monetary system and a way to faciliate international payments. Others see blockchains as a distributed ledger and immutable data source that can be applied to logistics, supply chain, land registration, crowdfunding and other use cases,” he wrote. “Either way, it’s clear that there are a lot of intriguing possibilities and we are working to help our customers use this technology more effectively.AWS Blockchain Templates give AWS users working on blockchain apps a faster way to set up Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric networks. Its launch comes six months after Oracle unveiled a new cloud service built on the open-source Hyperledger Fabric project during Oracle OpenWorld and about a year after IBM announced its own Hyperledger-based blockchain-as-a-service offering.Another new competitor in the BaaS market is Huawei, which announced its Blockchain Service, also built on Hyperledger, last week during its analyst conference in Shenzhen.

Despite explosive top-line growth, Amazon has consistently shown little-to-no GAAP profits in its core e-commerce business.One of the biggest drivers of sales growth has been Prime, Amazon's $99 per year (or $12.99 per month) subscription service. Started back in 2005, Prime offers a suite of intriguing benefits, most notably free two-day shipping for an unlimited number of items.Today, it seems increasingly clear that this was a farsighted and ingenious invention. As Prime has grown, Amazon has added benefits, spurring increased membership in a virtuous cycle. Now Prime is so large, it's causing problems even at Amazon's largest (and well-run) competitors: Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and Latin American e-commerce platform MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI). Amazon is competing hard against Walmart in the United States, but recent rumors suggest it's eyeing Latin America, specifically Brazil, potentially threatening MercadoLibre's leading position there. How are both companies trying to fend off the Amazon machine? With free two-day shipping, of course.a roll of hundred dollar bills at the end of a mousetrap.MoreImage source: Getty Images.Prime's progressThe bet on Prime may have seemed crazy at the time it was launched in 2005. Analysts often cited the fact that Amazon lost significant amounts of money on every Prime member due to shipping costs. But since then, Prime's annual price has increased from $79 to $99, and the service is now estimated to have between 65 million and 80 million members (Amazon does not disclose these figures). Those members contributed $3.2 billion in subscription revenue for Amazon, or just under 10% of sales, in the recent quarter. Consumer Research Intelligence Partners estimates that Prime members spend roughly $1,300 per year with Amazon, versus $700 for non-Prime members. That has, in turn, bolstered Amazon's third-party fulfillment business, which has higher margins.   Amazon's stock has rocketed in recent years as Prime has grown, winning over legions of loyal customers. It is only now, more than a decade after Prime launched, that competitors are biting the bullet to invest in free shipping.MercadoLibre claws aheadMercadoLibre rolled out free shipping in Mexico in 2016, then added it in Brazil in August 2017. Perhaps not coincidentally, that change came not long before rumors that Amazon was looking hard at the Brazilian market.The introduction of free shipping has been a huge positive for MercadoLibre's sales and gross market value (GMV), which grew a huge 70.5% and 66.5%, respectively, over the past year.But the company's margins tell a different story. Gross margins shrank from 63.5% to 46.5%, and operating margins plummeted from 25.2% to 4.8% (stripping out the effect of Venezuela, which the company de-consolidated in December). The largest cost difference? Free shipping, of course. MercadoLibre still applies volume conditions on free shipping, which vary by country, so its offering is not yet unlimited. Larger volumes should also generate more revenue from its fulfillment and payment businesses, Mercado Envios and MercadoPago, which have made encouraging progress to the point that optimism around these businesses offset concerns about MercadoLibre's lower margins. Story continuesStill, the free-shipping initiative combined with investments in fulfillment centers caused management to suspend its dividend going forward.WalmartUnlike MercadoLibre, which is trying to stay one step ahead of Amazon, Walmart is actually playing catch-up in the mature U.S. market. Walmart began pivoting in earnest to becoming more of an e-commerce company in recent years, buying Jet.com in 2016, and even changing its official company name from Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. to Walmart, Inc. in December, highlighting the company's renewed focus on e-commerce.Walmart's transition incorporated -- you guessed it -- free two-day shipping. Initially, Walmart tried to build its own Prime-like subscription service called ShippingPass, for which it charged $49, but obviously, the endeavor wasn't working as the company scrapped the subscription service in January 2017 in favor of free two-day shipping on eligible items included in orders over $35. Trying to play catch-up while fending off a giantAmazon has built quite a powerhouse in its Prime service, and the company's long-term orientation and willingness to lose money for years has put the e-commerce giant in prime position (pun very much intended), even against its largest-scale rivals.

Amazon's new feature, which it launched last year, is now finally available to most (if not all) customers in the US, according to Android Police. It's not like any other tracking feature, which only gives you a vague idea of where your package is: this one actually allows you to monitor your driver.Business Insidersays you'll get access to live tracking when your driver only has fewer than 10 stops left before reaching your location. It shows you their estimated time of arrival and how many deliveries they have left before they arrive. Since you can see the driver's every movement, it raises concerns about security and privacy -- someone could order an item just to see which houses near them have gotten packages they could steal off porches. It sounds like a useful tool, however, if you're out of the house and want to make sure you're there to receive your package or that the driver truly made a stop at your place. Well played, @amazon Putting a live update of where my packages are so that I can obsessively check my deliveries and open your app more.

The theater chain would be a natural place to showcase Amazon's growing slate of original films and could present yet another opportunity to add benefits for Prime members.A group of people watching a movie at a theater.MoreImage source: Getty Images.How Amazon could shake up movie theatersPhysical theaters present a number of opportunities for Amazon.First and foremost, they give the company a place to screen its original films. Unlike Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), Amazon has given theaters a first-run window for its original films before they appear on its Prime streaming service. Still, many theaters prefer to show big studio blockbusters than the smaller films Amazon produces. Landmark is the perfect setting for its films, ensuring they reach as wide an audience as possible. As more people become aware of Prime's offerings, that opens the door for more people to become Prime members.For a similar reason, Netflix is also considering a bid for Landmark. Netflix still wants to release its films to theaters on the same day that it releases them on its streaming service, but Landmark could give Netflix the ability to make more of its films Oscar eligible. Films must appear in theaters for a certain amount of time to be eligible for Academy Awards, and an Oscar could increase awareness of Netflix's originals.Beyond having a place to showcase original films, Amazon could inject Prime membership perks into the movie theater experience. For example, Amazon could introduce Prime benefits for ticket pricing, an area that's already facing disruption.Subscription ticketing services have forced AMC (NYSE: AMC) to introduce Stubs A-List, a $20 per month subscription that allows customers to see up to three movies per week at any AMC theater. The service has been a hit, attracting more than 180,000 subscribers in just over a month. Amazon could introduce free or heavily discounted tickets for Prime members to compete with AMC or create a subscription package of its own.Amazon could also give steep discounts on concessions for Prime members. Concession sales are a huge moneymaker for theater chains. AMC sold $446 million in food and beverages last quarter at a cost of only $72 million. Amazon could cut those prices in half and still produce gross margins well above what investors are used to.Landmark already offers higher-end concessions at some of its theaters -- an area where AMC is also investing. Amazon could expand on Landmark's existing offerings with products from Whole Foods, creating a differentiated experience at theaters.Driving Prime subscribersThe company's push into the brick-and-mortar world has been largely focused on increasing Prime subscribers. It's made several moves with Whole Foods to encourage shoppers to sign up for Prime, like discounts, free delivery, and free grocery pickup at select locations. Landmark presents a similar opportunity to drive Prime membership.Prime is one of the pillars of Amazon's business. Its members are more loyal when it comes to online shopping, and the program allows Amazon to post industry-leading conversion rates from product search to checkout.Story continuesAmazon increased the price of Prime recently, and purchasing a movie theater might present an opportunity to justify the price hike by expanding member benefits. If AMC can attract 180,000 customers in just over a month with a $20 monthly movie subscription, Amazon should be able to drive quite a few new Prime members with movie theater perks.There are still several hurdles to overcome for Amazon to capture Landmark. Amazon is not the only bidder and there are long-standing regulations that could prevent the company, as a movie studio, from owning a theater. Still, the acquisition could be the next step toward an even bigger Amazon Prime empire.

Despite serious glitches at its start, Amazon announced this morning that Prime Day 2018 grew to become the biggest shopping event in its history, beating out Cyber Monday, Black Friday, and the previous Prime Day 2017. Of course, this year's Prime Day was longer - a full 36-hours, in fact. And while Amazon did make its comparisons to other sales holidays over the same period of time, it's not quite the same thing to compare a shorter sale to a longer one. (Last year's Prime Day was 30 hours, for example.)Still, it's a remarkable showing on Amazon's part. So much so that Amazon has taken the unusual step of actually providing some numbers around how much people bought. Though it still declines to talk sales dollars, as per usual, it did say that Prime members worldwide purchased over 100 million products, with small and medium-sized businesses on Amazon "far exceeding" $1 billion in sales this year.It was unclear, however, if Amazon was counting sales at Whole Foods - which did participate in Prime Day for the first time - when calculating this 100 million products sold figure, or its "best day ever" statements. We asked the company to clarify this, and confirmed that Whole Foods sales were not being included in those calculations.That said, Amazon says that Prime members "saved millions" at Whole Foods during Prime Day, where the top buy was organic strawberries.Prime Day 2018 was also the biggest event ever for Amazon devices, the retailer noted.This can be, in part, chalked up to the fact that Amazon put its device on sale 12 hours before Prime Day even began, which allowed people more time to buy them at the reduced prices.Its best-sellers worldwide included the Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote and the Echo Dot. The Dot was a top seller in 2017, too. It's the most affordable of the Alexa-powered speakers, and was this year marked down $20 to $29.99, making it a good deal. Fire TV devices, Kindle e-readers had their best day ever on Amazon globally on day one of Prime Day, July 16, 2018. Prime Day was also the biggest sales event for Echo Show and Echo Spot.Amazon didn't provide numbers for any of these sales, but said "millions" of Fire TV devices were sold worldwide.In the U.S., July 17 was the biggest day for smart home devices in history, with over a million devices sold, and Ring had its best day ever on July 16, with the Ring Video Doorbell Pro selling out. The Amazon Cloud Cam also became the best-selling security camera in Amazon history.Outside of Amazon devices, other U.S. top sellers included the Instant Pot and LifeStraw water filters. Members purchased more than 300,000 Instant Pot 6 Qt 7-in-1 Multi Use and 150,000 LifeStraw Personal Water Filters, the retailer said. Back-to-school items also did well, with millions of pencils and pens sold.Different countries had their own best-sellers, which tended to include smart home items, electronics, gaming systems, tools, and other items for the home.Among Amazon's own brands, top sellers included the Stone & Beam Ceramic Geometric Table Lamp; Presto! Ultra Soft Toilet Paper; Daily Ritual Women's Jersey Short-Sleeve V-Neck T-Shirt Dress and AmazonBasics Pre-Seasoned Cast Iron Skillet.The company said that a record number of Prime members shopped Prime Day in 2018, but this, too can be explained partly by expanded access to the sale - Prime Day went live in Australia, Singapore, the Netherlands and Luxembourg for the first time this year. In total, 17 countries had access to Prime Day sales.More importantly to Amazon's bottom line was the increase in Prime membership sign-ups. In the end, the actual sales are just icing on the cake - Prime Day's larger goal is increasing the number of subscribers for its now $119 per year Prime membership program. Turning online consumers into paying subscribers not only increases Amazon's subscription revenues, it boosts overall sales as those consumers begin to shop Amazon more often to take advantage of its free, 2-day shipping and other premium services - like Amazon Channels, audiobook subscriptions, on-demand music, and more.The retailer in April announced Prime had exceeded 100 million subscribers, and Amazon didn't update that number today.Story continuesIt's notable that Amazon Prime Day went well, given how badly it began - glitches caused shoppers to lose the ability to even see the deals or complete checkout at the beginning of the sale, potentially resulting in millions of lost sales.“Prime Day offers us a unique opportunity to thank Prime members with our best deals,” said Jeff Wilke, CEO Worldwide Consumer, Amazon, in a statement. “Extending Prime Day to a day and a half this year allowed us to further reward members with unbeatable deals, access to exclusive new products and unforgettable experiences that highlight the many benefits of a Prime membership. All of this was made possible because of our many valued associates – the global team that continues to make Prime Day bigger and better.” This article originally appeared on TechCrunch.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley Fool3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceInvesting in General Electric Is All About These 3 Key ThingsMotley FoolCardinal Timothy Dolan on the Catholic ChurchWSJ

In the U.S. alone, more than 1 billion items were shipped for free using Prime, Amazon said in a statement Wednesday.The U.S. was already headed into a blow-out Christmas shopping spree, as Americans are benefiting from higher employment and wages, fueling higher household cash flow. Consumers seemed to be merry despite a S&P 500 Index that has tumbled, a government shutdown that’s entering its fifth day and ongoing trade tensions with China.Amazon wasn’t the only one benefiting from an insatiable consumer appetite. Mastercard Inc. and Visa Inc. rebounded after four days of declines. Mastercard said holiday sales increased 5.1 percent to more than $850 billion this year, the strongest growth in the last six years. Online shopping saw gains of 19 percent compared with 2017, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse. Brick-and-mortar retailers also gained. Nike Inc., Macy’s Inc., Kohl’s Corp. and PVH Corp. were all higher mid-morning in New York.People bought “millions more” of Amazon’s own devices compared with last year, including the new Echo Dot speaker and the Fire TV Stick, the Seattle-based company said. At the same time, Amazon said more than 50 percent of items sold in its stores came from small and medium-sized businesses.Among the most popular items under the Christmas tree were the L.O.L. Surprise! Glam Glitter Series doll, Bose Corp. wireless headphones and clothes from Carhartt Inc. Other popular brands bought through Amazon’s Prime Wardrobe service, which allows consumers to fill a box with selected items and return anything that they don’t want, included PVH Corp.’s Calvin Klein, and Hanesbrands Inc.’s Champion.Amazon started the shopping frenzy out strong, with November’s Cyber Monday already pegged as the company’s biggest shopping day in history. Along with the Christmas sales report, the picture seems much brighter than Amazon had initially projected in its latest earnings results. In October, Amazon’s revenue and profit forecast for the holiday quarter fell short of analysts’ estimates, as investors worried about Amazon’s increased pace of spending.While Amazon has expanded into almost every area of retail, from pharmaceuticals to groceries, its more profitable units are cloud computing and advertising. Still, Amazon, which dominates e-commerce in the U.S., has relied on the growth of its Prime members, who pay $119 a year for the service. Recent estimates put subscribers at just under 100 million in the U.S. Amazon didn’t give any new numbers for Prime subscribers in its statement Wednesday, but said millions of unique items in the U.S. shipped with Prime.That kind of volume presents a challenge for logistics services like FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc. In 2013, a larger than expected surge in last-minute online shopping caught UPS off guard and forced it and Amazon and other retailers to offer refunds to customers who didn’t receive their orders on time for Christmas.This year, UPS said it expects to deliver an average of more than 31 million parcels a day during the holidays and anticipates a peak-season total of about 800 million packages to rise 5 percent compared with last year’s tally. To deal with the rush of deliveries, the company invested in automation and new facilities to add sorting capacity of 350,000 packages an hour to its U.S. system.“We’re so far pleased with the operational aspect of it,” said Glenn Zaccara, a spokesman for UPS. “The investments that UPS made in the network, technology, people and planning across the season with our customers obviously paid off.”The couriers are bracing for a second wave of business as people begin returning gifts in January. UPS expects return packages to hit 1.3 million on Jan. 3. The company said it had 1.5 million returns, its highest for the season, on Dec. 19.Story continuesWith the S&P teetering on a bear market after a volatile fourth quarter and the worst December in more than a decade, Baird analyst Colin Sebastian lists Amazon as one of the three best picks for investors in the event of a market rebound. Amazon shares were up 1.9 percent to $1,369.12 at 10:57 a.m. in New York Wednesday. They have gained about 17 percent this year, compared with an 12 percent decline on the S&P 500.If Amazon’s Echo speaker was one of its best sellers, it appears to also have been a victim of its own success. Powered by Alexa, the voice-activated software, the smart devices appeared overwhelmed by an onslaught of new users on Christmas, according to reports from the U.K. Owners asking Alexa to play music, turn on the tree lights or recite turkey recipes were often met with the highly unsatisfactory response of: “Sorry, I’m having trouble understanding you right now,” The Guardian reported.A week before Christmas, several of Amazon’s online stores in North America and Europe sold out of various models of Alexa-powered devices, hinting at the surge in demand.(Updates with spending trends from Mastercard in fourth paragraph.)--With assistance from Thomas Black.To contact the reporter on this story: Molly Schuetz in New York at mschuetz9@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Jonathan Roeder, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2018 Bloomberg L.P.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolTesla earnings: The big question is how big is the quarterly lossMarketWatch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo Finance5 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy in 2019Motley FoolAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceHere's What Hedge Funds Think About NIO Inc.

REUTERS/Mike Segar/File PhotoMoreBy David Shepardson and Susan HeaveyWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Six major Web companies and internet-service providers, including AT&T Inc, Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google, will detail their consumer data privacy practices to a U.S. Senate panel on Sept. 26, according to a congressional statement on Wednesday.The Senate hearing will give the six technology-related companies, which also include Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc and Charter Communications Inc, "an opportunity to explain their approaches to privacy," said U.S. Senator John Thune, the Republican chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee.They will also testify on "how they plan to address new requirements from the European Union and California, and what Congress can do to promote clear privacy expectations without hurting innovation," Thune said.Data privacy has become an increasingly important issue, fueled by massive breaches that have compromised the personal information of millions of U.S. internet and social media users, as well as breaches involving large retailers and credit reporting agency Equifax Inc.Separately, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said in a tweet late on Tuesday that Google "claims to be fair, but gave a 'silent donation' to a left-wing group to stop Trump" and "works w/ China/Russia to censor the internet, but canceled a contract with our military."He noted Google declined to take part in a Senate Intelligence hearing last week that featured Twitter and Facebook. "It’s time for @Google to answer some ?’s An invite will be on its way," McCarthy wrote.Google said in a statement on Wednesday that the "suggestion that Google's products or actions are politically biased is simply wrong." The company said it "will continue to ensure that our products and election efforts remain strictly non-partisan in nature."The Internet Association, which represents more than 40 major internet and technology companies, said on Tuesday it backed modernizing U.S. data privacy rules but wants a national approach that would pre-empt new regulations in California that take effect in 2020.The witnesses at the Sept. 26 Senate hearing include Google's chief privacy officer, Twitter's global data protection officer and Apple's vice president for software technology.The White House said in July it was working to develop consumer data privacy policies and officials have held more than 50 meetings with major firms and other groups as the Trump administration seeks to help the policies become enshrined in legislation eventually.California Governor Jerry Brown signed data privacy legislation in June aimed at giving consumers more control over how companies collect and manage their personal information, although it was not as stringent as new rules in Europe.Under the law, large companies would be required starting in 2020 to let consumers view the data they have collected on them, request deletion of data, and opt out of having the data sold to third parties.The European Union General Data Protection Regulation took effect in May, replacing the bloc's patchwork of rules dating back to 1995. Breaking privacy laws can result in fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue or 20 million euros ($23.2 million), whichever is higher, as opposed to a few hundred thousand euros.(Reporting by Susan Heavey and David Shepardson in Washington; Editing by Susan Thomas and Matthew Lewis)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextFoxconn says it remains committed to Wisconsin investment projectReutersAt $1 Trillion, Apple is Bigger Than These ThingsInvestopediaWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhat to Expect When Alphabet Reports Later This MonthMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceTesla's board is about to get a lot smallerTechCrunchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceQualcomm's joint venture with Chinese province to shut down: The InformationReutersAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceEquity Shot: Pinterest zooms into the public markets (and yet another tech company files for an IPO)TechCrunchWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergCaterina Fake is known for her trend-spotting; here's some of what she's chasing nowTechCrunch

Shares in U.S. healthcare companies fell across the board.The new, not-for-profit venture will initially focus on technology for "simplified, high-quality and transparent healthcare" for their more than 500,000 U.S. employees. They did not elaborate on their strategy, but said they are searching for a chief executive officer.Healthcare industry experts say the new entity could eventually negotiate directly with drugmakers, doctors and hospitals and use their vast databases to get a better handle on the costs of those services.That could undercut the industry's "middlemen," from health insurers to pharmacies and benefits managers."The ballooning costs of healthcare act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy," said Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Warren Buffett. "Our group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable."ISI Evercore analyst Michael Newshal said the selloff in healthcare stocks reflected the fear of disruption in a sector helped by rising prices year after year, but is under growing scrutiny from U.S. consumers, regulators and politicians."There are a lot of companies, or arguably almost all companies, in healthcare that benefit from cost inflation running as high as it has been for many years. And if there is pressure to lower that, that can flow throughout the entire system," Newshal said.MAJOR DISRUPTOR?U.S. healthcare spending has been increasing annually faster than inflation, and in 2017 accounted for 18 percent of the U.S. economy. Corporations sponsor health benefits for more than 160 million Americans.Major healthcare players have tried to reduce costs without losing their profit margins. Most recently, pharmacy network CVS Health Corp reached a $69 billion deal to buy insurer Aetna Inc, arguing their combination could save money for the nation's employers.Investors in the sector see Amazon becoming a major disruptor of healthcare, just as it has done in the retail industry, fuelled by media reports in recent months that the company was considering entering the pharmacy business.Teaming up with JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, and Berkshire, the third largest public company in the world, offers new opportunities to shake up the industry, analysts said.For example, JPMorgan could help shape new payment models for consumers and providers, and provide cost data. CEO Dimon has for years expressed concerns about rising healthcare costs.In 2015 he wrote in his annual letter that the company spent $1.1 billion on medical benefits for U.S. employees, 2 percent of company-wide expenses.Berkshire CEO Buffett has long complained that high healthcare costs were hurting American businesses, and publicly began using the term "tapeworm" to describe their effects as early as 2010.The partnership will be spearheaded by Berkshire investment officer Todd Combs, JPMorgan managing director Marvelle Berchtold and Amazon senior vice president Beth Galetti.Combs, 47, has been an investment deputy to Buffett since 2010, and joined JPMorgan's board in 2016.INSURERS FALLHealth insurers that provide benefit management or health plans to Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire could be among the hardest hit.JPMorgan uses UnitedHealth Group Inc and Cigna Corp for health benefits for its global workforce, according to ISI Evercore analyst Ross Muken. Neither company was available for comment.Amazon uses Premera Blue Cross, part of the Blue Cross Blue Shield network, according to Muken. Express Scripts, the pharmacy benefits manager, has disclosed it manages pharmacy benefits for Amazon.Shares in UnitedHealth, Cigna Corp and health insurer Anthem Inc fell 3 percent to 7 percent. Drugstore operators CVS and Walgreen Boots Alliance as well Express Scripts all dropped between 4 percent to 5 percent. Drug distributors Cardinal Health, AmerisourceBergen and McKesson were off 1 percent to 3 percent. Amazon added 0.7 percent.(Additional reporting by Ankur Banerjee and Aparajita Saxena in Bengaluru and David Henry and Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Savio D'Souza and Jeffrey Benkoe)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextAnthem expanding into second Tech Square tower, adding hundreds of jobsAmerican City Business JournalsWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley Fool2 Stocks You Can Buy and Hold ForeverMotley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool'World's smallest baby boy' set to go home in JapanAFP'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

Most important among those will be genuine, intense customer obsession. The child will be the customer.”Along with running Amazon the tech mogul owns space exploration company Blue Origin and the Washington Post newspaper.However, he has recently said he is looking to use his wealth for philanthropy, following in the footsteps of Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg. He has put aside an initial $2bn to fund the Day 1 initiative, which will also assist homeless families.Mr Bezos said his fund will launch “Montessori-inspired” nurseries in low income areas as well as supporting homeles families.Mr Bezos singled out a homeless charity in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered, that has the policy that “no child sleeps on the street”. More families in the United States are homelessness than any other developed nation, figures suggest. pic.twitter.com/2GlgjztK1u — Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) September 13, 2018 Recent studies indicate that one one night in January 2017, over half a million people were living without a roof over their heads. Mr Bezos' tweet announcing the donation received mixed reaction on social media, with many pointing out that Amazon pays a light tax bill in the countries it operates and alleging that workers were underpaid.The recently completed Amazon Spheres building in Seattle, where the company is headquartered Credit: Reuters MoreSeveral reports have critiqued Amazon’s low wages for workers in its global distribution plants, where items are packaged and shipped for delivery. Employees in Amazon’s British and American “fulfillment centres” have complained of long hours without breaks.The company halved its corporation tax bill to $4.5bn in the UK despite tripling profits. Amazon said that it had paid all that was “required”. Its UK operations manager insisted that it would be creating 2,500 jobs in the UK going forward. Amazon has already made inroads into the education sector in the UK, inking a five-year £600m deal to sell office supplies and medical equipment to schools, emergency services and local government across Yorkshire in August. ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadgetAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolTesla's board is about to get a lot smallerTechCrunchWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunch

But alas, price is an issue, and Apple charges way more for iPads than rival companies do for their Android tablets… except for today.Amazon is blowing out refurbished iPad Air 2 tablets for one day only, and the prices are nuts. You can get an iPad Air 2 today for as little as $299! This is a featured deal of the day today from Amazon, but these are refurbs so there’s a very good chance that some or all models will sell out. At the time of this writing though, there were four different iPad Air 2 models available in the sale, and you can find them all below.

Here's what has changedKrystal HuReporterYahoo FinanceAugust 20, 2018ReblogShareTweetShare(David Foster/Yahoo Finance)MoreIt’s been a year since Amazon (AMZN) closed its $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods Market. The bombshell news once sent many other grocery stocks tumbling amid investor concerns. Some expected the e-commerce giant, which has changed the way people buy books, to disrupt how people shop for kale and cereals. So here we are. One year after Amazon took over Whole Foods, the natural grocery chain has become a virtual mystery to analysts as Amazon’s earnings reports shed little light on key measures of its performance.  Whole Foods CEO John Mackey once gushed that the Amazon deal was “love at first sight.” He later admitted at a conference in February “if you want to stay in the marriage, you change.” How has Amazon changed Whole Foods? And what’s ahead for Whole Foods? Through interviews, surveys and third-party data provided by Second Measure, Yahoo Finance can provide some insights.Whole Foods sales remain flat(David Foster/Yahoo Finance)MoreAmazon’s heavily-promoted price cuts have attracted attention, but they didn’t necessarily bring a big boost to Whole Foods. Whole Foods sales since the acquisition have largely remained stable, with only low single-digit growth, according to data from Second Measure, a company that tracks consumer spending. The premium grocery store’s growth has been stagnant since 2015. New shoppers only account for 3% of its customers base.Neil Saunders, the managing director of retail at GlobalData, sees no further decline in sales as a sign of progress. “If Whole Foods hasn’t been acquired by Amazon, we could probably see sales reverse much more sharply,” he said. The steep pricing strategy and limited investment in stores have kept the sales growth stagnant since 2015. (David Foster/Yahoo Finance)MoreAmazon’s self-created shopping holiday Prime Day did bring a bump. This year, Whole Foods celebrated its first Amazon Prime Day by offering $10 Amazon credit to Prime members who spend $10 or more at Whole Foods from July 11-17. Whole Foods’ average daily sales during the promotion week were 5% higher than the average summer day.The “Amazon Effect” on Whole Foods is really tied to the e-commerce giant’s Prime Membership. Amazon’s core subscription program now touts over 100 million users around the world. Those members accounted for more than half of Whole Foods sales in the U.S. In June 2018, 41% of Whole Foods new consumers were already Prime members, compared to 34% one year ago. However, the increase doesn’t necessarily mean the Prime sales and promotions are luring more shoppers. During that same time period, the percentage of Amazon Prime members among the U.S. population also increased to 32% from 27%.(David Foster/Yahoo Finance)MoreStory continuesCustomers see some product changesYahoo Finance surveyed more than 2,000 Whole Food shoppers about their experience in the past year. Forty percent believe the price of products in stores aren’t really lower. Nearly half of those surveyed say Amazon has brought positive changes to Whole Foods. The most popular feature in the integration is the discounts for Prime members at Whole Foods stores. Amazon has been gradually rolling out the perk since May. Now Prime members can enjoy an additional 10% off sale items in stores nationwide, plus exclusive weekly discounts on select items.Meanwhile, Whole Foods has been reorganizing its shelves by removing and adding products. Instead of giving regional teams the autonomy to source local products, the company’s management team at its Austin headquarter now makes centralized buying decisions, in an effort to standardize the supply chain and reduce cost. From Nature Valley granola bars, Tropicana Orange Juice to Starbucks cold brew coffee, Whole Foods has opened its arms to common brand names found at other grocery chains like Walmart. With consumer-packaged goods (CPG), Whole Foods now offers more options for shoppers. Travis Christensen, a Whole Foods shopper in Arizona, said the chain has emerged as his primary grocery store since Amazon’s acquisition. “I like Amazon bringing value proposition rather than just premium and organic. I use Prime discounts and appreciate the sprinkling of mainstream products,” Christensen wrote in the survey.But introducing more CPG, a different approach from Whole Foods’ long-standing reputation for sourcing natural and organic products locally, has disappointed some loyal customers. “Local brand items are disappearing from the shelves. This was something that made me loyal to Whole Foods in the past, but is making me rethink if I want to continue shopping there versus other grocery stores in the future,” John Dixon from Louisville, Kentucky told Yahoo Finance.Some longtime employees have also raised eyebrows at the push. Brittain Ladd, a retail consultant who had worked for Amazon, believes phasing out some locally sourced products is a necessary pain for Whole Foods.“The way Amazon could reduce cost is standardizing the assortments across all stores and relying on a nationwide distribution model versus the locally sourced model,” said Ladd.What’s next for Whole Foods(David Foster/Yahoo Finance)MoreAnalysts believe Amazon has delivered on its plan for Whole Foods in the first year of the transition, by focusing on reorganization and integrating Prime membership into the shopping experience.The streamline and standardization process is ongoing. Whole Foods has been working on consolidating its 13 regions across the country, Yahoo Finance has learned.Customers can expect more changes on the aisles, too. Amazon is expected to introduce more consumer packaged and private label products, a move that analysts believe would open the premium store to a larger customer base. “Amazon is performing a lot of analysis to identify what products to put on their shelves to bring the most customers, not to retain current customers,” said Ladd.With all the online and offline shopping behavior data Amazon could collect, Saunders thinks it will take a more personalized approach to making promotions and discounts more relevant to shoppers.More moves could also be expected on delivery. In February, Yahoo Finance first reported Amazon’s move to consolidate Amazon Fresh and Prime Now to work with Whole Foods. In the past year, both the delivery startup Instacart and Amazon have been sending Whole Foods goods to people’s doorway.“Amazon has a bucket list of things it would like to do, but it’s not gonna do them all at once. It has to learn how to cope with the existing business,” said Saunders. “They’re a bit slower than they usually are, a year is not a long time frame for astounding changes, so there is definitely more to come.”Do you work for Amazon/Whole Foods?

TV anchor-helicopter pilotMike SniderUSA TODAYJanuary 10, 2019ReblogShareTweetShareThe divorce between Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos and wife, MacKenzie, may be more complicated than originally expected.The couple, who have been married 25 years, announced their divorce Wednesday over Twitter. They had been separated but were now making it official, their statement said."As our family and close friends know, after a long period of loving exploration and trial separation, we have decided to divorce and continue our shared lives as friends," they said.Subsequent news reports suggest the timing of their announcement may have been forced. The National Enquirer is publishing in its latest edition, out Thursday, what it calls a four-month investigation tracking Bezos's time spent with former Fox L.A. TV anchor Lauren Sanchez, the wife of Hollywood talent agent Patrick Whitesell.More: Target, Costco report strong holiday season sales to round out yearMore: January specials: Your monthly guide to freebies and meal dealsMore: 10 Amazon products under $30 that people are obsessing overSanchez and Whitesell are also divorcing, according to several outlets including People.com. The couple owned a home in Seattle and have socialized with the Bezoses in the past, the New York Post reported.Sanchez, 49, also a helicopter pilot with her own aerial production firm, was hired to shoot aerial shots for Blue Origin, a private space company Bezos founded in 2000, the Post reported. She served as the initial host on Fox's "So You Think You Can Dance," and has been a contributor to TV shows including "The View," "Larry King Live," "Showbiz Tonight," and "The Joy Behar Show."Lauren Sanchez arrives for the 67th Golden Globe Awards on Jan. 6, 2019. She is reportedly dating Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos.MoreSanchez and Whitesell married in 2005 and have two children, but have not filed for divorce as of now, Fox News reported. She has a teenage son from her first marriage to former NFL player Tony Gonzalez.She and Bezos were seen together in Los Angeles on Sunday, the day of the Golden Globes and at Amazon's after-party, the Post reported. Bezos made the announcement about the divorce Wednesday because he knew photos of the two would become public, the Post reported.However, Bezos' wife, MacKenzie, knew the two were dating, the Post quotes an unnamed person close to Bezos as saying. "The news today was not a surprise to her. Lauren was with Jeff at the Golden Globes because they are dating," the person said.TMZ reported Thursday that the Bezoses did not have a prenuptial agreement and plan to file for divorce in Washington. While Washington state divorce law considers all that the couple builds and accrues during their marriage as community property, that doesn't necessarily mean a 50-50 split of assets — including six homes, according to Business Insider — but the court attempts to split assets (and debts), fair and equitably.The couple could have devised a postnuptial agreement to do so on their own and likely have a deal meant to not rock Amazon. "It's unlikely there’s any risk to the company," said Stuart Slotnick, chairman of the matrimonial department of law firm Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney in New York City. "When you are talking over $100 billion there is enough to go around."Story continuesEven if MacKenzie Bezos should eventually depart with half of Bezos' wealth, valued at $137 billion atop Bloomberg's Billionaires Index, the Amazon founder would remain among the top four most wealthy.And, should Amazon's shares continue to rise, Fortune noted, he could again overtake Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates as the world's richest man.More: How much could Mackenzie Bezos get in divorce with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos?More: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and wife MacKenzie to divorce after 25 years of marriageFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Amazon CEO Bezos reportedly didn't have a prenup, dating L.A.

Although he doesn't typically answer those emails himself, he does read them."I see most of those emails. I see them and I forward them to the executives in charge of the area with a question mark. It's shorthand [for] can you look into this? Why is this happening?," Bezos said.Getting such an email is a pretty common thing at Amazon, and it's also big deal. The executive, in turn, will often foward it along to the manager in charge of the area who will view the email with a sinking heart, one of them recently told us.That's because the manager is then on the hook to drop everything, investigate and get back with an answer. Sometimes that means a lot of research over nights and weekends, the Amazon manager recently told us. But Bezos views that email address, jeff@amazon.com, as a way to stay close to customers, which can otherwise be hard to do as an executive, who is far removed from day-to-day customer service and sees the company mostly through data and reports."We have tons of metrics," Bezos explained on stage. "When you are shipping billions of packages a year, you need good data and metrics: are you delivering on time? Delivering on time to every city? To apartment complexes? ... Whether the packages have too much air in them, wasteful packaging."So those customer complaints gives him front-line insights. If all of his data say one thing and a few customers say something else, he believes the customers."The thing I have noticed is when the anecdotes and the data disagree, the anecdotes are usually right. There's something wrong with the way you are measuring it," he explained.This is one of the ways Bezos expresses what he calls one of Amazon's most important values: customer obsession. "We talk about it, customer obsession, as opposed to competitor obsession," he said. Often companies say they are focused on customers but they really spend most of their energy reacting to and talking about competitors."If your whole culture is competitor-obsessed, it's hard to stay motivated if you are out in front. Whereas customers are also unsatisfied, always discontent, always want more. So no matter how far in front you get in front of competitors, you are still behind your customers. They are always pulling you along," he said.Video: Bezos Reveals How Many Customers Subscribe to Amazon PrimeFor more news videos visit Yahoo View.  NOW WATCH: The top 10 games coming in 2018See Also:Amazon executives sat through a brutally uncomfortable 4.5-minute phone call that showed them just how much Jeff Bezos cares about customersAmazon has more than doubled its lobbying dollars since 2014Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos just put your weekend to shame — and it includes a shoutout from The RockSEE ALSO: Jeff Bezos admits that Amazon has 'the weirdest meeting culture you will ever encounter'SEE ALSO: These ex-Facebook and Google engineers are helping companies kick abusive people off popular internet sitesReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceState defends South Dakota pipeline protest legislationAssociated PressSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolIn Ukrainian candidate's hometown, a cry for changeAssociated Press'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceButina Shouldn't Serve Any More Time in Prison, Her Lawyers SayBloombergAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin Rivet

The divorce should have no material impact on the company and its shares, said Tom Forte, an analyst at DA Davidson & Co.According to Refinitiv Eikon data, MacKenzie does not hold any Amazon shares directly, while Bezos has a 16.1 percent stake worth about $130 billion. Forbes magazine now estimates his overall net worth at $137.1 billion.Liat Sadler, a San Francisco matrimonial lawyer, noted that spouses owe a fiduciary duty to one another.“They have duties not to waste or devalue marital resources, and to keep the value of marital property as high as possible,” she said. “I don't think there is an issue of concern for shareholders as to what will happen to Amazon because of the divorce."Sadler said the main options facing the couple regarding Amazon stock were for Jeff Bezos to buy out his wife, or for MacKenzie Bezos to retain shares."If she trusts that he would manage Amazon well, either he should pay her for her share of the stock, or they could enter a more complicated agreement where she keeps stock and he keeps voting rights,” she said.It is unlikely that many details of the divorce will become public, according to New York lawyer Bernard Clair, who represents Judith Giuliani in her divorce from Rudolph Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and current lawyer for U.S. President Donald Trump."These two have been separated for a not insignificant time, and I would assume ... they would have used the time to reach a private, confidential agreement,” Clair said, referring to Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos.Reuters was unable to determine any further financial details of the planned divorce."Jeff remains focused on and engaged in all aspects of Amazon," said Drew Herdener, vice president of communications for the company. He declined to comment on how the divorce might affect the ownership stake.MacKenzie Bezos met her husband when interviewing for a job at a New York hedge fund, according to a 2013 profile in Vogue.The two were engaged after three months of dating and married three months after that, according to the magazine. They have four children.Speaking at an event in Berlin last April, Jeff Bezos said his wife's support was instrumental when he founded Amazon."When you have loving and supportive people in your life, like MacKenzie, my parents, my grandfather, my grandmother, you end up being able to take risks," he said.Jeff Bezos in September committed $2 billion through the Bezos Day One Fund to helping homeless families and starting pre-schools for low-income communities. He had solicited ideas on Twitter in 2017 for ways to donate some of his wealth.Last January, the couple donated $33 million to fund college scholarships for U.S. high schoolers with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status, an Obama-era program protecting young immigrants brought to the United States illegally by their parents.In 2012, they donated $2.5 million to a Washington state campaign to legalize same-sex nuptials there.From modest beginnings, Amazon branched out into almost every product category, taking on established retailers such as Walmart Inc (WMT.N).In November, Amazon picked America's financial and political capitals for massive new offices, branching out from its home base in Seattle with plans to create more than 25,000 jobs in New York City and a Virginia suburb of Washington, D.C.Jeff Bezos also founded space company Blue Origin in 2000, and is funneling more than $1 billion a year of his own fortune into pulling it out of start-up mode and into production.He also owns the Washington Post, which has been a frequent target of criticism from Trump.(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel and Jeffrey Dastin, additional reporting by Subrat Patnaik in Bengaluru; Writing by Meredith Mazzilli; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Susan Thomas)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

She moved to New York City and interviewed at the investment management firm D.E. Shaw where Jeff was the first person who interviewed her.The two were engaged within three months after their first date, and married within six, according to Vogue.Shortly after they married, the two quit their jobs and moved to Seattle to found Amazon, and lived in a one-bedroom rental there before the business took off.Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie BezosMoreJeff and MacKenzie announced the news in a statement on the billionaire’s Twitter account on Wednesday, writing that they had decided to continue their “shared lives as friends.”“We feel incredibly lucky to have found each other and deeply grateful for every one of the years we have been married to each other. If we had known we would separate after 25 years, we would do it all again,” they added in the statement.The pair have four children together — three sons and a daughter. pic.twitter.com/Gb10BDb0x0 — Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos)  January 9, 2019 Shortly after news of his divorce was made public, multiple sources confirmed to PEOPLE that Bezos is currently seeing news anchor Lauren Sanchez.PEOPLE confirmed Sanchez, 49, is also divorcing her husband Patrick Whitesell after 13 years of marriage.

Other cities may get major sites from the company, the newspaper said.Associated Press reported similar details Tuesday, also citing an unnamed individual.Bloomberg News reported last week that the company is close to agreements that would split the new headquarters between the Crystal City area of Arlington, in Northern Virginia and Long Island City, in the New York borough of Queens.A decision would end a yearlong search by the e-commerce giant for supplementary headquarters to its existing base in Seattle. Cities across the U.S. have spent months jockeying for a $5 billion investment that promises 50,000 high-paying jobs.Since Amazon pared the list to 20 cities in January, speculation has been rampant, with lists handicapping supposed front-runners. Amazon had a broad list of criteria, including a population of 1 million, proximity to a major airport and a strong university system, without clearly identifying which factors were most important.(Updates with AP detail in 3rd paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Spencer Soper in Seattle at ssoper@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Robert Fenner at rfenner@bloomberg.net, Peter ElstromFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2018 Bloomberg L.P.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextButina Shouldn't Serve Any More Time in Prison, Her Lawyers SayBloombergWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolAfter just one day of trading, Zoom Video is the most highly valued tech stock by this metricMarketWatchLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

And now the e-commerce giant has become my personal in-home sentry thanks to its $119 Cloud Cam.A web-connected security camera, Cloud Cam has some stiff competition in Google parent company Alphabet’s (GOOG, GOOGL) own $199 Nest Cam Indoor. But with a significant price advantage and a solid set of features, the Cloud Cam makes a compelling case to hire Amazon as your own watchdog.The setupSetting up the Cloud Cam is incredibly easy. Simply position the camera facing an area you want to monitor, likely near a door or windows, and plug it in. Amazon includes mounting screws and drywall anchors if you prefer to screw the camera into your wall. Once the camera is set up, download the Cloud Cam app for your iPhone or Android device, log in with your Amazon account and you’re set. The app will ask you to select the Wi-Fi network you’d like to connect the camera to and what you’d like to name it to differentiate multiple cameras from each other.And that’s essentially it. I was genuinely surprised with how smooth the entire setup process went.Spying … on my catsThe minute I setup the Cloud Cam, I knew I was going to use it to see what my cats do all day when I’m not home. Spoiler alert: They sleep. A lot. The Cloud Cam’s interface is incredibly straightforward. You’ve got one large box that shows you a live feed from your camera. In the bottom right corner of that box is a microphone that lets you speak with whomever, or whatever, is in your home. The Cloud Cam is an easy way to spy on your pets from the office.MoreBelow the video box is a list of the various clips the Cam’s motion detector has recorded. See, unlike the Nest Cam Indoor, which captures images when motion is detected, Amazon’s Cloud Cam captures short video clips.You can replay up to 24 hours worth of those clips with Amazon’s free Cloud Cam account. If you want to save more, you’ll have to sign up for a subscription.Beyond that, Amazon lets you adjust a number of settings in the app including whether the camera is on or off, its name and how often you want to receive motion notification updates.You can enable location tracking in the Cloud Cam app to automatically determine when your phone and the camera are at the same location and switch the camera off.Sign up for one of Amazon’s monthly plans and you’ll also be able to get notifications for whether movement is from a person or your pet and set up zones that you want to exclude from the motion detector’s sensors for things like ceiling fans. As with other such cameras, the Cloud Cam has night vision capabilities, so you can see what’s happening in your home even if it’s dark.That person is not a personNone of this is unique to Amazon’s offering. The Nest Cam Indoor has the same features with a slightly wider field of view and sound detection, so if the camera hears a loud noise you’ll receive an alert. Amazon’s Cloud Cam can’t do that.What it can do, however, is learn over time using Amazon’s own Amazon Web Services. And that’s good, because while the Cloud Cam detected movement in my apartment, it couldn’t seem to differentiate between when my cats were wandering around and if someone was actually in my home.The Cloud Cam can determine if movement in your home is caused by a person or pet.MoreStory continuesOver the course of a day, I received a handful of notifications that said a person was detected when it was just my cat walking across my coffee table. The vast majority of the time the Cam knew the movement wasn’t a person, but those false positives were still there.Amazon, however, says that as the Cam is used, the software will become better at understanding the difference between pets and people.The Cloud Cam also works with your Fire TV and Echo Show, so if you tell Alexa to show you the living room camera, you’ll instantly get a live feed of what’s happening.The plansOf course, to get the most out of your Cloud Cam, you’ll need to sign up for a subscription. Free subscriptions give you the ability to save up to the last 24 hours worth of clips, connect 3 cameras and get general motion notifications. For $6.99 per month or $69.99 a year, you can save up to the last 7 days of clips, get notifications, get person detection, set up exclusion zones and download and share an unlimited number of clips.Jump up to the Extended plan and you can save 14 days of clips and connect up to 5 cameras for $9.99 a month or $99.99 a year. The top-tier Pro plan costs $19.99 a month or $199 a year and lets you save the last 30 days of clips and connect 10 cameras.You’ll need to sign up for a Cloud Cam account to get the most out of the device.MoreNest’s subscription service, Nest Aware, also lets you get alerts based on whether motion detected is from a person or pet, as well as set up specific Activity Zones that will activate specific motion alerts for more important areas like your child’s crib.Nest Aware also lets you save as much as 30 days of video and clip out specific events that seem important.A basic plan, though, costs $10 per month or $100 a year to get 10-days of video history, while an Extended plan gets you 30-days of video history or $30 a month or $300 a year.Amazon’s way into your homeAs with anything Amazon does, though, the Cloud Cam’s raison d’etre comes back to getting you to shop more. See, you can upgrade your Cloud Cam to also work with Amazon’s Key program. Amazon Key lets you give a delivery person access to your door lock using a one-time code so they can drop your packages inside and then close the door behind them.When you sign up for Amazon Key, the company provides you with a lock and a Cloud Cam Key Edition. But if you already own a Cloud Cam, you can purchase a cable that connects to the Key smartlock and begin using the service. The Cloud Cam is an integral part of Amazon Key, as it allows homeowners to see that the delivery person dropping off their package isn’t also making off with the fine china. Should you get it?Amazon’s Cloud Cam is a simple, easy to set up and use security camera that opens your home up to the company’s future plans. Its motion detection is excellent, and the ability to save individual clips and share them is fantastic. But it’s the Cam’s $119 price tag and subscription plans that make it worth the investment.If you’re looking for a security cam and already love Amazon, the Cloud Cam is a no-brainer.More from Dan:Microsoft Xbox One X review: A beast of a console at a steep price‘Super Mario Odyssey’ review: Nintendo tips its cap to the pastSamsung North America CEO believes we’ll soon talk to all of our appliancesAmazon’s all-new Echo is a more attractive smart assistantWhy Microsoft is playing nice with iPhones and AndroidEmail Daniel at dhowley@yahoo-inc.com; follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextLockheed Martin joins the discussion about cloud computing services in spaceGeekWireZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolTesla's board is about to get a lot smallerTechCrunchBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo Finance3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceInvesting in General Electric Is All About These 3 Key ThingsMotley FoolNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceCardinal Timothy Dolan on the Catholic ChurchWSJ

The vast majority of the time the Cam knew the movement wasn’t a person, but those false positives were still there.Amazon, however, says that as the Cam is used, the software will become better at understanding the difference between pets and people.The Cloud Cam also works with your Fire TV and Echo Show, so if you tell Alexa to show you the living room camera, you’ll instantly get a live feed of what’s happening.The plansOf course, to get the most out of your Cloud Cam, you’ll need to sign up for a subscription. Free subscriptions give you the ability to save up to the last 24 hours worth of clips, connect 3 cameras and get general motion notifications. For $6.99 per month or $69.99 a year, you can save up to the last 7 days of clips, get notifications, get person detection, set up exclusion zones and download and share an unlimited number of clips.Jump up to the Extended plan and you can save 14 days of clips and connect up to 5 cameras for $9.99 a month or $99.99 a year. The top-tier Pro plan costs $19.99 a month or $199 a year and lets you save the last 30 days of clips and connect 10 cameras.You’ll need to sign up for a Cloud Cam account to get the most out of the device.MoreNest’s subscription service, Nest Aware, also lets you get alerts based on whether motion detected is from a person or pet, as well as set up specific Activity Zones that will activate specific motion alerts for more important areas like your child’s crib.Nest Aware also lets you save as much as 30 days of video and clip out specific events that seem important.A basic plan, though, costs $10 per month or $100 a year to get 10-days of video history, while an Extended plan gets you 30-days of video history or $30 a month or $300 a year.Amazon’s way into your homeAs with anything Amazon does, though, the Cloud Cam’s raison d’etre comes back to getting you to shop more. See, you can upgrade your Cloud Cam to also work with Amazon’s Key program. Amazon Key lets you give a delivery person access to your door lock using a one-time code so they can drop your packages inside and then close the door behind them.When you sign up for Amazon Key, the company provides you with a lock and a Cloud Cam Key Edition. But if you already own a Cloud Cam, you can purchase a cable that connects to the Key smartlock and begin using the service. The Cloud Cam is an integral part of Amazon Key, as it allows homeowners to see that the delivery person dropping off their package isn’t also making off with the fine china. Should you get it?Amazon’s Cloud Cam is a simple, easy to set up and use security camera that opens your home up to the company’s future plans. Its motion detection is excellent, and the ability to save individual clips and share them is fantastic. But it’s the Cam’s $119 price tag and subscription plans that make it worth the investment.If you’re looking for a security cam and already love Amazon, the Cloud Cam is a no-brainer.More from Dan:Microsoft Xbox One X review: A beast of a console at a steep price‘Super Mario Odyssey’ review: Nintendo tips its cap to the pastSamsung North America CEO believes we’ll soon talk to all of our appliancesAmazon’s all-new Echo is a more attractive smart assistantWhy Microsoft is playing nice with iPhones and AndroidEmail Daniel at dhowley@yahoo-inc.com; follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextLockheed Martin joins the discussion about cloud computing services in spaceGeekWireZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolTesla's board is about to get a lot smallerTechCrunchBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo Finance3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceInvesting in General Electric Is All About These 3 Key ThingsMotley FoolNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceCardinal Timothy Dolan on the Catholic ChurchWSJ

Is Relying on This Vulnerable SegmentJames BrumleyInvestorPlaceJanuary 11, 2018ReblogShareTweetShareEarlier this week, Piper Jaffrey once again touted Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) as a top pick, explaining it’s only scratched the surface of the amount of money it could extract from consumers. Analyst Michael Olson even went as far as to raise his price target on Amazon stock from $1,200 to $1,400. That’s 11% above the stock’s present price.It’s an exciting, even familiar, refrain to shareholders of a company that can seemingly do no wrong. And truth be told, Amazon has largely earned its stature among investors with its top-line growth, even if bottom-line growth hasn’t matched it.At some point, though, the analyst community is going to have to start accepting and discussing the reality that the bigger Amazon’s e-commerce business gets, the less profitable it is. Indeed, were it not for Amazon Web Services — the Amazon’s cloud-computing arm — the company would be alarmingly in the red. And even that may not be enough in the near future.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  7 ETFs That Will Beat the Market in 2018  Piper Jaffrey’s Olson upped his target on Amazon stock mostly in response to the firm’s review of data regarding consumer spending during the all-important holiday-shopping spending period late last year. In short, as big as Amazon has become, it still only captured about 4% of the money spent on gift-giving late last year. Olson opines the company is “still in the early innings of its share-gain potential,” which could be taken from rivals like Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) or Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT).It all sounds very compelling — and believable — on the surface. Amazon.com has become a juggernaut few competitors dare stand up to. And it’s still growing the top line at a double-digit pace.The funny thing is, the bigger Amazon’s e-commerce machine gets, the less profitable it becomes. More of the same top-line growth is likely to mean more of the same shrinking bottom line, putting all the pressure of cash flow on Amazon Web Services.Dynamics of Amazon StockThe graphic below tells the tale, strikingly. The company’s North American e-commerce arm is barely profitable, and decreasingly so. Its international e-commerce effort has been and continues to bleed money. The only meaningful profits being produced right now are coming from Amazon Web Services. Click to EnlargeHere’s the same data, presented as margins, or as a percentage of revenue. Click to EnlargeIt’s not the end of the world in and of itself. Lots of companies manage different divisions of various profitability levels. If it works for owners of Amazon stock, then it works.It’s a dynamic that should be questioned though, as it may not be able to work forever.There are two overarching liabilities packed into Amazon’s profit mix. One of them is the one Tom Taulli explored last year, pointing out that competition from names like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) is heating up now that Amazon has proven cloud computing and cloud storage is a viable market. The more players who are in the race, the thinner margins become as a price war ensues.The other vulnerability of such a lopsided mix of earnings? It’s not even clear how profitable AWS actually is.Amazon’s Cash Flow Isn’t ReallyIt’s a bit complicated, but here’s the simple explanation: Amazon’s touted cash flow isn’t actually its cash flow. The company expenses short-lived hardware used by Amazon Web Services as a capital lease obligation. As such, the cost of that equipment isn’t deducted from cash flow, though given the short lifespan of a server, it arguably should be treated like a traditional, recurring expense. Amazon isn’t bucking GAAP rules, to be clear, but the approach does obscure the true, effective cost of keeping AWS up and running.Story continuesEither way, the heavy cost of running AWS in an increasingly commoditized environment is creating some major liabilities. A closer look at last quarter’s SEC filing shows $116 billion worth of debt and capitalized lease obligations. That’s up from just a little less than $40 billion in debt and capitalized lease obligations Amazon was sitting on a year earlier.Those are bills that are going to have to be paid sometime by a company that could be limping along more than it seems on the surface.Bottom Line for Amazon StockA pronouncement of death for Amazon stock? Hardly. If nothing else, CEO Jeff Bezos has proven he’s always got another trick up his sleeve to drive growth.  4 Bitcoin Alternatives That You Need for 2018  Still, these are the basis of questions that die-hard shareholders of AMZN should be asking. The company is making a massive, expensive bet on a cloud market that’s not guaranteed to be dominated by Amazon. If it’s not actually as profitable as it seems like it is, there’s no real backup plan or scenario that gets the company anywhere near its projected profit expectations.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Rather, it might take as long as 7.5 years to get there, which would still result in an annualized return of 33% for Jeff Bezos and company.“In my estimation, if it took 7.5 years to get to $1,000 from $100, I see AMZN stock getting to $10,000 somewhere between January 2023 and January 2025.“InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn September, the markets went into full-on bear mode, knocking the S&P 500 for a 14% loss, making it the worst quarter for the index since 2008, and in the process, putting it into negative territory (-7%) in 2018. Talk about a reversal of fortune.How did AMZN stock fare in the fourth quarter? It lost 25% to close well down from its 52-week high of $2,050.50. No matter. Early in 2019, Amazon’s managed to regain some of those losses — it’s up 7.8% year-to-date through the Jan. 9 close.  10 F-Rated Stocks That Could Break Your Portfolio  Like a young child taking learning to walk, step by step, Amazon will get back on the path to $10,000. In fact, it needs only a couple of its big initiatives to be successful to reach the lofty goal sooner rather than later.Here are two of them:Amazon’s Push Into AdvertisingWhen investors name-drop companies in online advertising, two names come to mind: Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google, part of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG).Facebook and Google account for 58% of the U.S. online advertising market. Together, the two firms generated approximately $61 billion in ad revenue in 2018. Way down in third place with 7% market share of U.S. digital ad spending is Amazon — but it’s coming on like a house on fire. Forecasts suggest that Amazon ad revenues could hit $38 billion annually by 2023.While Amazon has little chance of catching the duopoly that is Facebook and Google, it stands a good chance of becoming a strong third wheel.“My understanding from speaking with people in the industry is that Amazon’s retail, subscription-based and advertising revenues are fairly fluid,” said Pivotal Research senior analyst Brian Wieser. “Amazon will optimize revenue streams and profitability based on what it sees from consumers.”So while Facebook and Google are heavily dependent on advertising, Amazon has stuff like Amazon Web Services (AWS) — $5.1 billion in operating income in the first nine months of its latest fiscal year — that are highly profitable to lean on while building some of its other businesses such as advertising.Jeff Bezos has become a master allocator of capital, stoking the fires that need stoking, and in the process, making Amazon extremely nimble and able to act on its best ideas.Amazon GoThe cashier-less convenience store concept Amazon began rolling out in 2018 is going to revolutionize the industry. Amazon, which expects to open 3,000 stores by the end of 2021, could generate as much as $4.5 billion in annual sales from these stores in three years’ time. According to RBC Capital Markets, the average Amazon Go store does $1.5 million in annual sales.Not bad for a store concept that doesn’t need any front-of-store personnel.“Amazon Go stores could be a game changer for physical retail experience. Its in-store technology enables shoppers to have a very efficient and pleasant shopping experience,” RBC analyst Mark Mahaney wrote in a note to clients. “While not a significant financial contributor yet, we believe the overall opportunity is huge.”Darn straight.The convenience store industry hasn’t changed in 25 years. Those aren’t my words — they’re Alimentation Couche-Tard (OTCMKTS:ANCUF) CEO Brian Hannasch’s.“The experience of buying fuel and of buying items in our stores has largely been unchanged since card readers were introduced 25 years ago,” Hannasch said in a November story in ConvenienceStore News. The convenience store business might not be as sexy as Whole Foods, but it’s got the potential to engage Amazon Prime customers wherever they live.The stores themselves might generate $4 billion in sales, but it’s the free advertising Amazon gets to attract more Prime members that’s the real key to Amazon Go’s ultimate success.Story continuesEverything Amazon does revolves around Prime. The Bottom Line on AMZN StockNothing Amazon does surprises me anymore. It’s got a great business model and is using technology to innovate old-school industries like grocery, convenience stores, healthcare — the list goes on. I could actually see Amazon stock hit $10,000 within five years, two-and-half years sooner than I suggested last January. However, it’s got to nail at least one of these initiatives to have a chance.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace  2 Toxic Pot Stocks You Should Avoid    10 F-Rated Stocks That Could Break Your Portfolio    5 Fintech Stocks to Buy As This Mega Trend Gains Steam    10 Cold Weather Stocks to Heat Up Your Returns   Compare Brokers The post Amazon Stock Will Hit $10,000 Sooner Than You Think appeared first on InvestorPlace.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

AFTVNews has discovered a page on Amazon's website where you can sign up to receive more info about a certain "Fire TV Cube." While the page is pretty much empty other than the words "What is Fire TV Cube?" and the promise of more details coming soon, it could be all about the box-like device the same publication leaked last year. Back in September, AFTVNews published the photo you can see above. It said the boxy contraption on the right is some sort of a Fire TV-Echo Dot hybrid with hands-free Alexa support.To be able to control current Fire TV devices with Amazon's voice assistant, you need to use its accompanying voice remote or a separate Echo speaker. You apparently don't need either with the cube-like device, and since it has a built-in speaker, you'd even hear Alexa's responses even if the TV isn't switched on. The device will reportedly be able to handle 4K HDR video, as well.Of course, we can't say with 100 percent certainty whether that's truly what the "Fire TV Cube" is. As AFTVNews noted, it's also unclear whether "Fire TV Cube" is an official name or something Amazon decided to use for now, since that's what fans call the device in the leaked image. Your best bet is to sign up to receive more info and hope that the e-commerce giant sends out one with all the juicy details in the near future.(AOL)MoreUpdate: A reader sent us scans of the manual that came with his Amazon Ethernet adapter, and one of the pages showed an illustration of the Fire TV Cube. The ports on the device's back are marked as "Infrared" "HDMI" and "Power," while the micro-USB port is marked "Network," which likely means it can't power the device through the TV -- you'll have to plug it into an outlet. Between the sign-up portal and this page in the manual, we might be seeing the Fire TV Cube very, very soon.

Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos said his company "will continue to support" the U.S. Defense Department, drawing a contrast with cloud-services rival Google, which has said it won’t seek some military contracts following protests from its employees.Amazon Web Services is widely seen as the favorite to win a Pentagon cloud-computing contract worth as much as $10 billion. Alphabet Inc.’s Google last week said it would no longer compete for that work, which involves transitioning massive amounts of Defense Department data to a commercially operated cloud system. Other companies vying for the accord are IBM, Oracle Corp. and Microsoft Corp."If U.S. tech companies turn their backs on the Department of Defense, this country is in trouble," Bezos said Monday at the Wired 25 Summit in San Francisco, where he was a surprise speaker. "This is a great country and it does need to be defended."Google’s announcement that it was dropping out of the running for the winner-take-all deal came months after the company decided not to renew its contract with a Pentagon artificial intelligence program, after extensive employee protests about the internet giant working with the military. Google then released a set of principles designed to evaluate what kind of artificial intelligence projects it would pursue.--With assistance from Sarah Frier.To contact the reporter on this story: Spencer Soper in Seattle at ssoper@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2018 Bloomberg L.P.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextButina Shouldn't Serve Any More Time in Prison, Her Lawyers SayBloombergWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolDocuments confirm what Microsoft is building in GoodyearAmerican City Business JournalsWhat to Expect When Alphabet Reports Later This MonthMotley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolTesla earnings: The big question is how big is the quarterly lossMarketWatch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo Finance5 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy in 2019Motley FoolAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceHere's What Hedge Funds Think About NIO Inc.

The chance for a small manufacturing business to reach 4.5 million viewers for free doesn't come around often.Lopreiato appeared on "Buy it and Try It," a segment for hosts to test out popular niche gizmos from infomercials in front of an enthusiastic New York studio audience. The first product they tried was a steel nonstick pan, which smoothly cooked up eggs without the use of oil or butter.Then it was Forearm Forklift's turn. After viewing a commercial for the product, ABC's Lara Spencer and Gio Benitez pulled the heavy-duty moving straps over their forearms and proceeded to lift up a washing machine and walk with it."I was pretty impressed," Spencer said to the crowd.You'd think such a shout-out from the hugely popular morning show would provide a huge boost for Lopreiato's 18-year-old family business.But this is Amazon.com's (NASDAQ: AMZN) world, and Forearm Forklift, like so many brands, is uncomfortably inhabiting it.Once a thriving product for movers and contractors available at a dozen big-box retailers including Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT), Target (NYSE: TGT) and AutoZone (NYSE: AZO), Forearm Forklift has been ravaged over the past half-decade by counterfeiters, mostly selling on Amazon. Scores of merchants have copied the patented product, using its name, images and labels and undercutting the real Forearm Forklift on price.When "Good Morning America" viewers go online to buy a set, which retails between $20 and $25, odds are they'll be purchasing someone else's product."It just keeps funneling business to the knockoffs," said Lopreiato, 48, whose wife Sophia also works at the company and traveled with him to New York. "It's almost like winning the lottery if they choose our item."Forearm Forklift is hanging on by a thread. The company is down to 21 full-time employees from 52 at its peak and recorded less than $500 in profit last year. Annual revenue in 2008 topped $4 million and has since plunged 30 percent. Retailers stopped placing orders because they were finding what appeared to be the same thing online for much cheaper.Lopreiato has diversified his product line, adding a harness for the shoulders, a strap that goes over a single shoulder and straps for carrying boxes. But nothing has come close to replicating the success of his flagship Forearm Forklift.Meanwhile, Lopreiato bears the costs of workers' compensation, product quality control, commercial insurance, mortgage payments and patent management fees all so counterfeiters can act as freeloaders."We're competing with people who are stealing our brand, stealing our pictures and stealing our intellectual property," Lopreiato said in an interview last week from his 20,000-square foot warehouse in Baldwin Park, about 20 miles east of Los Angeles.Amazon's growing dominance in commerce brings with it plenty of collateral damage. The counterfeit problem, in particular, goes largely undiscussed by CEO  Jeff Bezos  and ignored by investors and analysts.The stock has climbed 37 percent over the last 12 months making Amazon the world's fourth-most valuable company, and 89 percent of analysts tracked by FactSet say shareholders should buy more.Heading into the Seattle-based company's third-quarter earnings report Thursday, investor focus is on Amazon Web Services, Prime membership growth and additional investments in supply chain and fulfillment. Analysts at Pacific Crest Securities, in their earnings preview, called Amazon "one of the most disruptive forces in retail and technology today."Conversations with merchants elicit a very different reaction. Since CNBC.com  began reporting  on Amazon's budding counterfeit issue in May, we've spoken with dozens of merchants that have narratives similar to Lopreiato's, but very few are willing to speak on the record out of fear of retribution from Amazon.Lopreiato, an Army veteran and father of two middle-school daughters, said he felt compelled to tell his story."If Jeff Bezos knew exactly what was happening to us, he'd do the right thing," he said. "It's not that he's a bad guy. It's that there is, in my opinion, a lot of pressure put on folks at Amazon to increase sales, increase sales, increase sales. That's wonderful. That's the American way. But do it right."Story continuesAmazon's obsessive focus on pleasing consumers with discounts and service has come at the expense of brands like Forearm Forklift. In trying to provide the lowest-cost option for virtually every product on the planet, the company  opened the doors  to merchants from across the globe with little respect for intellectual property, despite an anti-counterfeiting policy that prohibits the sale of inauthentic items.That's enabled manufacturers largely from China to take advantage of cheaper production and labor costs to compete on the Amazon market.Some big brands have voiced their concerns. Birkenstock  said in July that it's no longer authorizing sales on Amazon starting in 2017. Last week Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) sued a distributor named Mobile Star for selling counterfeit power adapters and charging cables on the site, claiming the products "pose an immediate threat to consumer safety."Amazon has taken steps to crack down of late by forcing new sellers of major brands like Nike (NYSE: NKE), Hasbro (NASDAQ: HAS) and Cuisinart to show invoices proving the items are legitimate and then pay a fee. Third-party sellers are getting  suspended  in droves for activity that Amazon deems suspicious or for complaints from buyers, sparking outrage from merchants who say they're being punished for Amazon's inability to control counterfeiting."Amazon has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeits," a company spokesperson said in an e-mailed statement. "We are working closely with manufacturers and brands to identify offenders, and removing fraudulent items from our catalog. We are also taking action and aggressively pursuing bad actors in this space."The company didn't offer a comment on Forearm Forklift's situation.Until now, Forearm Forklift has been forced to self-police the site and take action to get unauthorized listings removed. See an infringer? Send a cease-and-desist letter. Suspicious of a counterfeit? Buy it, and prove to Amazon through a formal complaint that the listing should be taken down.Repeat, repeat, repeat. And pray it works.On the second floor of Forearm Forklift's warehouse, Lopreiato opens a closet filled floor-to-ceiling with cardboard boxes from Amazon purchases. Inside each, supposedly, is a version of his product.There's no subtlety. The packaging includes not only his name and label but images of his family members and co-workers moving washing machines, armoires and exercise equipment. Open a box and find orange straps that are either too thin, too short, have loose stitching or are made of entirely different and weaker material.Lopreiato said he's submitted more than 100 cease-and-desist letters to third-party sellers and takedown notices to Amazon. But go to Amazon today, and infringers are easy to spot. One listing for furniture moving straps contains an image that looks like a couple of seat belts. Among the attached photos is one of Mark's wife moving a mattress.In a July 2015 e-mail to Amazon's patent team, Marty Proops, an Amazon marketplace expert who previously worked with Forearm Forklift on its account, said he and Lopreiato had identified 53 separate sellers offering infringing products over the past year.Buyers who assume they're getting the real thing are dismayed when the product can't possibly help them move a 300-pound refrigerator. Thus, Forearm Forklift has one-star reviews from customers calling it a "cheap knockoff (don't purchase)" and "very obvious counterfeit.""That posts on our offer page on Amazon so a lot of people think we're offering fakes," Lopreiato said.He never expected this to be easy. He developed the original contraption while working as a mover and dealing with clients who didn't want dollies rolling across new wooden floors. Carrying items by hand meant bending down with 200-pound appliances to get through doorways.Lopreiato got started renting a small warehouse in 1998 and had so little money that he lived in the office. He had an evening gig at a law firm doing clerical work and waited tables on weekends.For 12 years, Lopreiato built the business by attending trade shows and networking with distributors and buyers. He forged deals with companies ranging from U-Haul and Home Depot (NYSE: HD) to Ross Stores (NASDAQ: ROST) and Canadian Tire (Toronto Stock Exchange: CTC.A-CA).He was on QVC every two months or so starting in 2003, selling more than 20,000 Forearm Forklifts per live show at the peak. He started selling to Amazon as a vendor that same year, but it was never a big part of his business, representing under 2 percent of revenue in 2008.Lopreiato was fully prepared for competition, knowing that patent protection only goes so far. But he never expected a counterfeiting onslaught.The slide started in 2010. He got a call from an Amazon employee, saying that other sellers were offering his product at a much lower price and he needed to cut his rate to keep the business.Lopreiato investigated and quickly found the rival products were fakes. He told Amazon that he would aggressively defend his intellectual property but that he couldn't compete with those prices and still make money. Amazon was unhappy with that response, and within weeks there were more than 100 knockoffs on the site, Lopreiato said."Since that date, it's just been absolutely downhill," he said.Over the past six years, Lopreiato has seen vendor managers come and go without fixing the problem or notifying him that they're leaving.He forwarded a number of e-mails from the past two years, where he and Proops showed explicit infringement and asked for help. In addition to jeopardizing Forearm Forklift's business, Proops wrote in June 2015, "Sooner or later an Amazon customer is going to be seriously injured by one of these cheap knockoffs!"Responses ranged from terse to deflecting. Amazon told Proops to send complaints to generic e-mail addresses copyright@amazon.com and patents@amazon.com. Other e-mails suggested that the company was looking into the matter, but then the account would move to another representative.In July 2015, an Amazon lawyer told Proops by e-mail that Forearm Forklift should take up infringement matters directly with the third-party sellers. "At this time we consider this matter closed and we will take no further action," he wrote.C.J. Rosenbaum, a lawyer who represents Amazon sellers, said the rapid turnover in vendor managers and inconsistency in how they treat issues is a constant source of frustration."Amazon's responses are very erratic," said Rosenbaum, who recently published the "Amazon Law Library," a book compiling the legal issues surrounding the company and platform. "You can send in one complaint through the system about an IP violation and they take down the listing, and submit the same exact thing again and just fail."For Lopreiato, legal action presents an expensive option with little upside. Individually going after infringers, who he'd first have to track down, would require more time and money than he's got in the bank. He filed one case in 2013 against a domestic company and was awarded a settlement before trial.Taking on Amazon directly has been a nonstarter for the three intellectual property lawyers Lopreiato has contacted.More than anything, he needs Amazon's help. With traditional retailers sinking fast and more retail and wholesale activity shifting to Amazon, Forearm Forklift now counts on the site for about 12 percent of revenue, a number that's growing despite the flood of counterfeits.A tiny number of additional orders rolled in after the "Good Morning America" appearance, even though Lopreiato is certain that far more went to the knockoffs.Similarly, a Facebook page called Impressive Things posted Forearm Forklift's commercial earlier this month, generating 909,000 views and counting. Again, more revenue for the fakes.On Friday morning, Lopreiato received a particularly discouraging call.Aafes, a retailer targeting military communities, had been planning to buy Forearm Forklift for 120 of its stores. The representative handling the deal was calling Lopreiato because an Aafes executive had discovered lookalikes on Amazon for a much lower price.He e-mailed a screenshot showing two different sellers using Forearm Forklift's photos (including the one below) to promote their products, one for $8.09 and the other for $11.24.Lopreiato is all too familiar with this routine. He replied with a lengthy apology and offered assurance that the cheaper products are fakes. He gave his standard "buyer beware" pitch, explaining that the knockoffs are low quality, unsafe and uninsured.He's not at all confident that it will be enough. In a text message on Friday afternoon, Lopreiato wrote, "Another prospect will probably be lost."More From CNBC Top News and AnalysisLatest News VideoPersonal FinanceReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextLockheed Martin joins the discussion about cloud computing services in spaceGeekWireZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBC'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraph57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley Fool3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceInvesting in General Electric Is All About These 3 Key ThingsMotley FoolCardinal Timothy Dolan on the Catholic ChurchWSJ

The agency said that it was not immediately clear which teams would be affected. Its consumer units include its retail and marketplace businesses, and its food delivery service Amazon Restaurants.Amazon has expanded globally at a break-neck pace in recent years. According to Reuters, it created around 130,000 jobs worldwide last year. It’s announced plans to open a second headquarters in the US, which could create an additional 50,000 jobs.In the fourth quarter of its financial year, its full-time and part-time headcount rose by 66 per cent to 566,000. That number also includes the employees of Whole Foods. Amazon agreed to buy the high end grocer in a nearly $14bn deal in summer last year.Reuters reported that new hires were largely going into areas of high growth, like Amazon Web Services and voice-controlled computing, like home assistant Alexa.Earlier in February, chief executive Jeff Bezos said that the company’s 2017 projections for Alexa were “very optimistic” and that the company had “far exceeded them”.“We don’t see positive surprises of this magnitude very often — expect us to double down,” he added at the time.Also earlier this month, Amazon reported its largest ever profit in history of nearly $2bn, particularly helped by luring customers to its Prime fast-shipping club. Prime saw more than 4 million sign-ups in one week alone during the quarter to the end of December, and revenue from subscription fees grew 49 per cent to $3.2bn, Amazon said.In the UK, Amazon has also been on a rampant hiring drive over the past year. Last February, it said that it intends to expand its workforce in Britain by 5,000 shrugging off any uncertainty unleashed by Brexit.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

Amazon determined through planning for 2018 that certain mature areas of its business no longer required as much staff for the results it was seeking, the person said.It was unclear which specific teams inside Amazon were affected. Amazon's consumer organization includes its retail and marketplace businesses, as well as programs like food delivery service Amazon Restaurants.Seattle-based Amazon has been on a hiring tear, creating some 130,000 jobs worldwide in 2017 and announcing plans to open a second headquarters in North America, anticipating up to 50,000 more jobs there. Its full-time and part-time headcount surged 66 percent in the fourth quarter to 566,000 from a year earlier. That figure includes employees at Whole Foods Market, which Amazon acquired in a $13.7 billion deal last year.But many of the corporate jobs are going to areas of soaring profit, like cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services, or areas where Amazon sees potential, like voice-controlled computing."Our 2017 projections for Alexa were very optimistic, and we far exceeded them," said Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder and chief executive, in a statement earlier this month. "We don’t see positive surprises of this magnitude very often — expect us to double down."Amazon hopes Alexa will become a regular part of consumers' lives and will spur shopping orders by voice.The company currently has 3,900 jobs open in Seattle, and staff facing job cuts can apply for them. The company has contracts for 1 million square feet or more of new office space in the city to hire still more employees.The Seattle Times earlier reported the job cuts.(Reporting by Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco and Arjun Panchadar in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila and Cynthia Osterman)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

You could go to a store, or order from a catalog via phone, mail or online.In the past few years, Amazon (AMZN), in its position as a global juggernaut of retail, has managed to single-handedly wrench open new windows through which to buy things.So far, two of the most interesting windows have been its Alexa system, which allows ordering by voice, and the Amazon Dash button. Of the two, there’s little love for the Dash button. It doesn’t get Super Bowl ads and is generally relegated to order products “that aren’t necessarily fun to shop for,” as one Amazon spokesperson put it to Yahoo Finance.But the Dash button, which launched in March 2015, may be the best literal representation of the company’s entire genius — it makes it possible to buy something with the push of one button.“The true innovation was allowing someone to buy something with one click,” says Dean Seifert, director, Dash and Dash Replenishment Services at Amazon. “This is a physical representation of that same concept.”Less and less frictionNo one is talking about the Dash button, but people are using it to place orders, in the millions. “A dash button order is placed four times a minute,” said Seifert, who added that many customers have more than one, if they have any. (Dash buttons also exist virtually, on the Amazon website and mobile app.)The stuff that people buy is the exact kind of stuff you’d think they buy, though there’s more than 500 buttons worldwide. Batteries, soap, laundry detergent are all amongst the top items that have a Dash button. But the most-pressed Dash button of all time, unexpectedly, is Smartwater. (Bounty, however, led 2018, according to Seifert.)As mobile has become stronger and stronger — 46% of traffic and 29% of sales were made by mobile devices, according to Adobe Analytics — and Amazon Echos are popping up in more and more homes, it’s likely that this is eating some of the Dash button’s lunch. (“We’re not trying to compete. We just try to make sure the channels work well,” Seifert noted.)The luster of the full-send one-touch physical button ordering system Amazon pioneered might not shine as brightly as it once did with the myriad of new ordering options, but it all appears to be part of Amazon 3D chess.The endgameSeifert is not just the head of Dash, but the head of Dash Replenishment Services, a part of Amazon that’s endgame is even more dominating than that of a one-touch ordering system, an integrated, or even zero-touch system.The virtual version of a Dash button, thanks to the magic of APIs, can easily be linked to the device it works with — if there’s a device. The internet of things, filled with smart fridges and coffee makers may not yet be the standard, but should that be the future, the Dash product and the automatic replenishment is the logical step.In this system, the milk is ordered automatically when the fridge says its low (or it asks you, depending on your preferences), and the washer orders detergent when it’s low, and so on.Amazon isn’t the only one betting on this. Visa (V), for its part — and it’s a big portion of the payments landscape — has been looking at these types of internet of things payments as a part of the future, recently telling CNBC, “you may end up with four, five, six, eight places in your home where you could actually buy from.”Amazon has already been making progress on this with new partners like Samsung and Whirlpool, which could have a Dash function built into their appliances. As a result it could become standard. For many people, however, it would solve a problem that doesn’t exist, and would fail to give consumers a good reason to spend extra money on additional “smart” features.But for Amazon, that’s probably fine. With Dash buttons, Alexa, subscriptions, and more, there are plenty of other ways to make a sale.Ethan Wolff-Mann is a senior writer at Yahoo Finance focusing on consumer issues, tech, and personal finance.

Customers who don’t have an Echo and sign up via SiriusXM’s website for at least six months of new service, or upgrade their current plan, can get a free Echo Dot, which normally sells for $50. SiriusXM subscribers who have an Amazon device can listen to the service by linking their accounts in Amazon’s Alexa app.The deals bring together two leaders in different realms that are rapidly converging. Amazon  amzn  has sold the most smart speakers, trailed by Google  googl  and Apple  aapl  , which are frequently used to listen to audio content, including radio stations and podcasts. A survey released by Adobe last month found that listening to music was the top use for smart speakers, cited by 70% of owners.SiriusXM  siri  has over 33 million subscriber accounts, mainly listening via about 110 million car radios that tap into its satellite broadcast network, though it has struggled to find new growth markets. Shares of SiriusXM, which have gained 17% so far this year, were down about 1% in afternoon trading on Thursday.(This story was updated on October 18 to correct the number of subscribers at SiriusXM.)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceNatural Gas Price Prediction – Prices Tumble as Supplies IncreaseFX EmpireSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolCrude Oil Weekly Price Forecast – Crude oil running into resistanceFX Empire'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadget

Banks.The digital giant has acquired worldwide rights to “Consider Phlebas,” the first novel in the series about a world known as “the Culture.” Dennis Kelly (“Matilda”) is on board to adapt the book for Amazon Studios and Plan B Entertainment.“The story of the Culture is so rich and captivating that for years Hollywood has been trying to bring this utopian society to life on the screen,” said Sharon Tal Yguado, head of scripted series at Amazon Studios. “We are honored that we have been chosen, along with Dennis Kelly and Plan B Entertainment, to make ‘Consider Phlebas’ into a television series we think will be loved by fans for years to come.”Published in 1987, “Consider Phlebas” revolves around a war that erupts between the Culture, a highly advanced and progressive society, and the Idirans, a deeply religious, war-like race intent on dominating the galaxy.“Iain Banks has long been a hero of mine, and his innate warmth, humor and humanism shines through these novels,” said Kelly. “Far from being the dystopian nightmares that we are used to, Banks creates a kind of flawed paradise, a society truly worth fighting for — rather than a warning from the future, his books are a beckoning.”The Banks estate is on board as an executive producer with Plan B and Kelly.“Consider Phlebas” is in keeping with the kind of epic fantasy fare that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has sought for the entertainment arm of his empire. Amazon Studios is in the midst of an executive transition following the appointment earlier this month of NBC Entertainment president Jennifer Salke as its new leader.Related storiesDan McCarroll, Former President of Warner Bros.

It reported sales of $51 billion in the past few months, which is an increase of 43 percent from this time last year.As revealed last week, Amazon also reported that subscriptions for Amazon Music and Amazon Music Unlimited more than doubled in the past six months. Seeing as streaming music is a big part of the Echo experience, the rise in subscriptions is likely a result of an increase in Echo sales as well. As is typical with the online retail giant, it doesn't usually break down revenue by division. But we do know that of that $51 billion, $32 billion was from product sales, while $19 billion was from the sale of services.Amazon also continues to see its AWS cloud storage solution as a huge asset, especially since it's grown substantially in the past few months. "AWS lets developers do more and be nimbler, and it continues to get even better every day," said CEO Jeff Bezos in a statement.This is a very positive outlook of the company, especially on the heels of Jeff Bezos' mention that Amazon now has over 100 million paid Prime subscribers globally. It's also been busy investing in other areas, like the acquisition of Ring, a kid-friendly Alexa and potentially a cube-shaped update to its Fire TV. It's not afraid of exploring uncharted territory either, such as delivering packages directly to your car.Still, Amazon hasn't always had it easy. It had to fix an exploit where Alexa could listen in and record your private conversations and it's recently faced a barrage of criticism from the President Trump for not paying its share of taxes and for putting local retailers out of business.We'll update this report with any additional insights from the earnings call later this afternoon.This article originally appeared on Engadget.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadgetAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolNewsmaker: Diversity, inclusion will drive — or limit — success, Cerner exec saysAmerican City Business JournalsWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

This past week, Caterpillar shares dropped more than 7% and year-to0date the stock has dropped more than 15%.Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft will also be crucial reports from the tech sector, with the Nasdaq this week lagging the Dow and the S&P 500 as Netflix (NFLX) stock failed to hold on to its post-earnings gains and shares fell 4% to close the week.Earnings out of Amazon on Thursday after the market close will be on the week’s big events in a week full of crucial events for investors.MoreOn the economics side, the highlight will come Friday when investors get their first look at economic growth in the third quarter of this year.Expectations are the economy grew at an annualized pace of 3.4%, down from the 4.2% pace of growth seen in the second quarter but still capturing an acceleration in the economy’s expansion after tax cuts were passed by the Trump administration in late 2017.“Data next week are likely to show GDP growth slowing to 3.3% annualized in the third quarter,” Capital Economics said in a note to clients this week. “That would still be well above the economy’s potential growth rate but, looking under the hood, there are reasons to suspect that a sharper slowdown lies ahead.”No matter what way you cut it up, the week ahead is likely to be very busy. Buckle up.Economics calendarMonday: Chicago Fed national activity index, September (0.25 expected; 0.18 previously)Tuesday: Richmond Fed manufacturing index, October (24 expected; 29 previously)Wednesday: FHFA house price index, August (+0.3% expected; +0.2% previously); Markit Economics flash manufacturing PMI, October (55.4 expected; 55.6 previously); Markit Economics flash services PMI, October (54 expected; 53.5 previously); New home sales, September (-0.6% expected; +3.5% previously)Thursday: Initial jobless claims (213,000 expected; 210,000 previously); Durable goods orders, September (-1.4% expected; +4.4% previously); Pending home sales, September (-2.5% previously)Friday: Third quarter GDP, first estimate (+3.4% annualized pace of growth expected; +4.2% previously); University of Michigan consumer sentiment, October (99 expected; 99 previously)The housing market is sending troubling signals about the economyThe stock market is saying all is not well in the U.S. economy.A quick look at the XHB ETF (XHB) which tracks homebuilder stocks and the chart is not good. On 20 of the last 23 trading sessions through Friday, the XHB has declined. Since the beginning of the year the fund is down 24%. Just last week, homebuilder stocks fell 3.5%.So, what are the homebuilders trying to tell us about the economy?Homebuilder stocks have been getting decimated this year, reflecting broader concerns about the health of the U.S. economy. (Source: Yahoo Finance)MoreIn a note to clients this week, economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch led by Michelle Meyer said that, “while housing is no longer a tailwind, its headwinds are blowing very slowly.”“We are making a number of changes to our housing forecasts which reflect a weaker trajectory of sales, starts and home prices,” the firm said in its note. “The revisions largely reflect the decline in affordability — which is likely to continue to deteriorate with further increases in rates — and a shift toward more negative perceptions regarding housing.” Story continuesA major economic story for some time has been the lack of affordable housing in the economy.In July, Yahoo Finance’s Amanda Fung noted that the housing market had been losing significant momentum with the pace of existing home sales really starting to level off. On Friday, the September data on existing home sales indicated the pace of sales fell 3.4% from August to the lowest level since November 2015.“A decade’s high mortgage rates are preventing consumers from making quick decisions on home purchases,” said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors. “All the while, affordable home listings remain low, continuing to spur underperforming sales activity across the country.”And while the cost of housing is a story that continues to make itself felt, the biggest economic shift this year has been higher interest rates. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates three times this year. Investors expect the central bank to raise rates once more in December and up to four times in 2019, even as the Fed forecasts a slowdown in economic growth as the benefits from the Trump tax cuts fades. Higher rates are not going away.A major impact of higher rates has been an increase in the 30-year fixed mortgage rate, the mechanism by which many Americans actually experience a change in interest rates. Earlier this month, the 30-year fixed hit 4.9%, the highest since 2011.The 30-year fixed mortgage rate, which is the mechanism by which many Americans feel the impact of higher or lower interest rates, is at a 7-year high, pressuring the housing market. (Source: FRED)MoreSo with rates rising, inventory low, and prices high, it is should come as little surprise that most folks see the housing market as one that favors sellers right now.BAML economists led by the Joe Song wrote in a separate report this week that, “consumers believe the housing market has favored the seller this year. “When we ask consumers if it is a good time or bad time to sell a house, the majority of respondents have consistently reported it is a good time to sell. Unsurprisingly, that hasn’t been great for prospective home buyers.” Perhaps even more discouraging for those looking for a pick-up in home sales — and the spending on things like furniture and home improvements — the gap between current sales prices and what folks think they can afford is very wide.According to BAML, respondents to the firm’s survey of more than 3,800 consumers, respondents think they can afford to a home of $227,000 well below the median sale price of an existing home of $297,000. Millennials are, perhaps not surprisingly, the furthest away on the affordability scale, indicating the ability to afford a $198,000 home against this $297,000 median price.“With home prices continuing to track higher, albeit more gradually, finding affordable housing will be a greater challenge for millennials and for all prospective homebuyers,” BAML said. Prospective homebuyers see the likely price they could afford for a home today well below the median sales price for an existing home right now.

Based on the homeownership rate in the fields Amazon is hiring for, HotPads estimated how many renters the new headquarters would be expected to bring in each yeariii, and how this influx of new renters would affect each metro's supply of available rentals.Among the U.S. metros still vying for Amazon's second headquarters, Raleigh is one of the more affordable rental markets still in the running. The median rent in Raleigh is $1,470, up about 3.4 percent over the past year. Population wise, Raleigh is the smallest metro still under consideration for HQ2 and typically has about 10,800 available rental units on the market each year.If Amazon HQ2 went to Columbus, rental supply would need to increase by 22.1 percent to keep rent growth steady, which equates to building about 2,480 additional rental units a year. Nashville would need to increase its supply of available rental units by 15.2 percent a year, or 2,000 additional rental units. The median rent in Columbus is $1,410 a month, and the median rent in Nashville is $1,505 a month."An influx of new residents will inevitably influence the rental market, particularly in smaller markets like Raleigh and Columbus," said Joshua Clark, economist at HotPads. "Both Raleigh and Columbus have seen remarkable growth in recent years, but if selected, they'll have to undergo the most dramatic building boom to accommodate Amazon HQ2 and keep rent inflation at current levels. However, finding available land has been a recurring issue for both Amazon and housing developers in Seattle – so areas with more buildable space like Raleigh and Columbus may have an advantage when it comes to building for Amazon's future. No matter which city is chosen for HQ2, planning in advance will be critical as developers, city officials and renters adapt to a new normal that includes a strong and ever-growing tech workforce."Among the U.S. metros on Amazon's shortlist, the New York City metro would see the smallest impact on available rental inventory from HQ2. New York City typically has about 213,200 available rentals on the market each year and would need to increase its supply of available rental units by just 1.5 percent a year to keep rent growth steady.HotPads is a Zillow® Group-owned apartment and home search platform for renters in urban areas across the United States.

(NASDAQ:Z and ZG).HotPads is a registered trademark of Zillow, Inc.i For this analysis, HotPads used data from the U.S. Census Bureau to estimate the number of renters that will move to Amazon's second headquarters location, based on the renter rate for the five job categories outlined in Amazon's HQ2 Request for Proposal. HotPads then paired the Census data with its own quarterly rental inventory data on the typical flow of new rental listings – which includes new construction and existing rentals that have been off-market for a year or more – to determine how many available rental units each market will need in a year to accommodate the expected number of new renters. For more information about this methodology, email press@hotpads.com. ii Per Amazon's HQ2 Request for Proposaliii HotPads assumed a constant rate of hiring for all job types over 7.5 years – approximately the amount of time it took for Amazon's Seattle headquarters to reach its current capacity.iv HotPads also analyzed what the impact would be on the Seattle metro area's supply of available rental units if Amazon doubled the number of employees in its current headquarters instead of opening HQ2.CisionMoreView original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/amazon-effect-hq2-would-have-the-greatest-impact-on-rental-inventory-in-raleigh-and-columbus-300711010.htmlReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

Amazon, which acquired robot-maker Kiva Systems for $775 million in 2012, now has 100,000 robots zipping across 75-plus fulfillment centers in the U.S.“In the same time as we’ve deployed 100,000 robots, we’ve actually hired 315,000 people,” Wilke explained during a recent interview with Yahoo Finance, which selected Amazon as the Company of 2017. “We have continued to add humans to robots, and I think that’s going to continue for a long time across the economy.”Amazon Worldwide Consumer CEO Jeff WilkeMoreIn fact, Wilke contended that the concept of technology outright eliminating work is a “myth,” based on the last 100 years of technological change and its effect on the broader economy. Sure, some jobs will be lost, but new kinds of jobs for humans will be created — a theory, at least partly borne out by third-party estimates. According to Forrester Research, 16% of U.S. jobs will be replaced, while the equivalent of 9% new jobs will be created — a net loss of 7% of U.S. jobs by 2025. In the long-term, it’s possible that gap could shrink further. At Amazon’s fulfillment center in Tracy, California — one of more than 75 across the country — some 3,500 people work in tandem with hundreds of robots. After a customer clicks the “Buy” button on Amazon.com, Amazon’s computer algorithms tell one of the robots to pick up the shelf containing that item and bring the shelf to an employee, who picks out the item and sends it on its way to other stations to be packaged and eventually delivered — a highly efficient process Amazon has honed over the years.There are hundreds of robots zipping around Amazon’s fulfillment center in Tracy, California.MoreFor Amazon, offering such streamlined warehouse processes is vital for quickly training workers — it hired 120,000 seasonal workers this holiday season, similar to 2016 — so they can hit the ground running and meet holiday demand. (The Seattle tech giant plans on hiring thousands more employees in 2018, according to jobs site Glassdoor.) Between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday this year, 140 million products were ordered from and fulfilled by third-party sellers via Amazon, Wilke told Yahoo Finance. “What’s happened is, technology changes work,” said Wilke. “It changes the work of humans. “It allows them to do higher-quality work. It allows them to be more efficient. It allows them to be safer. I think that kind of thing is going to continue.” Click here to read more about why Yahoo Finance chose Amazon as its company of 2017 and here to learn more about Amazon’s plans for Alexa.

Danielle asked that the news outlet not use her last name.In an interview with KIRO, Amazon said the issue was “very, very rare.” According to an Amazon spokesperson, the device was triggered to record and send the audio by background noise. Here is the company’s official statement:Echo woke up due to a word in background conversation sounding like “Alexa.” Then, the subsequent conversation was heard as a “send message” request. At which point, Alexa said out loud “To whom?” At which point, the background conversation was interpreted as a name in the customers contact list. Alexa then asked out loud, “[contact name], right?” Alexa then interpreted background conversation as “right”. As unlikely as this string of events is, we are evaluating options to make this case even less likely.Danielle, who immediately unplugged all her Amazon Alexa devices, has requested a refund for her Amazon Alexa devices, reports KIRO.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextThe best lawnmowers to buy right nowThe TelegraphAmazon Music Is Available for Free NowRolling StoneWhat to Watch this weekend: The season premiere of Bosch and Tonya Harding on Worst Cooks in AmericaEntertainment WeeklyGet this $20 Alexa smart speaker instead of a $50 Echo DotBGR NewsZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolNatural Gas Price Prediction – Prices Tumble as Supplies IncreaseFX EmpireSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphCrude Oil Weekly Price Forecast – Crude oil running into resistanceFX Empire'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolA Look At The Fair Value Of Westlake Chemical Corporation (NYSE:WLK)Simply Wall St.What are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo Finance3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceInvesting in General Electric Is All About These 3 Key ThingsMotley FoolRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

Bezos says he and his wife, MacKenzie, have decided to divorce after 25 years of marriage. Bezos, one of the world’s richest men, made the announcement on Twitter Wednesday, Jan. 9, 2019. (Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP, File)MoreSEATTLE (AP) — Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie, are divorcing, ending a 25-year marriage that played a role in the creation of an e-commerce company that made Bezos one of the world's wealthiest people.The decision to divorce comes after a trial separation, according to a statement posted Wednesday on Jeff Bezos' Twitter account. He and his wife both signed the announcement, which ended with a vow to remain "cherished friends.""If we had known we would separate after 25 years, we would do it all again," the couple said.Left unanswered was one of the biggest sticking points in any divorce: How the assets amassed during the marriage will be divided.And there may never have been more money than in this case.Jeff Bezos is ranked at the top of most lists of the world's wealthiest people, and his fortune currently hovers around $137 billion, according to estimates by both Forbes and Bloomberg. Virtually all of that is tied up in the nearly 79 million shares of Amazon stock (currently worth about $130 billion) that Bezos owns, translating into a 16 percent stake in the Seattle company. Bezos, 54, also owns rocket ship maker Blue Origin and The Washington Post, which he bought for $250 million in 2013.Because the pair were married before Amazon was founded, it's likely that MacKenzie Bezos, a 48-year-old novelist, holds a large claim to that fortune, though details hinge on where the couple files for divorce and if they had a prenuptial agreement.King County, where their home is located, confirmed on Twitter Wednesday that the Bezoses had not filed for divorce in court. The couple own a home in a wealthy Seattle suburb within the county. Jeff Bezos also bought a mansion in a swanky Washington D.C. neighborhood last year for $23 million. The Bezoses have four children."The property acquired during the marriage is common property," said Jennifer Payseno, a family lawyer at the firm McKinley Irvin in Seattle. That includes stock ownership, although Amazon has not filed any regulatory documents to suggest Bezos' stake in the company has changed. Amazon didn't respond to inquiries about how the divorce may affect that stake.The Bezoses will almost certainly settle the divorce outside of court, if they haven't already, said Jacqueline Newman, a Manhattan divorce lawyer and managing partner at Berkman Bottger Newman & Rodd."For the most part, they're going to want to keep things private and quiet," she said. "Especially in the case of a public company, they're not going to want information to leak because it could ultimately affect stock prices."Amazon's stock edged up $2.84 Wednesday to close at $1,659.42. That left Amazon with a market value of $811 billion, more than any other publicly traded company in the U.S.The amicable tenor of the Bezoses' divorce announcement makes it highly likely that the couple already has reached an agreement on how to divide their assets, Payseno said.Jeff Bezos' tremendous wealth has magnified the focus on him, although his divorce seems unlikely to enthrall the public like high-profile breakups involving movie stars such as Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Or even those of other billionaires, such as Donald Trump's tabloid-fodder split with his first wife Ivana in the early 1990s, long before he was elected president.But the Bezos divorce seems likely to attract more attention than when Google co-founder Sergey Brin — currently worth $49 billion — divorced his former wife Anne in 2015.Amazon's origins trace back to a road trip that the Bezoses took together not long after they met in New York while working at hedge fund D.E. Shaw. They got married just six months after they began dating, according to Bezos.Not long after that, Jeff Bezos quit his job at Shaw and started an online bookstore. While his wife did the cross-country driving, Bezos wrote a business plan on the way to Seattle — chosen for its abundance of tech talent. By July 1995, Amazon was operating out of a garage, with MacKenzie Bezos lending a hand, according to a review she posted on Amazon in 2013 panning "The Everything Store," a book about Bezos and the company written by Brad Stone."I was there when he wrote the business plan, and I worked with him and many others represented in the converted garage, the basement warehouse closet, the barbecue-scented offices, the Christmas-rush distribution centers, and the door-desk filled conference rooms in the early years of Amazon's history," she recalled.Story continuesAmazon has since evolved from an upstart website selling books to an e-commerce goliath that sells virtually all imaginable merchandise and runs data centers that power many other digital services such as Netflix. It also has become a leader in intelligent voice-activated speakers with its Echo products, which are emerging as command centers for internet-connected homes — and a gateway to buying more stuff from Amazon.___Michael Liedtke reported from San Francisco.

StockVince MartinInvestorPlaceMay 17, 2018ReblogShareTweetShareWhatever one thinks of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock, there’s no question that the company still needs to grow into its valuation. That’s going to require continued revenue growth — and margin expansion. And that in turn makes the company’s Amazon Fresh initiative an interesting glimpse into the future of AMZN stock.That’s because, in many ways, Amazon Fresh is a microcosm of the opportunities — and risks — facing Amazon.com. The grocery home-delivery service needs to beat out competitors like Peapod and Instacart.Amazon no doubt is losing money on its initial efforts, with hopes of creating a profitable business somewhere down the line. And longer term, the core question is whether Amazon at some point can expand its margins — and its profits — before investors get anxious.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSuccess in Amazon Fresh doesn’t necessarily make AMZN stock a buy. But a failure here might raise some concerns about the rest of the company’s potential in several key areas.What Is Amazon Fresh?Amazon Fresh is the company’s new grocery delivery service. Like Peapod and Instacart, the service allows for next-day and even same-day delivery, albeit for now only in a few major areas. Fresh requires a $14.99 per month fee on top of Amazon Prime membership, and orders under $40 add on a $9.99 delivery fee.  25 Unstoppable Stocks to Buy No Matter What  What’s interesting about the pricing is that, unlike in many other categories, Amazon isn’t necessarily undercutting competition.Peapod, for instance, charges a fee per order, but it’s just $6.95-$9.95 per order, with no membership charges. A consumer would have to use Amazon Fresh at least twice a month for its fees to be lower. The Instacart Express offering has a $149 annual fee, which in turn generates free delivery for all orders over $10.For now, Amazon’s offerings are limited to mostly major metro areas. And while Amazon hasn’t broken out any numbers on the business in terms of sales, it appears to be an exceedingly tiny part of the company’s overall revenue — for now. But for a number of reasons, even this small effort is an interesting test case for Amazon’s broader strategy.Amazon and CompetitionAmazon is behind in the space, which traditionally hasn’t served the company well. The company has had huge success in online retail and in cloud services, both areas where it was a first mover.But in hardware, Amazon’s catch-up efforts failed. It still lags Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in video. It’s behind Spotify Technology SA (NYSE:SPOT) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in music.Fears of an Amazon entrance have cast shadows over stocks in pharmaceuticals, health care and even photo prints. But as I wrote last month, there’s some evidence that Amazon’s bark is much worse than its bite. Traditionally, the company has struggled to dislodge entrenched competition (the recent rebound in shares of W W Grainger Inc (NYSE:GWW) is an interesting example).And given that bulls are expecting 20%+ revenue growth for years to come, it’s going to need to prove that it can win in new areas, not just threaten established operators. If its scale and distribution can’t drive it past two privately held, smaller companies, investors may begin to wonder if Amazon will be able to conquer territory held by larger, more experienced operators.The Margin Question for AMZNJim Cramer made the point last week that “No one is holding Amazon to a profit standard, just a growth standard.” I’ve long argued that Amazon stock can’t be judged just on its sky-high P/E because investors need to understand that the company currently has depressed margins thanks to its myriad investments, including Fresh.But at some point, Amazon is going to have to prove that it can actually start earning money. And Amazon Fresh highlights two ways in which the company can do so.First, Fresh in theory should be a relatively simple expansion of its existing investments. Amazon already has established a huge base of Prime users. It’s acquired Whole Foods Market. It’s built a distribution capability that’s second to none.It should be able to operate Amazon Fresh at a lower cost than anyone else, whether that’s Peapod and Instacart or Kroger Co (NYSE:KR) and Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT).Secondly, the company already is pushing its private-label products on Amazon Fresh. That’s part of a broader strategy which also includes apparel and which should in turn help Amazon margins.Story continuesThe third driver here is that Amazon Fresh fee income should be close to pure profit. So is the recent price increase for Amazon Prime itself. This is a company with 3% operating margins. It only takes a few hundred basis points of improvement to double Amazon’s profits, or more. How Amazon Fresh rolls out could show how easy — or how difficult — that expansion will be.Is AMZN Stock a Buy?I still think Amazon has a clear path to a $1-trillion valuation, as I wrote back in November. But I’ll also admit that the recent run to almost $1,600 has undercut some of my long-held optimism toward AMZN.From here, AMZN looks attractive but perhaps not quite compelling. Should the company post wins in Amazon Fresh and similar initiatives, and those margins start rising, there’s an obvious path for the huge, multiyear run in Amazon.com stock to continue.  Amazon Rolls Out New Whole Foods Discount for Prime Members  But if investor confidence gets weakened at all at these levels, there may be an opportunity to buy Amazon stock at a much cheaper price.More From InvestorPlace  Rising Gas Prices?

The company has had huge success in online retail and in cloud services, both areas where it was a first mover.But in hardware, Amazon’s catch-up efforts failed. It still lags Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in video. It’s behind Spotify Technology SA (NYSE:SPOT) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in music.Fears of an Amazon entrance have cast shadows over stocks in pharmaceuticals, health care and even photo prints. But as I wrote last month, there’s some evidence that Amazon’s bark is much worse than its bite. Traditionally, the company has struggled to dislodge entrenched competition (the recent rebound in shares of W W Grainger Inc (NYSE:GWW) is an interesting example).And given that bulls are expecting 20%+ revenue growth for years to come, it’s going to need to prove that it can win in new areas, not just threaten established operators. If its scale and distribution can’t drive it past two privately held, smaller companies, investors may begin to wonder if Amazon will be able to conquer territory held by larger, more experienced operators.The Margin Question for AMZNJim Cramer made the point last week that “No one is holding Amazon to a profit standard, just a growth standard.” I’ve long argued that Amazon stock can’t be judged just on its sky-high P/E because investors need to understand that the company currently has depressed margins thanks to its myriad investments, including Fresh.But at some point, Amazon is going to have to prove that it can actually start earning money. And Amazon Fresh highlights two ways in which the company can do so.First, Fresh in theory should be a relatively simple expansion of its existing investments. Amazon already has established a huge base of Prime users. It’s acquired Whole Foods Market. It’s built a distribution capability that’s second to none.It should be able to operate Amazon Fresh at a lower cost than anyone else, whether that’s Peapod and Instacart or Kroger Co (NYSE:KR) and Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT).Secondly, the company already is pushing its private-label products on Amazon Fresh. That’s part of a broader strategy which also includes apparel and which should in turn help Amazon margins.Story continuesThe third driver here is that Amazon Fresh fee income should be close to pure profit. So is the recent price increase for Amazon Prime itself. This is a company with 3% operating margins. It only takes a few hundred basis points of improvement to double Amazon’s profits, or more. How Amazon Fresh rolls out could show how easy — or how difficult — that expansion will be.Is AMZN Stock a Buy?I still think Amazon has a clear path to a $1-trillion valuation, as I wrote back in November. But I’ll also admit that the recent run to almost $1,600 has undercut some of my long-held optimism toward AMZN.From here, AMZN looks attractive but perhaps not quite compelling. Should the company post wins in Amazon Fresh and similar initiatives, and those margins start rising, there’s an obvious path for the huge, multiyear run in Amazon.com stock to continue.  Amazon Rolls Out New Whole Foods Discount for Prime Members  But if investor confidence gets weakened at all at these levels, there may be an opportunity to buy Amazon stock at a much cheaper price.More From InvestorPlace  Rising Gas Prices?

We tested two popular online grocery delivery services, Amazon Fresh and Peapod, and compared cost, convenience and service to see who came out on top. Amazon Fresh is currently available in Seattle, California, New York, and Philadelphia. Currently, you must be a Prime member to use Fresh, and there’s an additional monthly membership of $14.99. Peapod has a wider reach—it’s available in 12 states and Washington, DC. There’s no membership fee, though it does have optional membership programs through its PodPass program. You pay a fee and receive free deliveries. Otherwise, delivery costs range from $6.95-$9.95. Orders and deliveryWhen it came to ordering, Amazon has no delivery minimum, compared to Peapod, which had a $60 minimum.  Both offer a 2-hour delivery window, but Peapod had some discounted options depending on the day and time you place your order. We placed our orders the day before at 3 p.m,, and set a delivery window of 9-11 a.m. The Amazon groceries arrived at 9:36 a.m., and we were notified with a text from the driver directly. Peapod experienced delays and didn’t arrive until 11:22 a.m. While we did receive text updates from customer service, we couldn’t reach our driver directly. a We were told the driver couldn’t find our address, so anytime we wanted an update on delivery time, we had to go through customer service, who would call the driver, and then call us back. So this round goes to Amazon for promptness, and more direct communication. When we got our groceries, Amazon gave us coolers, which get picked up with your next order.  The frozen items were packed with dry ice and ice packs in a separate cooler. Peapod puts everything in regular plastic bags, which means no ice packs! Peapod customer service told us the groceries are kept in insulated coolers and packed with dry-ice on their delivery trucks, and our frozen items were still well-frozen on delivery. Still, Amazon takes another win in this round. PriceWhen it came to the price of our groceries, it was a tie for the two grocery giants. Amazon Fresh was cheaper for produce, meat and fish, and dairy items. A 4-pack of avocados on Amazon was $3.49, $2 less than Peapod’s price of $5.49. Their chicken was also a bargain buster, at $4.42 per pound, compared to $7.33 at Peapod. But Peapod inched ahead it when it came to staples, grains, and frozen items. A 25-ounce container of olive oil was $12.99, compared to Amazon’s price of $14.19. Their brand of frozen peas was just $1.09, slightly cheaper than $1.39 at Amazon. That spare change adds up: We spent $74.77 at Peapod and $81 at Amazon Fresh. They both had a $10 delivery fee, though Peapod varies from $6.95-$9.95, depending on the size of the delivery. But Peapod offers coupons through the mail, which often negate the cost of delivery. Peapod snags a last round win, for being more affordable overall, with no monthly fee. So who reigns supreme? If you don’t mind the extra fees or are already a Prime Member, our money’s on Amazon. But if you’re looking at your bottom line, Peapod is the better bargain, and is available in more states.

The internet giant has confirmed a third season of the 1950s comedy/drama before the second season has even premiered -- and that's after ordering two seasons right out of the gate. That kind of trust in a show isn't completely unheard of for Amazon (just ask the creators of Jack Ryan), but it's rare when streaming services frequently order one season and wait until after a show's debut to make another commitment.The decision isn't exactly coming out of left field. Mrs. Maiselwon two Golden Globes in January, and it just picked up a Peabody. There's a very real possibility that the second season (due later in 2018) is in line for more awards, including Emmys. Amazon thrives on the prestige associated with these prizes, especially now that it's focused on producing widely appealing blockbusters. Meld that with the consistent quality of creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and a third season may have been more a question of "when" than "if."Variety, Rachel Brosnahan (Twitter)This article originally appeared on Engadget.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksWalmart Wants to Take On Amazon in Digital AdvertisingMotley FoolWill Amazon (AMZN) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?ZacksZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo Finance1 Big Reason Why Disney Stock Is Just Getting StartedMotley FoolSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance'American Ninja Warrior Junior': Get an exclusive sneak peek at the semi-finals!AOL.comWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergCoachella Weekend 2: What to Watch ForVariety

Image source: MercadoLibre.The Amazon is in Brazil, after all...Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN), the global leader in e-commerce, has been in meetings with a number of manufacturers as it ramps up plans to warehouse and sell a wide array of products in Brazil, according to a report by Reuters. The company wants to sell everything from perfume to consumer electronics in Latin America's largest retail market. Amazon will also be deploying its own call centers and transportation assets in Brazil, according to the report.  Until now, Amazon has proceeded cautiously with its entry into Brazil's online arena due to the complexity and unique attributes of the local market. Amazon first began selling e-books in the country in 2012, gradually introducing physical books later on.

Image source: MercadoLibre.The Amazon is in Brazil, after all...Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN), the global leader in e-commerce, has been in meetings with a number of manufacturers as it ramps up plans to warehouse and sell a wide array of products in Brazil, according to a report by Reuters. The company wants to sell everything from perfume to consumer electronics in Latin America's largest retail market. Amazon will also be deploying its own call centers and transportation assets in Brazil, according to the report.  Until now, Amazon has proceeded cautiously with its entry into Brazil's online arena due to the complexity and unique attributes of the local market.

I think it goes down first," said Mark Newton, technical analyst at Newton Advisors, on CNBC's " Trading Nation " on Wednesday.A decline to $1,650 represents a 17 percent drop from current levels, pushing it into a correction but shy the 20 percent decrease that marks a bear market.Newton says Amazon's moves in recent sessions have raised some technical flags that point to a possible pullback."RSI now, on a monthly basis, is at 89.5, the highest level overbought that it's been since 1999. At that time obviously Amazon had a very difficult time as did most stocks into 2002, 2003," said Newton.Its monthly relative strength index, which measures momentum changes, was last as high as 90 in April 1999. From that peak to its bottom in September 2001, Amazon shares plummeted 95 percent."Even on a weekly basis when you see that RSI gauge over 75 (for example, it's happened about six times just since 2015 alone), five of those six times you were actually down over 10 percent, as much as 20 percent, really in the two to three months that followed," said Newton.Boris Schlossberg , managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management, also sees its big swing higher as a warning sign."Amazon, of course, is the ultimate momentum stock at this point," said Schlossberg on "Trading Nation" on Wednesday. "I would not want to chase it at this point. I think it's too dangerous."Schlossberg has a strategy for playing Amazon's surge in anticipation of any market pullback."If I was going to sell it, I would sell it against the other $1 trillion company, Apple. I would do a pairs trade — short Amazon, long Apple," Schlossberg explained. "If we do get any kind of pullback in the market, I think the market is going to run to safety of cash-rich companies and Apple is going to outperform Amazon."Amazon has seen gains more than double Apple in 2018 so far. In the year to date, Amazon has climbed 71 percent, while Apple has increased 32 percent.More From CNBC Advanced Micro just did something it hasn't done since the dot-com bubbleThree incredible stats about Apple as it tracks for its best month since 2012Classic chart pattern points to S&P 3,500ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksWalmart Wants to Take On Amazon in Digital AdvertisingMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

The company said today it plans to adjust wages and bonuses to ensure those workers don’t receive lower wages as a result.Senator Bernie Sanders, critical of large firms paying low wages, praised Amazon’s initial announcement, then questioned the company after reports indicated some workers would have lower annual income.A company spokesperson told Fortune that all hourly employees “will see an increase in their total compensation as a result of this announcement.” Amazon said it has worked “site by site and person by person” to adjust wages.For warehouse workers at lower pay tiers in particular, routine productivity bonuses that the company offered, and which were increased around the holidays, could add hundreds or thousands of dollars a year in income. Amazon cut these bonuses as part of its rise in base pay, but said the higher hourly rate would “more than compensate” for the difference. “Because it’s no longer incentive-based, the compensation will be more immediate and predictable,” a spokesperson said.The company also formerly issued warehouse workers restricted stock units (RSUs), which vest on their employment anniversary, after which point employees own the shares and may retain or sell them. Workers received 1 RSU for each anniversary and an additional one to mark five years with the company. Existing grants that vest in 2019 and 2020 remain in place, and those employees will receive the stock if they remain employees to those anniversaries, while also receiving increased wages.In lieu of stock, Amazon will pay a cash bonus of $1,500 at five years, and $3,000 at each subsequent five-year employment anniversary. An Amazon share is worth nearly $1,755 on Oct. 10. Warehouse workers making below $15 an hour currently will receive raises that amount between $2,000 and $7,000 more a year, depending on location, length of employment, and position.In a particularly apt remark given today’s stock market decline, especially among tech stocks, Amazon said that while employees “have benefited from a bull market and the unusually strong appreciation of Amazon’s stock price in recent years,” it’s not guaranteed to continue. However, Amazon will offer a direct stock purchase plan for employees starting in 2019.The Seattle Times and other outlets interviewing workers by name and anonymously have found that information about the $15-an-hour minimum wage and other wage and bonus changes have been unevenly communicated to workers.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolWalmart Wants to Take On Amazon in Digital AdvertisingMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolNatural Gas Price Prediction – Prices Tumble as Supplies IncreaseFX EmpireSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphCrude Oil Weekly Price Forecast – Crude oil running into resistanceFX EmpireWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

And it was an even shorter one year later that it bailed on its project.“We want to be a large company that’s also an invention machine,” wrote Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in his 2015 letter to shareholders.“We want to combine the extraordinary customer-serving capabilities that are enabled by size with the speed of movement, nimbleness, and risk-acceptance mentality normally associated with entrepreneurial start-ups. Can we do it? I’m optimistic.”Amazon CEO Jeff BezosMoreBloomberg reported that it took “a lot of convincing” for Bezos to be comfortable with the deal, which was far bigger than any acquisition Amazon has made in its history.“Most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70% of the information you wish you had,” Bezos wrote in this year’s letter to Amazon shareholders. Ultimately, then, Bezos took something like his own advice.“If you wait for 90%, in most cases, you’re probably being slow,” Bezos wrote. “Plus, either way, you need to be good at quickly recognizing and correcting bad decisions. If you’re good at course correcting, being wrong may be less costly than you think, whereas being slow is going to be expensive for sure.”In other words, act boldly and decisively. Acquiring a grocery store chain for almost $14 billion is, most would agree, a bold and decisive move.But that it was an acquisition large in size need not mean it is one Amazon will be committed to if it does not further the company’s goal to be “earth’s most customer centric company.”Because while so much of the commentary around the deal has focused on what this deal might mean for consumers, Stratechery’s Ben Thompson argued on Monday that Whole Foods did not get snapped up by Amazon as a selling platform, but as a customer of Amazon’s services.In this sense, then, Amazon’s ability to leverage its logistical expertise to service Whole Foods better will be the marker of the deal’s success, not an increase in same-store sales at Whole Foods locations.And with Amazon’s investor base clearly having been trained to give Bezos and his management team the benefit of the strategic doubt, expect investors to be willing to look past a continuation of discouraging sales trends at Whole Foods.It may still, however, turn out that Amazon, which has tried to make a splash in the fresh food space with its AmazonFresh business, cannot leverage Whole Foods’ resources as an answer to its efforts to break into food. And if this is the case, Amazon will probably be fine with it.—Myles Udland is a writer at Yahoo Finance.

Stocks are at record highs. And some of the biggest names in the market are set to report fourth quarter earnings.In the week ahead, the latest Federal Reserve meeting and the January jobs reports will be economic highlights, after this past week revealed that the economy grew at a slower pace than expected during the final three months of 2017.No change is expected in the Fed’s interest rate policy and there will be no press conference with Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen after the meeting. The central bank should keep its benchmark interest rate target pegged between 1.25%-1.50%.

They don’t like to talk about narratives.”For Shiller, the most likely story right now is that the current run we’re seeing in the stock market is a descendent of the 1928 stock market, which boomed under a pro-business president before the crash of 1929 which ushered in the Great Depression. And whether you’re a stock market bull or bear, no one likes to hear that a repeat of the 1929 crash is right around the corner.But Shiller’s probing for one big story to explain the market comes at a time when it does seems as if there are a few market themes most investors agree on.Robert ShillerMoreFor one, global economic growth is strong and likely to remain strong through the end of the decade, as the IMF laid out this week. Another is that the tax cuts passed by the Trump administration last year were not priced into the market. This second idea is, of course, related to the first — strong growth will continue because taxes are now lower in the world’s largest economy. And the market is only now accepting this relationship.Story continuesBut a third idea gaining traction is that whether it’s wage announcements due to lower taxes, investor optimism on the rise, or participation among retail investors surging, everything happening in markets and the economy right now is late cycle behavior. So everything is good right now, but everyone also knows it won’t last forever.The current enthusiasm about markets and the economy, then, appears less an echo of the 1929 market which saw proclamations of markets having reached a new “permanently high plateau” and more a reflection of an investor class that knows business cycles still exist. Central bank actions after the financial crisis may have changed the length and shape of the current cycle, but ultimately rising employment, rising asset prices, and rising leverage overheat an economy and the excesses are burned off.What ends each economic cycle and what the negative impacts are from a cycle’s end are unique in each downturn. But the story right now might be that for all of the optimism among consumers, politicians, business leaders, and investors, no one thinks there won’t be another downturn.—Myles Udland is a writer at Yahoo Finance.

Indeed, a subwoofer would add much-needed bass to Amazon's Echo range of smart speakers, which critics say have a relatively thin sound compared with speakers like the Alexa-powered Sonos One.Leaked Amazon Sub imageMoreAmazon UK via PocketLintThe listing also notes a new feature that enables two compatible Echo speakers to pair together and deliver true stereo sound. Currently, Amazon's Echo speakers can be paired, but not in stereo — the sound isn't separated into left and right channels, but simply duplicated. Adding stereo functionality could allow Echo speakers to deliver a more dynamic sound and better position Echo devices as primary sound systems rather than only smart speakers.The Smart Plug is a wall-power-outlet adapter designed to give basic Alexa functionality to any device plugged into it. For example, a lamp plugged into the Smart Plug could be controlled with Alexa using your voice at home or the app while you're away, or you could set a schedule to turn it on and off.Leaked Amazon Smart PlugMoreAmazon UK via Pocket-lintThe Smart Plug's price tag seems a bit steep compared with other smart plugs sold on Amazon that also work with Alexa and cost $10 to $30. We might find out during Amazon's event why the Smart Plug is so expensive.Both device listings showed availability on October 11, according to Pocket-lint.We're likely to get the details of these new devices on Thursday — if Amazon plans to announce them during the event.

The new device costs $50 and is available starting today. So, what's different about this year's model?The retailer says that the new Echo Dot is 70% louder than the previous model. Additionally, it sports a new fabric-covered design — a design, it should be noted, that makes it look a lot like Google's Home Mini smart speaker.The Echo Dot miniature smart speaker is Amazon's best-selling Echo product, and Amazon says it's the "best-selling speaker ever." The update to the Echo Dot was unveiled alongside several new devices at an event in Seattle on Thursday.In case you're not familiar, the Echo Dot is one of Amazon's many Alexa-powered devices. You can ask it questions, command it to play music, and even order stuff from Amazon — all of that is powered by Amazon's voice assistant "Alexa." The Echo Dot is Amazon's most popular version of its Echo devices. It's small, inexpensive, and widely available.Echo DotMoreJeff Chiu/APMore than just a louder version of last year's speaker, the updated Echo Dot adds a new mic array to hear commands more clearly. And the louder sound isn't just boosted volume, but louder sound "with lower distortion and enhanced bass reproduction."In so many words, Amazon claims the new Echo Dot is much louder, and the sound it's producing is of a higher quality.Beyond the new look and updated sound, the 2018 Echo Dot is still a Bluetooth speaker, and it still has a line out port so you can use it to control other, more traditional speakers in your home.One other thing that hasn't changed: The price.

Amazon Just Raised the Cost of Prime — But Only for Some MembersYahooSearchNo matching results for ''Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsGive feedback on the new search experienceCancelSign inMailFinanceWatchlistsMy PortfolioScreenersMarketsIndustriesVideosNewsPersonal FinanceTechU.S. Markets closedS&P 5002,905.03+4.58(+0.16%)Dow 3026,559.54+110.00(+0.42%)Nasdaq7,998.06+1.98(+0.02%)Russell 20001,565.75-1.85(-0.12%)Crude Oil64.000.00(0.00%)Gold1,277.90+1.90(+0.15%)Silver14.97+0.01(+0.07%)EUR/USD1.12470.0000(-0.0000%)Amazon Just Raised the Cost of Prime — But Only for Some MembersBrad TuttleMoneyJanuary 19, 2018ReblogShareTweetShareAre you affected?MoreOn Friday, Amazon surprised customers by increasing the price of Amazon Prime for some members.Prime subscribers who pay on a monthly basis will now be charged $12.99, up from $10.99. Monthly Prime Student subscriptions, available to college students, were also subject to a price hike, rising from $5.49 to $6.49 per month.Prices for annual Prime memberships remain unchanged, at $99 per year for regular customers, and $49 per year for students. All Prime members receive free two-day shipping on most Amazon orders, as well as access to unlimited streaming of Amazon video and music content.Obviously, the annual membership is a much better deal for anyone maintaining a Prime subscription over the course of 12 months or more. The total cost of a by-the-month Amazon Prime membership now runs just under $156 for a year, up from around $132.The new price hikes have likely been instituted to nudge monthly Prime members into becoming annual members. Prime members tend to be wealthy, and tend to spend significantly more at Amazon than non-Prime members. But the option of monthly memberships, introduced in 2016, offered customers the possibility of taking advantage of Amazon Prime for only a brief period: People could sign up for a single month—perhaps during the winter holiday shopping season—simply to get free shipping on multiple orders. Amazon could easily be losing money on such Prime customers, assuming they remembered to cancel subscriptions at the end of the month.By jacking up monthly Prime prices, Amazon will at least be extracting more money from these customers—thereby helping the e-retail giant recover some of its shipping costs.Amazon’s monthly Prime price hikes could also help convince some customers that it’s more worthwhile to become annual Prime members. And that’s one of Amazon’s ultimate goals: It wants as many customers to pay for Amazon Prime upfront and in full, and it wants them to be loyal Amazon shoppers year in, year out.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaThe Morning After: The Weather Channel got hackedEngadgetTrailers of the Week: 'Child's Play,' 'Hobbs and Shaw,' 'Big Little Lies 2'Rolling StoneWhere to Stream Movies FreeConsumer ReportsAmazon Music's free ad-supported tier is now available for all Alexa usersBGR NewsZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraph57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCN'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley Fool3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceInvesting in General Electric Is All About These 3 Key ThingsMotley FoolCardinal Timothy Dolan on the Catholic ChurchWSJ

But what happens once the campaign is over? Enter Amazon (AMZN), which launched a new partnership that hopes to keep the momentum going even after a Kickstarter project meets, or exceeds, its funding goal.Ahead of the company’s blowout quarter on Thursday, Amazon announced a collaboration with Kickstarter that now features more than 300 products hatched on the crowdfunding platform. The new collaboration with Kickstarter is part of LaunchPad, a one-year-old program that showcases products from startups. Now, products launched on Kickstarter will be available for purchase on Amazon.com. In addition to being available on a standalone landing page, the 300 products are listed on Amazon.com in their respective categories (e.g. electronics, wireless devices). Those products range from Prynt — a case that turns your phone into a Polaroid camera — to Zivix, a portable smart guitar. The companies don’t need to pay Amazon an extra fee; the financial relationship is just like that between Amazon and any vendor on its site. Amazon offers two selling plans to its vendors — the professional plan costs $39.99 per month plus per-item selling fees (which vary by category) and the individual plan costs sellers $0.99 per item sold plus additional fees. The partnership is intended to be a mutually beneficial, co-marketing experience, says Amazon PR manager Lori Richter. “Kickstarter takes companies up to a certain point,” she told Yahoo Finance. “And Amazon can help them get the product on a retail platform and really execute in a bigger way.”Kickstarter’s communications manager, Justin Kazmark, says the partnership helps startups keep up the success they’ve accrued on Kickstarter. “Now they have a second home by landing on Amazon,” he says. “They are in a place with a huge global reach and the project can continue to be discovered.” One of the concerns with Kickstarter is that you’re betting on a product that hasn’t been created yet. Even if you’re promised a pair of shoes or a keyboard waffle iron by a certain date, a manufacturing or shipping issue may delay when you actually receive the product from a company you’ve invested in.“When you’re pledging to something on Kickstarter, it really is just an idea. You’re taking a chance on somebody. And delays do occur but there is more success than anticipated,” Kazmark says. Amazon requires that the 300 Kickstarter companies ensure that their products will be ready to ship before their product is made available on their Launchpad program, according to Richter. She says Amazon consults with 100 venture capital firms and startup accelerators to get a sense of “the coolest new startups” it would like to feature on its site. It’s a huge win for the startups because without paying additional cost, they get to take advantage of Amazon’s fulfillment center. All the entrepreneur needs to do is handle the manufacturing; Amazon takes over to handle the customer service, shipping and delivery. This initiative is part of Amazon’s larger push to let consumers know it offers a bevy of products that aren’t ones you’d necessarily search for. The company, often referred to as “the everything store” is frequently used by consumers who know exactly what they are looking for, whether it be a TV or baby food.Mike Burtov, the founder of GeoOrbital, a company that makes an electric bike wheel, raised $1.26 million from 1,623 people during its 45-day campaign on Kickstarter. The company met its goal of $75,000 within 58 minutes of being online. This puts GeoOrbital in the top .05% of all crowdfunding platforms in terms of capital raised.He says 70% of the purchases were being shared organically by friends of the company, but he needs to find a retail partner in order to get to the next level — sales. “The virality of Kickstarter is super important in order to get exposure but afterward we thought, ‘What happens next?’” he says. “Amazon could be that next chapter. It’s an excellent thing.”Melody Hahm is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.

REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol/File PhotoMoreBy Daina Beth SolomonMEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) will begin selling food and drinks online in Mexico, including snacks, sweets and wines, it said on Thursday, a move that could intensify its competition with Wal Mart de Mexico (WALMEX.MX) to claim shoppers in a nascent e-commerce market.Online shopping represents a fraction of total retail sales in Mexico but has grown swiftly, putting Amazon and its rivals in a race to ramp up investments in logistics, technology and product offerings.Amazon views food and drink sales as key to growth, eyeing routine purchases to stock pantries as a way to generate other types of sales, but has yet to dominate the category.The new items on its Mexico site, which it launched in 2015, span coffees, teas, liquors, wines and beers, as well as cooking ingredients, non-perishable snacks and sweets."We're committed to offering our clients as many products as we can," Fernando Ramirez, Amazon Mexico's senior product manager, said in a statement.The launch shows Amazon's intent to claim more of Mexicans' wallets, said Gene Munster, research head at Loup Ventures."Non-perishables are the first step to capturing food spending, and likely indicate Amazon's ambitions to increase its offering related to fresh food," he said.In the United States, Amazon moved into online grocery sales through a $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods Market last year. It offers two-hour delivery and lets shoppers pick up Amazon products from Whole Foods stores.Walmart (WMT.N), meanwhile, aims to deliver groceries to over 40 percent of U.S. households by year's end.The company plans to accelerate its online grocery business in Mexico as well, Walmart International's Chief Executive Judith McKenna said earlier this year.Soriana (SORIANAB.MX), La Comer (LCMRUBC.MX) and Chedraui (CHDRAUIB.MX) are among Mexican grocers that also offer delivery services, along with online marketplace MercadoLibre (MELI.O).Walmart's Mexico unit, Walmex, is counting on its 2,390 stores to help execute speedy deliveries.Amazon may struggle to match the selection of traditional stores, said Jose Acosta, a former Walmex executive who is now CEO of digital payments application Pagamobil."Brick-and-mortar players have done a very good job of defining a very wide catalogue, and that's not something you develop so fast," he said.Small warehouses stocked with snacks and drinks will be crucial for Amazon to deliver fast, said Alfredo Garcia, business development head at Mexican e-commerce delivery service Skydrop.Convenience is also important."If you have a party ... what a drag if you go to Amazon to buy beer and potato chips, but you have to use another application to buy meat and tomatoes," Garcia said.(Reporting by Daina Beth Solomon; additional reporting by Julia Love in Mexico City, Nandita Bose in New York and Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco; editing by Susan Fenton and Sandra Maler)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextThe Best Places to Retire to AbroadInvestopediaWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

Here's Where the Search StandsGrace DobushFortuneSeptember 7, 2018ReblogShareTweetShareWilly Wonka would be pleased: One year ago today, Jeff Bezos announced Amazon’s search for a second headquarters, triggering a flood of publicity and a frenzy of interest from cities hoping to nab a golden ticket. The 238 HQ2 applicants were narrowed down to 20 finalists back in January.Amazon  amzn  promises to invest more than $5 billion in the city it chooses for its second headquarters and create 50,000 well-paying jobs over the next decade. Its effect on its current hometown of Seattle has been staggering: The company employs more than 40,000 people there and claims each dollar it has invested in Seattle generated an additional $1.40 for the city’s economy.The e-commerce giant has said it will make its final HQ2 decision by the end of this year.So where does the search stand today? As Amazon hovers around a $1 trillion market cap, the list of candidate cities remains at 20 across the U.S. plus Toronto, Canada.Geekwire tried to divine the HQ2 location by analyzing Amazon’s recent job postings. The Washington, D.C., metro area had the most open positions this summer, and three finalist cities are in that region: the District of Columbia itself, Northern Virginia and Montgomery County, Md. Online betting shops also say Northern Virginia is the most likely to win it.A CNBC analysis found that Texas was the most attractive location, with Dallas and Austin among the top 20 finalists. An earlier analysis by ATTOM Data Solutions ranked Raleigh, N.C., and Atlanta at the top of the list. Atlanta was an early favorite, and Wells Fargo Securities predicted Boston would be the frontrunner,CNN reports details about the economic climates of these cities as included in their proposals are attracting other investors as well.Cities often woo corporations that are considering building in their region, but it’s rare to see a company openly audition cities this way. The candidate cities have been falling over themselves to offer the most attractive tax incentive packages, but it’s difficult to tell what will make Bezos pick a city — and there’s no telling how tax cuts might affect the chosen city’s bottom line.While courting Amazon for its second headquarters seems like an obvious win, experts warn of downsides, such as increased traffic and inflated housing prices. “It feels like Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,” Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, told NBC News. “It’s a real prize, but they’re going to need to be very disciplined. It’s a big deal, a big project with lots of moving parts.”ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolNatural Gas Price Prediction – Prices Tumble as Supplies IncreaseFX EmpireSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphCrude Oil Weekly Price Forecast – Crude oil running into resistanceFX EmpireWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolA Look At The Fair Value Of Westlake Chemical Corporation (NYSE:WLK)Simply Wall St.Breaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo Finance3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceInvesting in General Electric Is All About These 3 Key ThingsMotley Fool

"Alexa for Hospitality" lets guests ask Alexa -- via an in-room Amazon Echo -- for help with hotel information, booking guest services, playing music and managing room controls, such as lighting and temperature.We've seen hotels leverage Alexa before -- in 2016 Wynn's Las Vegas hotel installed an Echo in all 4,748 of its rooms, letting guests control environmental conditions with vocal commands. The Marriot partnership takes things further, giving the hotels the option to configure and customize voice-first features based on their specific property and guest offering. You'll be able to use Alexa to book a massage if the hotel has a spa, for example, or ask Alexa where the gym is located, if it has a fitness center. Hotels can also choose to give their guests access to thousands of Alexa skills that can help with other aspects of traveling, such as checking flight times or local public transit systems.Personalization is also on the cards. Alexa for Hospitality will eventually allow guests to temporarily connect their Amazon account to the Echo in their room so they can play their own music from services including Amazon Music and Spotify, or listen to audiobooks via Audible. When they check out, their account will be automatically disconnected from the device.The system has been built to work with existing hotel technology, so locations won't need to retrofit or upgrade anything, but whether or not you'll get to try it out during your summer holidays will depend on where you're heading. It's arriving at Marriott hotels in Charlotte, NC, and Irvine, CA, first, with other hotel locations "by invitation" from today, before rolling out internationally later this season.AmazonThis article originally appeared on Engadget.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextNatural Gas Price Prediction – Prices Tumble as Supplies IncreaseFX EmpireState defends South Dakota pipeline protest legislationAssociated PressCrude Oil Weekly Price Forecast – Crude oil running into resistanceFX Empire1 Big Reason Why Disney Stock Is Just Getting StartedMotley FoolMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolSouthwest CEO says more Hawaii service in part depends on 'when the Max returns'American City Business JournalsSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCIt's Time to Start Saving for This Annual Expense TodayMotley FoolWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraph57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNAll the Best 4/20 Day Deals on Pizza, Pot, Nachos, Lyft Rides, and MoreMoney'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolWoman wears 9 extra pounds of clothing on flight to avoid $85 airline feeAOL.comBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley Fool3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo Finance

Further, it efficiently offesr scalability and availability to customers as well as manages critical MongoDB workloads at scale.The latest move is likely to add strength to AWS’ database services portfolio, which already comprises a wide range of relational as well as non-relational database services.Gaining Momentum in NoSQL Database SpaceNoSQL or non-relational databases are gaining traction among cloud customers as well as application developers.Moreover, these databases are best known for their scalability, ease of development and functionality which are boosting adoption rate in the cloud computing market.Per a report by Market Research Media, NoSQL technology is becoming mainstream in the database space. The report also suggests that the technology holds immense growth potential and is expected to witness a CAGR of 21% between 2019 and 2024 and reach $3.4 billion.AWS with Amazon DocumentDB expands its non-relational database services offerings. This is likely to help the company reap benefits from the potential non-relational database space.Amazon.com, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Amazon.com, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote Competition RifeThe cloud battle continues to become intense with strong initiatives of AWS as well as of other major cloud services providers such as Microsoft’s MSFT, Alphabet’s GOOGL Google Cloud and International Business Machines’ IBM cloud division, to name a few.Microsoft’s Azure DocumentDB is a NoSQL document database service that is fully managed and highly responsive database-as-a-service (DBaaS). The service provides faster processing of JSON data and is easily available.Further, IBM Cloud’s NoSQL database service — Cloudant — offers scalable JSON document database for web, mobile, IoT and serverless applications.Google Cloud Datastore also provides high scalability and features NoSQL database.Nevertheless, AWS is likely to maintain its dominant position in the cloud computing market on the back of its recent move. The compatibility feature of its new service with the existing MongoDB APIs will enable the company attract application developers to its platform.Apart from Amazon DocumentDB, AWS also offers Amazon DynamoDB which is another NoSQL database service.We believe that an expanding portfolio of non-relational database services will continue to strengthen its competitive position against the above mentioned companies.Currently, Amazon sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The e-commerce giant has just announced two new benefits for its subscribers: an additional 10 percent discount off sale items and deep discounts on select best-selling items every week. To take advantage of the discounts, Prime members have to physically go to a Whole Foods location and find the yellow 10 percent off and the blue special deal signs.

Additionally, over the past year, Amazon has created 130,000 jobs, not including its Whole Foods locations. By the end of last year, Amazon employed more than 560,000 globally, up nearly 66% from last year.Shares were up nearly 3% on Monday. Related ArticlesCuomo wants voluntary payroll tax to ease pain of US tax lawFormer pharma exec, Christie backer seeks to oust MenendezSeattle eyes taller, denser in affordable housing proposalReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraph57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCN'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley Fool3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceInvesting in General Electric Is All About These 3 Key ThingsMotley FoolCardinal Timothy Dolan on the Catholic ChurchWSJ

The device is aimed squarely at rival Amazon (AMZN), which released its Echo three years ago.The smart home speaker, as a category, appears to be taking off.Google jumped in with Google Home, released six months ago. Microsoft (MSFT) is getting in with a Harman Kardon speaker called Invoke, which it announced last month. Each of these devices is also a showcase for each company’s voice assistant technology: HomePod is powered by Siri; Echo runs on Alexa; Google Home is powered by Google Assistant (it’s very Google to avoid a cute human name); Invoke will use Microsoft’s voice tech Cortana.But for the time being, Amazon is miles ahead in this race—and not just because it was first out of the gate.“The Amazon Echo portfolio of products is definitely the one to beat right now,” says Adam Wright, research analyst at IDC. “Amazon has leapt ahead of the competition once again with the launch of its latest addition to the portfolio.”He means the Echo Show, coming on June 29, which looks nothing like the rest of the Echos: it’s a standing rectangle with a video touchscreen. It more closely resembles a portable DVD player, if you remember those relics.The Echo Show has not gotten a ton of press attention, but insiders are impressed with its 7-inch color screen and its 5-megapixel camera. Adding a visual experience to the speaker, Wright says, “affords Amazon a lead over Google for now.” Inside Higher Ed predicts the Echo Show will “revolutionize higher education.”Amazon currently controls more than 70% of the voice-enabled speaker business, eMarketer estimates.L-R: Amazon Echo; Google Home; Apple HomePod. (images via Amazon, AP Photo, Apple)MoreGoogle Home does offer an impressive conversational experience. And it could “further this edge,” Wright says, with the expected continued incorporation of Google Assistant with new features (like hands-free phone calls) and with other Google devices, like Lens. But Amazon was first to the space and is iterating so fast with Echo that it’s daunting to compete.And now there’s Apple. Its speaker comes along three years after Amazon’s, six months after Google’s, and is almost three times as expensive ($349) than either of those ($179 and $109, respectively). As Mizuho Securities wrote in a new research note after Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference keynote on Monday, HomePod’s pricing is “at a premium to competing offerings.” That’s an understatement. And HomePod isn’t just competing with those, but also with high-end wireless speakers like Sonos and Jawbone Jambox. “It’s unclear,” Wright says, “whether Apple can compete well in this space.”Indeed, tech media as well as some analysts have criticized Apple for its late entry, accusing the company, once known for its innovations, as being a copycat now. HomePod even looks a lot like Google Home.But this race is in its early days. The market for voice-activated home assistant devices is “still in its infancy,” Wright says. Former Apple analyst Gene Munster, now a partner at Loup Ventures, told Fox Business the same on Monday: “They’re about two years late, but… I would also point out that this market hasn’t even started.”Amazon and Google don’t typically break out sales of their individual devices, but Mizuho estimated that Amazon sold 8.6 million Echos last year, and predicts Echo revenue could balloon to $11 billion by 2020. RBC predicts 60 million units by 2020.If only 10 million units of smart home speakers have sold, that’s small potatoes. Munster pointed out that it takes 500 million units to really consider a category “mainstream.”In other words, Apple has ample time.—Daniel Roberts covers tech at Yahoo Finance.

And now the service is rolling out to an increasing number of users.Credit: ShutterstockThe feature gives you a real-time view of where your packages are and lets you know when you might get your delivery. It also gives you a map view, so you can see where your delivery truck is and how many stops it'll need to make before your package arrives.Credit: ShutterstockMoreThe tool is available in the Amazon mobile app. Simply boot it up and access your orders.

You can keep coming back to the app to see where the package is.MORE: Amazon Prime Day: When It is, Shopping Tips and MoreNow, before you start combing through the app to search for packages, there are some caveats to keep in mind. For one, the feature isn't available on any packages that are being shipped through traditional carriers, like UPS, FedEX, or the U.S. Postal Service. Instead, you'll only be able to track packages that are shipped entirely through Amazon's own logistics chain.And, as noted above, the feature launched last month and has been slowly making its way to people across the U.S. There's still a chance that you won't have access to the tracker yet and, if you're living outside the U.S., you won't have access to it.Amazon shed little light on the rollout schedule and international availability in a statement to CNET, which earlier reported on the feature. Instead, the company said that its Map Tracking feature is "another delivery innovation" that aims at improving "convenience for our customers."Amazon has unveiled a variety of new technologies to improve deliveries, including options to have packages delivered in your home or even your car trunk. And as it tries to build out its logistics network to rely less on traditional carriers, those efforts will only expand.See also :  Is Amazon Prime Worth It?

Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN), the e-commerce and cloud computing giant, is reportedly toying with the idea of selling cheap white-box networking switches to enterprise customers.A gateway to AWSAmazon is already using white-box switches inside its data centers, according to The Information's sources. Other large internet companies have taken that path as well, including Facebook and Alphabet's Google. Google has gone even further, designing its own custom chips for artificial intelligence.Data cables plugged into hardware.MoreImage source: Getty Images.But selling custom hardware to third-parties is a new frontier. Some customers are already reportedly testing Amazon's switches, with a launch planned within the next 18 months. Amazon's strategy will be focused on price, with plans to undercut the switches from Cisco by 70% to 80%.Amazon's switches will be unbranded and run open-source software. They'll have built-in connections to Amazon Web Services (AWS), enabling customers to more easily operate in a hybrid-cloud configuration, where on-premise hardware is mixed with public cloud computing. That could help make the process of moving to the cloud simpler and less painful for large enterprises.Given the reported pricing, Amazon probably won't make much money from selling the hardware itself. Instead, the switches could drive more business to AWS, which is by far the most profitable part of Amazon.Speaking to The Information, a Cisco spokeswoman downplayed the report: "Only Cisco offers an end-to-end intent-based networking portfolio that delivers assurance, industry-leading security, policy-based automation, and segmentation. We look forward to continue leading the industry on innovation and helping our customers simplify and manage their networks."Should Cisco be worried?One thing to remember: Cheap white-box networking hardware is not new. Cheap alternatives to Cisco's pricey hardware are also not new. If price were the only factor, Cisco wouldn't dominate the market for networking switches. But it does, with a market share of 53.4% in the first quarter, according to IDC.Other cloud computing companies have every incentive to work with networking hardware companies to fight back against the threat from Amazon. Cisco and Google are already collaborating, working on developing software that will connect data centers with Cisco hardware to Google's cloud services. Cisco is also a partner for Azure Stack, Microsoft's hybrid cloud solution.Amazon certainly shouldn't be underestimated, but selling enterprise hardware for use in on-premise data centers is a very different business than renting public cloud computing resources. Swapping out hardware from Cisco or other providers isn't trivial -- there are meaningful switching costs. And AWS certainly isn't the only game in town when it comes to hybrid cloud. Whether companies would want to lock themselves into AWS with Amazon's switching hardware is an open question.Amazon may ultimately abandon this effort, instead sticking with using the hardware in its own data centers. Even with low prices, winning market share will be a slog. Cisco has revamped its business model in recent years, moving to a subscription model with its latest Catalyst 9000 line of switches. Those products have proven popular, and the fact that they're bundled with subscription software may make it even more difficult for customers to move away from Cisco. Cisco has increasingly become a seller of networking solutions, and that makes its products and services even stickier.Story continuesCisco has been under attack from cheap commodity hardware for years. The company's dominance has so far held up. Just like Amazon shouldn't be underestimated, neither should Cisco.

As The Verge saw in the state's disclosure records, the three giants contributed a significant amount of money to a campaign pushing back against the initiative: Amazon and Microsoft donated $195,000 each, while Uber pitched in a smaller-but-still-noteworthy donation worth $50,000. Google, AT&T, Facebook and Verizon -- four of the first corporations that backed the fight against the initiative -- all plunked down $200,000. Facebook and Verizon eventually withdrew their support, however, with the former doing so after Mark Zuckerberg was hauled in front of Congress to answer questions about the Cambridge Analytica scandal.The California Consumer Privacy Act aims to give California residents the right to know what kind of data companies have on them and to tell those companies not to sell their personal info. Tech companies believe that it could ruin the way they develop their products and do business. A spokesperson for Amazon told The Verge, for instance: "While we share the initiative's overarching goal of protecting consumer privacy, we are concerned by unworkable requirements that would hinder our ability to innovate on behalf of our customers."Committee to Protect California Jobs spokesperson Steven Maviglio echoed that in a statement to Govtech. He said that bill author Alastair Mactaggart didn't consider the "workability" of his proposal and that it's nigh impossible for tech giants to comply with it. "[A]nyone who orders anything from Amazon can request where their information went, and that can not only overwhelm a large company like Amazon but also smaller ones too," the spokesperson explained. Microsoft also released a statement that pretty much said the same thing: "We believe the California measure could have unintended consequences for both businesses and consumers and that there is a better way to give consumers the privacy rights they deserve."So far, the Californians for Consumer Privacy Act has already collected 637,000 signatures. Authorities have to be able to verify 402,468 signatures for the proposal to make it to the November ballot -- we'll know for sure after the California Secretary of State announces the result on June 25th. Even if it does make its way to the ballot, the opposition now has a lot of money to spend on campaigns to fight its approval. The Committee to Protect California Jobs, for one, plans to make sure citizens know about the potential impact it may have on jobs in the state if companies choose to up and leave for another HQ.The Verge, California Secretary of StateThis article originally appeared on Engadget.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextDocuments confirm what Microsoft is building in GoodyearAmerican City Business JournalsWhat to Expect When Alphabet Reports Later This MonthMotley FoolHemp companies are raising capital at a fast clip and cannabis retailers can expect 4/20 sales spikeMarketWatchZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceState defends South Dakota pipeline protest legislationAssociated PressSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBC'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceIn Ukrainian candidate's hometown, a cry for changeAssociated PressAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadgetMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

Amazon and Microsoft announced a new partnership that will allow better integration between the tech titans' two voice-powered digital assistants.MoreAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) announced a new partnership that will allow better integration between the tech titans' two digital assistants.Amazon's voice-powered digital assistant Alexa will now be able to activate Microsoft's own assistant Cortana, and vice versa. The partnership means  Amazon customers can use Alexa  to access Cortana's exclusive features such as accessing work calendars, while Microsoft customers can use Cortana to ask Alexa to order products from Amazon or control their smart home devices."Ensuring Cortana is available for our customers everywhere and across any device is a key priority for us," said Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, in a press release Wednesday."Bringing Cortana's knowledge, Office 365 integration, commitments, and reminders to Alexa is a great step toward that goal."Amazon's personal assistant Alexa was first announced in November 2014 alongside the Echo, Amazon's smart speaker. Meanwhile, Cortana was announced by Microsoft in May 2015 and released for its Windows Phone product."There are going to be multiple successful intelligent agents, each with access to different sets of data and with different specialized skill areas. Together, their strengths will complement each other and provide customers with a richer and even more helpful experience," Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon, said in a press release."It's great for Echo owners to get easy access to Cortana."More From CNBC A bitcoin rival that has quietly surged nearly 1,400% this yearBurger King has launched its own version of bitcoin in Russia called ‘WhopperCoin’Samsung launches huge 6.3-inch Note 8 smartphone and hopes to price it under $1,000ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextDocuments confirm what Microsoft is building in GoodyearAmerican City Business JournalsCan Microsoft (MSFT) Keep the Earnings Surprise Streak Alive?ZacksConsole gaming is at a crossroadsEngadgetData Sheet—Why We Should Stop Haranguing Our Kids to Put Down Their PhonesFortuneMicrosoft introduces tools to better VR experience for users with low visionAFP Relax NewsZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceTesla's board is about to get a lot smallerTechCrunchAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergApple may bring Siri Shortcuts and Screen Time to macOSEngadget

The company is aiming to give AWS customers an "easy button" to get into the same technology that underpins bitcoin."They can focus on their scenario and they don't have to become PhDs is cryptography, we give them a simple platform to build their company on blockchain," said Steve Cerveny, one of the founders of Kaleido.Blockchain technology records transactions on a public, distributed ledger, which advocates say gets rid of the need for a third party in many cases. The technology is touted as faster and more secure by advocates."Introducing Kaleido to AWS customers is going to help customers move faster and not worryabout managing blockchain themselves," Amazon Web Services said in a statement. It is the first Blockchain SaaS solution available on the AWS Marketplace and will help them rapidly advance their blockchain projects."Amazon Web Services is a subsidiary of Amazon that offers a paid subscription for cloud computing platforms to individuals, companies and governments. AWS is using a partner-led strategy instead of building from the ground up."They've been looking for partners to help get blockchain into their customers hands," Cerveny said. "They're putting it in the marketplace will accelerate what their customers are going to do with it."The founder of the Ethereum blockchain platform, which is what Kaleido and AWS will be using, said this is the biggest move yet by the tech giant to get into blockchain."This is a heavy duty, full stack way of getting the company into blockchain solutions," said Joseph Lubin, founder of Ethereum.Blockchain can help Amazon in other arms of the ever-expanding business he said, using supply chain as one example. Lubin said Consensys, which oversees more than 50 blockchain projects, has seen a major increase in interest around the technology."Three years ago we were getting calls from companies trying to spell blockchain and trying to order one in a color because their boss told them they should get a blockchain," Lubin said. "At this point there are tens of thousands of companies around the world that have real sophistication around this."Amazon joins other tech giants including Microsoft and Facebook exploring use cases for blockchain.Facebook announced last week it is going through a reorganization that will include a new blockchain effort and aims to address privacy concerns. The experimental blockchain group will be led by David Marcus, the executive most recently in charge of Facebook's Messenger group.IBM, Accenture, Deloitte, JP Morgan, and HSBC are among the other corporate names working on blockchain initiatives.WATCH: Amazon is so much more than online shopping — here's how big its becomeMore From CNBC Blockchain company BitPesa wants to transform payments in AfricaIBM joins forces with a start-up to combine crypto with environmental credit tradingCryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is trying to lure big institutional investorsReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBlockchain cross-border transactions space set for unprecedented growthCoin RivetHow CSG plans to take blockchain mainstream for telecom paymentsAmerican City Business JournalsPrivacy Crypto Monero Celebrates Its 5th BirthdayCoindeskJimmy Song discusses Bitcoin, blockchain, and the crypto spaceCoin RivetGibraltar Blockchain Exchange Appoints New CEOBitcoin MagazineZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolTesla's board is about to get a lot smallerTechCrunchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraph57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNQualcomm's joint venture with Chinese province to shut down: The InformationReuters'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolEquity Shot: Pinterest zooms into the public markets (and yet another tech company files for an IPO)TechCrunchBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley Fool3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo Finance

A paid service, however? That's relatively rare... or at least, it has been. Amazon, Netflix and multiple Hollywood studios (including Disney, Fox, Sony, Universal and Warner Bros.) have sued SET Broadcast over allegations its SET TV service is used expressly for piracy. While there is a dedicated set-top box, the centerpiece is a $20 per month subscription service that offers access to over 500 live TV channels and "thousands" of on-demand shows, including Netflix shows and movies that are still officially limited to theaters. As you might guess, the media giants argue SET TV is focused "overwhelmingly, if not exclusively" on pirated material.The companies also accuse SET Broadcast of going so far as to pay for video reviews and other sponsored material to drive subscriptions. The firm hasn't commented on the case so far.The lawsuit could have SET pay dearly. The court would order the service shut down, of course, but it would also impound devices and demand damages up to $150,000 for every piece of pirated work. That could easily amount to millions of dollars even if the penalties were limited to on-demand videos. Between the number of media industry companies involved in the case and the penalties they're asking, it's clear that the lawsuit is intended as a message to anyone that would design a service with piracy in mind -- especially if they have the gall to charge for it.GeekWireThis article originally appeared on Engadget.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolNetflix might have more Beyoncé specials planned after 'Homecoming'EngadgetZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool'American Ninja Warrior Junior': Get an exclusive sneak peek at the semi-finals!AOL.com'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceCoachella Weekend 2: What to Watch ForVarietyAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance Video

Called Alexa Skill Blueprints, the new feature is open to anyone with an Echo device. You can create custom Alexa content like quizzes, jokes, games, and instructions for babysitters or house guests.That way, when you say things like, "Alexa, who's the best-looking member of the family?", it will answer with a custom response. To get started, you'll have to log on to Amazon's Alexa Skill Blueprints website. There, you'll find more than 20 templates to choose from. The templates are pre-filled, but you can also customize the language so Alexa will talk more like you and your family. After you're done, the new skill will be available on all your Amazon devices. Until now, the personalization options on Echo devices has been somewhat limited. You've always been able to tell Alexa what to call you and set up a custom routine, but beyond that, you've never really been able to choose what Alexa will say back to you. This is also the first time users have been able to easily make their own Alexa skill. Thanks to the pre-made templates, you don't need to be a developer to create a skill for your Echo. Plus, the custom skills you create won't go into the Alexa Skills section of the app — they will only appear on the devices registered to your Amazon account. Here are all the customizable skills available at launch:- Custom Q&A- House guest info- Babysitter info- Pet sitter info- Family jokes- Trivia- Inspirational quotes- Family trivia- Bachelorette party trivia- Birthday trivia- Burns- Compliments- Double Trouble game- Categories game- Adventure story- Fairy tale- Sci-fi story- Fable- Flash cards- Facts on a specific topic- QuizNOW WATCH: Facebook can still track you even if you delete your account — here's how to stop itSee Also:Amazon just visited New Jersey — and the state is offering a $7 billion incentive to land HQ2The unlikely way Jeff Bezos became one of the first investors in Google, which probably made him a billionaire outside of AmazonApple is considering a low-cost HomePod, says KGI SecuritiesSEE ALSO: These wireless earbuds look exactly like Apple's AirPods — but they cost a fraction of the price and work with any smartphoneReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolState defends South Dakota pipeline protest legislationAssociated PressSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCIn Ukrainian candidate's hometown, a cry for changeAssociated PressWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraph57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNButina Shouldn't Serve Any More Time in Prison, Her Lawyers SayBloomberg'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatchBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley Fool3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceInvesting in General Electric Is All About These 3 Key ThingsMotley FoolCardinal Timothy Dolan on the Catholic ChurchWSJ

REUTERS/Pascal RossignolMoreBy Noel Randewich and April Joyner(Reuters) - Amazon.com (AMZN.O) became the second most valuable publicly listed U.S. company on Tuesday, surpassing Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) for the first time.Amazon shares finished up 2.69 percent at $1,586.51, for a market capitalisation of $768 billion, underscoring Wall Street's confidence in its relentless expansion into cloud computing, groceries and other new businesses.Alphabet lost 0.39 percent, trimming its stock market value to $762 billion, as Wall Street fretted about regulatory fallout following revelations that a political consulting firm had improperly obtained personal data on 50 million Facebook Inc (FB.O) users.Together, Alphabet and Facebook dominate online advertising. They have previously faced government criticism for how they employ their user data.Amazon's stock has surged 81 percent over the past year, through Monday, bolstered by scorchingly fast revenue growth as more shopping moves online and businesses shift their computing operations to the cloud, where Amazon Web Services leads the market."They're using their cash flow to develop new businesses," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. "They could have Apple in their sights at some point."Seattle-based Amazon dislodged Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) as the No. 3 U.S. company by market capitalisation in February. Apple (AAPL.O) is the world's most valuable publicly listed company, with a market capitalisation of $889 billion.Obviously, past stock gains are not a reliable predictor of future performance, and the surge in Amazon shares in recent years has been exceptional by most standards. But if Amazon's stock were to keep growing on the trajectory seen over the past year, its market capitalisation would hit $1 trillion in late August.Apple's market cap would reach $1 trillion around a month later if its stock price continued to rise at the 25 percent pace seen over the past year.Alphabet's stock has risen 4 percent so far in 2018 and is up 26 percent in the past year.The median of analyst price targets for the three companies put Amazon's market capitalisation at $823 billion, Alphabet's at $914 billion and Apple's at $989 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.(Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Leslie Adler)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextAt $1 Trillion, Apple is Bigger Than These ThingsInvestopedia3 Stocks to Buy Ahead of the Next Market CrashMotley FoolWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolHere's what smart rich people really do with their nest eggMarketWatchA 'tired' stock market is a reason for caution, says chart watcherMarketWatchZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraph57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCN'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley Fool3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceInvesting in General Electric Is All About These 3 Key ThingsMotley FoolCardinal Timothy Dolan on the Catholic ChurchWSJ

The packages are being sold in five price tiers, at a flat fee -- no monthly service contracts, a significant disruption of how many home security services are sold today.The least expensive, $240 for Outdoor Base, gives you an Echo Dot plus indoor and outdoor lighting designed "to make it look like you're home" The most expensive tier, $840 for Smartest, includes an alarm siren, motion sensors, safety sensors, a camera, and Echo Dot, the lighting and a video doorbell -- potentially rolling in previous security launches from the company like Amazon Key and Cloud Cam. All include two visits from Amazon employees to consult you and help with the installation.The Last July it emerged that Amazon was quietly working on its own answer to Best Buy's Geek Squad -- offering repairs and installations of home WiFi, smart home devices, Alexa installations, and other hardware-related services.Amazon never appeared to confirm it at the time, but that service now officially seems to be called "Smart Home Services" and it has expanded to Washington, Oregon, California, Arizona, Texas, Nevada, North Carolina, Georgia, Illinois, New Jersey, Washington D.C. and Florida.The security offering we are describing here -- which was initially flagged to us by a reader -- falls under that general banner, and it is being promoted at the top of the Smart Home Services homepage.Giving consumers the option of a more full-service security offering, beyond selling alarms and other devices a la carte, makes sense for a couple of reasons.The first is that while there are some early adopters who might like the challenge of installing these services themselves, there will be many middle and later adopters who will not be interested in facing that learning curve. Amazon has positioned itself in the smart home security space as more than just a reseller of third-party devices -- although it sells those, too -- with acquisitions of the smart doorbell startup Ring and the smart camera and doorbell startup Blink.The second is that most often, home security systems are coupled with service installations it in your home that include maintenance contracts, so if Amazon hopes to eat up some of that market, it needs to offer something comparable to the market.It's an interesting development also of the company's wider strategy to move into selling services, beyond physical products -- one of Amazon's various efforts to diversify its business by targeting different categories of commerce and different demographics.Another foray into human-powered services was its Thumbtack-style competitor Amazon Home Services, a marketplace it launched back in 2015 for finding tradespeople and other freelance service providers like masseurs and language tutors. (Notably, Amazon makes a big deal in its security pages of using Amazon employees to install its security systems.)Earlier this month, it also emerged that Amazon was stealing a march on Apple in smart homes, specifically by inking deals with smart home builders, who were opting for Amazon as their preferred supplier for consulting and installing such services for their home buyers.A report in The Information noted that one such home builder, Lennar, was "prioritizing Amazon" in its recommendations, while still working with Apple, in part because of the former company's stronger efforts to integrate with more third-party products, giving buyers a wider range of choices.Ramping up into security services fits with this, too. Lennar, as it happens, is directly linked now on Amazon's security homepage, but to be clear, the offering is not exclusive to Lennar homeowners.We've asked Amazon about the security service pages, and the company has acknowledged the question but still has not replied. We'll update this post as and if we learn more.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadgetAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolTesla's board is about to get a lot smallerTechCrunchWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunch

The tech giant is currently trading at $2,013 per share as of Thursday 11:30am Eastern timeWith a current market cap of $980.6 billion, some are speculating that it could be the second trillion-dollar company, after Apple hit the $1 trillion mark earlier this month.Given the company started off as an online book vendor and has now branched into all types of e-commerce, web hosting, and video streaming, CNBC’s Melissa Lee asks, “how much bigger can Amazon get?”Going further, Tim Seymour questioned “What is Amazon? … Is it a retail stock, is it a tech stock, is it a consumer staples stock? To me, the most aggressive moves that Amazon has made have really been in this trillion-and-a-half dollar consumer staples/consumables space, where they’re competing with Walmart, with Target, with Kroger, with a lot of mom-and-pop stores, and again, it’s a low-margin business. That, to me, is where the disruption lies.”On the other hand, Pete Najarian claims, “I view Amazon as a tech company, and the reason I say that is AWS. That’s where the margins are.”Yesterday, Amazon rebuffed criticism from Senator Bernie Sanders, who had recently lambasted Amazon for low wages and poor working conditions.In a statement released online, Amazon said on Wednesday, “Senator Sanders continues to spread misleading statements about pay and benefits. Amazon is proud to have created over 130,000 new jobs last year alone. In the U.S., the average hourly wage for a full-time associate in our fulfillment centers, including cash, stock, and incentive bonuses, is over $15/hour before overtime. We encourage anyone to compare our pay and benefits to other retailers.”Some of the main consumer discretionary ETFs were buoyed Wednesday by Amazon’s rise. Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLY) was up almost 1% yesterday, as was Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF (VCR) , both of which are weighted almost 25% by Amazon alone.For more information on tech ETFs, visit our technology category.POPULAR ARTICLES FROM ETFTRENDS.COMKevin O’Leary Betting on Small Caps to Outperform S&P 500Amazon Passes $2,000 Per Share, Nears $1T Market CapA Review of Tesla’s Go-Private Roller CoasterCrypto Mining Giant Bitmain Might Go Public With $18B IPOMarkets Won’t Crash if Trump ImpeachedREAD MORE AT ETFTRENDS.COM >ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceGeorge Conway calls for Trump impeachment after Mueller report | Laura Ingraham says president owed an apologyMarketWatchHere's Where to Find Every 2020 Presidential Candidate's Tax Returns (If They've Released Them)MoneyWhat The Potential 2020 Candidates Are Doing And Saying, Vol. 15FiveThirtyEight2020 campaign trail runs through churches in South CarolinaAssociated PressZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBC'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraph57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley Fool3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolInvesting in General Electric Is All About These 3 Key ThingsMotley FoolMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceCardinal Timothy Dolan on the Catholic ChurchWSJRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

Further, it provides continuous backup service which enables the companies to automate the data backup process.The addition of such disaster-resilient services to the services portfolio of Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) is likely to strengthen the company’s key offerings. Moreover, the buyout will bolster the reliability of AWS services.Cloud Backup Market Holds PromiseGrowing proliferation of cloud services worldwide is a testament to the fact that the cloud industry is booming. Several small, medium and large companies are transferring their workloads and infrastructure to a cloud platform.Meanwhile, crime and cyber attacks are taking place in an alarming rate in today’s world. These are resulting in misuse well as loss of massive amounts of data stored on a cloud platform.This has created a strong demand for data recovery services from such disasters in order to avoid any kind of operational loss.Per a report from HTF Market Intelligence, the global cloud backup market is expected to witness a CAGR of 23.4% between 2018 and 2025. Further, it is projected to hit $6.82 billion by 2025.We believe if the speculated acquisition occurs, AWS will be able to rapidly penetrate this potential market. Further, disaster recovery services will help the company in attracting customers to its platform, in turn strengthening its clientele.Consequently, this will aid in the revenue generation of AWS.Amazon.com, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Amazon.com, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteIntensifying CompetitionGrowth opportunities in the global cloud backup market are attractive enough to lure other major cloud providers such as Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet’s GOOGL Google and Alibaba BABA, to name a few.Microsoft’s Azure Security Centre offers advanced analytics and global threat intelligence services which help its cloud customers to pace with the cyber attacks. Moreover, its advanced security management services for hybrid cloud workloads are major positives.Further, Google Cloud offers a wide range of products and services that have high availability features. These help the customer in the disaster recovery process.Meanwhile, Alibaba Cloud’s hybrid backup and disaster recovery solutions which are equipped with automated mechanism, are also gaining traction in the market.Nevertheless, Amazon’s latest move is likely to strengthen competitive position against the above-mentioned companies. Further, its growing focus on hybrid cloud architecture services will help it in gaining further momentum among the customers, which in turn will aid its cloud dominance.Currently, Amazon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The question now is should investors consider buying Amazon stock on the dip as we move into 2019?Holiday Shopping Amazon posted record-breaking sales during the vital holiday shopping period, according to a company statement Wednesday. The company sold millions of more Amazon devices, which include the new Echo Dot and Fire TV Stick 4K, compared to 2017.Overall, Amazon shipped more than one billion items for free as part of its Prime membership offerings in the U.S. alone. Jeff Bezos’ firm also saw “tens of millions” of people start their free Amazon Prime trials and begin their paid memberships.Amazon stock jumped 5% to reach $1,411.10 a share in morning trading Wednesday. Despite this surge, AMZN stock still sat 31% below its 52-week high of $2,050.50 a share. Investors should note that other beaten-down stocks, including Facebook FB and Apple AAPL, also surged as the larger market tries to rebound from a rough December.OverviewAmazon is coming off a Q3 that saw its revenue grow far slower than recent periods. Third quarter sales climbed 29% to reach $56.6 billion, which came in below Q2’s 39% surge and Q1’s 43% climb. The question for investors is can they find new reasons to be excited about Amazon?Right off the bat, Amazon is projected to capture approximately 50% of the total U.S. e-commerce market in 2018, up from 44% last year. This should help the e-commerce giant remain strong compared to Target TGT, Walmart WMT, and Costco COST. Meanwhile, Amazon grabbed 35% of the cloud infrastructure services market last quarter, which helped it come in well above second-place Microsoft’s MSFT roughly 15%, as well as IBM IBM, Google GOOGL, and Alibaba BABA.Outlook Looking ahead, our current Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for Amazon’s Q4 revenues to jump 18.5% to reach $71.61 billion. More specifically, Amazon’s cloud computing business is expected to jump roughly 43% from $5.113 billion in the year-ago period to reach $7.298 billion, based on our NFM estimate. For reference, Amazon Web Services revenues surged 46% last quarter and 49% in Q2.Amazon fiscal 2018 revenues are expected to surge 30.8% to touch $232.69 billion. Peeking ahead to fiscal 2019, Amazon’s top line is projected to hit $280.4 billion, which would mark a 20.5% jump above our 2018 estimate.At the bottom end of the income statement, Amazon’s adjusted fourth quarter revenues are projected to skyrocket 154% to reach $5.48 per share. AMZN’s full-year earnings are also expected to soar 328.6%. Plus, fiscal 2019’s EPS figure is projected to come in 37% higher than our 2018 estimate. It is also worth noting that Amazon’s positive earnings estimate revision activity helps it earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at the moment.Bottom Line Amazon’s days of insane top-line growth might be over—for now at least. But the firm has some newer businesses that look poised to help it continue to expand.One with some serious potential is Amazon’s digital advertising segment. The company is set to move into third-place this year behind only Google and Facebook. Amazon will continue to grow its ad business as more consumers begin their product searches across its website and app. Plus, Amazon has jumped deeper into the pharmaceutical industry with its PillPack purchase, which should help it challenge CVS CVS and Walgreens Boots WBA.Amazon is also ready to expand its Prime Video offerings to help it stand out against Netflix NFLX and soon enough Disney DIS, Apple, and AT&T T as we race into what could become an almost completely streaming future. And Amazon has actively grown its brick-and-mortar business, with a focus on its cashierless Amazon Go stores.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

Wall Street analysts were generally expecting $1.27 per share on revenues of $49.96 billion. In the same quarter last year, earnings were $1.48 per share on $35.7 billion in revenue.caThe stock surged over 6% in after-hours trading.Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos pointed to Amazon Web Services, or AWS, as one of the company’s ongoing, key revenue drivers. The rapidly evolving service remains one of the most widely used go-to cloud computing services for over 1 million businesses and organizations, including McDonald’s (MCD), Netflix (NFLX), Spotify (SPOT), and UnderArmour (UAA). “AWS had the unusual advantage of a seven-year head start before facing like-minded competition, and the team has never slowed down,” Bezos said in the earnings release published on Thursday . “As a result, the AWS services are by far the most evolved and most functionality-rich. AWS lets developers do more and be nimbler, and it continues to get even better every day. That’s why you’re seeing this remarkable acceleration in AWS growth, now for two quarters in a row. A huge thank you to all our AWS customers, and you can be sure we’ll keep working hard for you.” One of the biggest bit of news Amazon dropped on Thursday? It’ss raising the price on its popular Amazon Prime program, from $99 a year to $119 a year, effective May 11. Previously, the company announced Prime had over 100 million subscribers.The last several months have been busy for Amazon. In late March and early April, President Trump criticized Amazon via Twitter and said Amazon’s agreements with the U.S. Postal Service are “not a level playing field” and that Amazon is putting “many thousands of retailers out of business.” Amazon stock temporarily took a hit in the immediate wake of President Trump’s unfavorable tweets but has since recovered.President Trump’s current anti-Amazon stance could affect AWS’ odds of landing an exclusive 10-year multibillion-dollar contract it’s competing for — alongside Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) — that would modernize the U.S. Department of Defense’s information technology system.In an interview with Yahoo Finance this month, Amazon CTO Werner Vogels declined to offer an update on the process, other than to suggest that the company remained unfazed by Trump’s attacks. Regardless, Amazon’s chances of scoring the government contract are pretty good, given the company already hosts classified systems with the CIA, as well as other top defense contractors like Lockheed Martin.Amazon executives have also been preoccupied in recent months with its ongoing search for a second U.S. headquarters, dubbed HQ2. Since Amazon announced last year it planned on opening a new $5 billion headquarters outside of Seattle, the company has narrowed its search down from 238 U.S. cities and towns to 20 finalists, with news outlets speculating Washington D.C. and Boston could have the edge, based on those markets’ local talent pool, Amazon’s significant presence in those areas, not to mention the fact Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos purchased a $26 million home in D.C.—JP Mangalindan is the Chief Tech Correspondent for Yahoo Finance covering the intersection of tech and business. Email story tips and musings to jpm@oath.com. Follow him on Twitter or Facebook.More from JPFacebook beats earnings expectations, stock jumpsMeet the Silicon Valley matchmaker helping top tech executives find loveNetflix CEO takes jab at Facebook over privacy controversyFacebook to combat pornography and hate speech with more content reviewersFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg owes lawmakers answers to these questionsRichard Branson: Government regulation of Facebook ‘makes sense’ ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextState defends South Dakota pipeline protest legislationAssociated PressFoxconn says it remains committed to Wisconsin investment projectReutersButina Shouldn't Serve Any More Time in Prison, Her Lawyers SayBloombergWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolWhy the Infamous Trump Tower Meeting Didn't Take Down TrumpFortuneZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceTesla earnings: The big question is how big is the quarterly lossMarketWatchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolHere's What Hedge Funds Think About NIO Inc.

Research has also indicated that Prime members spend about $1,300 per year on Amazon.com, $600 more than what the non-Prime Amazon customer spends.(If you’re wondering how Amazon Prime membership stacks up to Netflix, Spotify, and other subscription services, check out the numbers.)In after hours trade, Amazon shares were up about 1.5% after Bezos’ disclosure.In previous letters to shareholders, Bezos has discussed Amazon’s goal of making Prime such a good value that customers would be “irresponsible” not to pay for the service, which costs $99 a year in the U.S. and offers two-day free shipping among other benefits for members.Part of Amazon’s efforts to build its Prime member base has been its investment in Prime Video, its streaming service that competes with Netflix (NFLX) and Hulu, among others.“Prime Video continues to drive Prime member adoption and retention,” Bezos said in his letter. “In the last year we made Prime Video even better for customers by adding new, award-winning Prime Originals to the service, like The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, winner of two Critics’ Choice Awards and two Golden Globes, and the Oscar-nominated movie The Big Sick.”Bezos also said that Amazon’s streaming of NFL games on Thursday night accumulated more than 18 million viewers over 11 games. Amazon reportedly paid $50 million to stream NFL games, meaning it cost them about $2.78 for each viewer.A recent survey from Loop Capital Markets indicated that 23% of Prime members would definitely cancel their membership if streaming were not included.—Myles Udland is a writer at Yahoo Finance.

That's a massive global member base of customers that pay Amazon for the privilege of shopping on the site, enjoying a growing collection of benefits, most notably free two-day shipping. While it's hard to figure out exactly how much revenue Amazon is bringing in from Prime membership fees, since members are located all around the world and pay varying fees based on geography, it's clear that Prime is one of the most successful membership programs ever.For context, here's how Prime compares to other membership-based businesses (including some subscription businesses that may not technically refer to customers as "members").Amazon warehouse showing huge racks full of different productsMoreWhat can't you buy with Amazon Prime? Image source: Amazon.Costco: 92.2 millionThe wholesale warehouse chain is the most relevant comparison, as Costco (NASDAQ: COST) operates a global network of retail locations that similarly sells everything under the sun at aggressive price points. At the end of the last quarter, Costco had a total of 92.2 million cardholders that it counts as members.Costco's model has long been to sell products at modest markups, just enough to cover its operating expenses. If you were to ignore membership fees, Costco would have made just $270 million in operating income last quarter, or just a meager 0.8% operating margin. In other words, the $716 million that the company collected in membership fees during the quarter comprised nearly 75% of reported operating income, which is why Costco is so focused on member satisfaction.It's worth noting that Costco only has 50.4 million paid memberships, as families with multiple shoppers are able to share memberships within the household. Membership fees range from $60 per year to $120 per year.Netflix: 98.75 millionWhile it operates in a completely different industry, online video streamer Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) also refers to its paid subscribers as members. At last count, the company had 98.75 million total memberships, making it relatively comparable to Amazon Prime. Netflix acquires members with a free trial, of which there are about 4.4 million. The remaining 94.4 million memberships are paid. Investors cheered last quarter when Netflix crushed its own subscriber targets again.The majority of Netflix's member base is concentrated within the U.S., which accounts for 50.9 million total memberships (49.4 million paid memberships). Netflix continues to aggressively expand internationally, which will require a lot of localized original content and marketing.Spotify: 74.5 millionSpeaking of streaming content, Spotify Technology (NYSE: SPOT) went public last month. Ahead of the direct listing, the company estimated that it had 73 million to 76 million premium subscribers at the end of the first quarter, or 74.5 million at the midpoint. Technically, the Swedish music streamer doesn't refer to paying customers as members, but rather premium subscribers.Spotify's total monthly active user (MAU) base is 168 million to 171 million, topping Prime, but free users are under no obligation or ongoing need to continue using the service, unlike a shared Costco membership, for example (everyone needs groceries). Still, Spotify is the dominant music-streaming platform by a significant margin, enjoying roughly twice as many paid subscribers as its next closest rival.Membership- and subscription-based businesses are the way to go these days.

Prepare your bank account.MorePrime Day 2018 is upon us. And that means if you’re an Amazon (AMZN) Prime member, someone who likes a good deal or simply have a pulse, you’re going to spend an inappropriate amount of time browsing the site for some incredible deals beginning July 16. Naturally, you can expect plenty of tech deals this year. But before you click “Add to Cart,” or get fired for gross negligence for spending the entire 36-hour sale shopping rather than, you know, working, brush up on the best tips for buying everything from smartphones and laptops to TVs and smart home gadgets.Whatever you decide to buy, we’ve got you covered.What to look for in a new TVIf you’re hoping to score a sick new TV during Prime Day, and chances are there will be at least one, there are a few important thoughts to keep in mind. The first is size. My rule is always go big or go home. Just don’t go too big or it won’t fit in your room.The point is, you want to find a television that’s the right size for your home. Check out the size of the TV on sale during Prime Day, then measure the space you want to place it to make sure it’ll fit. And remember, you’re definitely not going to be able to make your friends jealous with a new TV that’s small.A Sony TV that was on sale during last year’s Prime Day.MoreIf you’re buying that sweet new television to upgrade from your current 1080p set, you’ll want to purchase a 4K model. 4K TVs have a higher resolution than 1080p panels, creating a sharper image. It’s worth noting, though, that you’ll only really see a difference in sharpness on TVs that are 55 inches or larger. A 32-inch, 4K TV is pretty much pointless.It’s also worth checking to see if your new TV offers high-dynamic range (HDR) compatibility. HDR increases the contrast ratio of the image on the screen making for a wider array of colors, as well as deeper blacks and brighter whites. Chances are, if you’re buying a TV that offers HDR capability, it’ll also be 4K. You’ll also want to make sure that the TV you’re buying is compatible with HDR10 and Dolby Vision, two of the more popular HDR formats.A TCL TV from Prime Day 2017.MoreFinally, if you’re buying a new TV, make sure it has enough HDMI ports for all of the devices you want to connect. Sure, you can always get an HDMI splitter, but those don’t necessarily work with every device you use.What to look for in a new smartphonePast Prime Days have included sales on smartphones, which means we’ll likely see the same this year. But when you’re buying a smartphone online there are a few important options to consider.First thing’s first: Make sure the handset you’re buying is compatible with the network you use. For instance, if you see a deal on a Huawei or ZTE smartphone, you might not be able to use it in the U.S. if you’re a Verizon or AT&T customer because of the handset’s antennas. Not every phone uses the same bands needed to be compatible on U.S. networks, especially if they’re from overseas companies.If you’re interested in buying a smartphone during Prime Day, make sure it works with your carrier.MoreStory continuesYou’ll also want to look at how much storage the smartphone offers. If you tend to keep all your photos, music, movies, shows and documents saved on your phone rather than in the cloud, you’ll need a handset with a good amount of storage space. I’d recommend going with a phone with 128GB of storage, just to make sure you have plenty to spare in the future. If you’re a serious storage hog, then opt for a handset with 256 GB. You can also check out smartphones with microSD card slots to add your own amount of storage.Finally, make sure that the phone you’re buying is the right size for you. Some people prefer smaller handsets, others love pocket-busting behemoths. Just be sure to note the size and make sure the one you buy fits your needs. What to look for in a computerShould you find a sweet, sweet laptop for sale during Prime Day, don’t pull the trigger before you check out exactly what you’re getting. If you’re the kind of person who wants the best of the best when it comes to your tech, you’ll definitely want to look at the kind of processor, graphics chip and RAM comes packed into the machine you’re checking out.Hoping for a laptop this Prime Day? You’ll need to make sure it offers the kind of specs for your needs.MoreYou’re not going to want to buy a slick new laptop that has a two-year old processor and graphics chip that can’t handle the best games on the market. Do your research and make sure you’re getting a system with a CPU that’s from this or last year.If you’re going to be doing some serious multitasking on your computer, you’ll want to get a machine with at least 6GB of RAM. Last year, Amazon was selling some completely insane gaming laptops, so buckle up, because this year could be even better.Smart home devicesGot a smart speaker at home and want to grow your tiny electronic outpost into a fully connected digital empire? Then Prime Day might be the best way to get started. Importantly, you’ll have to make sure that whatever connected device you buy works with your particular system.The vast majority of smart home devices work with Amazon’s Alexa, the most popular system available. Up next is Google’s Home, followed by Apple’s (AAPL) HomeKit. If you want to set up an Apple-centric smart home system, you’ll have to make sure that your devices are compatible with HomeKit.The Amazon Echo dot.MoreGot an Echo in the house? Then you can buy pretty much any device; it’ll likely work without issue. More of a Google (GOOG, GOOGL) fan? You’ll also find what you’re looking for. But if you’re an Apple person, getting the smart home device you want could be more difficult since there aren’t as many on the market. All that being said, just be sure that the device you’d like to buy actually works with the smart home assistant you’re using.Now grab your credit cards, check your bank account and get ready to drop some cash on what should be some solid tech deals. Or just browse aimlessly until you stumble on a price cut for bulk underwear purchases. At least that’s what I’ll be doing.Illo by: David FosterMoreRead more about Prime Day:Amazon Prime Day 2018 tech shopping guideYour super-quick guide to Amazon Prime DayA few tips and tools for shopping on Prime DayChart: Amazon Prime Day depresses retail foot trafficHere’s how much Amazon is poised to make from Prime DayHow to shop smart and make money on Prime DaySurvey shows how much people plan to spend on Amazon Prime DayEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@oath.com; follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley. Follow Yahoo Finance on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaThe Morning After: The Weather Channel got hackedEngadgetTrailers of the Week: 'Child's Play,' 'Hobbs and Shaw,' 'Big Little Lies 2'Rolling StoneWhere to Stream Movies FreeConsumer ReportsAmazon Music's free ad-supported tier is now available for all Alexa usersBGR NewsZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolTesla's board is about to get a lot smallerTechCrunchBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo Finance3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceInvesting in General Electric Is All About These 3 Key ThingsMotley Fool

Now, it is one of the biggest shopping events in the world! It’s such a large shopping event, and it has grown so quickly, that Prime Day has some significant investment implications.First off, investors want to judge whether or not Prime Day performed well relative to expectations to see whether Amazon remains an e-commerce juggernaut. Secondly, investors also want to see what sold well on Prime Day to glean insights as to where consumer demand is strongest.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  7 Alternative Internet of Things Stocks to Buy  With that in mind, here’s a list of three winners and one loser from this year’s Amazon Prime Day:Amazon Prime Day Winner: Amazon (AMZN)Source: AmazonPerhaps it goes without saying, but the biggest winner from Prime Day is the event’s host, Amazon.Despite website glitches and worker strikes, third-party data and Amazon statements have come together to paint a picture that Prime Day was a huge success for Amazon. According to algo-commerce company feedvisor, total sales in the first 12 hours of Prime Day were up 89%, versus an 80% gain in the prior year. Google Tends shows a huge spike in search interest to all-time highs for both “Amazon.com” and “Prime Day“.Meanwhile, Amazon said in a press release that more than 100 million products were purchased worldwide during Prime Day. They also said that the best selling products of those 100 million were Amazon products like Fire TV Stick and Echo Dot.Thus, not only did Prime Day generate a ton of sales through Amazon’s e-commerce platform, but it also helped Amazon sell a ton of its own products. That is a double win for Amazon, and it comes despite noise in the background from website glitches and worker strikes.What does all this mean? The Amazon e-commerce powerhouse remains as strong, as important, and as irreplaceable as ever.Amazon Prime Day Winner: Royal Philips (PHG)Source: ShutterstockIn the world of smart devices, everything is going smart. We aren’t just talking smartphones and smartwatches, but also smart appliances.The smart appliance market is admittedly limited in scope at the present moment. But there are pockets of it that are booming, and one of those pockets that is booming is the smart lighting category.Smart lights have been a consumer favorite for some time now. This popularity continued on Prime Day. Philips Hue smart lights and related appliances, made by Royal Philips (NYSE:PHG), were a top seller on Prime Day across multiple countries, including the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Belgium, and Australia. Also, PHG’s smart toothbrush was the top top-selling item on Prime Day in China.What does all this mean? Clearly, PHG is at the forefront of the smart appliance trend. In many respects, that makes PHG stock an Internet of Things (IoT) stock with huge growth drivers on the horizon.  7 Cybersecurity Funds for Growth Investors  Indeed, PHG’s growth strategy is all about the connected health market, and consequently, results have been quite good for the past several years. That is why PHG stock has nearly doubled over the past two years. Further gains seem possible considering the huge tailwinds in connected health and smart appliances.Amazon Prime Day Winner: Sony (SNE)Story continuesSource: Dalvenjah via FlickrThe PlayStation gaming console, made by Sony (NYSE:SNE), had a strong showing on Prime Day.PlayStation gaming consoles, games, and related accessories and memberships were top-sellers on Prime Day across multiple countries, including Germany, France, and Australia. In Australia, PlayStation made a particularly strong showing with the top two selling items (a PlayStation 4 gaming console and the FIFA 18 game for PlayStation 4).What does all this mean? Sony isn’t purely a gaming company. But, games are a big part of what the company does. This business has been doing well, thanks to growing demand for next-gen video game consoles as well as the explosion in eSports and the huge digital shift in the video game industry. With augmented and virtual reality catalysts right around the corner, this business also promises to keep doing well over the next several years.A strong PlayStation showing on Prime Day simply bolsters the bull thesis on Sony’s gaming growth prospects. As such, it looks fairly certain that Sony experiences strong growth in gaming over the next several quarters and years, and that this growth helps power SNE stock higher.Amazon Prime Day Loser: Newell Brands (NWL)The biggest loser from Amazon Prime day is Newell Brands (NYSE:NWL), the company behind the once mega-popular Crock-Pot.The Crock-Pot has been on its way out for a few quarters now. The new fad centers around multipurpose cookers like the Instant Pot, which are widely viewed as more versatile and less dangerous. Indeed, over the past several quarters as Instant Pot has stolen market share from Crock-Pot, NWL has reported sluggish sales growth and even reported negative core sales growth in the past two quarters.Prime Day suggests there is more pain ahead for NWL stock.The Instant Pot, which was the top-selling Prime Day item in the U.S. and Canada in 2017, was again the top-selling Prime Day item in the U.S. and Canada in 2018. Considering the U.S. and Canada are presumably two of Amazon’s biggest markets, Instant Pot nabbing the top-selling spot means that a lot of Instant Pots were sold through Amazon on Prime Day.  5 Strong Earnings Stocks to Buy Post-Netflix Plunge  What does all this mean? The Crock-Pot continues to lose popularity, and that will continue to show up in NWL’s numbers. Bad numbers usually lead to a weak stock, so I think there is more weakness ahead for NWL stock.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long AMZN and PHG.  Compare Brokers The post Amazon Prime Day: 3 Winners, 1 Loser appeared first on InvestorPlace.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

That’s according to Daniel Ives, head of research for the marketing insights firm GBH Insights, who estimates Amazon’s 36-hour sales event will be its most successful since it debuted Prime Day in July 2015, when the Seattle tech giant celebrated its 20th anniversary. Ives declined to provide an estimate regarding how much in sales Amazon generates during a normal 36-hour period other than to say that sales during Prime Day would be significantly higher. “We expect this to be the biggest, most successful Prime Day Amazon has ever had,” said Ives, who estimates that 60%-70% of all items on Amazon.com will be discounted. This year’s Prime Day, which kicks off on Monday, July 16 at 3 p.m. ET and wraps up on Tuesday, July 17, will include over 1 million deals — 50% more than the year prior.A Jumbotron-sized ad for AmazonIllo by: David FosterMoreWhile analysts like Ives generally expect Amazon (AMZN) and third-party retailers to profit from Prime Day sales — albeit with razor-thin margins — Prime Day serves as an excellent way for Amazon to steal the limelight for several days every year. Not only does Prime Day serve as an excellent Jumbotron-sized virtual billboard for Amazon proper, it’s a big splashy ad for Prime, given Prime Day deals are only available to Prime members. In April, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced Prime had 100 million subscribers — a marked improvement from the “tens of millions” of Prime members Amazon had touted for years. “[Prime Day] is all about getting more people to sign up for Prime,” contends Anthony Chukumba, an analyst for Loop Capital Markets. “Are they going to make money? Probably a little bit of money. But they don’t really care either way. It’s about advertising for Amazon, and it’s about Prime, and it’s about getting people to sign up for those free Prime memberships and hopefully getting some of those people to convert to a regular annual membership.”More Prime users mean more sales for Amazon. Data released in July 2017 from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners indicates that the average Prime user spends $1,300 on Amazon each year versus just $700 per-year for non-Prime members. The research firm surveyed 500 U.S. consumers who made purchases on Amazon.com between April and June in 2017.Non-Prime members aren’t as jazzed about Prime DayStill, Prime Day may not be reason alone for many shoppers to sign up for Prime. A survey conducted by Yahoo Finance this week found less than 7% of the 1,084 non-Prime members surveyed said they would become Prime members before July 16, or Prime Day. In fact, the majority indicated they would only sign up for a free trial. Also bear in mind that a portion of items sold during this year’s Prime Day will be heavily-discounted, in particular Kindle e-readers and Echo speakers, which are essentially Trojan horses to boost customer loyalty. According to Mark Mahaney, senior tech analyst for RBC Capital Markets, just 15% of the “tens of millions” of Echo owners use their speakers to make purchases on Amazon. “That’s a pretty small penetration,” concedes Mahaney. “But I think that’s something that rises over time. It will take a couple of years, because that’s a behavioral change that doesn’t come quickly, but it will happen.”If we’ve learned anything about Amazon, of course, it’s that it doesn’t mind playing the long game. —JP Mangalindan is the Chief Tech Correspondent for Yahoo Finance covering the intersection of tech and business. Email story tips and musings to jpm@oath.com. Follow him on Twitter or Facebook.Read more about Prime Day:Almost half of Amazon Prime members surveyed plan to spend over $100 on Prime Amazon Prime Day 2018 tech shopping guideYour super-quick guide to Amazon Prime DayA few tips and tools for shopping on Prime DayChart: Amazon Prime Day depresses retail foot trafficHere’s how much Amazon is poised to make from Prime DayHow to shop smart and make money on Prime DayReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

That’s according to Daniel Ives, head of research for the marketing insights firm GBH Insights, who estimates Amazon’s 36-hour sales event will be its most successful since it debuted Prime Day in July 2015, when the Seattle tech giant celebrated its 20th anniversary. Ives declined to provide an estimate regarding how much in sales Amazon generates during a normal 36-hour period other than to say that sales during Prime Day would be significantly higher. “We expect this to be the biggest, most successful Prime Day Amazon has ever had,” said Ives, who estimates that 60%-70% of all items on Amazon.com will be discounted. This year’s Prime Day, which kicks off on Monday, July 16 at 3 p.m. ET and wraps up on Tuesday, July 17, will include over 1 million deals — 50% more than the year prior.A Jumbotron-sized ad for AmazonIllo by: David FosterMoreWhile analysts like Ives generally expect Amazon (AMZN) and third-party retailers to profit from Prime Day sales — albeit with razor-thin margins — Prime Day serves as an excellent way for Amazon to steal the limelight for several days every year. Not only does Prime Day serve as an excellent Jumbotron-sized virtual billboard for Amazon proper, it’s a big splashy ad for Prime, given Prime Day deals are only available to Prime members. In April, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced Prime had 100 million subscribers — a marked improvement from the “tens of millions” of Prime members Amazon had touted for years. “[Prime Day] is all about getting more people to sign up for Prime,” contends Anthony Chukumba, an analyst for Loop Capital Markets. “Are they going to make money? Probably a little bit of money. But they don’t really care either way. It’s about advertising for Amazon, and it’s about Prime, and it’s about getting people to sign up for those free Prime memberships and hopefully getting some of those people to convert to a regular annual membership.”More Prime users mean more sales for Amazon. Data released in July 2017 from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners indicates that the average Prime user spends $1,300 on Amazon each year versus just $700 per-year for non-Prime members. The research firm surveyed 500 U.S. consumers who made purchases on Amazon.com between April and June in 2017.Non-Prime members aren’t as jazzed about Prime DayStill, Prime Day may not be reason alone for many shoppers to sign up for Prime. A survey conducted by Yahoo Finance this week found less than 7% of the 1,084 non-Prime members surveyed said they would become Prime members before July 16, or Prime Day. In fact, the majority indicated they would only sign up for a free trial. Also bear in mind that a portion of items sold during this year’s Prime Day will be heavily-discounted, in particular Kindle e-readers and Echo speakers, which are essentially Trojan horses to boost customer loyalty. According to Mark Mahaney, senior tech analyst for RBC Capital Markets, just 15% of the “tens of millions” of Echo owners use their speakers to make purchases on Amazon. “That’s a pretty small penetration,” concedes Mahaney. “But I think that’s something that rises over time. It will take a couple of years, because that’s a behavioral change that doesn’t come quickly, but it will happen.”If we’ve learned anything about Amazon, of course, it’s that it doesn’t mind playing the long game. —JP Mangalindan is the Chief Tech Correspondent for Yahoo Finance covering the intersection of tech and business. Email story tips and musings to jpm@oath.com. Follow him on Twitter or Facebook.Read more about Prime Day:Almost half of Amazon Prime members surveyed plan to spend over $100 on Prime Amazon Prime Day 2018 tech shopping guideYour super-quick guide to Amazon Prime DayA few tips and tools for shopping on Prime DayChart: Amazon Prime Day depresses retail foot trafficHere’s how much Amazon is poised to make from Prime DayHow to shop smart and make money on Prime DayReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

The company is raising the price from $10.99 per month to $12.99 per month -- an 18% increase. Student members that pay monthly will see their prices rise by a comparable percentage, from $5.49 per month to $6.49 per month.However, the changes only apply to members that pay on a monthly basis. The annual subscription prices ($99 per year, or $49 per year for students) are unchanged. It's been nearly four years since the last Prime price increase, when Amazon bumped the annual price from $79 to $99 back in 2014.Amazon warehouse employee sorting ordersMoreImage source: Amazon.Here's everything you need to know about the changes, and why Amazon's making them.Net shipping losses are growingThere are a couple likely reasons why Amazon is making the change. First and foremost is to generate more revenue to cover rising shipping costs. Amazon used to disclose its net shipping costs each quarter, but abruptly stopped in Q2 2017. The company has been increasingly losing money on shipping costs, and while Amazon has an incredibly high tolerance for absorbing losses if those losses can drive growth, the figures underscore why a price increase is in order.Shipping losses jumped precipitously in 2016.   Metric   2014   2015   2016       Shipping revenue   $4.5 billion   $6.5 billion   $9 billion     Shipping costs   ($8.7 billion)   ($11.5 billion)   ($16.2 billion)     Net shipping cost   ($4.2 billion)   ($5 billion)   ($7.2 billion)   Data source: SEC filings.For Q1 2017, the last quarter that investors have net shipping cost data for, net shipping losses widened by 30%.   Metric   Q1 2016   Q1 2017       Shipping revenue   $1.8 billion   $2.5 billion     Shipping costs   ($3.3 billion)   ($4.4 billion)     Net shipping cost   ($1.5 billion)   ($1.9 billion)   Data source: SEC filings.Shipping revenue includes some (unspecified) portion of the Prime membership fees as well as fees earned from merchants for Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) services, but excludes any shipping fees charged by third-party merchants where Amazon does not fulfill the orders. Amazon now only discloses its shipping costs ($5.4 billion in Q3 2017) but not shipping revenue, so investors no longer have a sense of its net shipping costs, but the trend was already abundantly clear.Pushing members to annual plansThe monthly subscription option may have been more popular among lower-income consumers or those that don't want a long-term subscription, but the price structure change even more strongly encourages consumers to sign up for the annual plan.    Tier   Annual Cost (Paid Monthly)   Annual Cost (Paid Annually)   Difference       Prime before price change   $131.88   $99   $32.88     Prime after price change   $155.88   $99   $56.88     Prime Student before price change   $65.88   $49   $16.88     Prime Student after price change   $77.88   $49   $28.88   Data sources: Amazon and author's calculations.The savings associated with the annual plan just jumped quite a bit. That's a strong incentive for monthly members to upgrade to the annual plan. Of course, Amazon would prefer customers on the annual plan because Prime members tend to spend more on Amazon, and it can foster long-term relationships with those customers while enjoying greater financial visibility.It's hard to quantify what financial impact the change might have. How many Prime members Amazon has is a closely guarded secret. Even if investors knew this number, they'd need to know the mix of monthly subscribers vs. annual subscribers as well, since the change only affects the former group.The value is still therePrime offers such incredible value that it's extremely unlikely that the price increase will cause any type of mass customer exodus. It's comparable to Costco memberships or Netflix subscriptions -- both of which also receive price increases every few years. Those companies' respective member bases don't see any lasting adverse effects from price increases, since they still provide strong value to consumers.The same will hold true for Amazon.

REUTERS/Ralph D. Freso/FilesMoreBy Phil Wahba and Deepa Seetharaman(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc plans to hike the annual fee for its popular Prime service by 25 percent to $99 starting next week, a move announced on Thursday that risks losing customers for a feature that has helped drive its business.The increase comes about six weeks after Amazon warned that it may raise prices by as much as $40 to offset rising fuel and shipping costs. Prime, which offers unlimited two-day shipping among other perks, had cost $79 since its introduction in 2005.Later on Thursday, Amazon rival ShopRunner offered a free one-year membership to its own $79-a-year service to disgruntled Prime users who have not renewed their subscription at the higher rate. ShopRunner partners with brick-and-mortar retailers like Nieman Marcus and offers unlimited two-day shipping.The $20 hike for Prime is unlikely to spur users to drop the service en masse, analysts said. But it may temper Amazon's ability to attract new customers to Prime, seen as instrumental to boosting purchases of goods and digital media."We wonder if a meaningful price increase would dissuade some on-the-fence potential Amazon Primers from ponying up for the membership," RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said in a research note.The move comes as Amazon faces mounting pressure to show sustained bottom-line growth, following years of rapid revenue expansion at the cost of profits. In 2013, Amazon's shipping costs grew almost 30 percent to $6.6 billion as its sales grew.The increase in Prime's fee could add about half a billion dollars to Amazon's annual operating income, according to some analyst estimates."If you consider things like inflation and fuel costs, a Prime membership valued at $79 in 2005 would be worth more than $100 today," Amazon spokeswoman Julie Law said. She declined to say how the company calculated the figure.Prime customers get a limited selection of book downloads as well as film and television streams as part of the service, which has helped expand Amazon's presence on mobile devices.There are about 20 million Prime members in the United States, and they spend at least twice as much as non-Prime members in a given year, according to some analyst estimates.One analyst said the hike was expected and consumers would get accustomed to paying more."Based on our surveys of consumers, key reasons to shop on Amazon (and online more generally) include convenience, selection, and price comparisons," R.W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian wrote in a research note. "Prime helps to amplify the first two drivers."But others said consumers tended to strongly resist online fee hikes, such as when Netflix Inc tried in 2011 to raise its annual subscription fee by what it called "the price of a latte." It backtracked after a customer revolt.Some Prime members bristled at the increase in Prime, saying it was unfair to Prime users who spend more than non-users."I'm going to cancel: My thought is that the price should be going down. Prime customers order more from Amazon because of their membership," Caryn Brooks wrote on a Facebook Inc discussion moderated by Reuters."By having Prime members they have more guaranteed sales ... they should nurture those folks, not repel them," Brooks said.Amazon shares ended little changed on the Nasdaq at $371.51.(Reporting by Phil Wahba and Franklin Paul in New York; and Deepa Seetharaman in San Francisco; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn, Jeffrey Benkoe and Tom Brown)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolCrude Oil Weekly Price Forecast – Crude oil running into resistanceFX EmpireSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraph1 Big Reason Why Disney Stock Is Just Getting StartedMotley FoolWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

The company has already renewedJack Ryan for a second season despite a months-long wait for Prime Video show's August 31st premiere. If you ask Amazon, it's a combination of its reaction to watching the show (generally a good idea) with early hints of customer interest. Reportedly, there was a 400 percent jump in watchlist additions for Jack Ryan following Amazon's Super Bowl ad campaign.There's very little to say about season two at this stage, although Amazon noted that Ryan will go to a "new, exciting and dangerous world." You can presume he survives the first season, then.The renewal bodes well for the series, although we'd take Amazon's hype with a grain of salt. It's not exactly shocking that watchlist additions would surge for a show when it gets one of the most coveted ad spots on the planet. And the watchlist doesn't guarantee that people will watch the season at all, let alone every episode. Think of this as an experiment on Amazon's part -- it's betting that a strong presence in show queues will translate to strong audience numbers. If that bet pays off, viewers won't have to wait as long for the follow-up as they would if Amazon had been more conservative.AmazonThis article originally appeared on Engadget.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksWalmart Wants to Take On Amazon in Digital AdvertisingMotley FoolWill Amazon (AMZN) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?ZacksZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo Finance1 Big Reason Why Disney Stock Is Just Getting StartedMotley FoolSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance'American Ninja Warrior Junior': Get an exclusive sneak peek at the semi-finals!AOL.comWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergCoachella Weekend 2: What to Watch ForVariety

On Tuesday, the UK’s Metro newspaper asked whether Gunn will still direct the project for Amazon in the wake of his Disney firing.The answer is no.A spokesperson for Amazon Studios tells Yahoo Finance that Amazon backed out of the project months ago—before Gunn’s current scandal.“We passed on the project completely months ago,” says the spokesperson. “There was no statement. This is the same for any other project we do not move forward with.”Director James Gunn at a discussion during the E3 Expo on June 13, 2017, in Los Angeles, Calif.

It is unclear whether the series could still get made by a different distributor; Yahoo Finance has reached out to Sony TV for comment.Gunn has publicly apologized for the tweets, and said, “I understand and accept the business decisions taken” by Disney.

The company's experimental hiring tool used artificial intelligence to give job candidates scores ranging from one to five stars - much like shoppers rate products on Amazon, some of the people said."Everyone wanted this holy grail," one of the people said. "They literally wanted it to be an engine where I'm going to give you 100 resumes, it will spit out the top five, and we'll hire those." But by 2015, the company realized its new system was not rating candidates for software developer jobs and other technical posts in a gender-neutral way.That is because Amazon's computer models were trained to vet applicants by observing patterns in resumes submitted to the company over a 10-year period. Most came from men, a reflection of male dominance across the tech industry. (For a graphic on gender breakdowns in tech, see: https://tmsnrt.rs/2OfPWoD) In effect, Amazon's system taught itself that male candidates were preferable. It penalized resumes that included the word "women's," as in "women's chess club captain." And it downgraded graduates of two all-women's colleges, according to people familiar with the matter. They did not specify the names of the schools.Amazon edited the programs to make them neutral to these particular terms. But that was no guarantee that the machines would not devise other ways of sorting candidates that could prove discriminatory, the people said.The Seattle company ultimately disbanded the team by the start of last year because executives lost hope for the project, according to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Amazon's recruiters looked at the recommendations generated by the tool when searching for new hires, but never relied solely on those rankings, they said.Amazon declined to comment on the recruiting engine or its challenges, but the company says it is committed to workplace diversity and equality.The company's experiment, which Reuters is first to report, offers a case study in the limitations of machine learning. It also serves as a lesson to the growing list of large companies including Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc that are looking to automate portions of the hiring process.Some 55 percent of U.S. human resources managers said artificial intelligence, or AI, would be a regular part of their work within the next five years, according to a 2017 survey by talent software firm CareerBuilder.Employers have long dreamed of harnessing technology to widen the hiring net and reduce reliance on subjective opinions of human recruiters. But computer scientists such as Nihar Shah, who teaches machine learning at Carnegie Mellon University, say there is still much work to do."How to ensure that the algorithm is fair, how to make sure the algorithm is really interpretable and explainable - that's still quite far off," he said.MASCULINE LANGUAGE Amazon's experiment began at a pivotal moment for the world's largest online retailer. Machine learning was gaining traction in the technology world, thanks to a surge in low-cost computing power. And Amazon's Human Resources department was about to embark on a hiring spree: Since June 2015, the company's global headcount has more than tripled to 575,700 workers, regulatory filings show.So it set up a team in Amazon's Edinburgh engineering hub that grew to around a dozen people. Their goal was to develop AI that could rapidly crawl the web and spot candidates worth recruiting, the people familiar with the matter said.The group created 500 computer models focused on specific job functions and locations. They taught each to recognize some 50,000 terms that showed up on past candidates' resumes. The algorithms learned to assign little significance to skills that were common across IT applicants, such as the ability to write various computer codes, the people said.Story continuesInstead, the technology favored candidates who described themselves using verbs more commonly found on male engineers’ resumes, such as "executed" and "captured," one person said.Gender bias was not the only issue. Problems with the data that underpinned the models' judgments meant that unqualified candidates were often recommended for all manner of jobs, the people said. With the technology returning results almost at random, Amazon shut down the project, they said.THE PROBLEM, OR THE CURE? Other companies are forging ahead, underscoring the eagerness of employers to harness AI for hiring.Kevin Parker, chief executive of HireVue, a startup near Salt Lake City, said automation is helping firms look beyond the same recruiting networks upon which they have long relied. His firm analyzes candidates' speech and facial expressions in video interviews to reduce reliance on resumes."You weren’t going back to the same old places; you weren’t going back to just Ivy League schools," Parker said. His company's customers include Unilever PLC and Hilton.Goldman Sachs has created its own resume analysis tool that tries to match candidates with the division where they would be the "best fit," the company said.Microsoft Corp's LinkedIn, the world's largest professional network, has gone further. It offers employers algorithmic rankings of candidates based on their fit for job postings on its site.Still, John Jersin, vice president of LinkedIn Talent Solutions, said the service is not a replacement for traditional recruiters."I certainly would not trust any AI system today to make a hiring decision on its own," he said. "The technology is just not ready yet." Some activists say they are concerned about transparency in AI. The American Civil Liberties Union is currently challenging a law that allows criminal prosecution of researchers and journalists who test hiring websites' algorithms for discrimination."We are increasingly focusing on algorithmic fairness as an issue," said Rachel Goodman, a staff attorney with the Racial Justice Program at the ACLU.Still, Goodman and other critics of AI acknowledged it could be exceedingly difficult to sue an employer over automated hiring: Job candidates might never know it was being used.As for Amazon, the company managed to salvage some of what it learned from its failed AI experiment. It now uses a "much-watered down version" of the recruiting engine to help with some rudimentary chores, including culling duplicate candidate profiles from databases, one of the people familiar with the project said.Another said a new team in Edinburgh has been formed to give automated employment screening another try, this time with a focus on diversity.(Reporting By Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Marla Dickerson)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

REUTERS/Pascal RossignolMoreLONDON (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc is expanding its nascent European product insurance business, according to recent job adverts, which industry watchers say could signal the start of broader ambitions in insurance.Amazon Protect, which provides extensions to manufacturers' warranties for items like mobile phones or washing machines bought on Amazon's website, launched last year in Europe.It is Amazon's only insurance business globally.Recent job advertisements for the EU product insurance division described "launching a new business" and "creating a new palette of services"."This is a sure sign disruption is on the way for the UK insurance market," said Patricia Davies, financial services analyst at data and analytics firm GlobalData.An Amazon UK spokesman declined to comment.Specialist insurers are concerned that Amazon and other online players will encroach on their territory, and are looking to partner with them.Investment in insurtech firms in Europe has risen sharply in the first half of 2017, often with the backing of big insurers. [nL5N1LW28W]Amazon Protect launched in Britain in April 2016, quickly expanding to the firm's main European markets of France, Germany, Italy and Spain.Its policies give customers an extension on manufacturers' two-year warranties for up to five years, insuring against accidental damage, breakdown and theft.The Warranty Group, which underwrites Amazon Protect policies, did not respond to a request for comment.Amazon posted the jobs on LinkedIn and "Where Women Work" in recent weeks."Along with internal and external partners, we are re-defining the warranties and product insurance experience, disrupting the way traditional product insurance services are acquired and delivered and creating a new palette of services," one job ad, which is no longer accepting applications, said.Another asked: "Would you like to take part in launching a new business?"Insurers have been looking at ways of tapping into the so-called connected home, for instance by offering home insurance cover which will alert you if your pipes have sprung a leak.Amazon's launch of voice-activated home personal assistant Alexa could give an opportunity for it to expand into this area of home insurance, Davies said."I don't expect them to come up with traditional insurance products," she said.(Reporting by Carolyn Cohn and Noor Zainab Hussain; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextHealthcare stocks take a beating as Bernie Sanders' 'Medicare for all' plan grows in popularityThe IndependentThis Is The Part Of 'Medicare For All' That You Never Hear AboutHuffPostWorth the risk?

Then in late June, on the first day of vacation with his wife in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, Cipriano noticed over a dozen missed phone calls and messages alerting him that his books had been pulled from the Kindle store and that his ability to publish through KDP was suspended. “It was the worst week of my life,” Cipriano said. “We spent the entire vacation in the hotel worried if I was ever going to make another penny again and worrying about how I was going to pay off all of the expenses for everybody and if we could even afford to eat dinner that night.”Cipriano says he has yet to receive a clear, detailed explanation from Amazon beyond the assertion that he manipulated KDP services — services that include Amazon’s all-you-can-read $9.99 Kindle Unlimited — despite reaching out to customer support to explain the situation. Feedback from Amazon largely came in the form of a generic form letter via email:Source: J.A. CiprianoMoreMichael-Scott Earle, an author of over 45 pulp fiction, science fiction and fantasy novels for men, experienced a similar scenario play out. In mid-July, the Austin, Texas-based native was on the phone with his editor going over changes to the draft of his latest novel, when he received an email from Amazon stating his KDP account was also involved in the “manipulation of KDP services including Kindle Unlimited.”“I imagine I make them probably about a half-million dollars a year which is nothing to them — it’s probably a rounding error to them,” says Earle, who says he has sold roughly 300,000 copies of his books. “But could they have called me or maybe sent me an email? I’m not even worth someone reaching out to and saying, ‘Hey, Michael-Scott, we’re seeing this or that with your account. What’s going on?’”Story continuesAuthor Michael-Scott Earle, pictured with his daughter Betty, has self-published over 45 novels through Amazon. Source: Michael-Scott EarleMoreAmazon, for its part, declined to go into specifics about why it banished these authors. But it appears the company has come down particularly hard on some KDP Select authors in recent weeks. Four other authors Yahoo Finance spoke to on the condition of anonymity acknowledged they had somewhat similar experiences and were also notified that they had somehow manipulated KDP services, including Kindle Unlimited.  “As I’m sure you understand, we don’t comment on actions we take against specific author accounts, but we take attempts to manipulate our services very seriously,” an Amazon spokesperson tells Yahoo Finance. ‘There are people who abuse the system’Since it launched in 2007, the Kindle Direct Publishing platform has become a behemoth in self-publishing, cementing itself as one of the largest marketplaces for authors looking to independently publish their work. In the years since, thousands of authors have flooded KDP with books across many genres, from fiction and romance to business and investing. The KDP platform has become successful enough such that Amazon, in addition to having its own book publishing imprints like 47 North and Grand Harbor Press, offers a slew of tools aimed at helping aspiring independent authors get started. Because KDP has become a crowded platform, some authors who publish through KDP are strongly compelled to enroll in KDP Select, a program that offers enrollment in Kindle Unlimited and the Kindle Owners’ Lending Library for added visibility in exchange for book exclusivity with Amazon. If an author participates in Kindle Unlimited, it’s more likely their books will also be promoted elsewhere in the Kindle store, which can yield more sales. The catch: Authors whose books are available on Kindle Unlimited get paid differently than the rest of the book industry. Instead of receiving a percentage of each book sold, authors are paid each month from one collective royalty fund. And each monthly payment is determined not by how many times an author’s book is downloaded, but by how many ebook pages are read.Thousands of authors self-publish on Amazon’s KDP platform across many genres, from fiction to business and investing. Source: Amazon.comMoreThat business model, unfortunately, has led to authors who try to game the system by faking the number of book pages read — a scam called “book stuffing.” One method involves scammers exaggerating or falsifying the number of pages read by adding a “disruptive link” at the start of a book promising “bonus content.” Clicking on the link jumps the reader to the end of the book, however long it may be. That way, the reader’s device sees that they have finished a book, even if a reader has only read just 5% of it. Yet the book’s author is paid more for it. This June, Amazon further clarified its publishing guidelines such that “disruptive links” are explicitly banned and bonus content should “make up no more than around 10% of an e-book.” Such “manipulations” of Amazon’s KDP service are also grounds for the company to pull an author’s books from Amazon.com and terminate that author’s KDP account. Jessica Park, an author in Manchester, New Hampshire, who has self-published seven books on the KDP platform, says she’s only had positive experiences with Amazon but expressed sympathy for authors whose works may have unjustifiably been banned. “There are some people who abuse the Kindle platform, and that’s slimy,” acknowledged Park. “But some of these cases sound to me like KDP has misinterpreted something or is not communicating well, and it’s shutting off accounts with insufficient explanation. They [Amazon] built this world to let people publish and encouraged them to get their work out there. So I really don’t know, but I am frustrated for them if they’ve truly not done anything wrong.” An imperfect systemAuthors such as Cipriano and Earle, who say they haven’t engaged in any such practices, are now facing the realization that this could be the end of their careers as full-time novelists. After all, Amazon is a dominant force in the publishing industry — and publishing through Amazon was their only source of income. Although Amazon terminated Earle’s KDP account, he attempted a workaround: employing a third-party publisher and their KDP account to potentially publish his works to the Kindle Store on his behalf. On Thursday morning, however, Amazon rejected the publisher’s attempts and additionally told Earle he would not receive the remaining book royalties due to him. Because Amazon’s terms of service state KDP authors can’t sue the company, Earle may pursue arbitration against Amazon in the months ahead if his attorney can’t resolve the issue with Amazon.“I love Amazon, because they offered me the opportunity to publish for a living,” says Earle. “Without them, I wouldn’t have been able to write. But what other choice do I have? It seems like they’re banning my books.”Michael-Scott Earle has written over 45 novels, which have sold over 300,000 copies to date.MoreAnother self-published author, whose works were removed from the Kindle Store this summer, spoke to Yahoo Finance under the condition of anonymity and expressed similar ambivalence: gratitude to Amazon for the ability to jumpstart their career as an independent author but frustration and anguish over playing by Amazon’s rules and still getting dinged.“It may not be Amazon’s intention to do that — it could simply be the result of an imperfect system that can’t properly differentiate between high volumes of legitimate sales and fake, bot-generated sales, for example — but the fact remains that to become a successful self-published author on Amazon is to put yourself at higher risk of having your income obliterated overnight through no fault of your own and without any explanation,” explains the author, who also says he did not receive a detailed explanation of their alleged wrongdoing. “I now feel that even though Amazon may be a decent platform for a hobbyist, it has shown itself to be unreliable, unfair, and arbitrary for people who are serious about self-publishing.”For now, the author plans on taking a “much needed” break from publishing.“Since Amazon is the biggest online book retailer there is, publishing exclusively on non-Amazon storefronts may not be a sustainable plan,” the author adds. Cipriano, who says he was once approached by a major publisher, now faces another reality. Even if he wanted a future book published through a traditional publishing house, the possibility would be unlikely, Cipriano argues.   “Why would a company want to work with a writer like me knowing Amazon doesn’t want me?” he explains. In the eyes of Amazon and some of their hard-won fans, Cipriano, Earle and authors like them are now viewed as tainted goods — whether they gamed Amazon’s publishing platform or not. —JP Mangalindan is the Chief Tech Correspondent for Yahoo Finance covering the intersection of tech and business. Email story tips and musings to jpm@oath.com. Follow him on Twitter or Facebook.More from JP:Pandora CEO: ‘We’re in the early innings of turning things around’ Facebook woes ‘deeper than a 1-day sell-off’Facebook user number disappoint and revenue guidance disappoint, stock collapsesReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksWalmart Wants to Take On Amazon in Digital AdvertisingMotley FoolWill Amazon (AMZN) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?ZacksZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo Finance1 Big Reason Why Disney Stock Is Just Getting StartedMotley FoolSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceCoachella Weekend 2: What to Watch ForVarietyWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloomberg'American Ninja Warrior Junior': Get an exclusive sneak peek at the semi-finals!AOL.com

The ACLU and a coalition of civil rights groups are calling on Amazon chief Jeff Bezos to stop offering Rekognition facial detection system to government customers after learning that the company is actively helping law enforcement implement the potentially invasive technology. Police in multiple regions have partnered with Amazon on surveillance projects, including an Orlando proof-of-concept that lets Amazon search for "people of interest" through city cameras as well a Washington County, Oregon initiative that lets officers scan people to see if they turn up in a mugshot database.The ACLU also learned that Amazon provided Washington County a roadmap under a non-disclosure agreement, and offered to link the county to other government customers interested in Rekognition, such as a body camera manufacturer. That's particularly problematic when facial recognition on body cameras is illegal in Oregon. Amazon deleted mentions of body cams from its site after the ACLU raised the issue.The concern, as you might guess, is that law enforcement and governments could easily use this for all the wrong reasons. Rekognition is powerful enough to track faces in crowded scenes, and could theoretically be used to locate activists and dissidents. New York police, for instance, have already been caught filming protesters as an intimidation tactic -- Rekognition could automate that process by flagging people who routinely show up at protests, no matter how innocent they are. The ACLU also warns of immigration officials abusing this to track newcomers (legal and otherwise), while cities could "routinely" surveil residents regardless of their crimes.In a statement, Amazon didn't directly address the civil rights complaints. It said that it would "suspend" access to Amazon Web Services-based features like Rekognition if a customer "abused" them, and pointed to positive uses such as finding lost children or identifying guests at the recent royal wedding in the UK.It's not certain if Amazon will formally address the objections. However, the outcry highlights some of the problems with the adoption of this surveillance technology: companies are shopping it around to governments and police with no real public input, and little consideration for privacy violations and other abuses. The ACLU and other organizations are clearly concerned that tech giants like Amazon focus on profit while neglecting the social impact of their products.ACLU, AmazonThis article originally appeared on Engadget.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksWalmart Wants to Take On Amazon in Digital AdvertisingMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolState defends South Dakota pipeline protest legislationAssociated PressSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergIn Ukrainian candidate's hometown, a cry for changeAssociated Press'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo Finance3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceInvesting in General Electric Is All About These 3 Key ThingsMotley Fool

Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote and Echo Dot were the best-selling devices.This year Prime Day, Amazon's summer marketing event, started on July 16 and lasted 36 hours.The technical glitches lasted for at least two hours and was likely exacerbated by excessive demand and traffic volume, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said.The retailer likely got between $1.5 billion and $2 billion in revenue from Prime Day and gross merchandise value topped $3.5 billion, Mahaney said.Amazon said it sold over a million smart home devices in the United States.The company did not provide total sales figures for the event, which was open only to members of its Prime subscription service across 17 countries, up from 13 last year.(Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

That notion doesn't seem to fit with Italian soccer giants Napoli, however, as the club has just become the first team in the world to launch its own "brandstore" on Amazon's sprawling marketplace.Instead of choosing to make its new jersey available on just the club website and its own stores, Napoli created a dedicated portal on the Amazon website, allowing fans to grab not only a replica kit but also a wide array of other official apparel. Right now, it's available on Amazon's UK, Italian, German, French and Spanish websites, with the aim to bring it to the US and Canada in the "near future."Amazon's entry into sports clothing isn't all that surprising. The company recently confirmed it had won streaming rights to the English Premier League, providing Prime subscribers with access to 20 matches per season. Customers can also stream ATP Tennis, while perusing a selection of rackets, balls and suitable attire.Despite pushback from major brands, the company has forged ahead with its own in-house clothing lines, allowing customers to throw a pair of jeans in their online basket, alongside some toilet paper and a streaming stick.Napoli BrandstoreThis article originally appeared on Engadget.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadgetAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetTesla's board is about to get a lot smallerTechCrunch

Still, it was the first time Amazon had reached the  milestone,  and was a long way from the company's 52-week low of $682.12.According to FactSet, just 14 other U.S. stocks trade above $1,000 per share, and the only other tech company in the club is Priceline Group, currently trading around $1,865. Of note: Amazon is more than four times more valuable than those 14 other companies combined.Amazon has split three times since its IPO in 1997. In 1998, it issued a 2-for-1 split. In January 1999, it issued a 3-for-1 split and in September 1999, it split 2-for-1. When Amazon hit $1,000, it's technically the equivalent of a $12,000 share price in today's terms.Amazon topped estimates in late April when it posted revenue of $35.7 billion and  an earnings  per share of $1.48, sending the stock on its upward trend. Amazon said sales increased 23 percent during the quarter and its Amazon Web Services business sales increased 42 percent, showing increased demand for its cloud services business.Alphabet (GOOGL) isn't too far behind; shares of its Class A stock are trading above $995.-- CNBC's Peter  Shacknow  contributed to this reportWATCH:An inside look at how Amazon Prime Now delivers food and household items in less than two hoursMore From CNBC Andreessen says we're wrong about the robots, just like we've always beenSteve Ballmer: We took too long to get into hardware when I was at MicrosoftNew York Times executive editor Dean Baquet: Tweets can be journalisticReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

It is unclear how choosing Toronto might affect worsening trade relations between Ottawa and Washington. Other bidders include Washington and two surrounding communities: Montgomery County, Maryland and Northern Virginia."The international politics is for Amazon to deal with," said Toby Lennox, CEO of Toronto Global, which submitted the bid for Toronto and surrounding cities with support of provincial and federal governments. "We are just going to put forward our best offer possible."Canadian federal officials declined to discuss what steps the government might take to campaign on behalf of Toronto or comment on how that might affect relations between Canada and the United States."Canada is a beacon of stability, reliability and openness," Economic Minister Navdeep Bains said in an emailed statement. "We offer a low-risk, business-friendly environment with the lowest business taxes and costs in the G7."Amazon is already expanding in one major Canadian city. In November unveiled plans to open a second corporate office in Vancouver, doubling staff to 2,000 by early 2020.The company disclosed that it was considering boosting investment in Canada just a day after Apple's said it would boost investment in the United States. The iPhone maker promised to open a new U.S. campus, hire 20,000 people and spend $30 billion in a five-year U.S. investment plan.The search for a second North American headquarters after Seattle set off a frenzied competition, with some 238 initial submitting applications, offering incentives including big tax breaks.Toronto's bid shied away from promising tax breaks, while New Jersey offered $7 billion in financial incentives for Amazon to choose Newark. Atlanta's suburb of Stonecrest offered 345 acres of industrial land to create a new city called Amazon, making Bezos mayor for life.Here is the full list of candidates:AtlantaAustin, TexasBostonChicagoColumbus, OhioDallasDenverIndianapolisLos AngelesMiamiMontgomery County, MarylandNashville, TennesseeNewarkNew York CityNorthern VirginiaPhiladelphiaPittsburghRaleigh, North CarolinaTorontoWashington(This version of the story has been refiled to fix typo in first paragraph)(Reporting by Alastair Sharp in Toronto; Additional reporting by Supantha Mukherjee and Shariq Khan in Bengalaru, Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Jim Finkle)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextState defends South Dakota pipeline protest legislationAssociated PressFoxconn says it remains committed to Wisconsin investment projectReutersButina Shouldn't Serve Any More Time in Prison, Her Lawyers SayBloombergWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolWhy the Infamous Trump Tower Meeting Didn't Take Down TrumpFortuneZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

(Bess Adler/Bloomberg via Getty Images)MoreAmazon (AMZN), the second-largest private-sector employer in the U.S., plans on hiring fewer workers for the holidays this year. On Wednesday, the e-commerce giant announced its plan to hire 100,000 workers for the coming holiday season, a 16.7% drop from last year, when its hiring target was 120,000. Amazon has been announcing its holiday season hiring plans annually since 2012. This is the first year that it has lowered its hiring goals. Amazon will hire fewer people for the holiday season this year. (Krystal Hu/Yahoo Finance)MoreThe deceleration comes at a tough time for companies seeking seasonal workers — the labor market is very tight. In September, the unemployment rate fell to 3.7% — a 48-year low. Amazon said the main reason for fewer job openings this holiday season is that most of its employees are full-time. “Since the last holiday season, we’ve focused on more ongoing full-time hiring in our fulfillment centers and other facilities,” an Amazon spokesperson told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday. The Seattle-based retail behemoth has been on a hiring spree as its valuation ballooned to nearly $1 trillion. Amazon said it created over 130,000 new full-time jobs last year. Today, it employs 250,000 full-time employees in fulfillment centers across the country. Amazon is also converting more temporary workers to full-time employees through programs like Career Choice.Even in the tight labor market, the 100,000 openings this year are likely to be filled. Earlier this month, Amazon received more than 70,000 applications within 48 hours of its announcement that it will raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour.Andy Challenger, vice president at outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, doesn’t see Amazon’s holiday-season hiring plans as a negative reflection of its business. “There is no indication it’s because their business has less demand,” Challenger told Yahoo Finance. “All the major retailers are expecting a really big holiday season.”Amazon’s slowdown comes as other major retailers and shipping companies ramp up their hiring plans this year. According to a tally of 31 companies released Wednesday by Challenger, Gray & Christmas, holiday hiring is expected to hit a record high with 704,000 jobs available this year.Krystal Hu covers e-commerce for Yahoo Finance.

A decision could come as early as this week.The Seattle, Washington-based company first announced its HQ2 project in September 2017. The company said it expected to invest over $5 billion in construction and create as many as 50,000 high-paying jobs for the second headquarters.“It will be a full equal to our current campus in Seattle,” the company said in a previous statement. Last year’s HQ2 announcement sparked a competition among more than 200 cities vying to win over the online behemoth. Many cities took up a charm offense for the high-stakes bid, with Tucson, Arizona sending Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos a 21-foot-tall cactus and other communities including Newark, New Jersey and Montgomery County, Maryland offering major tax breaks for the corporation.Amazon narrowed the options down to 20 finalists earlier this year. The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday that the company was in late-stage talks with several communities including Crystal City in Virginia, Dallas, and New York City.An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment about the company’s plans.In this Sept. 13, 2018, file photo Jeff Bezos, Amazon founder and CEO, speaks at The Economic Club of Washington’s Milestone Celebration in Washington.(AP Photo/Cliff Owen, File)More—Emily McCormick is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on Twitter: @emily_mcckRead more from Emily:Netflix user growth beats expectations, shares spike Now is a ‘once-in-a-lifetime chance’ to invest in US pot companies, investor says There are ‘4 headwinds’ facing markets rights nowArk Invest CEO: Tesla ‘is a replay of Apple’ China’s slowing economy could be a problem for Apple   ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolAfter just one day of trading, Zoom Video is the most highly valued tech stock by this metricMarketWatchComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

The first stock split came almost immediately after Amazon shares hit the $100 per-share mark. The pace of gains accelerated in late 1998 and early 1999, and that prompted a more aggressive 3-for-1 split to knock down a stock price that had climbed above $150.

Apple introduced the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max in late September. Previously, Amazon sold only older model iPhones.“Amazon is constantly working to enhance the customer experience, and one of the ways we do this is by increasing selection of the products we know customers want,” the Seattle-based company said in a statement. “We look forward to expanding our assortment of Apple and Beats products globally.”IPhone unit sales barely increased in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, Apple reported earlier this month, even though the new flagship devices came out in the period. The smartphone remains the Cupertino, California-based company’s most important device, generating about 60 percent of quarterly sales and tying customers to other services such as Apple’s music and video streaming.The two tech giants have clashed in the past.Amazon in 2015 stopped selling the Apple TV media-streaming device that wasn’t easily compatible with the e-commerce giant’s video service, an example of Amazon using its clout as the world’s biggest online retailer to promote products that helped push its own streaming content.In 2016, Apple filed a lawsuit against Amazon alleging that the online retailer was selling counterfeit Apple products on its web store.Amazon won’t be selling Apple’s HomePod, the iPhone maker’s competitor to Amazon’s popular Echo brand of home wireless speakers.To contact the reporters on this story: Mark Gurman in San Francisco at mgurman1@bloomberg.net;Spencer Soper in Seattle at ssoper@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Alistair BarrFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2018 Bloomberg L.P.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextFoxconn says it remains committed to Wisconsin investment projectReutersAt $1 Trillion, Apple is Bigger Than These ThingsInvestopediaWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadgetAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceTesla earnings: The big question is how big is the quarterly lossMarketWatchWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergNewsmaker: Diversity, inclusion will drive — or limit — success, Cerner exec saysAmerican City Business Journals

Walmart-owned Jet.com, Click & Collect and Instacart are now solid competitors in the online grocery wars.According to the survey, while online grocery shopping has gained significant momentum, conventional grocery shopping still remains the most frequent grocery channel. Walmart (WMT) Supercenters came in second, and clubs/warehouses such as Costco (COST) and Sam’s Club took the third spot.Primary grocery shopping channel (RBC Capital Markets Proprietary Survey)MoreWhen survey respondents were asked what the primary driver was for grocery shopping in general, price came in at the top with 39% saying that it was the leading decision driver. While location was the second most important driver, the number decreased from 31% in 2017 to 26% in 2018. RBC attributed the decline in the importance of location to the growing online options being offered.Leading reason for choosing primary grocery store (RBC Capital Markets Proprietary Survey)MoreThirty-six percent of respondents said they purchased groceries online in 2018, and 28% said that they purchased groceries online through Amazon. Last year 74% of online grocery shoppers turned to Amazon, but that number took a plunge in 2018 to only 38% as Jet.com and Instacart stole some of the market share.A shifting marketplace for the top online grocery shopping sites (RBC Capital Markets)MoreSatisfaction was an important indicator that the online grocery space has more room to grow. The survey concluded that 79% of respondents that purchased groceries online planned on continuing to do so.RBC concluded that if Amazon wants to hold onto the top spot, getting customers to keep coming back to its online grocery shopping platform remains critical. “The goal, particularly for Amazon, is to create habitual shoppers in their ecosystem.”“2018 saw an acceleration in online grocery shopping adoption. Online grocery pulled off a rare retail feat: increasing shopper frequency and basket size. At the same time, perceived quality is increasing and repeat and expected trial scores improved. A large contributor to this has been availability of Click & Collect and Instacart. Amazon is still growing as the share leader, but it appears others have gained share,” RBC said.Heidi Chung is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Long time market cap king Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ceded the crown to long time runner up Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) after announcing weak third quarter numbers. Then, Microsoft stock started to drop. Meanwhile, the third horse in this race, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), started to regain lost ground. Amazon stock became number one before too long.Those trends persisted in early 2019. Now, AMZN has officially taken the market cap crown. That marks the second market cap crown exchange in roughly just as many months.The buck stops here. There will be no more market cap exchanges in the foreseeable future. Amazon stock is the ideal combination of big, innovative, disruptive, and rapidly growing which warrant it wearing the market cap crown.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  10 Stocks You Can Set and Forget (Even In This Market)  Microsoft is just big and innovative. There isn’t enough disruption or growth there. Apple is just big. Innovation, disruption, and growth are all lacking. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) is big and innovative. But, growth and disruption lag Amazon.There also isn’t any other contestant. The next largest company after the aforementioned Big Four is Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) at under $500 billion.In other words, Amazon stock has taken the market cap crown, and it’s not giving it up any time soon.Why Amazon Deserves the Market Cap CrownIf you were to talk about the largest publicly traded companies with individuals who don’t follow the stock market, the Big Four of Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Google would make sense to pretty much everyone. These are all companies that touch consumers and enterprises on a daily basis and which have widely recognized and valuable brands.But, Amazon stands out from the pack in terms of innovation, growth, and expansion.When you think of Apple, you think of the iPhone and other legacy hardware products. Sure, there’s something to be said for the Apple Watch. But, it’s no iPhone 2.0.For Microsoft, you think about all the cloud offerings, and while those are growing nicely, the company really isn’t expanding dramatically beyond its core cloud business.For Google, you have a company that represents the backbone of the internet and has a rapidly growing cloud business. But, until the self driving business gets off the ground, this company, too, isn’t the gold standard for growth or expansion.Now, let’s talk Amazon. We all know Amazon for its huge and still rapidly growing e-commerce business. We also all know Amazon for its market-leading cloud business. But, that’s just the tip of the iceberg for this company.Amazon is rapidly developing an offline retail business, which projects to go from essentially zero stores two years ago, to 500 Whole Foods locations and 3,000 Amazon Go convenience store locations by 2021.The company is also rapidly building out a digital advertising business, that has gone from hardly being on the scene a few years ago, to a $10 billion annualized revenue business today.There is also the nascent but promising logistics and pharmaceutical businesses, both of which represent multi-billion dollar opportunities.Overall, Amazon’s innovation, growth, and expansion are simply unparalleled. That isn’t a knock against Apple, Microsoft, or Google. Those are all great tech companies with stocks that are long term winners. But, it’s simply to say that no one matches Amazon when it comes to combining size with growth drivers.Because of that, Amazon stock rightly deserves the market cap crown.The Case for $2 TrillionGiven the company’s multi-faceted and long-running growth drivers, there is a case for Amazon stock to not only regain its $1 trillion valuation, but eventually hit a $2 trillion valuation in the long term.The math is pretty simple. You can see it here. But, the brief synopsis for where Amazon’s businesses could be by 2025 are as follows:Ecommerce: $600 billion-plus revenues, 5% operating margin, $30 billion-plus operating profitsCloud: $110 billion revenues, 35% operating margin, ~$40 operating profitsAdvertising: $50 billion revenues, 35% operating margin, ~$20 billion operating profitsAdding it all up, Amazon’s potential operating profit opportunity by 2025 sums to nearly $90 billion. Taking out 10% for taxes, that’s about $80 billion in net profits. A big-growth 25X multiple on that to account for growth potential in pharma and logistics implies a 2025 valuation of $2 trillion for Amazon stock.Story continuesBottom Line on Amazon StockIt’s fair to say that Apple is in the later innings of its growth narrative. Microsoft and Google are both in the middle innings. Amazon is still in the early innings.As such, now that AMZN has taken the market cap crown, it won’t give it up anytime soon.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long AAPL, AMZN, and GOOG. More From InvestorPlace  2 Toxic Pot Stocks You Should Avoid    7 Retail Stocks to Buy for Winning the Online Battle    The 7 Best Stocks in the Entrepreneur Index    7 5G Stocks to Buy as the Race for Spectrum Tightens   Compare Brokers The post Amazon Stock Has Taken the Market Cap Crown, and It Isn’t Giving It Back appeared first on InvestorPlace.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextFoxconn says it remains committed to Wisconsin investment projectReutersAt $1 Trillion, Apple is Bigger Than These ThingsInvestopediaWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolDocuments confirm what Microsoft is building in GoodyearAmerican City Business JournalsComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

Such moves lend credence to the disruptive nature of Amazon. But in other cases, the disruption could be seen a million miles away. That’s the case for the latest rumor centering on an Amazon streaming video game service.According to inside sources, Amazon is developing a platform to stream video games over the internet. This decision pits the company directly against Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), which is working hard to launch a similar service. The e-commerce giant is also going up against video-game powerhouses Sony (NYSE:SNE) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).The news couldn’t come soon enough. Despite its dominant presence, the markets haven’t been kind to Amazon stock. Sure, AMZN did return 28% for its shareholders last year, which is a deeply impressive haul considering the circumstances. But since the end of August, shares are down nearly 18%. Plus, the choppiness over the past three months isn’t helping matters.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn theory, a groundbreaking reveal like Amazon’s streaming games service should bolster the case for the company. In the nearer-term, I can see Amazon stock tick a little higher. But over the long run, the forecast is a little hazy.  7 Stocks at Risk of the Global Smartphone Slowdown  Let’s take a look at both sides of the issue, beginning with the positives:Amazon Stock Has a New WeaponThe appeal for Amazon stock doesn’t just rely on the underlying company’s disruptive strategies. In many cases, it creates new markets and subsequently dominates them. A prime example is their smart speakers. While Alphabet is catching up, Amazon owns the greatest market share by a country mile. More importantly, rival Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has no answer.Considering this track record, I can appreciate the optimism for Amazon’s upcoming streaming games service. For starters, it brings a new revenue stream for the company that previously didn’t exist. Moreover, as its Prime media-content platform has demonstrated, Jeff Bezos & Co. can compete with anyone, even well-established players. That should make the management teams at Sony and Microsoft uncomfortable.Adding to that point, Amazon could possibly put physical gaming consoles on the endangered-species list. Rather than producing its own console, an Amazon streaming service would store the energy-intensive hardware in-house. This allows the tech company to transmit data through the internet.Two advantages readily stand out. First, such a mechanism will entirely forego a physical console. This saves space and cost for the gamer. Second, streaming allows consumers to enjoy graphically intense games on smaller devices like smartphones or tablets. If that’s the case, Sony and Microsoft are futilely spinning their wheels developing their next-generation consoles.Amazon Streaming Service Is Not Practically FeasibleOn a surface level, the bullish argument for video game streaming as a catalyst for Amazon stock is extremely convincing. Apparently, it’s a no-brainer. Considering the rapid proliferation of gaming culture, the e-commerce giant has another guaranteed money-maker on its hands.But does it really? While I generally have a positive view on AMZN stock, I’m not entirely convinced that Amazon’s video game streaming service will get the job done. The venture might even lose money for the vaunted organization.We must consider why consoles exist in the first place. Essentially, they are purpose-driven computers: their entire functionality revolves solely on gaming. Additionally, these devices utilize graphics processor units (GPU) from leading companies like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). GPUs are processors designed to accommodate the intensive data requirements of today’s top video games.Amazon intends to replace this physical platform through streaming. Even with 5G technology, this is an ambitious undertaking.More critically, Amazon’s intended input devices — smartphones, tablets, TV controllers — don’t work well with most modern games. For example, a “Call of Duty” game is tough enough as it is on a traditional console and dedicated controller. I can’t imagine the frustrations involved playing that on my iPhone.Story continuesBottom Line on AMZNIf you’re asking me about my overall opinion on Amazon stock, I maintain my long-term bullishness. AMZN already changed how we shop. Eventually, it will shape how an entire generation lives.But as a gamechanger in gaming? I’m not sure I can buy into that story. Amazon may think it can stream state-of-the-art video games from its data center. But when Sony and Microsoft continue to pound out successor consoles, eventually, the inherent advantages of having a dedicated (and decentralized) platform will outweigh the conveniences of a streaming setup.As long as management keeps expectations in check, and doesn’t go overboard with expenses, this new venture could work. But if they think they can topple the alpha dogs in this sector, they’re in for a rude awakening.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long SNE.More From InvestorPlace  2 Toxic Pot Stocks You Should Avoid    10 Stocks You Can Set and Forget (Even In This Market)    10 Virtual Assistants for the Future of Smart Homes    7 5G Stocks to Buy as the Race for Spectrum Tightens   Compare Brokers The post Amazon’s Streamed Gaming Service Is Neat, But It’s Not a Disruption appeared first on InvestorPlace.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextDocuments confirm what Microsoft is building in GoodyearAmerican City Business JournalsWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolTesla earnings: The big question is how big is the quarterly lossMarketWatch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo Finance5 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy in 2019Motley FoolAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceHere's What Hedge Funds Think About NIO Inc.

(Other reports say it’s ten 30-second ads, which would equal five minutes total, which would be fewer than two minutes of ads per hour, since the average game lasts for 3 hours 7 minutes; Amazon will not answer which is correct.) The rest of the ads that you’ll see will be the same as the national spots that appear on cable networks.For the Amazon-only ads, Amazon has sold packages that reportedly cost $2.8 million. It’s unclear exactly how many minutes are included in each package, and Amazon will not share how many separate packages it has sold, but Amazon does say the packages include banner ads elsewhere on Amazon.com, that don’t run during the games.The ability to sell this volume of ads against the games likely accounts for the rise in price tag compared to the $10 million Twitter paid to stream 10 TNF games last season.And Amazon will track sales data after each ad, so that it can tell a brand exactly how many people purchased or looked up its products after seeing its ad. Saurabh Sharma, director of ad platforms at Amazon, uses Gillette as an example. Amazon will be able to tell Gillette how many people bought its razors and blades on Amazon during or immediately after a game stream. “That’s very exciting, and has never been done,” says Sharma. “We’re taking what we already do with digital ads and applying it to the NFL.”So, what can we expect from the Amazon-only ads during the streaming TNF games? You might assume, since some Prime members will watch the game on a computer, phone, or tablet, that some of the ads might be interactive or innovative in some other way.But the likelihood is the ads won’t look any different than the standard 30-second or 60-second spots you see on television.“Unfortunately I don’t think we’re going to see much different… which is a big mistake,” says Brian Cristiano, CEO of ad agency Bold Worldwide. “Maybe someone surprises us, and I’m hopeful that they do, but I think that’s what’s going to happen. What should be happening is, What story can we tell that starts before, during, and after the game, that a brand can own?”Indeed, at a promotional event at its AWS Loft in Manhattan last week, Amazon showed some of the ads that will appear during the first game. Some of the ads are for Amazon itself, and the rest are mostly from brands that are already official NFL sponsors, like Pepsi, Hyundai, and Gillette (owned by P&G). But there was also an ad from Showtime, not an NFL sponsor, for its series “Ray Donovan.”Even if the ads don’t look unique, what matters is the data Amazon will get from them and give to the advertisers. As Cristiano acknowledges (sounding a lot like Amazon exec Sharma), the ability to figure out how many people purchased directly from Amazon after seeing an ad during the Amazon stream “has never been done before.”Which games Amazon is streaming, and how to watchAmazon is showing 10 Thursday Night Football games and a Christmas Day (this year, a Monday) game.

(Other reports say it’s ten 30-second ads, which would equal five minutes total, which would be fewer than two minutes of ads per hour, since the average game lasts for 3 hours 7 minutes; Amazon will not answer which is correct.) The rest of the ads that you’ll see will be the same as the national spots that appear on cable networks.For the Amazon-only ads, Amazon has sold packages that reportedly cost $2.8 million. It’s unclear exactly how many minutes are included in each package, and Amazon will not share how many separate packages it has sold, but Amazon does say the packages include banner ads elsewhere on Amazon.com, that don’t run during the games.The ability to sell this volume of ads against the games likely accounts for the rise in price tag compared to the $10 million Twitter paid to stream 10 TNF games last season.And Amazon will track sales data after each ad, so that it can tell a brand exactly how many people purchased or looked up its products after seeing its ad. Saurabh Sharma, director of ad platforms at Amazon, uses Gillette as an example. Amazon will be able to tell Gillette how many people bought its razors and blades on Amazon during or immediately after a game stream. “That’s very exciting, and has never been done,” says Sharma. “We’re taking what we already do with digital ads and applying it to the NFL.”So, what can we expect from the Amazon-only ads during the streaming TNF games? You might assume, since some Prime members will watch the game on a computer, phone, or tablet, that some of the ads might be interactive or innovative in some other way.But the likelihood is the ads won’t look any different than the standard 30-second or 60-second spots you see on television.“Unfortunately I don’t think we’re going to see much different… which is a big mistake,” says Brian Cristiano, CEO of ad agency Bold Worldwide. “Maybe someone surprises us, and I’m hopeful that they do, but I think that’s what’s going to happen. What should be happening is, What story can we tell that starts before, during, and after the game, that a brand can own?”Indeed, at a promotional event at its AWS Loft in Manhattan last week, Amazon showed some of the ads that will appear during the first game. Some of the ads are for Amazon itself, and the rest are mostly from brands that are already official NFL sponsors, like Pepsi, Hyundai, and Gillette (owned by P&G). But there was also an ad from Showtime, not an NFL sponsor, for its series “Ray Donovan.”Even if the ads don’t look unique, what matters is the data Amazon will get from them and give to the advertisers. As Cristiano acknowledges (sounding a lot like Amazon exec Sharma), the ability to figure out how many people purchased directly from Amazon after seeing an ad during the Amazon stream “has never been done before.”Which games Amazon is streaming, and how to watchAmazon is showing 10 Thursday Night Football games and a Christmas Day (this year, a Monday) game. On television, some of those games are on CBS, some on NBC, and some on the NFL Network.The 11 games are as follows: Bears at Packers (Sept. 28); Patriots at Buccaneers (Oct. 5); Eagles at Panthers (Oct. 12); Chiefs at Raiders (Oct. 19); Dolphins at Ravens (Oct. 26); Seahawks at Cardinals (Nov. 9); Titans at Steelers (Nov. 16); Redskins at Cowboys (Nov. 30); Saints at Falcons (Dec. 7); Broncos at Colts (Dec. 14); Steelers at Texans (Dec. 25). (A wall at Amazon’s AWS Loft in SoHo, Manhattan, shows all 11 games.)A wall at Amazon’s AWS Loft in Manhattan showing its streaming NFL games.

Square had previously been bid up in anticipation of Reddit’s acceptance. And, another tech darling is taking a hit: Nvidia (NVDA). Investors are still thinking about the chipmaker’s decision to temporarily suspend its self-driving car program, which it announced yesterday. Also lower were shares of Red Hat (RHT) — the software name taking it on the chin on Wednesday after a post-earnings rally on Tuesday. With Wednesday’s losses, the stock has given up more than all of its gains from the earnings move.Stocks in the green include Lululemon Athletica (LULU), shares of which soared today after the company reported earnings after the bell yesterday that beat expectations. Online sales were a bright spot for the company last quarter. Shares of RH (RH), formerly known as Restoration Hardware, shot up today. The company reported earnings late yesterday that were better than expected and also announced expansion plans. Finally, Equifax (EFX) is also having a good day, as shares of the credit reporting agency are up on the day after Mark Begor was named as new CEO. Equifax still trying to recover from fallout surrounding a massive data breach last year. ReblogShareTweetShareWhat to Read NextNatural Gas Price Prediction – Prices Tumble as Supplies IncreaseFX EmpireState defends South Dakota pipeline protest legislationAssociated PressCrude Oil Weekly Price Forecast – Crude oil running into resistanceFX Empire1 Big Reason Why Disney Stock Is Just Getting StartedMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

Grocery store openings declined 29 percent last year as expansion plans cooled and some supermarkets prepared to file for bankruptcy in the year Amazon AMZN acquired Whole Foods, according to a new report from Jones Lang LaSalle.But investments in grocery-anchored shopping centers in 2017 climbed 5.3 percent from 2016, JLL found, making it one of the only retail sectors to see deal growth in a year of low transaction volume."Traditionally, retail has such a reputation right now of everybody being afraid of disruption by e-commerce," James Cook, JLL's director of retail research in the Americas, told CNBC. "Grocery is considered to have a moat around it to defend against e-commerce, and because of that, these [assets] are seen by retail property investors as a safe investment."To be sure, these investors aren't interested in all grocery-anchored centers, Cook cautioned. Just this month, for example, Williamsville, New York-based Tops Friendly Markets filed for bankruptcy, and reports surfaced that Winn-Dixie owner Bi-Lo was preparing to do so, too. There's a glut of shopping centers built around weak tenants that risk going dark, just like many malls anchored by weak department stores."In many U.S. markets you might have six or more grocery chains," Cook said. "In most cases, investors are only interested in the top one or two. Those are the most defensible."The short list for those top grocery contenders include Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Florida-based Publix, Wegmans and some of Kroger KR 's brands. And for the most part today, these chains are opening few new stores. Instead, they are investing in their existing locations to fulfill online orders and ease the delivery of groceries to homes.The strongest U.S. markets for grocery stores, where the most businesses continue to expand, include California, Virginia and North Carolina, according to JLL. Texas, although it's still a top market for grocers, added fewer stores in 2017 than in 2016. The growth in that state has stemmed from a spurt of new residential development. Where there are homes, people need more grocery stores.Source: Jones Lang LaSalle "Retailers die but retail does not," Cook said about the ongoing evolution in the grocery space. "There's just churn as retailers are either disrupted by new business models, or they go out of fashion."Germany-based Lidl was one new player in the U.S. grocery market that everyone had their eyes on in 2017, when it began opening stores across the Southeast. Shortly thereafter, Lidl halted several of its construction projects, local news outlets have reported, as the company admitted it might have started expanding too quickly. Lidl opened nearly 50 stores across the U.S. last year.In turn, Lidl offered other supermarket chains a warning sign: Many markets weren't ready for another grocer in town. The German company also had to fix a few snags internally. It's still working out its private-label items, its layout of U.S. stores and its marketing strategy for American consumers.The most successful grocers today have well-known private labels, fresh food at affordable prices and digital platforms that allow for shopping online, Cook said."We've got two types of classes in grocery right now: One is about offering the best goods at the lowest prices — it's a price play that's targeted at the families in America shopping on a budget, so someone like Aldi is a part of that," he said. "Another avenue of success is offering a great shopping experience to shoppers who aren't as price sensitive — those leaders are Whole foods and Wegmans."5 trends to watch for in grocery retail in 2018, according to JLL:  Smaller grocery stores. (Companies including Whole Foods and Publix are testing new store formats.) Technology implemented in stores that gives retailers more data about their shoppers Blockchain technology, specifically for food safety purposes. (Walmart WMT has been a leader thus far here.) More mergers and acquisitions within the industry (i.e. Albertsons buying Rite Aid RAD ). Rapid checkout. (Walmart, Kroger and Amazon are spearheading their scan-and-go options.)

The shot of the CEO, which went viral and inspired a stream of breathless coverage like GQ Magazine’s “Jeff Bezos’ big-ass biceps will shame you into working out this weekend,” served as a stark symbol of how far he and Amazon have come since Bezos jump-started Amazon in his Seattle garage to peddle books online. Amazon (AMZN) still sells books, of course. But it does so much more now, from cloud-based services to food delivery, much to the delight of more than 300 million shoppers spoiled by its competitive pricing and fast shipping.While Amazon continues to account for a relatively small share of retail overall, the company continuously made business headlines.The e-commerce giant’s broad reach is also drawing the attention of lawmakers like Senator Cory Booker, who argue that big tech companies like Amazon and Google have simply become too big and should face greater antitrust scrutiny.Amazon has had quite the year, which is why Yahoo Finance’s editors selected the Seattle tech giant as 2017’s Company of the Year. Credit: David Foster/Yahoo FinanceMoreIndeed, Amazon’s massive size and influence is part of the reason why, when the time came once again for Yahoo Finance’s editors to select a Company of the Year, the answer was clear. Amazon — which has innovated, moved markets, and pushed boundaries — joins past winners such as Facebook (FB), Disney (DIS), and Nvidia (NVDA). While it might seem like an obvious choice for Company of the Year, there’s no denying that 2017 was huge for Amazon.To be sure, Amazon wasn’t the market’s strongest performer in 2017. Still, Amazon shares soared nearly 60% in 2017 — following moves like the $13.7 billion Whole Foods deal, strong quarterly earnings, Amazon Web Services’ $18 billion annual revenue run rate, and reports that Amazon could break into pharmaceuticals. At the same time, Alexa became the undisputed market leader for voice assistants.But while Amazon’s achievements up-to-date are praiseworthy (see our timeline for Amazon’s path to domination in 2017), some of the company’s most exciting offerings appear yet to come. ‘We’re not focused on conquering’“Our focus is pioneering,” Amazon Worldwide Consumer CEO Jeff Wilke told Yahoo Finance recently during an interview at the company’s Santa Monica, California, offices. “We’re not focused on conquering. That’s a business model some people could choose, but we’re trying to invent — not disrupt. If customers like what we’ve invented, they’re going to choose our invention sometimes, and that may lead to disruption for others, but we expect it to accelerate invention and there will be more opportunity for others to build great models, too.”Despite Wilke’s assertions, disrupt is what Amazon did, so much so that Amazon was cited over 2,000 times on corporate earnings calls this year. One of the year’s largest deals — CVS’s (CVS) $69 billion acquisition of health insurer Aetna (AET) — is viewed by many pundits as a preemptive strike should Amazon barrel into pharmaceuticals the way it has into other areas like retail, groceries and food delivery.   “That seems to be the nature in which every business operates now,” RBC Capital Markets analyst George Hill explains, pointing to moves like Target’s (TGT) $550 million acquisition of Shipt, a same-day delivery company, which was announced in December. “Has Amazon led this charge? Absolutely. As Amazon continues to up its game in owning the ‘last mile’, they’re going to force every participant to up their game, as well.”Story continuesAmazon’s obsession with that “last mile” — the final journey of an order from the warehouse to the shopper’s doorstep — has forced virtually every retailer to rethink delivery since the tech giant launched Amazon Prime’s two-day delivery in 2005 and spearheaded an all-out arms race for faster shipping. Before Prime, anyone who wanted their orders quickly would have to pay FedEx or UPS big bucks or just have to wait. Now two-day or same-day shipping is the norm for an estimated 90 million Prime members, or 63% of Amazon customers in the U.S. A “genius” acquisitionOne pundit calls Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods Market, which closed in August, the “second best” acquisition of the decade — second only to Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram in 2012. Source: Francisco Antunes/FlickrMoreThe tech giant’s boldest move this year was also its most surprising. In June, Amazon announced it would acquire Whole Foods for $13.7 billion — its largest acquisition to date. Although it toyed with groceries before — most visibly with an in-house groceries delivery service called Amazon Fresh — the Whole Foods acquisition was by far Amazon’s biggest signal yet that it is serious about expanding its overall presence in brick-and-mortar retail, starting with taking over Whole Foods’ 460-plus stores. Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at at NYU Stern School of Business and author of the book, “The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google” calls Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods the second-best acquisition of the decade — second only to Facebook’s (FB) $1 billion acquisition of the popular photo-sharing app Instagram in 2012. “For Amazon, buying Whole Foods was genius,” Galloway contends. “It gives them access to the wealthiest refrigerators in the world, one of the best and largest consumer brands in the world and lets them pick up 500 new warehouses all in one purchase.”The week Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods Market closed, Whole Foods started selling Amazon Echo speakers in-store.MoreThe effect on competition was immediate. That same Thursday in August when Amazon announced it would cut prices, Kroger (KR), Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM), SuperValu (SVU), Costco (COST), Target, and Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) stock all took a nosedive.Whole Foods, meanwhile, saw new life after announcing its sixth consecutive quarter of falling same-store sales early this year. Foot traffic to its stores jumped 17% year-over-year during the week Amazon initially cut prices, according to the data analytics firm Thasos Group. Of those new shoppers, 24% came from Walmart, 16% came from Kroger, and 15% crossed over from Costco. “The purpose of the acquisition was very simple: we’re fans,” explained Wilke, who added that the grocery chain’s healthier selection helped change the way he consumed food soon after he relocated from Pittsburgh 18 years ago to work with Bezos at Amazon. “I think we had a great opportunity to partner with a terrific company and a great brand. They essentially invented the natural and organic category.”  Amazon’s other home runAmazon may not have invented the voice assistant, but that doesn’t seem to matter to the tens of millions of shoppers who now own an Echo speaker. According to estimates from digital research firm eMarketer, the Echo cornered roughly 70% of the U.S. market for voice-controlled speakers this year. You knew Alexa had entered the pop culture lexicon when “Saturday Night Live” aired its geriatric-themed spoof in May. Unlike Apple (AAPL), which keeps Siri under lock and key, Amazon early on opened up access to Alexa so outside companies and developers could develop functions for it, even integrate it into their own devices. It was a risky business move, to be sure, but one that turned out to be a masterstroke. At last January’s Consumer Electronics Show, hundreds of Alexa-enabled devices from outside parties — fridges, self-driving cars, even baby monitors — lined the convention halls. “We envisioned Alexa and all the products that connect to her to be based mostly in the cloud, and I think that’s the kind of paradigm shift that we’ve seen with this technology as opposed to previous technologies in consumer electronics, because Alexa being up in the cloud allows us to improve her every single day,” Dave Limp, Amazon SVP of devices and services, told Yahoo Finance at Amazon’s Seattle headquarters recently.  “And because developers can extend her through software skills and through hardware partners, you’re seeing her now in refrigerators and cars and baby monitors and cameras.”The hunt for HQ2Although Amazon’s Seattle headquarters is already sprawling, the tech giant plans on opening a second headquarters elsewhere in the U.S. Source: AP Photo/Elaine ThompsonMoreAs Amazon expanded its brick-and-mortar footprint in 2017, it also made headlines by announcing it planned on opening a second headquarters somewhere else in the U.S, dubbed HQ2, with an estimated cost of $5 billion.Soon after, the tech giant received 238 proposals from across North America, several of which got creative in wooing Amazon. Arizona representatives sent Amazon a 21-foot cactus, and a Pittsburgh sandwich chain offered to feed every Amazon employee. But the city of Stonecrest, Georgia, dangled the most outrageous deal of them all in offering to create an entirely new city called “Amazon” where Bezos could serve as mayor “for life.” (Yes, really.) Media reports suggested a number of cities as top contenders, from Austin, Texas to Boston. But Stonecrest, Georgia, may have the edge. In early December, Amazon registered an in-house lobbyist specializing in “clean energy and technology” with the Georgia State Ethics Commission ahead of the state’s legislative session in January. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed on Tuesday to Yahoo Finance that this is not at all related with the search of Amazon’s second headquarters and is part of their ongoing investment efforts across the country through different projects. The spokesperson also pointed out that over the last 5 years, Amazon has invested more than $100 billion in the U.S in fulfillment center infrastructure (they have now 75 fulfillment centers in the U.S.), data centers, wind farms, regional tech hubs, corporate offices and compensation to its teams.For his part, Wilke contends that Amazon is still in the early process of evaluating bids.“We don’t want to over-describe or over-constrain what we’re interested in because there will be trade-offs probably in all of these cities,” he said, “but it needs to have a large enough pull, a large enough workforce where we can attract and retain the kind of people that work at Amazon, including technical folks.”What’s in store for 2018? In the months and years to come, Wilke says, Prime members in particular will reap the benefits of the Whole Foods purchase with more exclusive discounts. For Amazon, Whole Foods also represents a trove of logistical and supply chain data. As the company expands its physical footprint beyond lockers stuffed with shoppers’ orders, physical bookstores and autonomous stores like Amazon Go, the tech giant is looking to better understand aspects of brick-and-mortar like foot traffic, in-stores sales versus online sales, and sales technology — all things Amazon needs to master if it wants to expand its Amazon Go store beyond its employees-only Seattle location. The Amazon employees-only Amazon Go store in Seattle uses a tracking system with sensors and cameras to determine what a customer has bought without anyone ever having to scan an item. Source: AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, FileMoreOne day, regular shoppers in the U.S. will eventually pick up any item they want to buy in-store and simply walk out without ever having to interact with another human being or having to scan their items to purchase them. Amazon naturally wants to be at the forefront of that change.  As for Alexa, Wilke suggests more skills for the popular voice assistant are coming in 2018 focused on letting shoppers do more on Amazon.com simply using their voice.  “It’s early days, but you can imagine that the way we’re communicating right now would be a natural way to communicate when they’re something you want to buy,” Wilke hints.2018 could also prove to be the year in which regulators pay closer attention to Amazon, not to mention other big tech companies like Google and Facebook, as public sentiment with Silicon Valley has soured. Just over the weekend, news emerged that Amazon could face an investigation by UK’s Advertising Standards Authority over complaints that Prime didn’t come through on its promises of “unlimited one-day delivery” with some shoppers. Still, Wilke isn’t concerned about regulators or critics who argue Amazon is too oppressive on competition or needs to be broken up into smaller pieces. In typical Amazon fashion, he’s more concerned about winning over consumers.“I would just direct them to the fact that we have less than 1% of worldwide retail and there are several companies, many companies actually, who are larger than us, even in retail,” Wilke emphasizes. “We’re not at a place where we should worry about that. We should be continuing to take care of customers. We, Amazon, should worry about continuing to take care of customers, invent on their behalf.”He also points to the fact that over 50% of all sales on Amazon.com are sales done by third-party sellers and between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday alone, 140 million products were ordered and fulfilled by third-party sellers. “Our services are being used by third parties to build businesses independently of Amazon,” adds Wilke. “If that continues — and it will — there will be many winners in retail.” The caveat being of course, those winners, are beholden to Amazon for its revenues, whether they like it or not.Source: David Foster/Yahoo FinanceMoreClick here to find out more about Amazon’s culture and here to discover its plans for Alexa.—JP Mangalindan is the Chief Tech Correspondent for Yahoo Finance covering the intersection of tech and business. Email story tips and musings to jpm@oath.com. Follow him on Twitter or Facebook.More from JP:Facebook named the No. 1 place to work in the USFacebook targets 6- to 12-year-old demographic with Messenger Kids Facebook publishes ad rules in wake of Russias revelations ‘Scandal’ creator Shonda Rhimes: Why I left ABC for NetflixIntuit CEO: Old-school accountants will be ‘struggling in 5 years’ because of A.I.How Amazon quickly trains 120,000 employees for the holidaysPayPal CEO: ‘It’s expensive to be poor’Why the Russia ad scandal could actually be a win for FacebookFacebook diversity chief ‘frustrated’ over progressMelinda Gates on ‘the hardest thing’ she’s ever had to doRBC analyst: Only 2 scenarios would spur investors to flee FacebookMeet the man behind Facebook Messenger’s growth spurtLEAKED AUDIO: New Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi reveals 3 things employees should know about himReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatchWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopedia3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Watch in AprilMotley FoolWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

At last January’s Consumer Electronics Show, hundreds of Alexa-enabled devices from outside parties — fridges, self-driving cars, even baby monitors — lined the convention halls. “We envisioned Alexa and all the products that connect to her to be based mostly in the cloud, and I think that’s the kind of paradigm shift that we’ve seen with this technology as opposed to previous technologies in consumer electronics, because Alexa being up in the cloud allows us to improve her every single day,” Dave Limp, Amazon SVP of devices and services, told Yahoo Finance at Amazon’s Seattle headquarters recently.  “And because developers can extend her through software skills and through hardware partners, you’re seeing her now in refrigerators and cars and baby monitors and cameras.”The hunt for HQ2Although Amazon’s Seattle headquarters is already sprawling, the tech giant plans on opening a second headquarters elsewhere in the U.S. Source: AP Photo/Elaine ThompsonMoreAs Amazon expanded its brick-and-mortar footprint in 2017, it also made headlines by announcing it planned on opening a second headquarters somewhere else in the U.S, dubbed HQ2, with an estimated cost of $5 billion.Soon after, the tech giant received 238 proposals from across North America, several of which got creative in wooing Amazon. Arizona representatives sent Amazon a 21-foot cactus, and a Pittsburgh sandwich chain offered to feed every Amazon employee. But the city of Stonecrest, Georgia, dangled the most outrageous deal of them all in offering to create an entirely new city called “Amazon” where Bezos could serve as mayor “for life.” (Yes, really.) Media reports suggested a number of cities as top contenders, from Austin, Texas to Boston. But Stonecrest, Georgia, may have the edge. In early December, Amazon registered an in-house lobbyist specializing in “clean energy and technology” with the Georgia State Ethics Commission ahead of the state’s legislative session in January. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed on Tuesday to Yahoo Finance that this is not at all related with the search of Amazon’s second headquarters and is part of their ongoing investment efforts across the country through different projects. The spokesperson also pointed out that over the last 5 years, Amazon has invested more than $100 billion in the U.S in fulfillment center infrastructure (they have now 75 fulfillment centers in the U.S.), data centers, wind farms, regional tech hubs, corporate offices and compensation to its teams.For his part, Wilke contends that Amazon is still in the early process of evaluating bids.“We don’t want to over-describe or over-constrain what we’re interested in because there will be trade-offs probably in all of these cities,” he said, “but it needs to have a large enough pull, a large enough workforce where we can attract and retain the kind of people that work at Amazon, including technical folks.”What’s in store for 2018? In the months and years to come, Wilke says, Prime members in particular will reap the benefits of the Whole Foods purchase with more exclusive discounts. For Amazon, Whole Foods also represents a trove of logistical and supply chain data. As the company expands its physical footprint beyond lockers stuffed with shoppers’ orders, physical bookstores and autonomous stores like Amazon Go, the tech giant is looking to better understand aspects of brick-and-mortar like foot traffic, in-stores sales versus online sales, and sales technology — all things Amazon needs to master if it wants to expand its Amazon Go store beyond its employees-only Seattle location. The Amazon employees-only Amazon Go store in Seattle uses a tracking system with sensors and cameras to determine what a customer has bought without anyone ever having to scan an item. Source: AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, FileMoreOne day, regular shoppers in the U.S. will eventually pick up any item they want to buy in-store and simply walk out without ever having to interact with another human being or having to scan their items to purchase them. Amazon naturally wants to be at the forefront of that change.  As for Alexa, Wilke suggests more skills for the popular voice assistant are coming in 2018 focused on letting shoppers do more on Amazon.com simply using their voice.  “It’s early days, but you can imagine that the way we’re communicating right now would be a natural way to communicate when they’re something you want to buy,” Wilke hints.2018 could also prove to be the year in which regulators pay closer attention to Amazon, not to mention other big tech companies like Google and Facebook, as public sentiment with Silicon Valley has soured. Just over the weekend, news emerged that Amazon could face an investigation by UK’s Advertising Standards Authority over complaints that Prime didn’t come through on its promises of “unlimited one-day delivery” with some shoppers. Still, Wilke isn’t concerned about regulators or critics who argue Amazon is too oppressive on competition or needs to be broken up into smaller pieces. In typical Amazon fashion, he’s more concerned about winning over consumers.“I would just direct them to the fact that we have less than 1% of worldwide retail and there are several companies, many companies actually, who are larger than us, even in retail,” Wilke emphasizes. “We’re not at a place where we should worry about that. We should be continuing to take care of customers. We, Amazon, should worry about continuing to take care of customers, invent on their behalf.”He also points to the fact that over 50% of all sales on Amazon.com are sales done by third-party sellers and between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday alone, 140 million products were ordered and fulfilled by third-party sellers. “Our services are being used by third parties to build businesses independently of Amazon,” adds Wilke. “If that continues — and it will — there will be many winners in retail.” The caveat being of course, those winners, are beholden to Amazon for its revenues, whether they like it or not.Source: David Foster/Yahoo FinanceMoreClick here to find out more about Amazon’s culture and here to discover its plans for Alexa.—JP Mangalindan is the Chief Tech Correspondent for Yahoo Finance covering the intersection of tech and business. Email story tips and musings to jpm@oath.com. Follow him on Twitter or Facebook.More from JP:Facebook named the No. 1 place to work in the USFacebook targets 6- to 12-year-old demographic with Messenger Kids Facebook publishes ad rules in wake of Russias revelations ‘Scandal’ creator Shonda Rhimes: Why I left ABC for NetflixIntuit CEO: Old-school accountants will be ‘struggling in 5 years’ because of A.I.How Amazon quickly trains 120,000 employees for the holidaysPayPal CEO: ‘It’s expensive to be poor’Why the Russia ad scandal could actually be a win for FacebookFacebook diversity chief ‘frustrated’ over progressMelinda Gates on ‘the hardest thing’ she’s ever had to doRBC analyst: Only 2 scenarios would spur investors to flee FacebookMeet the man behind Facebook Messenger’s growth spurtLEAKED AUDIO: New Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi reveals 3 things employees should know about himReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatchWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopedia3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Watch in AprilMotley FoolWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

But now it’s saying goodbye to the cheaper and smaller store format.Whole Foods CEO John Mackey told employees the grocery chain will not open new Whole Foods 365 stores anymore, according to an internal email reviewed by Yahoo Finance. The existing 12 stores, the newest of which just opened in Atlanta in December, will remain in business.Mackey said the main reason behind the strategy shift is Whole Foods’ prices. “As we have been consistently lowering prices in our core Whole Foods Market stores over the past year, the price distinction between the two brands has become less relevant,” Mackey wrote on Wednesday. “As the company continues to focus on lowering prices over time, we believe that the price gap will further diminish.”“Learnings and innovations from 365 have been incorporated into Whole Foods Market and the company will continue to innovate and experiment,” a Whole Foods spokesperson said in a statement.Amazon has been rolling out discounts and weekly deals for Prime members who shop at Whole Foods stores. But in August, 40% of more than 2,000 Whole Food shoppers surveyed by Yahoo Finance said they believe the prices of products in stores aren’t really lower.Launched in 2016, 365 stores heavily feature Whole Foods private-label products, including 365 Everyday Value products, to lure budget shoppers who have avoided the premium stores once known as the Whole Paycheck. Following Amazon’s acquisition, those brands have become increasingly available in regular Whole Foods stores, Amazon.com and even Amazon Go stores.The team would concentrate efforts on growing the core Whole Foods Market brand, according to the email. Employees who have been working for 365 will be integrated into other Whole Foods’ regions.Brittain Ladd, CEO of Six-Page Consulting, said the move signals more private-label products could come to Whole Foods stores, a common strategy for grocers to lower prices in a business with thin margins.Amazon’s grocery strategy(David Foster/Yahoo Finance)MoreWhole Foods set high expectations for its 365 stores. It was the premium retailer’s effort to attract cost-conscious millennial shoppers. In May 2017, one month before Amazon announced its $13.7 billion acquisition of the chain, Mackey told investors Whole Foods had 22 365 stores under development in the U.S. and they would be increasing that number.The discontinuation of the 365 stores comes at a time when Whole Foods is planning a national expansion. With support from Amazon, Whole Foods is looking to open more stores in locations with more than 45,000 square feet and eyeing sites that used to host retailers like Sears.Meanwhile, Amazon has expanded its own smaller-format grocery store footprint with Amazon Go. With a cashierless checkout experience, Amazon Go has grown to nine locations in the U.S. this past year.“Whole Foods Market’s leadership independently made this decision and it is unrelated to Amazon Go,” said the grocery’s spokesperson, referring to its pull back of 365 stores.According to Ladd, the move fits into Amazon’s overall grocery strategy. “Why do you need both Whole Foods 365 and Amazon Go, when Amazon Go carries the almost same number of SKUs (Stock Keeping Unit)? It was too confusing to the customers,” he said. “Amazon keeps a strategy where they have larger Whole Foods stores that provide a significant immersion experience of grocery shopping, and Amazon Go be the quick and convenience shop.”Krystal Hu covers technology and trade for Yahoo Finance.

Source: WebSummitMoreAmazon VP of Alexa Al Lindsay has a bold goal for Alexa, the popular voice-controlled personal assistant: one day, Alexa should be capable of holding conversations up to 20 minutes long.  “A lot of what people ask Alexa for today are fairly short interactions,” Lindsay told Yahoo Finance at the annual Web Summit tech conference, held this week in Lisbon, Portugal. “Longer conversations aren’t yet the norm.”Indeed, use any one of the voice-controlled personal assistants currently on the market, such as Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant or Cortana, and you’ll quickly realize Lindsay and his competitors still have a lot more to work to do before five-, 10- or 20-minute conversations are possible. For now, interactions with Alexa are a start-and-stop affair where users instruct it to perform one or two of over 25,000 different tasks: telling you the latest news, calling an Uber or playing the latest Nick Jonas album off Spotify. But what Alexa can’t do, for instance, is book an entire trip to the Bahamas in one go. You can do bits and pieces — book a hotel, check your flight status — but it’s not as intuitive as booking it yourself online yet or talking to an old-school travel agent. That’s still the stuff of Lindsay’s longer-term, unfulfilled dreams: a truly versatile “Star Trek”-like computer that accomplishes virtually anything you throw at it with a simple voice command. “To truly realize that vision, you’ll want a number of things: you’ll want to have it everywhere, be able to talk to it from anywhere, be able for it to do all of the things you would want an intelligent assistant do for you, and ultimately do it in a very conversational way,” Lindsay added.  A long road aheadGetting there will require a lot of work accomplished by the 5,000 or so Amazon employees who now work on Alexa in places as far-flung as Germany and India, as well as outside developers. Perhaps realizing that making Alexa a conversational whiz was a herculean task, Amazon readily shares Alexa’s software development tools with third parties. Last year, Amazon announced the Alexa Prize, a $2.5 million competition for university students who develop “social bots” using Alexa’s technology that can convincingly chat with people about pop culture and news events for up to 20 minutes. This March, Amazon announced the Alexa Fund, a $100 million venture capital fund that gives cash to companies and developers who drum up new “skills” that let Alexa perform new tasks. “If we can actually get to the point where it’s truly conversational and equivalent to speaking to another human, anyone will be able to interact with it effectively,” Lindsay explained. “You won’t have to learn how to use a touchscreen or how to use an app. You just speak to it.” The Amazon executive’s goal of having Alexa become truly ubiquitous could become reality faster than many think. The voice-controlled assistant started simply enough in 2014 when the first Echo speaker launched, but if this year’s CES in January was a good indicator, Alexa could soon be everywhere you want it to be. There were Alexa-compatible smartphones, baby monitors, air purifiers, self-driving cars, even refrigerators. It’s an ambitious effort, though hardly an altruistic one. The more Alexa-enabled devices there are in the world – and Lindsay tells Yahoo Finance there are already “tens of millions” of Alexa-enabled devices now — the more people interact with Alexa. And the more engaging Alexa becomes, the more likely they are to use Amazon’s wide array of services and buy things, whether it’s a new album off Amazon Music or dinnerware from Amazon.com. After all, Amazon has a 76% market share of the home smart speaker market in the U.S., according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, and the Seattle tech giant clearly wants to keep it that way. —JP Mangalindan is Chief Tech Correspondent for Yahoo Finance covering the intersection of tech and business.

The company said it was an easy to deploy tool and comes up with no up-front costs to manage it.Amazon said its Amazon Inspector helps customers pay for the assessments that they run and that the first 250 assessments were free for a customer's first 90 days. The online retailer said the scale and the flexibility of the AWS cloud would make it possible for customers to establish and deploy apps and services quicker than before.AWS' Chief Information Security Officer, Stephen Schmidt, commented, "Customers have asked us if we could help them do the same rigorous security assessments on their applications that we do for our AWS services. Amazon Inspector delivers key learnings from our world-class security team as a managed service, so customers benefit from our continuous implementation of best practices and threat intelligence. Companies of all sizes can now perform assessments of their applications in an automated way and proactively remediate vulnerabilities."Shares of the company traded down by 1.28 percent on Tuesday.See more from BenzingaMarkit To Hold Earnings Conference Call On May 10Franklin Street Properties To Hold A Conference Call On April 27LCNB Q1 Profit Rises 4.6%© 2016 Benzinga.com.

It acquired Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in August to help it deliver groceries to shoppers' doorsteps.Amazon's results defied expectations that it would invest nearly all of its earnings into new areas as it has in the past. The world's largest online retailer said net income rose to $256 million, or 52 cents per share in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Analysts on average were expecting 3 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Prime Day, a summer marketing event Amazon has created to replicate the shopping frenzy that is more typical of the winter holiday season, helped boost sales.The event fared better this year internationally than last year, Amazon's Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a call with reporters.Revenue jumped 34 percent to $43.7 billion in the third quarter, including $1.3 billion in sales from the upscale grocer. Analysts had expected $42.1 billion.This was "another strong performance, with top-line growth accelerating in the core retail segment," Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian said.In a first, Amazon broke out sales for its online retail business and for its physical bookstores and Whole Foods locations. Revenue from its online stores jumped 22 percent to $26.4 billion, the fastest growth Amazon has seen in the segment in more than a year.Key to its success has been signing more people up for Amazon Prime, its fast-shipping and video-streaming club, whose members tend to buy more from the company. Revenue from subscription fees such as Prime showed unusually strong growth of 59 percent, to $2.4 billion.And Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's most profitable unit, which handles data and computing for large enterprises, posted a 41.9 percent rise in sales to $4.58 billion, beating the average estimate of $4.52 billion, according to analytics firm FactSet."They are firing on all cylinders. The machine is churning," Benchmark Co analyst Daniel Kurnos said.Amazon expects an operating profit in the current quarter between $300 million and $1.65 billion. Analysts are expecting $930.78 million for this critical holiday sales period, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.STILL BETTING ON HOLLYWOODAmazon shares have a high valuation, with a price-to-earnings ratio more than eight times that of cloud-computing rival Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), for instance.Unlike peers, Amazon runs on razor-thin profit margins because it sinks most of its profit back into its business.In a call with media, CFO Olsavsky listed a dizzying number of investments: warehouses around the world to ship goods faster to shoppers, data centers to handle the computing needs of large enterprises, and a 77 percent uptick in employees last quarter, including Whole Foods workers.The company plans to spend more on video content next year as well, Olsavsky said. Analysts estimate Amazon will have spent $4.5 billion this year.The commitment to content comes after Amazon Studios chief Roy Price resigned last week, and other top studio hands left the company.It is unclear what impact the shakeup may have on Amazon's ability to secure video that competes with Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) for viewers' attention.Amazon Studios came up short at the Primetime Emmy Awards last month, and some have criticized it for not appealing to a broad audience.The company's shares, which closed down 0.05 percent on Thursday, rose about 7.5 percent to $1,046.00 in after-hours trading following the earnings statement. They had gained about 30 percent this year.(Reporting by Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco and Aishwarya Venugopal in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Henderson and Lisa Shumaker)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaThe Morning After: The Weather Channel got hackedEngadgetTrailers of the Week: 'Child's Play,' 'Hobbs and Shaw,' 'Big Little Lies 2'Rolling StoneWhole Foods Will Sell a Limited-Edition Cheese for The Royal Baby's BirthFood & WineWhere to Stream Movies FreeConsumer ReportsZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceTesla earnings: The big question is how big is the quarterly lossMarketWatchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolBoeing's earnings report brings the 737 Max debacle into focusMarketWatch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceThis High-Yield Dividend Stock Could Richly Reward InvestorsMotley FoolAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceWhat to Expect When Alphabet Reports Later This MonthMotley FoolWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergCan U.S. Steel Revive Sentiments with Its Q1 Earnings Results?Market Realist

Since the Seattle tech giant rolled out the first Alexa-enabled speaker in 2015, the sleeper hit has become the undisputed market leader and in the process, contributed to Amazon’s selection by Yahoo Finance’s editors as 2017’s Company of the Year. (See our timeline for Amazon’s path to domination in the past year.)According to eMarketer, the Echo cornered roughly 70% of the U.S. market for voice-controlled speakers this year, eclipsing competitors like Google Home, Microsoft Cortana and Apple’s Siri, to the point at which “Saturday Night Live” aired a geriatric-themed Echo spoof in May. “We envisioned Alexa and all the products that connect to her to be based mostly in the cloud,” explains Dave Limp, senior vice president of devices and services. Source: Yahoo FinanceMoreOver the next 12 months, Amazon says more skills for the popular voice assistant are coming focused on letting shoppers do more on Amazon.com simply using their voice. That’s good for the tens of millions of Echo owners and Prime users in the world today, but as is frequently the case, also good for Amazon’s bottom line. And, as the Echo becomes more ubiquitous, particularly in business settings, Amazon may be compelled to reassure users that the home assistant isn’t invading their privacy.Amazon says the cloud is the key to Alexa’s successIn September, Amazon unveiled several new Echo speakers, including a more compact Echo and a souped-up Echo Plus. Source: AmazonMoreThe Echo’s success as a voice-controlled speaker is undoubtedly impressive, and the key to America embracing Alexa in their homes was making Alexa cloud-based, contends Dave Limp, Amazon SVP of devices and services. “We envisioned Alexa and all the products that connect to her to be based mostly in the cloud, and I think that’s the kind of paradigm shift that we’ve seen with this technology as opposed to previous technologies in consumer electronics, because Alexa being up in the cloud allows us to improve her every single day,” Limp told Yahoo Finance at Amazon’s Seattle headquarters recently. Limp added: “And because developers can extend her through software skills and through hardware partners, you’re seeing her now in refrigerators and cars and baby monitors and cameras. The momentum just continues to build throughout the year and I think we’ll see it continue into 2018 as well.”Unlike Apple (AAPL), which keeps Siri under lock and key, Amazon early on opened up access to Alexa so outside companies and developers could develop functions for it, even integrate it into their own devices. It was a risky business move, but ultimately a savvy one. At last January’s Consumer Electronics Show, Alexa was the breakout star, with hundreds of Alexa-enabled devices from outside parties — fridges, air purifiers, self-driving cars, even baby monitors — lining the convention halls en masse.  What’s next for AlexaFor now, interactions with Alexa are a start-and-stop affair where users instruct it to perform one or two of more than 25,000 different tasks: telling you the latest news, cracking a sassy joke, calling an Uber or playing the latest Ariana Grande album off Amazon Music or Spotify. But what Alexa can’t do is hold a rich, lengthy conversation that picks up on things like cues and context. “I can barely hold a 20-minute conversation, so you can imagine how hard it is for technology,” Limp quips. Getting to that point will require a lot of work from 5,000 or so Amazon employees who now work on Alexa in places as far-flung as Germany and India, as well as outside developers. Perhaps realizing that making Alexa a conversational whiz was a herculean task, Amazon shares Alexa’s software development tools with third parties to create tasks, or “skills,” of their own.Story continuesIn 2015, Amazon announced the Alexa Fund, a $100 million venture capital fund that gives cash to companies and developers who drum up new skills that let Alexa perform new tasks. For Amazon, all these efforts — sharing software tools with third parties, the fund and student competitions — are a means to an end. The more Alexa-enabled devices there are in the world, the more people interact with Alexa. And the more engaging Alexa becomes, the more likely they are to use Amazon’s wide array of services and order things.Amazon’s efforts may help stave off increasing competition from companies such as Apple, which releases the HomePod — its answer to Amazon Echo — some time next year. Source: Yahoo FinanceMoreThose efforts may also help stave off competition like Google Home, Microsoft’s (MSFT) Cortana and Apple’s Siri, which is already usable on Mac computers and arrives loaded on the HomePod — Apple’s (AAPL) answer to the Amazon Echo — when the speaker arrives some time in 2018.Ask Limp about the growing competition, and he’ll contend Echo continues to distinguish itself in the way it interacts with users. “Some of those assistants are very different,” Limp says. “They’re focused on one-to-one interaction with a person themselves, usually on the phone, and that’s not what we’re trying to do with Alexa. We’re trying to do something very different. It’s in a home setting — it’s very communal.”  The Amazon executive also says the Alexa team pays serious attention to feedback from Echo owners. Case in point, in early December, the team rolled out a new Alexa “skill,” or task, that lets people use their voice to set an alarm that wakes them up with music. One Echo customer requested that feature roughly a year ago, Limp says.‘Privacy can’t be bolted on as a last feature’In November, Amazon announced Alexa for Business, which lets organizations bring the popular voice assistant into the office. Source: Amazon/YouTubeMoreAnother potentially big area of opportunity in the coming months? Alexa for Business, which the tech giant announced at Amazon Web Services’ re:Invent conference this November, and lets businesses bring the voice assistant into the office so entire teams or offices can use it. In addition to setting reminders, managing schedules and ordering office supplies, Alexa is now capable of simplifying certain office tasks. “I walk into the conference room, and all I say is, ‘Alexa, start the meeting,’” Limp explains. “The cloud knows which meeting it is, which attendees, which A/V [audio-visual] system to set up, and it all just automatically gets set up.”  While businesses like Capital One (COF), Brooks Brothers and WeWork have already signed up as clients, one business Yahoo Finance spoke under the condition of anonymity said it was evaluating Alexa for Business but expressed privacy and security concerns, because Alexa is allegedly “always on” and “always listening” to what’s going on in a room. According to a report from The Information in July, for instance, Amazon was thinking about giving developers access to raw transcripts of users’ interactions with Alexa — a report Limp vehemently denied to Yahoo Finance. Limp acknowledges that security and privacy remain a valid concern but contends Amazon has its bases covered on that front, whether it’s having a Mute button on the device or that blue ring that turns on once Alexa is listening. “Privacy can’t be bolted on as the last feature you would put into this,” he says. “From the very beginning, we thought about privacy as a foundational element. Alexa isn’t always on. All she’s listening for is that wake word [Alexa], and that’s local. Nothing is going to the cloud, and secondarily, once we do start streaming to the cloud, we make it very clear to everyone in the room by that circle of light that, hey, right now we are streaming up to the cloud. That’s critical. Because without that user interface, you would never know.” Despite Amazon’s efforts, privacy will likely remain a concern with devices such as the Echo as they become more successful and ubiquitous.Click here to read more about the work culture at Amazon.—JP Mangalindan is the Chief Tech Correspondent for Yahoo Finance covering the intersection of tech and business. Email story tips and musings to jpm@oath.com. Follow him on Twitter or Facebook.More from JP:Facebook named the No. 1 place to work in the USFacebook targets 6- to 12-year-old demographic with Messenger Kids Facebook publishes ad rules in wake of Russias revelations ‘Scandal’ creator Shonda Rhimes: Why I left ABC for NetflixIntuit CEO: Old-school accountants will be ‘struggling in 5 years’ because of A.I.How Amazon quickly trains 120,000 employees for the holidaysPayPal CEO: ‘It’s expensive to be poor’Why the Russia ad scandal could actually be a win for FacebookFacebook diversity chief ‘frustrated’ over progressMelinda Gates on ‘the hardest thing’ she’s ever had to doRBC analyst: Only 2 scenarios would spur investors to flee FacebookMeet the man behind Facebook Messenger’s growth spurtLEAKED AUDIO: New Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi reveals 3 things employees should know about himReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

Source: AmazonMoreThe Echo’s success as a voice-controlled speaker is undoubtedly impressive, and the key to America embracing Alexa in their homes was making Alexa cloud-based, contends Dave Limp, Amazon SVP of devices and services. “We envisioned Alexa and all the products that connect to her to be based mostly in the cloud, and I think that’s the kind of paradigm shift that we’ve seen with this technology as opposed to previous technologies in consumer electronics, because Alexa being up in the cloud allows us to improve her every single day,” Limp told Yahoo Finance at Amazon’s Seattle headquarters recently. Limp added: “And because developers can extend her through software skills and through hardware partners, you’re seeing her now in refrigerators and cars and baby monitors and cameras. The momentum just continues to build throughout the year and I think we’ll see it continue into 2018 as well.”Unlike Apple (AAPL), which keeps Siri under lock and key, Amazon early on opened up access to Alexa so outside companies and developers could develop functions for it, even integrate it into their own devices. It was a risky business move, but ultimately a savvy one. At last January’s Consumer Electronics Show, Alexa was the breakout star, with hundreds of Alexa-enabled devices from outside parties — fridges, air purifiers, self-driving cars, even baby monitors — lining the convention halls en masse.  What’s next for AlexaFor now, interactions with Alexa are a start-and-stop affair where users instruct it to perform one or two of more than 25,000 different tasks: telling you the latest news, cracking a sassy joke, calling an Uber or playing the latest Ariana Grande album off Amazon Music or Spotify. But what Alexa can’t do is hold a rich, lengthy conversation that picks up on things like cues and context. “I can barely hold a 20-minute conversation, so you can imagine how hard it is for technology,” Limp quips. Getting to that point will require a lot of work from 5,000 or so Amazon employees who now work on Alexa in places as far-flung as Germany and India, as well as outside developers. Perhaps realizing that making Alexa a conversational whiz was a herculean task, Amazon shares Alexa’s software development tools with third parties to create tasks, or “skills,” of their own.Story continuesIn 2015, Amazon announced the Alexa Fund, a $100 million venture capital fund that gives cash to companies and developers who drum up new skills that let Alexa perform new tasks. For Amazon, all these efforts — sharing software tools with third parties, the fund and student competitions — are a means to an end. The more Alexa-enabled devices there are in the world, the more people interact with Alexa. And the more engaging Alexa becomes, the more likely they are to use Amazon’s wide array of services and order things.Amazon’s efforts may help stave off increasing competition from companies such as Apple, which releases the HomePod — its answer to Amazon Echo — some time next year. Source: Yahoo FinanceMoreThose efforts may also help stave off competition like Google Home, Microsoft’s (MSFT) Cortana and Apple’s Siri, which is already usable on Mac computers and arrives loaded on the HomePod — Apple’s (AAPL) answer to the Amazon Echo — when the speaker arrives some time in 2018.Ask Limp about the growing competition, and he’ll contend Echo continues to distinguish itself in the way it interacts with users. “Some of those assistants are very different,” Limp says. “They’re focused on one-to-one interaction with a person themselves, usually on the phone, and that’s not what we’re trying to do with Alexa. We’re trying to do something very different. It’s in a home setting — it’s very communal.”  The Amazon executive also says the Alexa team pays serious attention to feedback from Echo owners. Case in point, in early December, the team rolled out a new Alexa “skill,” or task, that lets people use their voice to set an alarm that wakes them up with music. One Echo customer requested that feature roughly a year ago, Limp says.‘Privacy can’t be bolted on as a last feature’In November, Amazon announced Alexa for Business, which lets organizations bring the popular voice assistant into the office. Source: Amazon/YouTubeMoreAnother potentially big area of opportunity in the coming months? Alexa for Business, which the tech giant announced at Amazon Web Services’ re:Invent conference this November, and lets businesses bring the voice assistant into the office so entire teams or offices can use it. In addition to setting reminders, managing schedules and ordering office supplies, Alexa is now capable of simplifying certain office tasks. “I walk into the conference room, and all I say is, ‘Alexa, start the meeting,’” Limp explains. “The cloud knows which meeting it is, which attendees, which A/V [audio-visual] system to set up, and it all just automatically gets set up.”  While businesses like Capital One (COF), Brooks Brothers and WeWork have already signed up as clients, one business Yahoo Finance spoke under the condition of anonymity said it was evaluating Alexa for Business but expressed privacy and security concerns, because Alexa is allegedly “always on” and “always listening” to what’s going on in a room. According to a report from The Information in July, for instance, Amazon was thinking about giving developers access to raw transcripts of users’ interactions with Alexa — a report Limp vehemently denied to Yahoo Finance. Limp acknowledges that security and privacy remain a valid concern but contends Amazon has its bases covered on that front, whether it’s having a Mute button on the device or that blue ring that turns on once Alexa is listening. “Privacy can’t be bolted on as the last feature you would put into this,” he says. “From the very beginning, we thought about privacy as a foundational element. Alexa isn’t always on. All she’s listening for is that wake word [Alexa], and that’s local. Nothing is going to the cloud, and secondarily, once we do start streaming to the cloud, we make it very clear to everyone in the room by that circle of light that, hey, right now we are streaming up to the cloud. That’s critical. Because without that user interface, you would never know.” Despite Amazon’s efforts, privacy will likely remain a concern with devices such as the Echo as they become more successful and ubiquitous.Click here to read more about the work culture at Amazon.—JP Mangalindan is the Chief Tech Correspondent for Yahoo Finance covering the intersection of tech and business. Email story tips and musings to jpm@oath.com. Follow him on Twitter or Facebook.More from JP:Facebook named the No. 1 place to work in the USFacebook targets 6- to 12-year-old demographic with Messenger Kids Facebook publishes ad rules in wake of Russias revelations ‘Scandal’ creator Shonda Rhimes: Why I left ABC for NetflixIntuit CEO: Old-school accountants will be ‘struggling in 5 years’ because of A.I.How Amazon quickly trains 120,000 employees for the holidaysPayPal CEO: ‘It’s expensive to be poor’Why the Russia ad scandal could actually be a win for FacebookFacebook diversity chief ‘frustrated’ over progressMelinda Gates on ‘the hardest thing’ she’s ever had to doRBC analyst: Only 2 scenarios would spur investors to flee FacebookMeet the man behind Facebook Messenger’s growth spurtLEAKED AUDIO: New Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi reveals 3 things employees should know about himReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

It acquired Whole Foods Market for $13.7 billion (£9.8 billion) last year to help it send groceries to shoppers' doorsteps.Amazon's results bucked expectations that it would plow more profit into investments, as it has done in the past. Amazon said net income rose to $1.6 billion, or $3.27 per share in the quarter ended March 31. Analysts on average were expecting $1.26 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Sales rose 43 percent to $51.0 billion in the quarter, beating analysts' average estimate of $49.8 billion.The fast ascent of Amazon and its Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, now the richest person in the world, has drawn the attention of U.S. President Donald Trump.

Sales from Prime fees and other subscriptions grew 60 percent to $3.1 billion."We still feel it's the best deal in retail," Brian Olsavsky, Amazon’s chief financial officer told a conference call, adding the number of items eligible for free two-day shipping increased in recent years from 20 million to more than 100 million.Revenue from third-party sellers paying to promote their products on Amazon.com was an unusually large bright spot during the quarter. Advertising and "Other" sales, including from co-branded credit cards, grew 139 percent to $2.03 billion."The significant acceleration in Other revenues suggests Amazon's advertising ambitions continue to ramp quickly, and is now large enough to drive upside in Amazon's margin profile," said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian in a note.Amazon said it expects operating profit this quarter between $1.1 billion and $1.9 billion, up from $628 million a year earlier.

For nearly every product category, Amazon is offering curated options that are priced very competitively and consistently please the masses.The list of categories — which began in 2015 with AmazonBasics and “Pinzon” (another home essentials brand) — was already growing quickly when it gained another boost by Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods and its popular 365 brand. Whole Foods itself illustrated a distinct take on generics, as its upscale reputation gave its generic brand 365 prestige.This strategy, according to SunTrust analysis, could carry the business to sales of $25 billion a year by 2025, far above 2018’s current projection of $7.5 billion.Amazon has found the missing piece for generics with its techIn many ways, Amazon’s approach to generic products isn’t that different from classic in-store generics. Generics sit next to their name-brand counterparts at the pharmacy or grocery store, like Costco’s Kirkland brand, CVS’s CVS brand, or Whole Foods 365. Their location, subtle design hints like packaging shape and color, active ingredients, and the occasional “compare to Listerine” would serve to inform consumers of the lower-cost alternative.The Amazon model is largely the same thing, but in search results — instead of on the shelf. You search for sunscreen on Amazon and you see Amazon’s “compare to Coppertone” next to the Coppertone. But there are a few secret weapons inherent to Amazon’s platform that make its current forays into generics a force that could reshape retail.One trick up its sleeve: reviews. If a shopper were ever on the fence deciding between a generic and a name-brand product, a chorus of 5,000 Amazon reviews with a 4.8-star average is often enough to make someone trust the in-house generic. No one wants to pay more than they have to, and if you don’t care about buying a brand-name suitcase or electric kettle, the cheaper generic has a very good shot.But Amazon itself has also become a name brand of sorts, as its brand connection may be seen as a pro, not a con for some items.Amazon Essentials, men’s clothing (Amazon.com)MoreSince the Amazon marketplace is filled with countless inexpensive, largely anonymous brands — like Yungsong and Qianxiang for iPhone cables — Amazon’s often similarly priced offerings stand out. Unlike the unknown brands, Amazon’s products are backed by a large, established company with a track record of customer satisfaction and a “customer-obsessed” CEO who has a stake in the reputation of products carrying the brand.“A big advantage of AmazonBasics is being able to deal directly with Amazon for warranty replacement,” wrote one commenter on the Wirecutter, a popular online review site owned by The New York Times. “For me, that often helps tip the scales.”Story continuesEven if an Amazon-branded product appears to be identical to a competitor’s, its branding carries an implicit promise of quality control, customer service, and a generous return policy that makes it risk-free to try. Like Whole Foods elevating generics with its 365 brand, the Amazon mark may be a value-add.Amazon said it adds products too quickly to have metrics to share about the average reviews or return rates of its in-house branded products, but a Yahoo Finance analysis across multiple product categories found very strong showings that regularly match or exceed their counterparts.Amazon is a search engine, and its products are doing well on itAmazon’s most overlooked quality may be the fact that its marketplace is a search engine, and one that research has shown has supplanted Google as the first place an online shopper goes to buy something.Amazon search results have long been a battleground for retailers looking for prominent placement because customers seldom look beyond the first page. The retailer has, unsurprisingly, become savvy at playing the placement game with its own private-label products.Search for anything on the site and you’ll see an Amazon brand in the first few results, as well as “sponsored” products at the top. (The company sponsors Amazon-brand items on its own site.) Yahoo Finance searched dozens of product categories with a cleared browser and Amazon’s house brands were staples among the first three results.The Amazon algorithm, sellers have told Yahoo Finance, is based on a handful of factors, including positive reviews, number of reviews, sales, SEO-quality copy, and price, a characteristic that enables the company to be especially competitive, given its tolerance for microscopic margins.“These marketplaces always have new requirements, things they’re testing,” said Neha Gajwani, CEO of SmackTom, which sells electronics accessories and more on Amazon and other platforms, earlier this year. “All of that goes into where they put you in search.”Amazon refines its search algorithm continuously, and like a grocery store it has no obligation to treat its own products and competitors equally. Neutral or not, Amazon says that it is focused on providing a broad selection, including both in-house and independent brands.Data, quality and recognitionAmazon’s review system and generous return policy have allowed it to expand generics into hundreds of categories throughout its site. Armed with a precise understanding of the products people search for, Amazon can tailor its offerings.If, for example, 40-watt light bulbs or bocce ball sets become popular items — and they have good reviews and a low price — Amazon may give the product its coveted “Amazon’s Choice” badge in a search result. (There are also “Best Seller” badges.) The idea behind “Amazon’s Choice” is similar to the reviewing model used by the Wirecutter. In short, the model is: “This product works well for most people.”Amazon’s Mama Bear organic baby food (Amazon.com)MoreBut it has long been considered an open secret that besides using this data to give popular products a badge, Amazon uses the data on what people are searching for, buying, and reviewing positively to jump in to provide its alternative, especially if it’s an everyday product that’s easy to get for a private label.“Got a Hot Seller on Amazon?” asked one Bloomberg headline from 2016, “Prepare for E-Tailer to Make One Too.”The open secret holds that if Amazon house-brand products don’t already dominate these badges, they’re probably strong possibilities for what’s coming next. (Amazon launched its own pet food brand, Wag, in May.)Amazon didn’t directly confirm this open secret, but told Yahoo Finance that the idea for in-house products began by listening to and learning from customers to bring them products they’ll like.Amazon declined to elaborate on its data use and about how many data scientists work on these projects, but from CEO Jeff Bezos’s comments in the past, and Amazon’s behavior in product rollouts, data likely plays a major role.“There is a right answer or a wrong answer, a better answer or a worse answer, and math tells us which is which. These are our favorite kinds of decisions,” he wrote in a 2005 letter to shareholders. “Quantitative analysis improves the customer’s experience and our cost structure.”Practically all manufacturers and retailers use data, but Amazon’s data-driven approach may be the key to its success.On the Wirecutter, Amazon brands have performed well, earning prominent spots over the years in cables, umbrellas, paper shredders, and spots on its travel guide. As Courtney Schley wrote for the site in 2016: “We…test AmazonBasics offerings whenever they’re relevant and even recommend its stuff as a top pick or alternate in our guides to paper shredders, HDMI cables, school backpacks, and 12 other reviews (as of this writing).”Schley advised consumers to read the customer reviews, noting the quality for some was really good but poor for others. Amazon’s lightning pace of adding products every month means a near-impossible task for professional reviewers for sites like Wirecutter and the Strategist.Already, consumers are able to wake up with their phone plugged into an Amazon cable in an Amazon charger in an Amazon power strip, sitting next to their Rivet (Amazon) bedside table with an Amazon basics light with Pinzon (Amazon) sheets, shave, brush, and shower with Solimo shampoo, put on Amazon clothing, and so on — we haven’t even gotten 10 minutes into the day yet.

REUTERS/Joshua RobertsMoreBy Munsif Vengattil and Jeffrey Dastin(Reuters) - Jeff Bezos, Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) founder and the world's richest person, said on Thursday he will commit $2 billion to helping homeless families and starting pre-schools for low-income communities.The announcement marks a deeper foray into philanthropy for Bezos, whose fortune has soared to more than $160 billion thanks to his stake in Amazon. Dominance in e-commerce and the nascent field of cloud computing has made Amazon the world's second-most valuable public company.Bezos solicited ideas on Twitter last year for ways to donate some of his wealth. While he has financially supported cancer research and scholarships for immigrants, among other causes, Bezos has primarily devoted his fortune to his Blue Origin rocket company, which he described on Thursday as an "investment in the future of our planet through the development of foundational space infrastructure."His private ownership of The Washington Post, which has published articles critical of the White House, has also put him at odds with U.S. President Donald Trump.The new philanthropic effort is called the Bezos Day One Fund, a nod to the executive's management philosophy that organizations must view every day with the fervor of a new start, or face stagnation and decline.Within this, the "Day 1 Families Fund" will support existing non-profit organizations that offer shelter and food to young homeless families.The "Day 1 Academies Fund" will start an organization to operate a new network of full-scholarship pre-schools for low-income communities. Citing the Amazon mantra of customer obsession, Bezos said in a tweet https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/1040253796293795842: "The child will be the customer."Bezos said in remarks to the Economic Club of Washington that it is "really really hard" for a child to catch up if they fall behind in their early years. The money will pay "gigantic dividends for decades."He said he did not know how much money he would eventually give away.Bezos has yet to join "The Giving Pledge" created by fellow billionaires Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett, whose more than 180 signatories have promised to give more than half of their fortunes to philanthropy.The Amazon chief's wealth has become problematic for some.Earlier this month, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, proposed a bill in Congress called the "Stop BEZOS" Act, which would make large corporations pay workers more or pay for public assistance programs like Medicaid. Amazon has said Sanders' statements about the company were "inaccurate and misleading."(Reporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru and Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco; Additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington Editing by Shailesh Kuber and Paul Tait)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool









amazon's all-new echo is a more attractive smart assistant

After all, who would want a speaker in their homes they could talk to?It turns out a lot of people. Enough, in fact, for Amazon to launch five more smart speakers since then, including the all-new Echo. Available now for $99 — that’s less than the original’s $179 price tag — the new Echo improves upon both its predecessor’s looks and performance.It’s a great buy for consumers who are just getting into the smart assistant market. However, there might not be much reason for existing users to upgrade since the cloud-based Alexa gets all the same improved functionality in both the new and old versions of the Echo.An Echo that’s at home in your homeThe original Echo stood out for both its impressive capabilities as a smart speaker and almost alien design. Amazon crafted the Echo in the shape of a tall, black cylinder that was instantly recognizable. But as competitors like Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) Home and Apple’s (AAPL) upcoming HomePod opt for more traditionally decorative designs, Amazon is adjusting the Echo’s look.The new Echo is still a cylinder, but it’s squatter than the original. And like Google’s Home, which has a customizable base, the Echo now has an interchangeable shell that you can fit to your home’s style. The base shells come in black or grey fabric and are genuinely attractive. I can see both easily fitting in on my end table or night stand. I can also see my cats deciding to tear into them like they did with my Google Home’s fabric base.Evidence that my cats hate or love my Google Home.MoreIf you want a different look, you can purchase walnut, oak, or silver finish shells for $29 a piece. Replacing them is a snap. You simply push the small indent in the bottom of the Echo and push the speaker out of the shell. Slide it into your new one and you’re all set.Unlike the first-generation Echo, this new version doesn’t have a twistable volume ring at its top. Instead, Amazon has included volume up and down buttons. It’s not a big change and really makes no functional difference. Still, I liked the simplicity of being able to twist the top of the Echo to quickly adjust the volume when I needed to turn down Taylor Swift before the delivery guy got to my door and found me out.Amazon did away with the Echo’s twisting top in favor of traditional volume buttons.MoreAmazon did, however, add an AUX jack to the new Echo, which means you can connect it to any speaker. Want to turn your big home entertainment center into a giant smart speaker? You’ve got it.Pump up the jamConsumers don’t just use their smart speakers to talk to disembodied voices. They’re also solid standalone speakers for listening to music and podcasts. But Amazon couldn’t just release a new Echo with the same speakers as the previous model. So the company upped the audio capabilities of the Echo by dropping in a 2.5-inch subwoofer and 0.6-inch tweeter.Story continuesThe new Echo next to the older, taller Echo.MoreI’m by no means an audiophile — I think the headphones that came with my smartphone are more than adequate — so I’m not exactly picky when it comes to audio quality. That said, I found the new Echo’s speakers to be a bit clearer and deeper than the original’s.If you’re the kind of person who needs the absolute best audio experience, well, the Echo probably isn’t going to cut it. But then that’s what that AUX jack is for.Can you hear me, Alexa?Amazon says the new Echo has improved beam-forming microphones that allow it to hear your voice from farther away. I live in a New York City apartment, which means, well, there’s not a ton of room to really put the Echo’s mics to the test. I noticed it, like other smart speakers, had a bit of trouble hearing me over excessively loud music, but both it and the older Echo picked up my voice with ease from a moderate distance.The point is, this Echo isn’t going to blow away the last version, which is great for owners of the original.The Amazon Echo without its fabric shell.MoreThat holds equally true when it comes to the new Echo’s overall capabilities. The second-generation Echo can do everything its predecessor can. That means you can call other Echo devices, as well as people with the Alexa app, make voice calls to your family’s and friends’ mobile phones and landlines and set up multi-room listening.Both Echos also have the ability to let you perform multiple tasks at once with one voice command. You can, for example, say, “Alexa, goodnight,” and it will run a set routine of tasks like lock the doors, turn off the lights and more. You can also train both Echos to recognize your voice, so when you say “Play my favorites playlist,” it will play your playlist and not your roommates. The same feature also works with making calls. So, if you tell your Echo to call your Mom, it will call your own mother and not your friend’s.Should you get it?The Amazon Echo is already the best smart speaker you can buy thanks to its ability to communicate with hundreds of connected devices, as well as Amazon’s own massive online store.The addition of a vastly improved design, and slightly upgraded sound, simply serve to make it a more attractive purchase for first-time smart speaker buyers. Should you ditch your current Echo for the gen 2? Not necessarily.I’d only suggest making the switch if you’re sick of your current Echo’s look, or you really want that AUX jack. If not, stick with your original.Update: This post has been updated to reflect that the echo can make voice calls and recognize individual voices.More from Dan:Why Microsoft is playing nice with iPhones and AndroidThe biggest problem holding VR back right nowGoogle Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL review: Android phones done right‘South Park: The Fractured But Whole’ review: Disgusting, smart and funWhat it takes to play video games for a living: Insane hours and tons of stressEmail Daniel at dhowley@yahoo-inc.com; follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextGoogle Allows YouTube App on Amazon's Fire TV Once AgainIndiewireGet this $20 Alexa smart speaker instead of a $50 Echo DotBGR NewsXbox One S, Bushnell, iPad Pro, Fire TV Cube, and more deals for April 19MashableAmazon and Google launch free music services in challenge to SpotifyThe TelegraphZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraph57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCN'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley Fool3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceInvesting in General Electric Is All About These 3 Key ThingsMotley FoolCardinal Timothy Dolan on the Catholic ChurchWSJ

But the stores serve a number of strategic purposes for Amazon, and selling books may be the least of them.Most media discussion of the store has centered around the method of display: books are shelved with the covers facing out (as opposed to the spines) and with a user review from Amazon.com below every book, plus the number of total reviews the book has and its average score. Only books with 4 stars or higher can earn a spot in the stores, with the exception of a few new releases.Most of the sections are organized based on data from Amazon.com (Highly Rated: 4.8 Stars & Above; Frequently Wished-For on Amazon.com; If You Like, You’ll Love) or data from Kindle (Page Turners: Books Kindle Readers Finish in 3 Days or Less).A display shelf in Amazon’s bookstore (Daniel Roberts)MoreAll of this has led to the criticism you’d expect the book world to have when the big bad guy moves into town: Quartz wrote that the store “sucks the joy out of buying books.”But the other striking characteristic of the store is a large section for products that aren’t books: Amazon hardware devices like the Echo and Echo Dot.That’s no afterthought. Think of Amazon’s physical bookstores as a proving ground for its many other, larger brick-and-mortar plans.A test for future Amazon stores“This is a way for them to figure out how to do physical stores,” says Spencer Millerberg, CEO of e-commerce researcher One Click Retail. “Amazon started [in 1994] in physical media like books and CDs that were easy to stock and sell cheap and didn’t expire. Now they’re doing consumables, groceries, clothing, and what they’re trying to do there is really, really hard. They don’t understand the minutia and mistakes they’ll make in the meantime. This store is just a beachhead for Amazon in order to get into consumables, clothing, and electronics, all in physical retail.”Indeed, Amazon had planned to open its first Amazon Go, a cashier-less convenience store, in Seattle in early 2017, but in March it delayed the opening. That may signal it hasn’t quite figured out the kinks of brick-and-mortar yet.The bookstores could be useful for some of Amazon’s other business endeavors, too. “They’re never going to tell you, but you can sense that you might need a physical location for drones to do delivery,” says Millerberg. “Having these stores act as distribution hubs is not a bad way to go, or having these function as a physical place to touch and smell their devices is not a bad way to go.”And of course, it’s yet another Amazon venture that it hopes can buoy Prime memberships. The store is cashless: you must pay with a credit or debit card, or Amazon Prime members can check out with the Amazon app (and get a discounted price).Using a bookstore as a showroom for Amazon devicesThere’s a dirty word in the bookstore business: “showrooming,” which refers to when people browse a physical bookstore (or Best Buy or Macy’s) to make decisions, then buy nothing and go home and order the books online. The irony is that in Amazon’s store, showrooming is encouraged, and feeds itself: people can browse physical books and then buy them on their own Kindle instead (right in store), or do the same for Amazon tech gadgets, a la Apple Store.Jennifer Cast, VP of Amazon Books, in an interview at the store, rejected the showroom label, but then went on to describe the store as exactly that.Story continues“I wouldn’t call it a showroom,” she said. “The way that people use showrooming in retail—we’re fine with that too—but with our devices, customers have been asking for a place that they can test drive for a long time. And here, not only can you see the Kindles, and they’ve got books on them, but Echo can play books on Audible, so there’s obvious synergy between our devices and books. We are completely agnostic here. We have a lot of physical books in this store, and our goal is not to showroom, our goal is to encourage you to discover a book. But if you want to buy an Audible book, or a Kindle book, or you don’t want to schlep the big cookbook that you found and loved, ship it home, we don’t care.”Amazon now sells more in groceries and clothing than booksPhysical media (books, DVDs, physical video games) made up $8 billion of Amazon’s $136 billion in total sales in 2016, according to One Click Retail. Consumables (grocery, fresh, beauty products) surpassed that at $9 billion. Apparel (including shoes and handbags, too) was bigger yet, at $11 billion. Hard-copy books are now Amazon’s smallest category, apart from digital books ($3 billion).In other words: the table stakes for Amazon’s bookstores are low. But what it stands to gain is knowledge and lessons for additional brick-and-mortar efforts down the road.What booksellers have to fearThat’s not to say that smaller booksellers don’t have to worry about Amazon invading their space. On the Amazon store’s grand opening day, multiple shoppers inside told Yahoo Finance they were impressed with the presentation of the books—many noted the covers facing out and liked the change—and said they plan to return. (See the Yahoo Finance video at the top of this page, from the grand opening.)Jay DePaolo, owner of the wellness-focused specialty bookstore Choices in Manhattan, predicts, “The initial brick-and-mortar store will cause a great deal of excitement because it is Amazon and it is something new.” But he isn’t too worried in the long run, because he’s not convinced Amazon can change buyer behavior back to physical stores: “Once the initial hoopla is over, if people can get it online cheaper and faster, especially the youth, [Amazon] will phase this out and within three years they will close the stores. Look at what happened to Borders and Barnes & Noble.”Independent and specialty stores like DePaolo’s have proven an exception to the larger brick-and-mortar crisis, and there’s something Amazon’s store has in common with the bookstores that do remain today: they contain quite a lot of items that aren’t books. DePaolo says his store once sold 75% books and 25% gift items; it’s the opposite balance now. “I believe in today’s market if you’re not doing several things in your business, you won’t last,” he says. “Today you have to wear many hats.”Even if selling books is a secondary goal, if the store does well you can trust Amazon will open more of them. For now, it has two more planned in New York City this year.—Daniel Roberts is a writer at Yahoo Finance, covering technology and media.Read more:Why Amazon will have success selling workout clothesAmazon Prime Day is a raw deal for e-book buyersAmazon crushes earning expectations again on the strength of Web ServicesHow baseball’s tech arm got so big that Disney had to have a pieceNew novel envisions American economic collapse in near futureReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley Fool1 Big Reason Why Disney Stock Is Just Getting StartedMotley FoolSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCHere's What Hedge Funds Think About NIO Inc.

Only books with 4 stars or higher can earn a spot in the stores, with the exception of a few new releases.Most of the sections are organized based on data from Amazon.com (Highly Rated: 4.8 Stars & Above; Frequently Wished-For on Amazon.com; If You Like, You’ll Love) or data from Kindle (Page Turners: Books Kindle Readers Finish in 3 Days or Less).A display shelf in Amazon’s bookstore (Daniel Roberts)MoreAll of this has led to the criticism you’d expect the book world to have when the big bad guy moves into town: Quartz wrote that the store “sucks the joy out of buying books.”But the other striking characteristic of the store is a large section for products that aren’t books: Amazon hardware devices like the Echo and Echo Dot.That’s no afterthought. Think of Amazon’s physical bookstores as a proving ground for its many other, larger brick-and-mortar plans.A test for future Amazon stores“This is a way for them to figure out how to do physical stores,” says Spencer Millerberg, CEO of e-commerce researcher One Click Retail. “Amazon started [in 1994] in physical media like books and CDs that were easy to stock and sell cheap and didn’t expire. Now they’re doing consumables, groceries, clothing, and what they’re trying to do there is really, really hard. They don’t understand the minutia and mistakes they’ll make in the meantime. This store is just a beachhead for Amazon in order to get into consumables, clothing, and electronics, all in physical retail.”Indeed, Amazon had planned to open its first Amazon Go, a cashier-less convenience store, in Seattle in early 2017, but in March it delayed the opening. That may signal it hasn’t quite figured out the kinks of brick-and-mortar yet.The bookstores could be useful for some of Amazon’s other business endeavors, too. “They’re never going to tell you, but you can sense that you might need a physical location for drones to do delivery,” says Millerberg. “Having these stores act as distribution hubs is not a bad way to go, or having these function as a physical place to touch and smell their devices is not a bad way to go.”And of course, it’s yet another Amazon venture that it hopes can buoy Prime memberships. The store is cashless: you must pay with a credit or debit card, or Amazon Prime members can check out with the Amazon app (and get a discounted price).Using a bookstore as a showroom for Amazon devicesThere’s a dirty word in the bookstore business: “showrooming,” which refers to when people browse a physical bookstore (or Best Buy or Macy’s) to make decisions, then buy nothing and go home and order the books online. The irony is that in Amazon’s store, showrooming is encouraged, and feeds itself: people can browse physical books and then buy them on their own Kindle instead (right in store), or do the same for Amazon tech gadgets, a la Apple Store.Jennifer Cast, VP of Amazon Books, in an interview at the store, rejected the showroom label, but then went on to describe the store as exactly that.Story continues“I wouldn’t call it a showroom,” she said. “The way that people use showrooming in retail—we’re fine with that too—but with our devices, customers have been asking for a place that they can test drive for a long time. And here, not only can you see the Kindles, and they’ve got books on them, but Echo can play books on Audible, so there’s obvious synergy between our devices and books. We are completely agnostic here. We have a lot of physical books in this store, and our goal is not to showroom, our goal is to encourage you to discover a book. But if you want to buy an Audible book, or a Kindle book, or you don’t want to schlep the big cookbook that you found and loved, ship it home, we don’t care.”Amazon now sells more in groceries and clothing than booksPhysical media (books, DVDs, physical video games) made up $8 billion of Amazon’s $136 billion in total sales in 2016, according to One Click Retail. Consumables (grocery, fresh, beauty products) surpassed that at $9 billion. Apparel (including shoes and handbags, too) was bigger yet, at $11 billion. Hard-copy books are now Amazon’s smallest category, apart from digital books ($3 billion).In other words: the table stakes for Amazon’s bookstores are low. But what it stands to gain is knowledge and lessons for additional brick-and-mortar efforts down the road.What booksellers have to fearThat’s not to say that smaller booksellers don’t have to worry about Amazon invading their space. On the Amazon store’s grand opening day, multiple shoppers inside told Yahoo Finance they were impressed with the presentation of the books—many noted the covers facing out and liked the change—and said they plan to return. (See the Yahoo Finance video at the top of this page, from the grand opening.)Jay DePaolo, owner of the wellness-focused specialty bookstore Choices in Manhattan, predicts, “The initial brick-and-mortar store will cause a great deal of excitement because it is Amazon and it is something new.” But he isn’t too worried in the long run, because he’s not convinced Amazon can change buyer behavior back to physical stores: “Once the initial hoopla is over, if people can get it online cheaper and faster, especially the youth, [Amazon] will phase this out and within three years they will close the stores. Look at what happened to Borders and Barnes & Noble.”Independent and specialty stores like DePaolo’s have proven an exception to the larger brick-and-mortar crisis, and there’s something Amazon’s store has in common with the bookstores that do remain today: they contain quite a lot of items that aren’t books. DePaolo says his store once sold 75% books and 25% gift items; it’s the opposite balance now. “I believe in today’s market if you’re not doing several things in your business, you won’t last,” he says. “Today you have to wear many hats.”Even if selling books is a secondary goal, if the store does well you can trust Amazon will open more of them. For now, it has two more planned in New York City this year.—Daniel Roberts is a writer at Yahoo Finance, covering technology and media.Read more:Why Amazon will have success selling workout clothesAmazon Prime Day is a raw deal for e-book buyersAmazon crushes earning expectations again on the strength of Web ServicesHow baseball’s tech arm got so big that Disney had to have a pieceNew novel envisions American economic collapse in near futureReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley Fool1 Big Reason Why Disney Stock Is Just Getting StartedMotley FoolSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCHere's What Hedge Funds Think About NIO Inc.

Two things had investors excited about the company: 7nm chips and the news that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) will be using AMD’s Epyc server chips in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing division.That AWS announcement represents a big win for AMD, and when it hit, AMD stock shot up by nearly 9% before settling down. But it’s the 7nm chips that may prove the bigger blow to rival — and industry leader — Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).AMD Announces AWS Will Adopt Epyc Server ChipsOn November 6, AMD announced a new partnership with Amazon Web Services. Starting immediately, AWS will be offering three of its most popular products on servers using AMD’s Epyc server chips. That’s obviously good news for Advanced Micro Devices (and AMD stock), but what’s in it for Amazon compared to using Intel hardware? InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAMD says “The powerful combination of cores, memory bandwidth and I/O on AMD EPYC processors create a highly differentiated solution that can offer lower TCO for our customers.”  7 Dividend Stocks To Consider for Growth  In other words, AMD is pushing the advantages its Epyc server processors (launched last year) have over Intel’s Xeon, and it just landed a very big win with AWS. Amazon is touting the advantages of Epyc as well. It announced that AWS customers who choose solutions powered by AMD Epyc silicon will be able to take advantage of a 10% price savings.AMD 7nm Chips ComingWhile the Amazon partnership was a big part of the AMD stock gain, the company made another announcement yesterday that is even more important in the long term. The company will start shipping its first products featuring 7nm chips by the end of 2018. The new Radeon Instinct MI60 GPU ships to data centers later this year.That will be followed in 2019 by consumer graphic cards using the technology, and PC processors built on AMD’s new Zen 2 architecture. Zen 2 processors will be manufactured using that 7nm process, and will include new hardware protection against Spectre attacks. The company says Zen 2 processors are currently in testing. Naturally, a 7nm version of Epyc (code-named Rome) is also on track.Why the fuss about 7nm chips? They offer double the transistor density of AMD’s current processors, so they offer big performance gains. As Ars Technica explains, this gives AMD the option of reducing the power requirement by 50% while keeping performance on par with current generation chips, or keeping power requirements at the same level while boosting overall processing performance by 25%.AMD’s move to 7nm is equivalent to Intel’s move to 10nm chips. The difference is that AMD is on track with its transition. Intel is struggling. First expected in 2016, Intel’s 10nm processors have been repeatedly delayed, rumored to be cancelled altogether, and now expected some time in 2019.With its move to 7nm chips, Advanced Micro Devices is on track to not only beat Intel to market with next generation CPUs, the AMD versions are expected to offer superior performance to their Intel equivalents.2019 Could be a Big Year for Advanced Micro DevicesAMD stock has doubled in 2018 — despite the drubbing it took after its last earnings report reflected the crash of the crypto-mining market.  10 Stocks to Buy for a Midterm Rally  The company is reportedly on track to take as much as 30% of the market for PC processors in Q4. Yesterday’s AWS announcement is a clear signal that AMD is making real gains in the enterprise server market as well. With its 7nm Zen 2 processors on track for 2019 — while Intel struggles with its 10nm transition — AMD is positioned to make further gains next year, and the days of Intel grabbing 80% or more of the world processor market could be well in the rear view mirror.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace  2 Toxic Pot Stocks You Should Avoid    10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy Ahead of Black Friday    7 Dividend Stocks To Consider for Growth    5 Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Consider   Compare Brokers The post AMD Stock Pops on New 7nm Chips, Amazon Web Services Partnership appeared first on InvestorPlace.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

AFTVnewsreports that the virus -- a malware worm variant -- is not specifically targeting Fire TV devices, but they're vulnerable because of their Android-based operating system.The worm, called ADB.Miner, installs itself as an app called "Test" under the package name "com.google.time.timer". Once it's infected a device, it eats up resources mining cryptocurrency -- devices will become slow, video playback will stop abruptly and a notification saying "Test" with the green Android robot icon will appear randomly on screen.If you've never played around with your Fire TV's developer options (which are off by default), you'll be safe from the virus. If, however, you've allowed ADB debugging or apps from unknown sources, your device is at risk -- switch both to off. If you suspect you've already been infected, though, there are a couple of things you can do.First up, the tried-and-tested factory reset. But if you can't bear the thought of resetting your device and starting over, AFTVnews recommends downloading the app Total Commander from the Amazon app store, and using it to uninstall the malware directly -- this isn't ideal though, because it's not clear what other changes the malware will have made to your device.Alternatively, you can install a modified version of the malware, which updates the virus to a version that turns off the miner -- again, not ideal, but it appears to have fixed the issue for people who weren't able to remove the malware entirely. This XDA post shows you how, but you should definitely only try this if you're sure you know what you're doing.AFTVnewsThis article originally appeared on Engadget.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBritish cyber expert pleads guilty to creating malwareAssociated PressMarcus Hutchins: British computer expert who helped shut down NHS cyberattack admits criminal charges in USThe Independent'MalwareTech' security researcher pleads guiltyEngadgetZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosTesla's board is about to get a lot smallerTechCrunchAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetApple may bring Siri Shortcuts and Screen Time to macOSEngadgetMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley Fool

The retailer’s everything-and-the-kitchen-sink annual subscription plan is about to get pricier. On May 11, Prime annual memberships will jump $20, from $99 a year to $119.The news follows a similar announcement back in January, which found the monthly version of the program increasing from $10.99 to $12.99 — a $24 increase. Of course, annual subscribers will still come out ahead — the monthly model works out to $156 a year. This is the first increase to annual pricing in nearly four years. Why the bump? Amazon’s wild content buying spree likely has something to do with it. Just this afternoon, it announced that it was extending its Thursday Night Football deal another two years. “Since we increased the annual price of Prime four years ago both the value of Prime and the cost to offer it have increased significantly,” Amazon said in a statement provided to TechCrunch. And certainly the program has grown a lot, from free a shipping program to including everything from Alexa special features to The Washington Post. The new prices apply starting May 11 for new subscribers. Existing subscribers will see an increase for renewals starting June 16.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosTesla's board is about to get a lot smallerTechCrunchAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetQualcomm's joint venture with Chinese province to shut down: The InformationReuters

It can be tough for a shopper to keep them all straight, but some of these sales give you more time to shop and the chance to avoid the bargain-thirsty crowds on Black Friday itself.A woman carries a shopping bag with the words Black Friday printed on it.MoreBlack Friday represents a shopping season, not just a single day. Image source: Getty Images.Wal-MartWhile Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) has special events and sales all through the holiday season, it does plan to have a more traditional Black Friday event -- that is, if Black Friday deals beginning online at 12:01 a.m. on Thanksgiving can be considered "traditional." Wal-Mart's in-store Black Friday sale, meanwhile, will start at 6 p.m. on Turkey Day (though many stores will be open all day on the holiday). AmazonPart of the reason the shopping holiday has become more than one day is that Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) never closes. It has also intentionally spread out the season by offering deals beginning on Nov. 1.The online retailer has already opened its Black Friday store, with plans to release new deals each day through Christmas. It has some ongoing sales and some short-term offers each day, and it will have some actual Black Friday specials as well.Best BuyThe big-box electronics retailer has already released some, but not all, of its Black Friday deals. Best Buy (NYSE: BBY) is sort of hedging its bets this holiday season: It kicked things off early, but it also plans to open stores at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving for deal-hunters. That's also the day when its special Black Friday deals will go live on its website.SearsSears (NASDAQ: SHLD) can't afford to wait until Black Friday. The struggling retailer has already launched its Black Friday deals with the hope it can bring in some desperately needed cash. The company, which also owns Kmart, is calling its promotion the "Holiday Blowout." It began Nov. 1 and runs until Nov. 25, the day after Black Friday.During the sale, the chain will offer discounts of up to 50% off at Sears and 20% to 40% off at Kmart. Most of the company's locations will be open on Thanksgiving, with Kmart stores opening at 6 a.m. and Sears stores following at 6 p.m. Stores will close as late as 2 a.m. and reopen as early as 5 a.m. on Black Friday -- you'll need to check with your local locations for details.TargetLike Best Buy, Target (NYSE: TGT) plans to open on Thanksgiving (at 6 p.m. in this case) and then close its doors at midnight. That's a change from years past when the chain stayed open straight through from Thursday until late Friday night. This year, the chain will reopen at 6 a.m. on Black Friday.The company also has some early deals on its website, and it has offered an added incentive for shoppers: Anyone who spends $50 in stores or on Target.com on Black Friday itself gets a coupon for 20% off that can be redeemed between Nov. 28 and Dec. 10.Kohl'sAnother retailer that's blurring the lines of the holiday season, Kohl's (NYSE: KSS) plans to kick off its Black Friday sales online on Monday, Nov. 20. The chain will also be opening on Thanksgiving at 5 p.m. In addition, the chain is offering $15 in Kohl's Cash (essentially free money to spend on a future visit) for every $50 a customer spends from Nov. 20 through Nov. 25.Story continuesMacy'sAnother struggling brick-and-mortar chain, Macy's (NYSE: M) will offer Black Friday deals online all day on Thanksgiving. It will then open its stores on Thursday at 5 p.m. and keep them open until 2 a.m. that night. They will then reopen at 6 a.m. on Black Friday. The chain also plans to have some special deals from 6 a.m. through 1 p.m. on Black Friday itself and from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Saturday, Nov. 25.

"I am part of what you would call a hunter/recruiter team which actively searches for sellers we believe can do well on the platform," said one.eBay claims that many of the messages followed a similar pattern, or in some cases were "literally identical." eBay cites this as evidence that Amazon HQ coordinated the scheme.One such message, carried in the suit, reads:"To whom it may concern, Good afternoon. My name is Adam I work in the shoes category at Amazon. Came across your store and really like the selection that you offer and your fantastic feedback. Have you ever considered selling on Amazon as well? If so, I'd like to chat with you about the platform. Hope to hear back from you. Best regards, Adam."eBay claims that Amazon representatives were aware they were breaking eBay's rules by soliciting business over its messaging service. It provides examples of what it calls "creative ways" sellers tried to get around the ban on sending contact details over the messenger.Creative ways to poach sellersOne representative wrote their phone number with spaces between the numbers, adding: "The funky typing isbecause eBay doesn’t allow for info like this to normally be put into messages."In another message, the operative broke up the number by inserting the words "phone" and "number," and explaining "(read between the words) since eBay doesn't allow phone numbers in these messages."Another rep explained the need for such methods to the seller they were contacting. "eBay does scan for key termsand they don’t exactly like us poking around," they said.eBay said that the scheme was systemic, and in some cases effective. "Amazon's efforts have borne fruit. Its representatives have discussed the success of their scheme with eBay seller prospects," the suit claims.Amazon declined to comment. Elsewhere, it referred The Wall Street Journal to a previous statement in which it said it was carrying out a thorough investigation into the allegations.NOW WATCH: How Sony created the perfect video game controllerSee Also:eBay is going to war with Amazon over an alleged scheme to steal business that is 'startling in breadth'Here's how Google's new $150 Home Hub compares to the Amazon Echo ShowThe security community increasingly thinks a bombshell Bloomberg report on Chinese chip hacking could be bogusReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceState defends South Dakota pipeline protest legislationAssociated PressWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceIn Ukrainian candidate's hometown, a cry for changeAssociated Press'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNButina Shouldn't Serve Any More Time in Prison, Her Lawyers SayBloombergAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphTesla's board is about to get a lot smallerTechCrunchWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin Rivet57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool

The critically-acclaimed political conspiracy series set in a colonized solar system of the future has been heralded as one of the network's best but it couldn't find high ratings on Syfy, leaving Alcon Entertainment to begin shopping the show around to different networks earlier this month to find a home for the fourth season.Amazon will certainly bring a wider audience to the show, and with Amazon still trailing Netflix in terms of original content, bringing over a big fanbase is beneficial to the company's video streaming platform as well.

The company’s study, which includes data from 500 Amazon customers, estimates that Amazon Prime subscribers spend $1,300 per year, nearly doubling the $700 per year the average non-member spends on the e-commerce site.According to CIRP, 63% of Amazon’s  AMZN  customers are Prime members, and in the past 12 months, the total subscriber base has grown by 38%.Amazon Prime is a $99-per-year service that gives the company’s customers free two-day shipping and discounted rates on overnight delivery. Prime customers also get access to Amazon’s streaming video library, free e-books, and more.Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletterFor Amazon, the value is clear. At 90 million subscribers each paying $99 per year, the company generates nearly $9 billion in revenue before those customers even buy a single product. And since they spend an average of $600 more per year than their non-member counterparts, they also appear to be loyal customers that help Amazon’s bottom line.Best of all for Amazon, there’s no indication that many of its members will leave anytime soon. In fact, CIRP found that 95% of current Prime subscribers say they’ll either “definitely” or “probably” renew. That’s up from 94% of Prime members during the same period last year.CIRP conducted its study between July and September. All of its subjects were Amazon customers who made a purchase during that period.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaThe Morning After: The Weather Channel got hackedEngadgetTrailers of the Week: 'Child's Play,' 'Hobbs and Shaw,' 'Big Little Lies 2'Rolling StoneWhere to Stream Movies FreeConsumer ReportsAmazon Music's free ad-supported tier is now available for all Alexa usersBGR NewsZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceNatural Gas Price Prediction – Prices Tumble as Supplies IncreaseFX EmpireWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolCrude Oil Weekly Price Forecast – Crude oil running into resistanceFX Empire'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceDid The Underlying Business Drive REGENXBIO's (NASDAQ:RGNX) Lovely 384% Share Price Gain?Simply Wall St.What are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin Rivet5 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy in 2019Motley Fool

On Monday, hundreds of companies, including others like Microsoft, eBay, and Uber, — alongside a group of mayors and colleges — joined together as part of the "We Are Still In" campaign to reiterate their commitment to the principles of the climate agreement. "In the absence of leadership from Washington, states, cities, colleges and universities and businesses representing a sizeable percentage of the U.S. economy will pursue ambitious climate goals, working together to take forceful action and to ensure that the U.S. remains a global leader in reducing emissions," the campaign said in its press release.The move comes days after President Donald Trump announced on June 1 that the United States is pulling out of the Paris climate agreement, which was signed by 195 nations in December 2015. The Paris agreement was intended to slow climate change by setting limits on carbon emissions and has been widely embraced by the business community. The tech industry in particular has supported the Paris Agreement, and many of the big tech companies are currently transitioning their giant, energy-guzzling data centers to using completely renewable energy.The "We Are Still In" campaign launched with an open letter to to the world, acknowledging that the businesses and communities that signed will continue to work towards climate change. "It is imperative that the world know that in the U.S., the actors that will provide the leadership necessary to meet our Paris commitment are found in city halls, state capitals, colleges and universities, investors and businesses," the campaign wrote. "Together, we will remain actively engaged with the international community as part of the global effort to hold warming to well below 2°C and to accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy that will benefit our security, prosperity, and health."Here's a full list of all the companies that signed: 2 Point Perspective: Architecture2050 Partners, Inc.22 Designs23andMe3rd Rock Data, Inc.475 High Performance Building Supply7th Generation LabsAdidasAdmix, Inc.AdobeAdrian Dominican Sisters, Portfolio Advisory BoardAdventiveAdventureCORPS, Inc.Aegis Renewable EnergyAggie Writing ServicesAlameda Natural GroceryAleva StoresAllianz SEAlnical LLCAlphaGlider LLCAlpine Enterprises Inc.Alter EcoAlter Eco FoodsAmalgamated BankAmavida Coffee and Trading CompanyAmazonAmbata Capital, LLCAmbataliaAmeresco, Inc.American Outdoor Products, Inc.American Reading CompanyAmicus Green Building Center, LLCAmper MusicAmy's KitchenAngstrom Science Inc.Annie's, Inc.AnthemWildAnthesis GroupAnthropocene InstituteAntonelli's Cheese LLCAphra CommunicationsAppalachian Ski Mtn.

CEO Tim Cook announced the device as the day’s “one last thing.”“We think we can do a lot,” Cook said, “to make the experience [of listening to music in your home] much better.”The speaker is 7 inches tall, covered in “acoustic” mesh, with a 4-inch woofer. Along the bottom: 6 microphones and a beam-forming tweeter. It runs $349, which is far more expensive than competing products.The Apple Homepod. Photo: AppleMoreLike Amazon’s (AMZN) $179 Echo, Apple’s HomePod is not just for music. It can tell you the weather, read you news and sports scores, and perform many other tasks, all beginning with the command, “Hey Siri.”Three years after Amazon launched the Echo and six months after Google (GOOG, GOOGL) launched its $109 Home, this is Apple’s first entry to the category. And like those products, the speaker is a gateway to other Apple products, and a showcase for Apple’s voice assistant, Siri. Amazon Echo is powered by Alexa, while Google Home is powered by Google Assistant. (Last month, Microsoft announced the Invoke, a smart speaker powered by its Cortana voice assistant, set to go on sale in the fall.) Of course, you could also count the Sonos, the Beats Pill, and the Jawbone Jambox as home speakers that will have to compete with Apple HomePod now.Google Home (L) vs. Amazon EchoMoreYou might wonder why it took Apple this long to launch a home speaker. Apple senior vice president Phil Schiller answered that very question. He reasoned that there are great speakers already out there, but they aren’t “smart,” and there are smart speakers, but they don’t always deliver great quality.In addition to its own new speaker, Apple revealed that its new iOS 11 can control all the speakers in your home from your iPhone, including any Airplay-compatible third-party speakers.Announcing the Siri speaker was just one of many Siri-related upgrades that came out of this year’s WWDC. Apple opened the event by showing off new “Siri faces” for the Apple Watch Series 2 that use the voice assistant to provide quick information on the go.Later in the event, Apple ran through upgrades to Siri, including an updated voice (female and male), ability to translate from other languages, and syncing Siri’s learning about you across all your devices.So, which smart home speaker should you buy—Amazon’s, Google’s, or Apple’s?

   A year later, Amazon's Kindle finds a nicheStory Highlights Amazon.com's electronic Kindle reader celebrates its first birthday  Device holds about 200 digital books and can reduce bookshelf clutter  Sales have been steady, but the device so far remains mostly a tech novelty  Oprah Winfrey has praised it, but J.K. Rowling vows no e-versions of "Harry Potter" Next Article in Technology »   By  Zach Pontz  CNN 



 


 

  (CNN) -- It has the curves of a Lamborghini, looks like something an astronaut might take into space and weighs only 10.3 ounces.  
Amazon's Kindle e-reader is wireless and can hold about 200 books, plus newspapers and magazines. 
 Amazon.com's electronic Kindle reader -- a device meant to remove the paper from the page and make reading both more convenient and eco-friendly -- is celebrating its first birthday. Released in November 2007, the Kindle has sold more than a quarter million units. Its texts account for 10 percent of Amazon's book sales despite the fact that 200,000 titles -- a tiny fraction of the books offered on the site -- are available in digital form.  While exact sales figures are hard to come by, recent estimates have put the Kindle's sales on par with other high-profile mobile devices in their first year. Amazon.com says that the Kindle is currently sold out due to heavy demand.   So what has spurred its success? After all, electronic books have been around, in small numbers, for about a decade. Even Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and CEO, has admitted that the book is "elegantly suited to its purpose. It's hard to improve on."   One thing that's helped the Kindle is marketing. Where other readers failed to connect with consumers, the Kindle has excelled. The media-savvy Bezos has hardly been publicity shy, gaining his electronic toy a level of exposure most CEOs couldn't begin to fathom. "You can't discount the prominence of having Amazon behind this," says Paul Reynolds, technology editor at Consumer Reports. "Jeff Bezos is respected for what he's done with Amazon, and if he feels this is a future product in media, people are willing to trust him."

 Second, the gadget has been heralded by Oprah Winfrey, whose influence in the publishing world is immense. It's also been embraced by some prominent writers, including Nobel laureate Toni Morrison and best-selling thriller author James Patterson. Third, with more and more consumers accustomed to reading text on their cell phones and BlackBerrys, the world finally may be ready for an electronic version of a book. "I checked it out on Amazon and thought it was an intriguing idea, a great way to have a lot of books that don't take up a lot of space," says Emily Branch of Florida, who was moved to buy a Kindle after seeing the hosts of "The View" chatting about it. "I figured if I didn't like it I could return it within 30 days," Branch says. "There wasn't a chance of that happening once I got it in my hands though."    One clutter-killing Kindle can hold about 200 books. And while other e-readers such as Sony's Reader must connect through a USB port to upload content, the Kindle is a wireless device, thanks to Whispernet, which is powered by Sprint's high-speed data network.  "I think the Whispernet is what sets the Kindle apart from all the other e-readers on the market," says Leslie Nicoll of Portland, Maine, who co-authored "The Amazon Kindle F.A.Q." book after her tech-loving teenage daughter urged her to get a Kindle. Like Branch, Nicoll says she likes the Kindle's low-impact effect on her bookshelves. "I don't have to worry about giving it to someone else, reselling it on Amazon or finding a place to store it in my house," she says. "For the enjoyment and convenience, it has given me in the past seven months, I consider that it has paid for itself already."  Readers can visit Amazon's online store and upload a new book right to their Kindle. Subscribers also can have electronic versions of The New York Times and other newspapers and magazines delivered automatically to their Kindles in time for reading with their morning cup of coffee.  "The large and tightly interacting collection of Kindle features, that go far beyond those of any other previous e-Book attempt, will cause the Kindle to be the first e-Book to succeed," wrote one reviewer on an Amazon discussion board. But not everything in Kindle world is roses and gumdrops. There's a difference between modest early success and making a centuries-old print format obsolete. The Kindle sells for $359, a steep price for the average reader in the current economic climate.  "I'm not going to pay $360 for that. I can get books for free," says Nikki Johnson, a college student in Atlanta, Georgia, speaking for traditionalists who are wary of giving up their bound paper volumes.  "There's nothing like reading a nice paperback," she says. "There's nothing like holding or carrying a book, having that tangible quality and it being more than just a piece of data." So in an unforgiving economy and in a stubbornly old-fashioned medium, will the Kindle ever expand from a tech novelty to a mainstream accessory? It might be too soon to tell.  Blockbuster writers such as J.K. Rowling, author of the "Harry Potter" series, have said they'll never allow their books to appear on the market in electronic form. Yet future, better versions of e-readers may seduce younger consumers who grew up on PSPs and iPhones. A next-generation model of the Kindle is due in 2009. Early reports indicate the new device will be thinner and will have fixed some current design bugs, such as poorly placed buttons that cause readers to turn pages accidentally. "I think it's certainly a ways away from hitting the mainstream ... because of the price and the experience a reader gets from long-form reading," says Reynolds of Consumer Reports. "Whether these ... are successful, stand-alone devices remains to be seen. From what I've seen and heard, I think the technology is here to stay."

   Amazon: 'Glitch' caused gay censorship errorStory Highlights Amazon: Move was caused by "embarrassing ham-fisted cataloguing error"  Titles from authors such as Gore Vidal, Annie Proulx lost best-seller ranking  Ranking is number that Amazon uses to show how well one title sells  Book titles removed from charts are gay and lesbian-themed Next Article in Technology »   By  Paul Armstrong CNN 



 


 

  LONDON, England (CNN) -- Online retailer Amazon has said a system error caused it to remove a number of gay and lesbian-themed books from its sales charts. 
American novelist Gore Vidal has long been known as a liberal intellectual. 
 On Sunday, a number of distinguished writers, including Gore Vidal, Annie Proulx and E.M. Forster, suddenly lost their best-seller ranking -- which is the number that Amazon uses to show how well one title sells compared with another. As a result, famous novels such as Proulx's "Brokeback Mountain" and Vidal's "The City and the Pillar" were unranked Tuesday morning. However, Playboy: The Complete Centerfolds" by Chronicle Books, which features pictures of over 600 naked women, remains ranked.  Amazon spokeswoman Patty Smith told CNN partner Web site CNET News that the "glitch" was being fixed, but declined to elaborate. "This is an embarrassing and ham-fisted cataloging error for a company that prides itself on offering complete selection," she wrote in an e-mail statement.  "It has been misreported that the issue was limited to Gay & Lesbian themed titles -- in fact, it impacted 57,310 books in a number of broad categories such as Health, Mind & Body, Reproductive & Sexual Medicine, and Erotica," the statement said.  "This problem impacted books not just in the United States but globally. It affected not just sales rank but also had the effect of removing the books from Amazon's main product search."  Craig Seymour, author of gay memoir "All I Could Bare," wrote in his blog, "craigspoplife," that his sales rank was dropped earlier this year, only to be restored after a month. Amazon said his book had been classified as an "adult product."

 "I brought this to the attention of my publisher, and they started looking into it," Seymour wrote. "I also did some snooping around and it turned out that the only books I could find without a "sales rank" had gay content like mine."   Thousands of users have voiced their concerns online, with many accusing the retail giant of blatant censorship. This prompted Amazon to deny the move was part of a strategy to make the chart more "family friendly." It said the changes were caused by a "glitch" in the system.  The ranking removal appeared to depend on how Amazon originally categorized each book.  According to the Guardian newspaper, a paperback edition of British broadcaster and actor Stephen Fry's autobiography "Moab Is My Washpot," which Amazon tags as "gay," is unranked, whereas the original hardback, filed under "memoir," is.   The issue quickly became a hot topic over the weekend among Twitter users. In conversations under the hash tag "#amazonfail," people tagged hundreds of titles affected by the apparent glitch. Others simply mocked the e-tailer. Share your views here "Looks like Amazon did a government style u-turn. Of course it was an error, yes," was the sardonic response from Jonnyp.

 WikiLeaks, Amazon and the new threat to internet speech By Rebecca MacKinnon, Special to CNN      STORY HIGHLIGHTSRebecca MacKinnon says many differ on whether media should publish WikiLeaks cablesWhat's troubling, she says, is that Sen. Joe Lieberman can get Amazon to dump it from serverShe asks: What are private sector's responsibilities to prevent erosion of free speech?Writer: Future of free speech on internet turns on companies' accountability to public interestEditor's note: Rebecca MacKinnon is a Bernard L. Schwartz Senior Fellow at the New America Foundation, co-founder of the international bloggers' network Global Voices Online and a founding member of the Global Network Initiative. Her book, "Consent of the Networked," will be published late next year by Basic Books.  (CNN) -- In the physical world, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is a wanted man. In the virtual world, his website is under attack and on the run. There isn't much question that the person who obtained the WikiLeaks cables from a classified U.S. government network broke U.S. law and should expect to face the consequences. The legal rights of a website that publishes material acquired from that person, however, are much more controversial. There are many prominent Americans -- and a great many ordinary Americans -- who have made their views clear over the past week that WikiLeaks' "cablegate" website should not be considered constitutionally protected speech.  Others, however, believe equally strongly that now that the material is out, news media and website owners have the right to publish the material. What is troubling and dangerous is that in the internet age, public discourse increasingly depends on digital spaces created, owned and operated by private companies. The result is that one politician has more power than ever to shut down controversial speech unilaterally with one phone call. After suffering aggressive cyber attacks last weekend, Assange removed his "cablegate" site from servers in Sweden and purchased a new home for it on Amazon's web hosting service. On Tuesday, Amazon talked on the phone with the office of Sen. Joe Lieberman, chairman of the Senate's committee on homeland security.

Shortly thereafter, Amazon booted WikiLeaks. The senator responded with a statement: "I wish that Amazon had taken this action earlier based on WikiLeaks' previous publication of classified material. The company's decision to cut off WikiLeaks now is the right decision and should set the standard for other companies WikiLeaks is using to distribute its illegally seized material." This is not the first time Lieberman has demanded that an American internet company take down controversial material. Last time, the outcome was different. In 2008, Lieberman wrote to Google CEO Eric Schmidt, demanding immediate removal of "content produced by Islamist terrorist organizations from YouTube."  While YouTube did remove a few videos that violated community guidelines against violence and hate speech, it refused to remove most of them. Google's lawyers determined that the material Lieberman wanted removed, while upsetting to many Americans, was clearly protected under the First Amendment. "While we respect and understand [Lieberman's] views, YouTube encourages free speech and defends everyone's right to express unpopular points of view," Schmidt wrote in his response.  He continued: "We believe YouTube is a richer and more relevant platform for users precisely because it hosts a diverse range of views, and rather than stifle debate, we allow our users to view all acceptable content and make up their own minds." The New York Times editorial page chimed in: "While it is fortunate that Mr. Lieberman does not have the power to tell YouTube that it must remove videos, it is profoundly disturbing that an influential senator would even consider telling a media company to shut down constitutionally protected speech." Amazon's dumping of WikiLeaks at one senator's request brings into stark relief one of the core problems Americans have grappled with since before our country even existed: Where is the right balance between security, on one hand, and civil liberties, on the other?   We have always disagreed passionately. Much of American politics and a large number of constitutional battles center on this question. One might even argue that our political and legal systems are designed to enable this argument to continue indefinitely as new technologies and challenges arise. But the WikiLeaks Amazon case also highlights a new problem for American democracy -- and ultimately for the future of freedom and democracy more globally. A substantial if not critical amount of our political discourse has moved into the digital realm. This realm is largely made up of virtual spaces that are created, owned and operated by the private sector. As far as the law is concerned, Amazon is off the hook. Speech within the kingdom of Amazonia -- run by its sovereign Jeff Bezos and his board of directors with help from the wise counsel and judgment of the company's executives -- is not protected in the same way that speech is constitutionally protected in America's public spaces.  The law gives Amazon the right to set its own rules. The company's terms of service clearly state that it "reserves the right to refuse service, terminate accounts, remove or edit content in its sole discretion." By clicking "agree," the customer has legally consented to "represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the content," and that said content "will not cause injury to any person or entity." Given that citizens are increasingly dependent on privately owned spaces for our politics and public discourse, however, the fight over how speech should be governed in a democracy is focused increasingly on questions of how private companies should or shouldn't control speech conducted on and across their networks and platforms. We are facing new questions on which Americans have no clear consensus, and which were not covered in civics class: How will decisions made by private internet and telecommunications companies about what content they will or won't allow affect the ability of citizens to carry out informed debate on important matters of public concern? What are the private sector's obligations and responsibilities to prevent the erosion of democracy? While Amazon was within its legal rights, the company has nonetheless sent a clear signal to its users: If you engage in controversial speech that some individual members of the U.S. government don't like -- even if there is a strong case to be made that your speech is constitutionally protected -- Amazon is going to dump you at the first sign of trouble. Let's hope that there will always be other companies willing to stand up for our rights as enshrined both in the U.S. Constitution and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights -- and by extension their right to do business with us.  The future of freedom in the internet age may well depend on whether we the people can succeed in holding companies that now act as arbiters of the public discourse accountable to the public interest. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rebecca MacKinnon.

   'Uncontacted tribe' sighted in AmazonStory Highlights The photos are published on the National Indian Foundation's Web site  Government: Men appear strong and healthy, live in communal shelters   "Uncontacted tribes" are thought to have had no contact with outsiders Next Article in World »   Read  VIDEO  PHOTOS    



 


 

  (CNN) -- Researchers have produced aerial photos of jungle dwellers who they say are among the few remaining peoples on Earth who have had no contact with the outside world. 



 Taken from a small airplane, the photos show men outside thatched communal huts, necks craned upward, pointing bows toward the air in a remote corner of the Amazonian rainforest. The National Indian Foundation, a government agency in Brazil, published the photos Thursday on its Web site. It tracks "uncontacted tribes" -- indigenous groups that are thought to have had no contact with outsiders -- and seeks to protect them from encroachment. More than 100 uncontacted tribes remain worldwide, and about half live in the remote reaches of the Amazonian rainforest in Peru or Brazil, near the recently photographed tribe, according to Survival International, a nonprofit group that advocates for the rights of indigenous people. "All are in grave danger of being forced off their land, killed or decimated by new diseases," the organization said Thursday. Illegal logging in Peru is threatening several uncontacted groups, pushing them over the border with Brazil and toward potential conflicts with about 500 uncontacted Indians living on the Brazilian side, Survival International said. Its director, Stephen Cory, said the new photographs highlight the need to protect uncontacted people from intrusion by the outside world. "These pictures are further evidence that uncontacted tribes really do exist," Cory said in a statement. "The world needs to wake up to this, and ensure that their territory is protected in accordance with international law. Otherwise, they will soon be made extinct." 




   The photos released Thursday show men who look strong and healthy, the Brazilian government said. They and their relatives apparently live in six communal shelters known as malocas, according to the government, which has tracked at least four uncontacted groups in the region for the past 20 years.  Watch a report on the tribe » The photos were taken during 20 hours of flights conducted between April 28 and May 2.

  'Life of Pi's' Yann Martel blogs from Amazon BasinStory Highlights Author Yann Martel blogs for CNN from the Amazonian basin in Peru  On a three-week trek with Cape Farewell to see impact of climate change  Trek involves 18 artists and scientists started June 23, ends July 10   First Cape Farewell land expedition after seven voyages to the High ArcticNext Article in World »   By  Yann Martel Author 



 


 

 Yann Martel, award-winning author of the "Life of Pi," has spent the last three weeks trekking in the Andes mountains in Peru. He's there with Cape Farewell, a British organization that aims to increase awareness of climate change by taking artists and musicians to see its impact first hand. Here he writes exclusively for CNN. PUERTO MALDONADO, Peru -- I am writing these words in Puerto Maldonado, a hot and bustling town in the south-east of Peru. 
The team of 18 artists and scientists prepare to camp overnight near the Humantay Glacier Lake. 
 The town is bustling because its economic prospects look good. It lies near fields of oil and gas, gold mining has been going on in the nearby rivers for years, tourism brings in its share of revenue and -- the final blessing -- the paving of the Inter-Oceanic Highway is nearly complete. This highway links Peru to South America's economic superpower, Brazil, and will make commerce with Puerto Maldonado easier and more appealing. So the future looks bright, right? Not quite. Why? Because Puerto Maldonado sits in the Amazonian basin. The town is surrounded by the greatest biodiversity this planet has to offer. The average hectare of North American forest contains five species of trees. The average hectare of forest in the Amazon boasts over two hundred. A single tree here may be home to over a hundred species of termites. Professor Yadvinder Malhi of Oxford University, an expert on ecology, told me that likely 80 percent of animal species in the Amazon rainforest are still unknown to science. Life here is so abundant it's claustrophobic and overwhelming.

Climate change report: 'Seasons have changed'


 But it's not indestructible. And that's why I'm here, with others from the Cape Farewell project. Cape Farewell is a British NGO that brings together artists and climate change scientists. The scientists come to work, the artists come to watch, learn and, eventually, each in his or her own way, to react. The aim is to broaden the dialogue about climate change so that it becomes a broader cultural issue, involving each of us in a whole-person way beyond the narrower strictures of politics or science.   Cape Farewell has organized a number of expeditions to the Arctic, that canary in the coalmine when it comes to climate change. Witness of these expeditions can be found on the organization's excellent Web site. This trip to Peru has been the first organized by Cape Farewell to look at the effects of climate change in the tropics. It's been a memorable trip. We started high and dry, at 14,000 feet to be exact, camping near some fast-disappearing Andean glaciers not far from Cusco, and we've been moving steadily downwards in the last three weeks to the low and the very wet.

 On our way, we trekked the Trocha Union, a cloud forest trail that was so rich and dense with vegetation that we regularly stooped through tunnels of it, roots falling around us like static rain. We also traveled by boat down the Madre de Dios river, one of the many tributaries of the mighty Amazon, visiting a number of field stations where scientists from various universities are studying the stupendous wealth of the Amazonian ecosystem. What have I learnt? It's too early yet to say for sure, but I'll venture this: We, all of us, must learn that fine balance between the prosperity of our own species and the well-being of the planet, we must, like hot and bustling Puerto Maldonado, manage our economic assets so that our affairs continue to be bustling without our environment becoming too hot.

 Hiker hopes to complete historic Amazon River trek on MondayBy the CNN Wire Staff   STORY HIGHLIGHTSEd Stafford set out to become the first person to walk all of the river's roughly 4,000 milesHe's hoping to raise international awareness about deforestationStafford started his hike in April 2008A forestry worker from Peru has accompanied him for most of the trip (CNN) -- After hiking along the Amazon River for more than two years, Ed Stafford is suddenly in a rush. The native Brit, who set out to become the first person to walk all of the river's roughly 4,000 miles more than two years ago, is hoping to finish his hike on Monday, in time to catch his scheduled flight home to Leicestershire from Brazil. Despite collapsing from exhaustion on a roadside Sunday morning, Stafford is confident he'll make the plane. "Feeling much better," he wrote in a blog post from northeastern Brazil on Sunday, after catching three hours of sleep. "...will walk all night from now to complete the remaining 85 kilometers." It's the kind of fortitude that Stafford has summoned time and again since setting out from the Amazon's River source in Peru in April 2008, seeking to raise international attention about rain-forest destruction and to help raise funds to combat it. Since then, Stafford and Gadiel "Cho" Sanchez Rivera -- a Peruvian forestry worker who joined him in July 2008 -- have encountered pit vipers, electric eels, anaconda, mosquitoes and scorpions, but very few doubts about whether they'd reach the Atlantic.

"After grabbing something to eat, and replying to emails I finally got my head down at 1:27 a.m.," Stafford wrote in a piece for CNN.com last week, after hiking for 15 straight hours. "We've never walked 55km in a day before so we are satisfied with what we've achieved, if a little stiff." Stafford, a former British army captain, and his hiking buddy have seen their share of setbacks. Stafford contracted cutaneous leishmaniasis, a skin disease, and had to have a botfly removed from his skull. Cho suffered a nasty machete cut. But their biggest challenges were far less dramatic. "Although everyone would like me to say that the hardest thing has been our encounters with (indigenous residents) pointing bows and arrows at our chest, for me that wasn't the hardest part," Stafford said last month, " ... the adrenalin kicks in and you deal with exciting, potentially dangerous moments like that easily." "It's been the mundane that had really challenged me," he said. "... The weight of the rucksack, the basic food, the constant mosquito bites, the constant thorns. The little things that in a two-day expedition wouldn't bother you have been the things that have actually been challenging." The greatest pleasures of the journey, Stafford said, have been the warmth of the Brazilian people, with village children frequently welcoming him and Cho to new towns and their parents offering home-cooked meals. Having never visited the Amazon before starting his expedition, Stafford now says that his quest to save the region won't end with his hike. "I'm committed now to this place for the rest of my life," he wrote on CNN.com this month, "and I intend to take 'Walking The Amazon' around the world and keep alive the stories of the people we've met along the way, the lives in the Amazon and the tale of the jungle." Though he says that deforestation means the Amazon "is changing faster than many of us can comprehend," Stafford has also found reasons to be hopeful about its survival while hiking. "Although (deforestation) is sill going on in the moment," he said, "there's a generation coming through Brazil that are very aware of environmental issue and really do care about the Amazon." As he closes in on the Amazon's mouth, Stafford has found time to nurse less lofty desires. He says the first thing he'll do after touching down in England is grab a pint of beer. And his Peruvian partner, he says, can't wait for a pint of fresh milk.
