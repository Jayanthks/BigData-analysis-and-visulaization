Despite Amazons Big Plans the Feds Are Grounding the Drone IndustryYahooSearchNo matching results for Tip Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsGive feedback on the new search experienceCancelSign inMailFinanceWatchlistsMy PortfolioScreenersMarketsIndustriesVideosNewsPersonal FinanceTechUS Markets closedSP Dow NasdaqRussell Crude OilGoldSilverEURUSDDespite Amazons Big Plans the Feds Are Grounding the Drone IndustryRick NewmanSenior ColumnistThe ExchangeDecember  ReblogShareTweetShareAn Amazon PrimeAir drone is shown in this publicity photo released to Reuters on December   REUTERSAmazoncomHandout via ReutersMoreIf you saw Skyfall  the latest James Bond installment  you likely marveled at the breathtaking opening scene in which  chases a bandit across the rooftops of Istanbul on a motorcycle Filming it all was a remotecontrolled helicopter resembling a weedwacker with an overhead projector attached  the latest in aerial filming technologyBut for now such unmanned aerialfilming contraptions are effectively banned in the United States  the birthplace of the motionpicture industry  along with virtually all other commercial uses of unmanned aircraft or drones Thats because the US government has stalled in its efforts to regulate and manage the use of drones a breakthrough technology fostered largely by the US military As a result nations including Europe and China are gaining an edge over the US in yet another industryOnline retailing giant Amazon AMZN drew fresh attention to the commercial potential of drones recently when CEO Jeff Bezos unveiled an unmanned octocopter that theoretically could deliver small packages to customers doorsteps  a service he dubbed PrimeAir Amazonwatchers considered the move something of a publicity stunt meant to burnish Amazons reputation for customer service and Bezos himself said it could be four or five years before such drones are actually flyingA behindthescenes glimpseBut a behindthescenes glimpse into the Federal Aviation Administrations efforts to regulate drones suggests Amazons octocopters may never take off Nothing theyre contemplating right now fits with that vision says a source familiar with the FAAs policy efforts I dont see it happeningThe fortunes of FlyingCam the aerial filming company that worked on Skyfall and worked on movies including the Harry Potter and Mission Impossible franchises illustrate the difficulty of fostering a commercial drone industry in the US FlyingCam which has offices in Los Angeles Brussels and Hong Kong began using small remotecontrolled aircraft outfitted with cameras in the s Such innovations earned company founder Emanuel Previnaire an Academy Award for technical achievement in  But in  FlyingCams US business was effectively grounded when the FAA notified the film industry that flying unmanned aerial systems UAS for commercial use was illegal until regulations were finalizedIn  the FAA had quietly clarified its position on what constitutes an aircraft as nonmilitary UAS were morphing from recreational playthings into genuine aircraft able to fly hundreds of miles reach elevations above  feet and carry a sizable payload This was a de facto ban on the commercial use of drones until the FAA came up with formal rules governing their use Since many companies were unaware of the change the FAA began to tell industry officials that the use of drones was not yet legal as it became aware they were using themVirtually overnight FlyingCam and other companies in the same business were grounded in the US Everything has been shut down until they regulate it says Haik Gazarian director of operations for FlyingCam The most tragic part is an industry that was shining in many ways has been reduced Were not able to do these sequences in the US We have to take the whole thing outsideStory continuesFlyingCam laid off more than  workers and other companies doing the same type of work have gone bust FlyingCam is picking up more overseas business meanwhile largely because regulators in countries such as England France and China have developed new rules that allow and even encourage the commercial use of drones FlyingCam recently shot aerial scenes for the forthcoming films Transformers Age of Extinction in Hong Kong and Smurfs II in Paris for instance And the production for a Sony PlayStation advertisement was recently moved from LA to Budapest so the director could include such aerial shotsDirectors are still free to commission manned helicopters for aerial filming but unmanned systems have several advantages Since they tend to be much smaller they can penetrate tight spaces and fly far lower than big choppers that would disrupt a set with rotor wash and noise Lower flying also allows drones to get moreintimate aerial shots with the background in sharper focusA safer droneDrones are probably safer than manned helicopters too which is an unhappy irony of the de facto ban They can take off fly and land completely within the boundaries of a movie set with no need for helipads or use of public airspace to transit to or from a shoot Most smaller drones run on batteries so theres no flammable fuel on board if theres a crash And movie sets tend to have strict safety rules including tight security governing who can enterTo be fair to the FAA the proliferation of UAS does represent a bona fide safety issue and even a potential new avenue for terrorists hoping to attack US targets The rapid transformation of UAS is comparable to other manifestations of the digital revolution GPS guidance systems have become cheap and ubiquitous while advanced avionics are common enough to incorporate into affordable offtheshelf UAS Without new rules virtually anybody could fly a drone wherever they wanted for any reason The FAA in fact believes there are still plenty of businesses using UAS beneath the radar as it were despite the banFollowing the  policy clarification the FAA said it would publish a draft regulation for small UAS  those weighing less than  pounds such as the FlyingCam machine  by late  That would spell out the rules and make it legal to use them for those who complied But FAA insiders say the draft was so restrictive  requiring small drones to have the same sort of airworthiness certification as large passengercarrying planes for instance and UAS operators to have licenses and other credentials similar to those of commercial pilots  that the FAA never finalized the regulationIn  Congress passed a law requiring the FAA to publish final regulations allowing certain commercial UAS use by Sept   The agency says it will release draft rules next year and it recently published its first annual road map laying out necessary steps Congress also ordered the FAA to selectively approve certain UAS for use by energy firms off the Alaska coast which the agency did this summer Both types of UAS the FAA certified had already been approved for military use an advantage FlyingCam and most other companies hoping to use UAS  including Amazon  doesnt have Lawenforcement organizations and other public agencies also receive permission from the FAA to fly UAS in the national airspace for surveillance and other purposesThe FAA has also drawn several important distinctions between different types of UAS Model remotecontrolled aircraft can be flown for recreational use pretty much without limits although guidance from the FAA dating to  recommends they remain below  feet stay clear of populated areas and fullscale aircraft and arent used for business purposes The FAA however is concerned some businesses will try to operate UAS by claiming theyre abiding by guidance aimed at modelersThe agency anticipates many commercial uses once the regulatory framework is in place including cargo delivery as Amazon contemplates private security communication news coverage disaster response and monitoring of power plants and other types of infrastructure as well as aerial photographyThere are a few other key distinctions the FAA must grapple with The easiest UAS to regulate will be those flying within the lineofsight of the operator on the ground as most model aircraft do Next are those flying beyond lineofsight but still controlled in real time by a human After that the FAA will have to figure out what to do about fully autonomous UAS that are programmed to fly a specific route on their own with the capability to identify and avoid problemsFlyingCams aircraft are lineofsight UAS that fly limited distances over the perimeter of a movie set or shooting locale Amazons would have to be more advanced since it would make no sense to launch an aircraft to deliver a package to a doorstep so close to the launch site That would raise challenges the FAA hasnt even begun to grapple with UAS could crash near schools malls or other populated areas collide with other aircraft including other UAS run into powerlines or even bump into housesTheres also the problem of link loss which occurs when an interference disrupts the flow of data needed for a UAS to fly properly essentially leaving the aircraft uncontrolled When that happens some UAS continue on the last heading they were directed to take while others spin in circles or return to their starting point  usually without any eyes or ears allowing them to detect obstacles on

Big Plans the Feds Are Grounding the Drone IndustryRick NewmanSenior ColumnistThe ExchangeDecember  ReblogShareTweetShareAn Amazon PrimeAir drone is shown in this publicity photo released to Reuters on December   REUTERSAmazoncomHandout via ReutersMoreIf you saw Skyfall  the latest James Bond installment  you likely marveled at the breathtaking opening scene in which  chases a bandit across the rooftops of Istanbul on a motorcycle Filming it all was a remotecontrolled helicopter resembling a weedwacker with an overhead projector attached  the latest in aerial filming technologyBut for now such unmanned aerialfilming contraptions are effectively banned in the United States  the birthplace of the motionpicture industry  along with virtually all other commercial uses of unmanned aircraft or drones Thats because the US government has stalled in its efforts to regulate and manage the use of drones a breakthrough technology fostered largely by the US military As a result nations including Europe and China are gaining an edge over the US in yet another industryOnline retailing giant Amazon AMZN drew fresh attention to the commercial potential of drones recently when CEO Jeff Bezos unveiled an unmanned octocopter that theoretically could deliver small packages to customers doorsteps  a service he dubbed PrimeAir Amazonwatchers considered the move something of a publicity stunt meant to burnish Amazons reputation for customer service and Bezos himself said it could be four or five years before such drones are actually flyingA behindthescenes glimpseBut a behindthescenes glimpse into the Federal Aviation Administrations efforts to regulate drones suggests Amazons octocopters may never take off Nothing theyre contemplating right now fits with that vision says a source familiar with the FAAs policy efforts I dont see it happeningThe fortunes of FlyingCam the aerial filming company that worked on Skyfall and worked on movies including the Harry Potter and Mission Impossible franchises illustrate the difficulty of fostering a commercial drone industry in the US FlyingCam which has offices in Los Angeles Brussels and Hong Kong began using small remotecontrolled aircraft outfitted with cameras in the s Such innovations earned company founder Emanuel Previnaire an Academy Award for technical achievement in  But in  FlyingCams US business was effectively grounded when the FAA notified the film industry that flying unmanned aerial systems UAS for commercial use was illegal until regulations were finalizedIn  the FAA had quietly clarified its position on what constitutes an aircraft as nonmilitary UAS were morphing from recreational playthings into genuine aircraft able to fly hundreds of miles reach elevations above  feet and carry a sizable payload This was a de facto ban on the commercial use of drones until the FAA came up with formal rules governing their use Since many companies were unaware of the change the FAA began to tell industry officials that the use of drones was not yet legal as it became aware they were using themVirtually overnight FlyingCam and other companies in the same business were grounded in the US Everything has been shut down until they regulate it says Haik Gazarian director of operations for FlyingCam The most tragic part is an industry that was shining in many ways has been reduced Were not able to do these sequences in the US We have to take the whole thing outsideStory continuesFlyingCam laid off more than  workers and other companies doing the same type of work have gone bust FlyingCam is picking up more overseas business meanwhile largely because regulators in countries such as England France and China have developed new rules that allow and even encourage the commercial use of drones FlyingCam recently shot aerial scenes for the forthcoming films Transformers Age of Extinction in Hong Kong and Smurfs II in Paris for instance And the production for a Sony PlayStation advertisement was recently moved from LA to Budapest so the director could include such aerial shotsDirectors are still free to commission manned helicopters for aerial filming but unmanned systems have several advantages Since they tend to be much smaller they can penetrate tight spaces and fly far lower than big choppers that would disrupt a set with rotor wash and noise Lower flying also allows drones to get moreintimate aerial shots with the background in sharper focusA safer droneDrones are probably safer than manned helicopters too which is an unhappy irony of the de facto ban They can take off fly and land completely within the boundaries of a movie set with no need for helipads or use of public airspace to transit to or from a shoot Most smaller drones run on batteries so theres no flammable fuel on board if theres a crash And movie sets tend to have strict safety rules including tight security governing who can enterTo be fair to the FAA the proliferation of UAS does represent a bona fide safety issue and even a potential new avenue for terrorists hoping to attack US targets The rapid transformation of UAS is comparable to other manifestations of the digital revolution GPS guidance systems have become cheap and ubiquitous while advanced avionics are common enough to incorporate into affordable offtheshelf UAS Without new rules virtually anybody could fly a drone wherever they wanted for any reason The FAA in fact believes there are still plenty of businesses using UAS beneath the radar as it were despite the banFollowing the  policy clarification the FAA said it would publish a draft regulation for small UAS  those weighing less than  pounds such as the FlyingCam machine  by late  That would spell out the rules and make it legal to use them for those who complied But FAA insiders say the draft was so restrictive  requiring small drones to have the same sort of airworthiness certification as large passengercarrying planes for instance and UAS operators to have licenses and other credentials similar to those of commercial pilots  that the FAA never finalized the regulationIn  Congress passed a law requiring the FAA to publish final regulations allowing certain commercial UAS use by Sept   The agency says it will release draft rules next year and it recently published its first annual road map laying out necessary steps Congress also ordered the FAA to selectively approve certain UAS for use by energy firms off the Alaska coast which the agency did this summer Both types of UAS the FAA certified had already been approved for military use an advantage FlyingCam and most other companies hoping to use UAS  including Amazon  doesnt have Lawenforcement organizations and other public agencies also receive permission from the FAA to fly UAS in the national airspace for surveillance and other purposesThe FAA has also drawn several important distinctions between different types of UAS Model remotecontrolled aircraft can be flown for recreational use pretty much without limits although guidance from the FAA dating to  recommends they remain below  feet stay clear of populated areas and fullscale aircraft and arent used for business purposes The FAA however is concerned some businesses will try to operate UAS by claiming theyre abiding by guidance aimed at modelersThe agency anticipates many commercial uses once the regulatory framework is in place including cargo delivery as Amazon contemplates private security communication news coverage disaster response and monitoring of power plants and other types of infrastructure as well as aerial photographyThere are a few other key distinctions the FAA must grapple with The easiest UAS to regulate will be those flying within the lineofsight of the operator on the ground as most model aircraft do Next are those flying beyond lineofsight but still controlled in real time by a human After that the FAA will have to figure out what to do about fully autonomous UAS that are programmed to fly a specific route on their own with the capability to identify and avoid problemsFlyingCams aircraft are lineofsight UAS that fly limited distances over the perimeter of a movie set or shooting locale Amazons would have to be more advanced since it would make no sense to launch an aircraft to deliver a package to a doorstep so close to the launch site That would raise challenges the FAA hasnt even begun to grapple with UAS could crash near schools malls or other populated areas collide with other aircraft including other UAS run into powerlines or even bump into housesTheres also the problem of link loss which occurs when an interference disrupts the flow of data needed for a UAS to fly properly essentially leaving the aircraft uncontrolled When that happens some UAS continue on the last heading they were directed to take while others spin in circles or return to their starting point  usually without any eyes or ears allowing them to detect obstacles on their own In August  a US Navy drone lost contact with its controllers while flying over southern Maryland and nearly penetrated restricted airspace near the US Capitol before the link was reestablished and the plane turned aroundGazarian and many other businesspeople have met with the FAA and pressed their case for the limited use of commercial UAS So far nothing We cant even handle

Bezos explained the growth narrative tied to Amazons ecommerce channels AWS future expansion into new areas through an iterative approach and efforts to make smart bets to remain innovative but also the willingness to lose money if in the event an experiment doesnt workThe founder of Amazon has managed to keep an innovative culture going while they continue to disrupt ecommerce Bezos anticipates that Amazon can continue to grow its ecommerce footprint in various markets outside the United States where there has been minimal market penetration of ecommerce in generalAmazon stock is hovering just under T and remains stuck in a tight range Earnings could catalyze the stock nearterm but what remains important is the visionary stature of the company when compared to various other technology peersWhile there have been a number of publicity failures tied to Amazons HQ search this past year Bezos made no mention of the HQ search in his annual letter but instead directed much of the focus on their ability to grow their ecommerce business AWS and the minimum wage increase to Jeff Bezos mentions in his shareholder letter the importance of rdparty sellers and how it has contributed to its total ecommerce revenue and volumes when compared to eBay Something strange and remarkable has happened over the last  years Take a look at these numbers Thirdparty sales have grown from  of the total to  To put it bluntly Thirdparty sellers are kicking our first party butt Badly And its a high bar too because our firstparty business has grown dramatically over that period from  billion in  to  billion this past year The compound annual growth rate for our firstparty business in that time period is  But in that same time thirdparty sales have grown from  billion to  billion  a compound annual growth rate of  To provide an external benchmark eBays gross merchandise sales in that period have grown at a compound rate of  from  billion to  billionNot to point daggers at anybody but Bezos basically stated that their thirdparty retail sales which is very similar to eBays listing marketplace grew at annual growth rate of  versus eBay at  and its representative of  of Amazons total retail sales These are the key metrics that define Amazons ecommerce growth narrative and its likely where Amazon will continue to invest resources so they can attract more thirdparty retail sales at the detriment of eBayIts likely that Amazons rdparty retail will continue to dominate in comparison to eBay where historically that wasnt always the case but has now become an established reality given Amazons rdparty retail represents  billion in sales on the platform versus eBay at  billion in total platform salesThe divergence in narrative between Amazon and eBay will continue as eBay as a standalone website property hasnt gone much further into enhancing features for eBay sellers What has helped Amazon at beating eBay Well Bezos explains in his letter We helped independent sellers compete against our firstparty business by investing in and offering them the very bestselling tools we could imagine and build There are many such tools including tools that help sellers manage inventory process payments track shipments create reports and sell across borders  and were inventing more every yearThis paints a somewhat gloomy narrative both by the numbers but also the internal efforts to supply core competencies tied to Amazons distribution and ecosystem that eBay cannot provide While its been a wellestablished fact that Amazon can continue to execute there was one more hint or clue in the annual shareholder letter that points to Amazons futureBezos believe that further expansion into global retail will require a combination of ecommerce and brickandmortar initiatives Amazon today remains a small player in global retail We represent a low singledigit percentage of the retail market and there are much larger retailers in every country where we operate And thats largely because nearly  of retail remains offline in brick and mortar stores With Amazon Go we had a clear vision Get rid of the worst thing about physical retail checkout lines No one likes to wait in line Instead we imagined a store where you could walk in pick up what you wanted and leaveWhats interesting about Bezos is the fact that he believes that Amazon is small player in global retail What this points to though isnt the fact that he thinks Amazon can service every customers with onlineonly sales but how he transitions the idea to Amazon Go where he believes that a technologydriven approach to checkout lines and a seamless buyingselling experience could be globally disruptive and its where Amazon could continue to deploy resources where they only have  stores in the United States in Seattle Chicago and San FranciscoThe brickandmortar transition for Amazon has been slow and more iterative in nature But it could play into Amazons global ambitions of being a relevant retailer both online and offline which can also be integrated into its onlinebased business The execution on the AWS front has been strong but efforts by Bezos to outline expectations tied to retail shouldnt be ignored either because this is Amazons breadandbutter businessIf Amazon were to surprise shareholders with more efforts tied to retail it would doubledown on its incumbency advantage Based on the dialogue from Bezos within the shareholder letter its safe to presume that ongoing efforts to disrupt retail whether online or offline remains one of Amazons biggest priorities

can grow in an already saturated marketIts undeniable that Amazon Prime and Netflix dominate household media consumption and Primes added ecommerce bonus tempts families who are still holding outOne respondent noted They both have shows I would watch but I wouldnt pay for them separately I would also take advantage of Prime ShippingNetflix dominatesIn total respondents created  different combinations from the choices Perhaps unsurprisinglyNetflix dominated respondents picks with the streaming service appearing in the four most popular combinationsA Netflix and Spotify Premium bundle came in a distant second to Amazon PrimeNetflix with  of all respondents wanting that bundleWhen asked why they chose the two one person said Because I listen to Spotify all day long and I watch Netflix all night long Other comments included I already pay for Spotify it would be nice if I got some sort of discount when having Netflix as well I typically just subscribe when a show comes out I want to watch and I use both Netflix and Spotify daily and if I could get around paying  a month for both that would be amazing A Netflix and Hulu marriage was the third most popular bundle with  choosing the direct competitors as their ideal pairingComments included Hulu could do the TV part and Netflix could deal more with the movie side Netflix could offer their shows on Hulu I want to expand my movie and TV access as I only have internet and no cable What you cant see on one you can see on the other Its TV without a cable subscriptionOther comments echoed the fact that the two services actually complement each other Theyre in the same category but the content is different enough that we pay for both Plus Hulu comes with the option to add premium channels Im always flipping back and forth between shows on Hulu and Netflix one person commented Netflix and Hulu wLive would be all the TV I ever need another addedStory continuesHulu which is jointly owned by Time Warner st Century Fox Comcast and Disney has  million paying subscribers in the US across its videoondemand and new live TV servicesSeven percent of respondents chose a Netflix and Apple Music bundle most citing that they are current Netflix subscribers but are also part of the Apple ecosystem and would be interested if there was a discount Apple Music costs  per month or  for a family subscription which covers up to six peopleMoviePassFive percent of respondents chose Amazon Prime and SpotifyA Netflix and MoviePass deal came in sixth place with  choosing the movie lovers package  home entertainment and a night out at the movies the best of both worlds as one reader put it MoviePass and Amazon Prime was another popular combinationMoviePass dubbed the Netflix of cinema has been constantly rejiggering its business model slashing subscription fees to as low as  a month for unlimited movieviewing in select theaters D and IMAX are not includedThe latest option is  for four movies per monthWhat consumers wantWhile none of these combinations are necessarily down the pipeline Spotify has been an industry leader when it comes to partnering with services that share a similar target demographic Last fall Spotify and Hulu offered students a  monthly bundle to access Spotify Premium and Hulus entrylevel subscription The idea of being able to bring your favorite music together and an overthetop channel that allows you to see most of what you want to see anyway thats fantastic Its very smart said Susan Lyne president of BBG Ventures and a former executive at ABC Entertainment and Martha Stewart OmnimediaLast winter the New York Times partnered with Spotify offering its All Access digital subscribers a free membership to Spotify Premium That offer is no longer being offered to new customersOur offer with Spotify was always marketed as a special limitedtime offer  it was available for a full year Feb   Feb  Customers who subscribed to this option and have not canceled continue to receive Spotify Premium with their Times subscription a New York Times spokesperson told Yahoo FinanceEven if not at a discount one easy startup idea would be a service to actually streamline payments for all of these monthly subscription services As Morgan Housel partner at venture capital firm Collaborative Fund opined wouldnt it be nice to have a onestop shop to pay for all of these services Id like to manage all of my subscriptions in one product Pay once price a month for Netflix Spotify Prime Adobe newspapers etc One credit card charge one password Someone do

any of the classic rules of stockpicking But the ecommerce giant has a history of making up its own valuation rules so effectively that even the most traditional of investors can comfortably hitch onto this nameAmazons staying power is anchored in its diversity its reach and the mountain of consumer information it collects and leverages From grocery stores to bookstores to its own brand of consumer goods to its own apparel brand names  and more  a huge swath of the world does at least some business with Amazon on a regular basis Not everything it does is wildly or at all profitable But once someone is brought into the ecosystem Amazon presents all sorts of other alternative monetization pathsIts not a cheap business model Amazoncom was barely profitable for years and losses were never unusual or surprising The company never has been more profitable than it is right now and even so newcomers will be paying more than  times the companys trailing income and  times analysts estimates for next years profitsBut sales growth is unstoppable and AMZN stock has been a similarly unstoppable investment Its not immune to the occasional shortterm setback see now but its longerterm trend has mostly reflected the past decadeplus of uninterrupted quarterly sales growthSEE ALSO The  Best Investments You Can Make in American States Water CompanyGetty ImagesMarket value  billionDividend yield American States Water Company AWR  isnt exactly a highflying growth stock that inspires splashy headlines In fact its the diametrical opposite of that Its a utility name that boasts slow growth Its not even cheap at  times its trailing month earnings And its yield has been dialed down to a modest But just try to go one day without using any water The value of a reliable supply of potable water becomes crystal clearThere are cheaper companies with better growth rates even if that growth is uneven No other industry however can say they operate what is effectively a legal monopoly with literally no alternative Consumers can install solar panels as an alternative to relying on piping in power from a utility company Many consumers are dropping landlines altogether and making their mobile phone their one and only phone Short of drilling a well in their backyards though and hoping for the best consumers will buy water from their one local providerAmerican States Waters top and bottom lines are well positioned for longterm growth too Rate increases ultimately have to be approved by a localized utility board but requests from utility providers rarely are denied in the end even if most are initially foughtThe rate increase trend is particularly reliable for water supplies Circle of Blue an industry information resource reports eight consecutive years of nationwide water rate increasesSEE ALSO  Top Utility Stocks to Buy for Safety and DividendsAmgenGetty ImagesMarket value  billionDividend yield A biotech stock you can buy and forget ReallyYes but only because Amgen AMGN  is anything but your typical biotech company It has a great deal of builtin diversity that rounds out the wild revenue swings that singleproduct and other more focused biopharma stocks tend to dish out No single drug makes up more than onefourth of its revenue and only two drugs generate more than a tenth of its sales All told it makes and markets  different therapies addressing multiple marketsThose are just the drugs that are approved Amgen has eight Phase III trials underway seeking to expand its existing portfolio and another five Phase II trials Throw in the five biosimilar drugs in the works that dont have to follow the full developmental path the FDA requires of most new drugs and the company has plenty of revenue lined up for the foreseeable futureStill isnt biotech an inherently risky investment It certainly can be but given Amgens sheer size and  billion worth of liquidity Amgen is equipped to muscle out the competition and outright acquire some competitors it cant keep containedSEE ALSO The  Best Biotech Stocks for Investors Who Hate RiskAppleGetty ImagesMarket value  billionDividend yield Even for all its recent troubles Apple AAPL  really is one of the markets most proven names and it would be even if it wasnt a behemoth Jason Escamilla Chief Investment Officer with San Francisco based ImpactAdvisor says With Apple you a wellrun growth company with extraordinary profit margins at a reasonable valuationThose havent been the prevailing talking points of late The company recently announced it would stop reporting unit sales of its flagship iPhone Some analysts are interpreting the decision as a sign that Apple knows its finally starting to run out of new customers to sell the smartphone to Moreover Apple has gotten caught up in Americas trade war with ChinaThese headwinds are being offset by higher iPhone prices however and perhaps more important by major revenue growth from its Services arm Sales of apps and digital content shot  higher to a record  billion in the companys quarter ended Sept  Thats roughly  of Apples total sales and the organization has yet to reach its full stride on that frontApple always seems to find something to sell and it excels in most markets it chooses to addressTheres a certain philosophical advantage in owning Apple over other investment opportunities too Escamilla adds As a longterm investment it is further derisked when you consider the companys demonstrated preference for buying back shares over pursuing lowmargin and higherrisk growth Apple has repurchased nearly  billion of its own stock over the past four quartersSEE ALSO  Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying And  Hes SellingJohnson  JohnsonGetty ImagesMarket value  billionDividend yield Admittedly Johnson  Johnson JNJ  is tough to like right now Recent reporting suggests the company had known for years that its talcum powder contained the known carcinogen asbestos underscoring what many have suspected for quite some time now JNJ shares tumbled nearly  on the day Reuters made the allegation but if the development turns into a fullblown legal liability it could put even more pressure on JJ sharesYet as difficult as it may be one has to look at the bigger picture This is the same company thats been making baby shampoo for decades Its also the name behind BandAid brand bandages Tylenol Listerine and more  all consumer products that hold up against cyclical headwindsInvestors should also recognize JJ is waistdeep into the pharmaceutical business Last year it sold  billion worth of prescription drugs led by arthritis and colitis treatment Remicade It sold  billion worth of that prescription medicine followed closely by  billion worth of Stelara Even fewer investors recognize that Johnson  Johnson also operates a medical devices arm which added  billion to last years top line From laparoscopic surgery equipment to wound closure to glucose monitors Johnson  Johnson has solutionsIts a rare mix of diversity that keeps JNJ in good position to keep the top line growing regardless of the regulatory or economic environment Whatever litigation may arise from the asbestos allegation still wont change the fact that the company is welldiversifiedEDITORS NOTE This frame has been updated to include new information about Johnson  Johnsons talc scandalSEE ALSO  Health Care Stocks to Buy for Robust ReturnsJPMorgan ChaseGetty ImagesMarket value  billionDividend yield Being a value investor I like the financial sector and especially JPMorgan

breadth gives JPMorgan plenty of opportunity to growAnd it largely has While the bank finally struggled to fully shake off the echoes of s subprime meltdown and revenue continued to lose ground through  JPM finally found its form JPMorgan has broken records on the top and bottom lines in each of the past three quarters Smith expects more of the same too saying We expect interest rates to climb and as rates go up financials should profit more as the spread between what the banks generate on shortterm notes and what they pay out to the customer continues to widenJPMorgans appeal goes well beyond the foreseeable future While it has become a headturner of late its also on firmer footing than many of its peersSEE ALSO The  Best Bank ETFs for American BullsRealty IncomeGetty ImagesMarket value  billionDividend yield Real estate is no less cyclical than stocks though the ebb and flow of real estate values arent necessarily synchronized with the stock market So investors aiming for a little more stability might want to blend real estate investment trusts REITs into their portfoliosChris Kuiper equity analyst with CFRA Research thinks Realty Income O  is a top allweather way of adding real estate exposure to a portfolio The company owns develops and manages almost exclusively freestanding buildings that are leased to highquality tenants such as convenience stores dollar stores and drug stores  such as top customer Walgreens WBAEleven and FedEx FDX are a close second and third in terms of rent revenue making up a tenant base that Kuiper says is very insulated from the rise of ecommerce as well as recessionsThe company pays out a monthly dividend and has done so consecutively for the past  months at a  compound average annual dividend growth rate since it listed in  says Kuiper who also likes Realty Income for dividend investors The total stock return has delivered a  compound annual return far outpacing the SP SEE ALSO  Alternative Strategies for High Yield and StabilityUnileverGetty ImagesMarket value  billionDividend yield Unilever UN  does double duty for North American investors On the one hand it offers exposure to the reliable consumer staples sector via alwaysmarketable products like Lipton Tea Hellmans mayonnaise and Dove soap just to name a few On the other hand it brings some muchneeded international exposure to a portfolio Unilever is a dualheadquartered company based in the UK and Netherlands But more than that it serves consumers all over the worldIts a bit of a misnomer that consumer goods companies are recessionproof Recessions have become complicated matters marked not just with a slowdown in consumer spending power but also by inflation that can crimp margins of food and hygiene goods No company is truly recessionproofTo the extent a company can be recessionresistant however Unilever is It generated more sales and earned more profit in  than it did in  and though things slowed a bit it  the company was easily back on track come How Unilever had and has a firm grasp of what was working and what would work in terms of product mix and product development In  for instance the company tweaked its marketing message for its Bertolli frozen dinners appealing to consumers whod stopped eating out in the wake of a rough recession Its US counterpart Procter  Gamble PG conversely began to struggle in  and never really seemed to be able to recoverSEE ALSO  Consumer Stocks That Deliver Dividend Growth Like ClockworkUnitedHealth GroupGetty ImagesMarket value  billionDividend yield The future of the nations healthcare industry couldnt be less certain The discussion of a singlepayer solution is heating up Theres no argument that healthcare has become largely unaffordable even if the reason isnt clear Pharmaceutical companies hospitals insurers and caregivers all blame someone elseThis kind of uncertainty at first blush makes a middleman like UnitedHealth Group UNH  difficult to own Barring the outright  and unlikely  end to the forprofit healthcare and insurance industries however this very uncertainty is what makes UNH a goto souptonuts solutions providerCase in point Late last year as a means of contending with the increasingly expensive cost of reimbursing doctors UnitedHealth simply acquired a large doctors group adding it to a collection of smaller outfits its owns  a list that includes a pharmacy benefits business It also recently acquired Peoples Health a Medicare Advantage plan extending its breadth and depth Each of these deals makes the company more of a onestop solution that seems to be the shape of things to come jibing with CEO David Wichmanns comment from earlier in the year Were looking to add market presence and capability across our

any of the classic rules of stockpicking But the ecommerce giant has a history of making up its own valuation rules so effectively that even the most traditional of investors can comfortably hitch onto this nameAmazons staying power is anchored in its diversity its reach and the mountain of consumer information it collects and leverages From grocery stores to bookstores to its own brand of consumer goods to its own apparel brand names  and more  a huge swath of the world does at least some business with Amazon on a regular basis Not everything it does is wildly or at all profitable But once someone is brought into the ecosystem Amazon presents all sorts of other alternative monetization pathsIts not a cheap business model Amazoncom was barely profitable for years and losses were never unusual or surprising The company never has been more profitable than it is right now and even so newcomers will be paying more than  times the companys trailing income and  times analysts estimates for next years profitsBut sales growth is unstoppable and AMZN stock has been a similarly unstoppable investment Its not immune to the occasional shortterm setback see now but its longerterm trend has mostly reflected the past decadeplus of uninterrupted quarterly sales growthSEE ALSO The  Best Investments You Can Make in American States Water CompanyGetty ImagesMarket value  billionDividend yield American States Water Company AWR  isnt exactly a highflying growth stock that inspires splashy headlines In fact its the diametrical opposite of that Its a utility name that boasts slow growth Its not even cheap at  times its trailing month earnings And its yield has been dialed down to a modest But just try to go one day without using any water The value of a reliable supply of potable water becomes crystal clearThere are cheaper companies with better growth rates even if that growth is uneven No other industry however can say they operate what is effectively a legal monopoly with literally no alternative Consumers can install solar panels as an alternative to relying on piping in power from a utility company Many consumers are dropping landlines altogether and making their mobile phone their one and only phone Short of drilling a well in their backyards though and hoping for the best consumers will buy water from their one local providerAmerican States Waters top and bottom lines are well positioned for longterm growth too Rate increases ultimately have to be approved by a localized utility board but requests from utility providers rarely are denied

only because Amgen AMGN  is anything but your typical biotech company It has a great deal of builtin diversity that rounds out the wild revenue swings that singleproduct and other more focused biopharma stocks tend to dish out No single drug makes up more than onefourth of its revenue and only two drugs generate more than a tenth of its sales All told it makes and markets  different therapies addressing multiple marketsThose are just the drugs that are approved Amgen has eight Phase III trials underway seeking to expand its existing portfolio and another five Phase II trials Throw in the five biosimilar drugs in the works that dont have to follow the full developmental path the FDA requires of most new drugs and the company has plenty of revenue lined up for the

With Apple you a wellrun growth company with extraordinary profit margins at a reasonable valuationThose havent been the prevailing talking points of late The company recently announced it would stop reporting unit sales of its flagship iPhone Some analysts are interpreting the decision as a sign that Apple knows its finally starting to run out of new customers to sell the smartphone to Moreover Apple has gotten caught up in Americas trade war with ChinaThese headwinds are being offset by higher iPhone prices however and perhaps more important by major revenue growth from its Services arm Sales of apps and digital content shot  higher to a record  billion in the companys quarter ended Sept  Thats roughly  of Apples total sales and the organization has yet to reach its full stride on that frontApple always seems to find something to sell and it excels in most markets it chooses to addressTheres a certain philosophical advantage in owning Apple over other investment opportunities

Admittedly Johnson  Johnson JNJ  is tough to like right now Recent reporting suggests the company had known for years that its talcum powder contained the known carcinogen asbestos underscoring what many have suspected for quite some time now JNJ shares tumbled nearly  on the day Reuters made the allegation but if the development turns into a fullblown legal liability it could put even more pressure on JJ sharesYet as difficult as it may be one has to look at the bigger picture This is the same company thats been making baby shampoo for decades Its also the name behind BandAid brand

investors recognize that Johnson  Johnson also operates a medical devices arm which added  billion to last years top line From laparoscopic surgery equipment to wound closure to glucose monitors Johnson  Johnson has solutionsIts a rare mix of diversity that keeps JNJ in good position to keep the top line growing regardless of the regulatory or economic environment Whatever litigation may arise from the asbestos allegation still wont change the fact that the company is welldiversifiedEDITORS NOTE This frame has been updated to include new information about Johnson  Johnsons talc

for High Yield and StabilityUnileverGetty ImagesMarket value  billionDividend yield Unilever UN  does double duty for North American investors On the one hand it offers exposure to the reliable consumer staples sector via alwaysmarketable products like Lipton Tea Hellmans mayonnaise and Dove soap just to name a few On the other hand it brings some muchneeded international exposure to a

stockholders climbing from less than  per share shortly after its  IPO to nearly  per share as of this writing And even if you had bought shares of the ecommerce juggernaut a mere five years ago you still would have seen the value of your investment climb more than Of course the reasons for Amazons astronomical rise are clear in hindsight But are there any other stocks on the market today that could put Amazons returns to shameWe asked three top Motley Fool contributors to weigh in to that end Read on to learn why they like JDcom NASDAQ JD OrganiGram NASDAQOTH OGRMF and Denison Mines NYSEMKT DNNTwo line charts indicating stock market gainsMoreIMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGESConsider this Amazon of ChinaSteve SymingtonJDcom Chinese ecommerce leader JDcom the socalled Amazon of China is a  billion business as measured by market capitalization as of this writing But its dwarfed by the  billion juggernaut Amazon has becomeSo how can JDcom potentially rival the size  and most importantly the shareholder valuecreating ability  of its American counterpart While its biggest rivalAlibaba serves as more of an online marketplace like eBay JDcom delivers products purchased through its JD Mall platform directly to Chinese consumers And JD is forsaking bottomline profits in favor of investing heavily in its logistics warehousing and delivery infrastructure to build a sustainable Amazonesque advantage in the Middle KingdomBetter yet shares of JD have fallen nearly  from their week high set in January most recently pulling back amid economic tensions and trade war concerns between the US and China JDs longterm story remains firmly intact however and I think the stock could easily trounce Amazons returns for patient investors who buy nowThis budding smallcap has a real shot to outpace AmazonSean Williams OrganiGram Holdings Trying to top Amazon is a very difficult task considering just how much cash flow the king of ecommerce can generate But if any industry has a shot its marijuana The company that I believe could wow investors in the years to come is Atlanticbased grower OrganiGram HoldingsBack in July I had the pleasure of conducting an email interview with the CEO of OrganiGram Holdings Greg Engel And while I was already a fan of what the company was doing relative to its cannabis peers I felt even more positive about its future following some of his explanations and answersIn particular I dont believe theres a marijuana grower thats using its growing capacity more efficiently than OrganiGram The company has a threetiered growing system that it estimates will yield  kilograms of cannabisequivalent product despite only  square feet of growing space at its Moncton New Brunswick facility Meanwhile I can think of other grow sites that have in excess of  million square feet of growing capacity and are up to  kilograms lighter in expected annual yield than OrganiGramThat leads to the next point location The company has chosen to expand its capacity entirely at Moncton Though OrganiGram is sort of forgotten given its Atlanticbased roots  most growers are located in British Columbia and Ontario  its single site helps the company centralize and lower its costs That should give it a genuine shot at some of the lowest pergram grow costs in the entire industryStory continuesInvestors will also appreciate OrganiGrams focus on alternative cannabis products such as cannabis oil Though most folks are paying attention to dried cannabis production its highermargin oils which Engel expects will comprise half of all medical marijuana sales could be crucial in jumpstarting the companys operating marginsEven though OrganiGram wont be up to peak production until the second half of  I expect this company to turn heads and surprise a lot of peopleHigh risk high reward and little downsideReuben Gregg Brewer Denison Mines Compared with Amazon Denison Mines with its  million market cap is an afterthought of a company Its main asset the Wheeler River uranium project is a mine that isnt even built yet In fact its only just entering the prefeasibility stage meaning its still largely on the drawing board and awaiting more approvals But it could be a very big mine when its ready ranking in the top five globally And while uranium prices are low today thats a good thing for Denison and its investors since the stock can be bought for around  a share That limits the downside to literally  pennies And the upside could be huge Thats because todays oversupplied uranium market looks set to flip to being undersupplied in just a few years as the  nuclear power projects under development today get completed Supporting this outlook are production curtailments at some of the largest uranium miners in the world in an effort to balance current supply with current demand Camecoincluded  DNN ChartMoreDNN data by YChartsSo Denison could end up with a mine opening right when prices are heading higher The last time uranium prices were peaking meanwhile Denisons stock was up over  a share If the miners stock price follows that path again the upside here could be huge And with no debt on the balance sheet it seems well positioned to make it through the costly construction process For more aggressive investors Denison is a lowcost option on higher uranium pricesThe bottom lineIt might seem Amazon has set the bar impossibly high and nobody can know for sure whether these three stocks will go on to jump over it But between JDcoms Amazonesque position in China OrganiGrams efficiency and focus on alternative cannabis products and the potential for Denison Mines to benefit as uranium prices rise we think chances are high that they could do just that More From The Motley Fool    Best Stocks to Buy Today

fabulous returns for longterm shareholders Investors in the  initial public offering have scored a heartstopping  return so far  including a  gain in the last five years alone This juggernaut is not slowing downSo what would it take to outperform Amazon in todays stock market We took that question to a handful of your fellow investors here at The Motley Fool and they were quick to shoot back a few intriguing ideasRead on to see why they think Chinese etailer JDcom NASDAQ JD retail giant WalMart Stores NYSE WMT and fiberoptic components maker NeoPhotonics NYSE NPTN can do better than Amazon for new investors todayA young man tablet in hand celebrates good news with a fist pumpMoreThis could be you checking out your returns on these investments Image source Getty ImagesDont overlook this Chinese etailerLeo Sun JDcom Most investors see Alibaba NYSE BABA as the undisputed king of the Chinese ecommerce market However its biggest rival JDcom  which is often compared to Amazon  might have more room to runAlibabas Tmall controlled  of the Chinese ecommerce market in the second quarter of  according to Analysys International Enfodesk JDcom came in second with a  share But back in  Tmall controlled  of the market while JDcom controlled just JDcoms growth is attributed to two major tailwinds First JDcom gained ground as smaller BC business to consumer marketplaces flopped Second Chinese consumers retreated from dodgy CC consumer to consumer marketplaces like Alibabas Taobao and prioritized quality and authenticity over low prices JDcom capitalized on that shift and touted its reputation as a qualityoriented BC marketplace that cracks down on counterfeit goods while publicly chastising Alibabas qualitycontrol issuesThe company also partnered with WalMart Tencent flashsale site Vipshop and other companies in datasharing or orderstreamlining deals to widen its moat against Alibaba It also launched a drone delivery service for rural areas last yearJDcoms revenue rose  last year but it posted a net loss However it squeezed out profits over the past four quarters and analysts expect it to post its first annual profit this year as its revenues grow another  Therefore this stock still looks primed for some big gains over the next few yearsFuture returns are what matter to investorsChuck Saletta WalMart Amazons past investment returns have been impressive but what matters to investors is how well their shares will perform in the future On that front Amazons retail archrival WalMart looks like it might be a much stronger investment today than AmazonThe table below shows a handful of key measures for both companies WalMart wallops Amazon from the perspectives of revenue earnings and balancesheet strength yet Amazon has more than twice the market capitalization of WalMart That gap is likely not sustainable and thus WalMart may actually be positioned for stronger future returns than Amazon   Company   Market Cap   Trailing Revenue   Trailing Earnings   DebttoEquity Ratio       WalMart    billion    billion    billion        Amazon    billion    billion    billion      Data source Yahoo FinanceWhile Amazons tremendous growth rate justifies something of a premium valuation its hard to accept that every dollar of Amazons revenue should be worth six times WalMarts twice the market cap for onethird the revenue Thats especially true given that WalMarts profit margin rate and absolute dollars of profit are well ahead of Amazons Thus while bulls on Amazon point to its ability to reinvest cash into growing its business the reality is that WalMart is also willing to invest in fighting back to growthStory continuesIndeed WalMarts recent investments in its ecommerce platform and its buyonline pickupinstore program are generally acknowledged as key drivers of its recent growth As consumers get used to combining the convenience of online ordering with the speed of instore pickup at WalMart Amazon may find itself in the unusual spot of needing to invest merely to catch upTemporary trouble in big ChinaAnders Bylund NeoPhotonics If you want to reach for huge returns you have to accept a little risk NeoPhotonics makes optoelectronic components for use in highspeed optical networking equipment and its deep in the doldrums right now The future doesnt even have to be all that great in order to give NeoPhotonics investors a fantastic return on their investment  a simple return to normal market conditions would be plentyThe company was firing on all cylinders at the end of  Fourthquarter sales came in  above the yearago periods clients were clamoring for NeoPhotonics latest and fastest modules that could handle  gigabits of data per second and share prices reached multiyear highsThen an important part of NeoPhotonics distribution network in China filed for bankruptcy throwing a large spanner into the works On top of that sector peers have reported generally slow business in China and North America as telecoms and their equipment providers hammer out plans for the next wave of infrastructure upgradesSo revenues plunged  lower in the next quarterly report and the company has delivered a string of negative operating profits ever since Share prices came crashing down falling as much as  below those late highs before stabilizingToday NeoPhotonics has mended its Chinese infrastructure and introduced even faster networking modules Management expects to a quick return to predictable revenue growth including positive earnings by the middle of Theres a substantial helping of downside risk here NeoPhotonics burned  million of free cash in the third quarter of  The company raised  million of new longterm debt in that quarter and the cash balance is running low at just  million But if managements rosy forecast works out as expected that should be enough to see NeoPhotonics through these lean quarters to a fresh stretch of explosive growthThe optical networking industry will remain important and valuable for the long run notwithstanding the slowness of  Newer faster and better networks are coming soon and all of them will need fiberoptic components to connect everything to the internet at largeLets just hope that NeoPhotonics sticks around until the big bounce starts  or gets picked up by a more fortunate rival along the way Either way this unprofitable stock offers a

years of unfettered growth would have run out of room to pump up its top line But the company continues to choose new opportunities Amazon is willing to try its hand at almost any sort of business

of the meal kit biz Roughly threefourths of Blue Aprons and HelloFreshs customers stop buying them on a regular basis anyway within about six months The idea is creative but not necessarily one with longevityTo the extent there is a viable meal kit market though Amazoncom has an edge Two edges actually One of them is the fact that Amazon regularly serves more than  million customers enough of

read reviews regarding their previous work Angies List and Yelp offer similar information And while Yelp also serves up information about a variety of other consumerfacing businesses such as restaurants or retail stores theres no denying that Amazon Home Services is a viable alternative source of information on many frontsGiven that Amazon already connects consumers with restaurants near

when a customer needs something that cant be sold en masseBut take a closer look at the website that Amazoncom redirects you to when you click on the sizeable at the top of the Fabrics page Youre

Rebel Canyon or Peak Velocity labels youre actually wearing one of Amazons homegrown house brands The company got into the business for itself late last yearThe foray was a modest one  more of an experiment than something meant to make a splash It largely was meant to fill gaps left unfilled by the athletic apparel names that werent offering the entire breadth of their lineup at Amazoncom Most everything Amazon does though starts small and eventually gets big enough to become disruptiveIts a shot at names such as Lululemon Athletica LULU and Under Armour UAA which are wellrecognized brands but fiscally struggling companies Under Armour has been saddled by debt while Lululemon is finding that an increasingly competitive environment isnt driving profits any higher despite rising revenueNike NKE is vulnerable too but being the biggest and most respected name in the business it could just as easily benefit from the fact that Amazon has put other activewear manufacturers on the defensiveIt certainly wouldnt be a significant stretch to wreak some significant havoc in the semispecialized apparel arena Morgan Stanley noted earlier this year that Amazoncom already generates more US apparel revenue than any other retailer garnering  of the market for itself in  And last year online apparel sales grew  to make up more than  of the market while instore purchases fell  Amazon is

the same company having merged back in  as a means of defending itself from the slow disintegration of the office supply businessAmazoncom  and Amazon Business in particular  put that disintegration

would survive The Department of Justice didnt buy into the argument however it feared that whittling down the number of large brickandmortar office supply outfits would harm consumersLittle has changed since then Office Depot managed to top its secondquarter earnings estimates catapulting ODP shares higher but a closer look at the Q report reveals that not all of the tepid growth was even organic It was driven by acquisitions and new initiatives Perhaps worse the lackluster yearoveryear results appear to be the new normalStaples doesnt have to disclose its quarterly results but its difficult to see how it could be faring much better than ODP Neither can compete with Amazons prices and low prices are everything to business customersPandora SpotifyGetty ImagesWhen consumers mull their digital music options Amazon Prime generally isnt a name that comes to mind The race for onlineradio mindshare has largely been won by the likes of Spotify or Pandora P  or increasingly Apple AAPL which was recently cultivated its own subscriptionbased service to complement the a la carte nature of its iTunes storeHowever a wide swath of consumers are grooving to Amazons beat As of Q Amazon Music boasted  million regularmonthly users That pales in comparison to the Big Three of Apple Pandora and Spotify But considering how little effort Amazoncom puts into music that user base could ramp up quickly if Amazon turns up the heatAmazons exposure to the digital music market may actually be much bigger than it seems on the surface too Thats because you also could include the number of Amazon Prime subscribers that take advantage of the Prime Music offer available to Prime members Theres no firm figure on how many people listen to some sort of online audio via Amazon but the company said the number is in the tens of millionsOne small tweak in its music platform then could make Amazon alarmingly disruptiveSEE ALSO  Apple Products That Changed Everything And  That

Trader Joes and Sprouts Amazon isnt all that concerned about turning a profit in the grocery biz Indeed the company is almost annoyingly coy about how its grocery business is doing offering no

for Toys R UsAfter a poor showing for s busy holiday shopping season the privately held toy company finally decided to call it quits in March  It didnt even bother seeking a buyer that might be looking for a cheap way to scoop up a recognized name or garner some cheap retailing square footageNot every observer entirely blames Amazoncom for the demise of Toys R Us In many regards and like so

With Amazon Alexas Customizable SkillsAaron PressmanFortuneApril  ReblogShareTweetShare Cool Things You Can Do With Amazon Alexas Customizable SkillsMoreLess than a year after Amazon introduced its first Alexa smart connected speaker in  programmers were able to add their own voicecontrolled apps to the device The apps or skills in Amazons parlance could do everything from tell knockknock jokes to offer the latest price of BitcoinOn Thursday Amazon finally opened up the world of Alexa skills to ordinary customers albeit in a limited manner Now anyone with an Echo speaker or Spot clock can teach Alexa some new tricks using Amazons blueprints or prewritten types of apps that can have customized content supplied by customersno computer coding necessary Many are oriented towards kids Here are a few examples of how you can use the blueprints to create mostly useful skills for your Alexaenabled devicesGet Data Sheet Fortunes technology newsletter Help study with vocal flashcardsHave kids studying for a biology quiz Or maybe youre getting ready to take the bar exam The flashcards blueprint lets you create a list of questions and answers and hints if you want Then Alexa can offer the quiz either in review mode revealing both questions and answers or in test mode asking the questions and confirming whether the answers are correct Alexa even has encouraging messages to throw in like Great job studying hard Youre going to ace this test which can also be customized Leave important information for the babysitterYou can certainly go the oldfashioned route leaving a written list of important items and emergency contacts for the babysitter But why not impress your millennial childminder with an Alexaenabled babysitter helper app The babysitter blueprint has places to add items like a childs schedule allergies emergency contacts and answers to basic questions like where are the diapers Theres also a blueprint for the petsitter Cheer up family members with the compliments skillPretty straightforward Fill in the blueprint with a list of compliments Amazon offers a few canned phrases such as You light up the room but you can do better Then name the skill which will trigger Alexa to offer one of the compliments Not so into complimenting your little brother Theres a similar blueprint to write a burns skill Play a game of modern MadLibs with the story skillThe blueprints include a variety of genre stories like a fairy tale about a magical princess or the story of an alien invasion that require listeners to offer names and other bits such as a favorite dessert that Alexa incorporates But the entire text of the stories can be customized tweaked or wholesale rewritten Test party guests with a trivia quiz about the birthday boy or girlAnother one for the kids the blueprints include a quiz skill to work at a birthday party by asking trivia questions about the guest of honor In addition to reading the questions the skill lets the birthday celebrant

inventing and revolutionizing ecommerce and now he is the fifth wealthiest man aliveHis philosophy which helped him build the online retailer into a colossus with a current market cap of about  billion can be gleaned from his letters to shareholders since Amazon went public in This side of Berkshire Hathaway BRKA CEO and chairman Warren Buffett no American business leader stuffs his annual letters to shareholders more full of business wisdom than Jeff Bezos who is now  years old From Amazons first annual report as a public company in  to the letter he wrote in advance of the companys May  annual meeting this year hes set a consistent tone Build culture take risk and focus on the long termChamath Palihapitiya a venture capitalist and early Facebook employee said at the Sohn Investment conference that  Amazon is on its way to becoming a  trillion company  in a decadeIf true it would be in large measure due to the business philosophy of Bezos The Amazon Way as it has become known has attracted some controversy but it can be relevant to businesses of all sizesIn honor of his birthday today here are five lessons to take away from his success  Obsess over customers not competitorsBezos makes the point that tech companies especially obsess over competitors They wait and see what rivals introduce then try to match and oneup it By listening to customers instead Amazon built its Amazon Web Services AWS business which was designed to solve the problems with tooexpensive inhouse application hosting and opensource products that werent robust enough to easily

Bezos wrote in his very first annual letter  Failure and invention are inseparable twins To invent you have to experiment and if you know in advance that its going to work its not an experiment Moral Make bold rather than timid investment decisions Even if they dont work out youll learn something for the next time  Make employees think like ownersWhen Bezos wrote this in the first Amazon annual letter Bezos had  employees up from  a year earlier It has  now and plans to hire  fulltime employees over the next  monthsOne key component of the approach has been to use stock options in hiring We will continue to focus on hiring and retaining versatile and talented employees and continue to weight their compensation to stock options rather than cash Bezos wrote in the  letter We know our success will be largely affected by our ability to attract and retain a motivated employee base each of whom must think like and therefore must actually be an ownerMoral Whether its stock bonuses or profit sharing give workers a stake in the success of the company Build a culture thats right for your companyAmazons own culture is famously breakneckpaced and notoriously costconscious as befits a company that has run only a small profit or a loss under generally accepted accounting principles for most of its life as a public companyWe never claim that our approach is the right one  just that

company must be about The point is to decide what few things are most important repeat them often and make sure everyone buys in Story continues Empower people  up to a point  to avoid bureaucracy Bezos argues that there are two kinds of decisions Irreversible turning points he calls Type  decisions that top executives should be involved in and a larger number of tactical calls he calls Type

Dotwho winsDavid PogueTech CriticYahoo FinanceOctober  ReblogShareTweetShareEver since Amazon AMZN created the Amazon Echo the Siri for the home voice assistant every company and its brother has rushed to come up with one almost exactly like itTake for example the Amazon Echo Dot Like the fullsize Echo it responds to your commands and questions from across the roombut its a tiny sawedoff one that costs  The only difference is that because you dont have the big cylinder the sound quality is tinny It makes a fantastic second Echosay for the upstairsWell now heres Google GOOG GOOGL with its own version of the Dot called the Google Home Mini Also puckshaped also  Google will also be releasing the Google Home Max a beefier version with better soundThe newGoogle Home Mini right has clearly been inspired by the Amazon Echo Dot leftMoreThe Dot and the Mini are  identical They both work great Each has a Microphone Off switch so you can be sure that its not listening for its trigger word Both can now distinguish who is making the request so that it can respond to commands like Play my party playlist and Whats next on my calendar with the right persons music or info Both now let you make free speakerphone calls to actual phone numbers although the Googles call quality is awfulThere are however a few differences to noteIn this corner The Google Home MiniThe sound is much better Neither assistant pod will be mistaken for a concert hall But theres no question that Googles builtin speaker is richer than AmazonsIt talks to Chromecasts and Android TVs If you spring  for a Chromecast a little receiver stick that plugs into a modern TVs USB jack or if you have a TV that runs Android TV you can perform a nifty trick You can say Ok Google show me a video about how to remove contact lenses or Show me funny cat videos or Show me the trailer for the new Avengers movie and it appears on your TV instantly As you can see in the video above its quite magicalIt will someday have a taptotalk feature The top of the Mini is supposed to be touch sensitive As designed you could tap it to issue a command instead of saying OK Google or tap it to pause music But just as the Home Mini was shipping a reviewer discovered a bug in which that button thought that it was being pressed all the time transmitting everything anyone said in the room to Googles servers So Google responded by shutting off that top buttons features altogetherGoogle will presumably restore the tapthetop feature once they get their act togetherMoreAnd now in this corner The Amazon Echo DotWorks with more homeautomation products like internetcontrolled thermostats lights security cameras and so on Its a huge list Googles improving on this front but Amazons had a severalyear head startIt has an audio output jack Lots of people love plugging in their nice speakers or sound systems to an Echo Dot thanks to the standard miniplug on the side the Google offers nothing similar That makes it easy to control your music by voiceone of the most luxurious features everIts much easier and more reliable to adjustthe Echo Dots volume left by turning its ring instead of tappingthe sidesMoreYou can see feedback across the room The Dots LED ring glows in different colors and patterns to communicate different thingsfor example it glows when its transmitting sound back to Amazon You can see it from the side and therefore from across the room The Googles four LEDs are visible only when youre looking down on the device which isnt nearly as usefulYou can order stuff Of course this is exactly what Amazon hopes youll do but its still cool Alexaorder more paper towelsIf youre a Google Play subscriber maybe the convenience of speaking your desires for music tips the balance for you toward the Google Home Mini The argument about Buy a Google Home if you keep your calendar in Google Calendar doesnt really hold water since the Echo can consult or add events to the calendar systems of Google or Apple AAPLor Microsoft MSFTOtherwise though the Echo Dot is still the better microassistant Especially when its on sale for for example on the typical Black Friday which is in a couple of weeksThere will be a lot ofpeople unwrapping these little guys this holiday seasonMoreBoth of these devices are delicious enhancements to almost anyones home Over time youll find more and more ways that theyre usefuland for only  bucksCorrectionThe originally posted version ofthis story referred to the volume ring of the Echo DotThat was a feature ofthe firstgeneration Dot the current secondgeneration Dot has volume buttons on the top instead ofthe ringMore from David PogueThe Fitbit Ionic doesnt quite deserve the term smartwatchAugmented reality Pogue checks out  of the first

OilGoldSilverEURUSDReblogShareTweetShare Amazon shopping hacks to get your overspending under controlJeanie AhnSenior ProducerReporter Yahoo FinanceJune  Are you addicted to shopping on Amazon Heres one way to tell Go to your order history and count how many of the last  items you needed and how many you just wanted Or check your credit card statements When I did this I was shocked at how frequently Amazoncom showed up on my bill I couldnt even recall what I couldve possibly ordered and wondered if I was a victim of identity theft But it turns out I was only stealing from myselfIts not easy to resist the personalized convenience and instant gratification that this online retail giant has to offer In fact Amazon is responsible for more than half of all of s online sales growth according to a study by Slice Intelligence And with its recent announcement of its plan to acquire Whole Foods for  billion Amazon is set on taking over the grocery industryBefore your spending spirals out of control check out these  foolproof ways to conquer your Amazon addiction Begin by setting up what I like to call the check yourself before you wreck yourself payment plan Under your account settings turn off oneclick ordering everywhere and you wont have the ability to oneclick shop on any of your devices Delete all your payment methods Each time you go to pay youll have to put in your credit card information Annoying Yes it makes shopping a lot more deliberate and bit more timeconsuming If you can wait a few a days leave your items in your cart and revisit your decision to buy everything later I do this all the time and end up removing half the things I originally placed in my cart Set a spending limit by giving yourself an Amazon Allowance Its essentially a prepaid gift card that you can give to others or email to yourself  either on a onetime or recurring basis When you go to checkout itll show up as the only saved payment method Its also a great way to keep your kids spending under control on a daily weekly or monthly basis Buyers beware of the dangerous Dash buttons For those of you who dont know what it is its the oneclick shopping button on steroids placed all over your house Out of Gatorade Running low on Huggies diapers Hit the button and these wifi connected devices enable you to order more Sure its super convenient  and thats the point Its also a neat trick to make it alltooeasy for you to shop nonstop Not only does it keep you from looking at prices but youre not comparison shopping for better deals either Its a big nightmare for parents with young kids If your Dash buttons arent hidden you might get a surprise delivery of paper towels that your kids pushed for Another gimmick to avoid the lightning deals or what Amazon likes to call their Gold Box deals The original prices can be inflated on the day of these flash sales to make the discounts look more attractive To ensure youre getting the best deal dont check out until youve checked the price history on a thirdparty site like camelcamelcamelcomWhat are some of your Amazon savings hacks Share them with me Jeanie WATCH MORETil debt do us part  ways not to go broke as

significantly faster than brickandmortar storesOnline retailers brought in nearly half a trillion dollars in the US over the past year with about  of total sales according to data from the US Census Bureau And online sales are growing between  and  per year compared to about  for the overall retail industryGlobally the trend is even stronger Some  billion online shoppers spent  trillion in  By  sales could more than double from todays levelsIts no surprise then that some of the worlds largest internet companies are ecommerce companies Meanwhile many brickandmortar stores are moving aggressively into online retail to take advantage of the trend and protect their businessesIn this article well explore the seven largest ecommerce companies in the world many of which present interesting investment opportunities to take advantage of the megatrend in online shoppingA man holding a credit card while using a laptop computerMoreImage source Getty ImagesWhat is ecommerceEcommerce by its broadest definition is any transaction of goods and services done over the internet More colloquially it refers to buying an item or service online with an electronic payment method such as a credit or debit card or a digital wallet service The item could be physical a vinyl record digital an mp download or a service a music streaming subscriptionWhen talking about ecommerce companies theres a broad range of businesses involved in making online stores work Payment networks and digital wallet services ensure payment processing Shipping and logistics companies make sure packages are delivered And online stores connect buyers and sellersFor the purposes of this article were focusing primarily on online stores But those stores may operate in any one of the several flavors of ecommerceBusinesstoConsumer BC This is the kind of ecommerce that comes to mind when most people hear the word BC ecommerce is when a business sells a good or service to an individual consumer Some examples of BC ecommerce operations include Amazon NASDAQ AMZN Walmarts NYSE WMT online stores JDcom NASDAQ JD and Alibabas NYSE BABA TMallBusinesstoBusiness BB A business selling a good or service to another business This can be done in the form of wholesalers like those found on Alibabacom It could also be businesses that offer softwareasaservice to other businesses to help manage their companies Softwareasaservice is a term used to describe a software product offered to customers on a subscription basis and generally accessible through the internetConsumertoConsumer CC CC ecommerce businesses create a marketplace to connect buyers and multiple sellers online eBay NASDAQ EBAY originally got its start as an auction clearinghouse for consumers to sell their unwanted items to other consumers and its a prime example of CC ecommerce Amazon also offers a marketplace for consumers to sell unwanted items and Alibaba operates similar online marketplaces in China In the context of this article consumertoconsumer ecommerce companies are businesses that merely facilitate ecommerce through their platformConsumertoBusiness CB A consumertobusiness transaction is when a consumer sells an item to a business Instead of listing an item on a marketplace like eBay CB ecommerce companies buy items directly from consumers They might then turn around and sell them on an online marketplace An example would be companies that buy used smartphones including eBay and GazelleWhich ecommerce company is the biggestThere are several different ways one could measure the size of an ecommerce business How many customers does it have How much revenue do they generate How much is the company itself worthPerhaps the most universal way to compare online stores is with a metric called gross merchandise value or GMV Gross merchandise value is also sometimes referred to as gross merchandise volume or gross merchandise sales GMV is a measure of the total value of all items sold on an online store or marketplaceGMV is a lot different from revenue eBay operates as a marketplace and it doesnt sell items directly to consumers As such its revenue is a small percentage of its GMV Shopify NYSE SHOP makes it easy for other businesses to sell goods on their own websites so it also generates a small amount of revenue compared to GMV on its platformAmazon meanwhile splits its sales about  between its own retail operations and sales from thirdparty merchants on its marketplace As a result its revenue is a significantly higher share of its GMV Online stores that exclusively sell their own inventory think brand retailers will produce practically the same amount of revenue as GMVHeres a table of the worlds largest ecommerce companies sorted by GMV   Company   GMV TTM   Types of Ecommerce       Alibaba    billion   BB CC     Amazon    billion   BC CC     JDcom    billion   CC BC     eBay    billion   CC CB     Shopify    billion

launching Alibabacom and com Its flagship site operates as a global wholesale marketplace while com handles similar transactions within ChinaAlibabas core commerce business also consists ofTaobao Alibabas consumertoconsumer marketplace serving mainland China enabling small businesses and entrepreneurs to reach individual consumers Founded in  its now the worlds biggest ecommerce website It generated  billion in gross merchandise volume in Alibabas fiscal Tmall A spinoff from Taobao dedicated to businesstoconsumer ecommerce in China Its the secondlargest ecommerce website in the world after Taobao generating  billion in GMV during fiscal AliExpress Aimed at international shoppers enabling small businesses in China to sell to customers all over the world particularly the US Russia Brazil and Spain Alibaba doesnt report GMV on AliExpressEven just looking at Alibabas success with its Taobao brands Taobao and Tmall Alibaba is an absolute giant compared to the rest of the competitors Add in its wholesale marketplaces which are the goto source for finding manufacturers and suppliers in Asia to source whitelabel products and Alibabas share of all the commerce transacted on the internet is even bigger With a growing international presence anchored by AliExpress and other investments in retail Alibaba is by far the worlds largest ecommerce companyA truck with Amazons Prime logo on itMoreImage source AmazonAmazonAmazon is the largest online retailer in the United States Amazon started as an online bookstore but it quickly expanded to all sorts of different verticals including electronics fashion and home goodsPerhaps its most innovative and successful contribution to online retail is Amazon Prime Amazon Prime is a subscription service that provides shoppers with unlimited day shipping from Amazon The company has continually added new benefits such as video and music streaming exclusive access to certain items early access to deals free ebooks unlimited cloud storage for photos and more As a result Amazon now has over  million Prime members worldwideAmazon has also hit a homerun with its Fulfilled by Amazon service FBA allows thirdparty merchants to use Amazons warehouses fulfillment center network and logistics capabilities to fulfill orders Items sold through FBA are Primeeligible which is increasingly important to attracting customers on Amazon Fulfilled by Amazon allowed the online store to grow Primeeligible items from  million to  million over the last three yearsOverall Amazons GMV totaled about  billion over the last  months Consider that  billion of that is sold directly by Amazon with the other  billion coming from thirdparty sellers on its marketplace Amazon kept about  billion in fees for facilitating thirdparty sales Thats a much higher take rate than most marketplaces but Amazon has much higher costs associated with its thirdparty sellers using services such as FBAJDcomJDcom is very similar to Amazon but operating in China The company has built out an unparalleled logistics network with over  warehouses and  delivery stations Unlike Amazon though JDcom operates the entire logistics operation itself not handing off packages to third parties for lastmile delivery That enables JDcom to ship  of orders to customers by the next day Amazon is notably investing in its own delivery networkJD operates a firstparty retail segment just like Amazons but it also partners with international brands including Walmart to help them reach Chinese consumers JD operates more like an online mall in that way than a centralized retailer Walmart is notably a  stakeholder in JDcom after the American company sold its Chinese online store Yihaodian to JDcom in JD launched JD Plus in  its version of Amazon Prime Plus members enjoy free shipping up to  times per year free ebooks special discounts faster accrual of loyalty points and iQiyis premium service iQiyi is Chinas largest online video platform The company now claims over  million JD Plus members and members renew at an  rateJDs strong logistics network and growing list of domestic and international retail partners  and counting is helping it grow GMV rapidly GMV increased  in the second quarter of  outpacing Amazon by about  percentage points At that rate JDcom could overtake Amazon by eBayeBay started as an online auction house in the s for people to sell collectibles and used goods to one another Today  of items sold on the platform are new and  of items are sold at a fixed priceeBay is taking steps to make its platform look and operate more like Amazon Its encouraging sellers to offer free guaranteed day shipping Its combining product listings from sellers with the same item enabling consumers to find the best price more easily It also launched a Best Price Guarantee offering customers a  rebate on the difference between an item they bought on eBay and an identical listing on a competitors website eBay is operating more and more like a businesstoconsumer retailer instead of a marketplace for other businessesThe moves are starting to pay off GMV growth on a currencyneutral basis started accelerating in  growing  in the first half of the yearStill that growth is considerably slower than other companies on this list and slower than the overall growth of the ecommerce industryWhile eBay turns around its GMV growth its also working to increase its profit margin It moved to intermediate payments itself by starting to cut ties with former subsidiary PayPal The company will handle all of its payments inhouse by  which the company expects to provide significant value to sellers on the platform That could result in both higher profits and better GMV growtheBay offices in BerlinMoreImage source eBayShopifyShopify is very different than the other companies mentioned in this article Instead of operating its own centralized marketplace Shopify provides a platform for small merchants to sell items on their own websites and on other thirdparty marketplaces including Amazon and eBay At the core of its business Shopify provides an easy way to manage a retail business from one central location tracking sales and inventory helping fulfill orders and helping customers create their own websitesShopify charges a subscription fee to use its service offering several different tiers suitable for businesses of all sizes Its  merchants range from oneperson entrepreneurs with a single product all the way up to multibilliondollar brands with hundreds of productsHowever more and more of its revenue is coming from what it calls merchant solutions Shopify offers payment processing shipping services and cash advances to merchants In the second quarter of  merchant solutions accounted for  of total revenue for Shopify and the segment is growing faster than its subscription businessWhile these services have much lower profit margin than its subscription offerings they support subscriptions by locking merchants into Shopifys ecosystemMerchants are increasingly looking for an alternative to Amazon as the marketplace becomes more and more crowded Shopify is one of the top alternatives for businesses looking to establish a brand and take more control of their inventory and sales with their own websites The growth of merchant solutions outpacing subscription revenue is a sign that theres strong demand for an alternative to Amazon but entrepreneurs still want a bit of handholding Shopify is in one of the best positions to offer that serviceRakuten Rakuten is very similar to JDcom and Amazon The Japanese ecommerce company operates an online mall for big brands in Japan but it also owns several ecommerce operations in other countries including the US France Brazil and the UK which are more unbranded marketplaces like Tmall eBay or Walmarts marketplaceRakuten has put a major focus on its delivery network launching its One Delivery initiative last year Rakuten hopes to improve delivery speed at a lower cost by relying on its own network as well as third parties in a similar manner as Amazon in the US Amazon itself has made good progress in the Japanese market thanks to the growth of Prime and its shipping benefits Amazon is the largest online retailer in Japan according to some estimatesIn order to combat the growth of Amazon Rakuten is also investing outside of retail and logistics It operates Japans largest internet bank and its thirdlargest creditcard company It recently started building a wireless network to improve the profitability of its MVNO business It also owns a travel agency insurance company matchmaking service and golfreservation system among  or so other businesses Its also a major investor in Lyft and Pinterest and it owns  of Viber The goal is to create an ecosystem of services that can provide everything customers need in order to promote its brandRakutens profits have been hurt by its heavy investments recently and GMV growth isnt nearly as strong as others on this list Domestic GMV grew just  year over year in the second quarter of  Whats more the profitability of its core retail operations is declining as it invests in logistics and other efforts to stave off Amazon Operating income from domestic ecommerce is declining despite modest improvements in revenueRakutens global transaction volume which includes its international operations as well as creditcard payments digital transactions and other retail operations increased slightly faster at  Still Rakutens growth is relatively slowWalmartWalmart is the worlds largest brickandmortar retailer generating revenue of nearly half a trillion dollars per year But just a small portion of that revenue comes from online salesThe company has been investing heavily in ecommerce over the past few years It acquired Jetcom in  along with a string of small USbased ecommerce companies Its also rapidly expanding its online grocery operations following Amazons big push into groceries in  As a result Walmart has seen strong online sales growth over the past couple of years It generated  billion in sales in the US in  and it expects to hit  online sales growth this yearWalmarts most recent ecommerce investment is its acquisition of a  stake in Flipkart one of the leading ecommerce companies in India The move puts Walmart neckandneck with Amazon in India another market whereAmazon has grown to overtake native competition India holds massive growth potential for online shopping and Walmarts Flipkart stake gives it tremendous exposure to the market Walmart says Flipkarts GMV in  was about  billionNot all of Walmarts ecommerce investments have paid off In  the company made the decision to wind down its firstparty ecommerce operations in Brazil It also ended up selling an  stake in its brickandmortar business in the country as operations struggled during the Brazilian recessionWalmart has largely grown its ecommerce sales through acquisitions and the expansion of grocery pickup and delivery Its unclear how long the momentum can last as it finishes its grocery rollout and laps its acquisitions The Flipkart acquisition will provide significant growth in one of the fastestgrowing ecommerce markets in the world but it doesnt protect Walmarts brickandmortar operations from ceding sales to online competitors in the  other countries in which it operatesInvesting in ecommerceThese seven companies each offer various opportunities to invest in ecommerce Amazon offers global scale Alibaba and JDcom offer access to the rapidly growing Chinese market Shopify offers access to a growing number of small retail entrepreneurs Walmart offers exposure to India with its Flipkart acquisition but provides stability with its massive brickandmortar operations eBay and Rakuten are growing more slowly than the competition but eBay is finding ways to improve the profitability of its core business while Rakuten is investing in other areas outside of retail to drive profit growthFor investors interested in ecommerce these seven companies provide a great start More From The Motley Fool    Best

of the DayAfter nearly collapsing during the financial crisis in  American International Group was once of the most highprofile beneficiaries of US government intervention in the Troubled Asset Relief Program commonly referred to as TARPHaving decided that the failure of AIG with its large and diverse basket of assets and liabilities would cause catastrophic damage to the US financial system and economy the US became AIGs largest shareholder at one point owning  of the companys shares The program mandated significant changes to AIGs structure including a new corporategovernance structure and a reduction in exposure to risky derivative securitiesBy  the US Treasury and federal Reserve had not only recouped all of the  billion they had staked to the bailout but after selling all of its remaining shares actually posted a profit of nearly  billion on the transactionThanks to the austerity measures levied on the company while under government ownership AIG has never returned to the

continues Retail Stocks to Buy Ahead of Quarterly EarningsIs Walmart WMT Still Cheap Right NowShares of Walmart opened higher on Monday just a few trading days after the company reported solid firstquarter earnings results With that said Walmarts stock price had sunk over the last few months which means now might be a great time to consider buying the retail giant at a relatively cheap priceWalmarts overall revenues climbed roughly  from the yearago period to hit  billion in the first quarter with comp sales up  Meanwhile the companys adjusted earnings surged by  to reach  per share which also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of  per shareInvestors should also have been pleased to see that Walmarts US ecommerce sales popped by  despite increased competition from Amazon and other online sellers Now lets take a look at Walmarts price movement before we dive into why the companys current valuation looks rather enticingRecent Price MovementWalmart stock was up roughly  over the last year before Mondays gains However shares of Walmart had sunk  during the last  weeks and  over the last four weeks as investors reacted negatively to the companys slower fourthquarter ecommerce growth Furthermore shares of Walmart sat at their week high of  per share in late January Walmart stock opened Monday at  per share which means shares of Walmart are much cheaper than they were to start the year just based on price aloneStill investors need to know a little more before they can say that Walmart stock is currently offering a ton of valueValuationComing into Monday Walmart stock was trading at X forward months earnings estimates Walmart stock has traded as high as X over the past year with its median resting at X The company is also currently trading just slightly above its yearlong low of X which it rested at briefly in early July of last yearWalmart stock is also trading directly in line with the SP s average of X Furthermore the company compares favorably to the Retail  Supermarkets industrys current average forward PE ratio of  This industry includes the likes of Kroger other large US grocery chainsBased on the last year alone investors should be able to say with some conviction that Walmart stock is rather attractive at its current valuation and pretty cheap compared to where it has traded recentlyGrowth OutlookLastly it is worth considering Walmarts current growth prospects The company is projected to see its secondquarter earnings climb by  to touch  per share based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates For the fullyear Walmart is expected to hit  per share which would mark a nearly  surge from a year agoMeanwhile Walmarts revenues are only projected to pop by  in Q while fullyear revenues are projected to climb by  to reach  billion Investors might be a bit less pleased to see these topline projections but it is worth considering just how hard it is to post massive topline growth when the company is expected to pull in over  billionOur  fullyear growth estimate would mean Walmart expanded its top line by  billionLooking for Stocks with Skyrocketing UpsideZacks has just released a Special Report on the

Undermining Amazons InfluenceRohit ChhatwalInvestorPlaceSeptember  ReblogShareTweetShareAlibaba NYSEBABA and Amazon NASDAQAMZN are aggressively ramping up their operations in a number of international markets outside their respective home base This has led to an increased rivalry in these regions as both Alibaba stock and Amazon compete against each other in Southeast Asia and South AsiaIf Alibaba gains a significant market share in these regions it would provide the company with a much bigger growth runway than Amazon This will also increase the bullish sentiment toward the stockAlibaba and Amazon need to establish their presence in international markets to diversify their revenue base and have better growth potentialInvestorPlace  Stock Market News Stock Advice  Trading TipsOn the one hand Alibaba has tried to partner with startups who have already scaled up their operations On the other hand Amazon has mostly tried to build its business from the ground upThe jury is still out over which business model will be successful in the long term However Alibaba and the companies it has partnered with are already showing strong signs of a successful market penetrationMake or Break Moment for Both GiantsAlibaba and Amazon are investing huge piles of cash to ramp up their operations in South Asia and Southeast Asia Together these two regions are home to onethird of the total world population and have a nominal GDP of close to  trillion The average GDP growth in this part has been  in the past few years which has allowed rapid growth of the middle class There is also a significant increase in internet users due to cheaper smartphones and better networks   Super Safe Growth Stocks to Buy for LongLasting Dividends  Alibaba was a latecomer in investing in these regions compared to Amazon Amazon started its Indian operations in  It has committed to invest  billion to build up its operations Recently Amazon is reported to increase this investment by another  billion after Walmarts acquisition of Flipkart which is Amazons main rival Alibaba has mostly focused on Southeast Asia by getting majority control of Lazada and TokopediaIn India Alibaba has relied on local startups to scale up their operations and directly compete with Amazon and Walmart Alibaba has a significant stake in Paytm which is a leading digital wallet and financial services company in IndiaPaytm recently notched a big win when it was reported that Buffett has built a stake in the company for  million This values the company at a whopping  billion Alibaba has also invested close to half a billion dollars in the leading online grocer BigBasket One of the latest investment has been in Zomato which is a food delivery and restaurant search app Alibaba is planning to enter the ecommerce segment of India through Paytm Mall in which it has invested over  million along with SoftbankAlibaba has recently bought Pakistans main ecommerce company Daraz for an undisclosed sum It has purchased a  stake in Bangladeshs bKash which is the leading mobile financial services company This investment pattern across South Asia and Southeast Asia shows that Alibaba is relying heavily on local startups to build its presence in these regionsBesides ecommerce it is also looking to replicate the success of Ant Financial in payments ecosystem of these regions The banking presence in these regions is still relatively low which should help mobile payment services to expand their presenceThe level of investments will only increase in the near term as both Alibaba and Amazon try to increase their market share and expand their presence in ecommerce payments media logistics and other services If Alibaba or Amazon is able to gain a decisive market share across a broad spectrum of services in South Asia and Southeast Asia it will show the longterm potential of their business modelWhy Alibaba Has a Significant LeadAlthough Alibaba was a latecomer to these regions it has built up its presence by good investments and partnerships By focusing on local startups Alibaba has been able to prevent any regulatory obstacles and also leverage local talent Amazons strategy of building operations from scratch is not only more time consuming but could eventually cost more Even after five years of operations Amazon is yet to trounce the market leader Flipkart in India Now that Flipkart has been bought by Walmart it would be even more difficult for Amazon to increase its market shareStory continuesOn the other hand Alibabas investments in Paytm have paid off as the company is already in a dominant position in the payments ecosystem within India Alibaba is now using Paytm Mall as a springboard to enter ecommerce segment in India The investment in Big Basket has also been very successful as it now holds a significant share in online grocery businessBesides the success of individual investments Alibaba has a huge support due to Softbanks investment in South Asia and Southeast Asia In many segments the investments of Alibaba and Softbank are complementary The size of Softbanks investment portfolio is also important For example Softbank has invested close to  billion in Indian startups in the past few years This gives Alibaba an option to make an entry in various segments at a later stageFuture TrajectoryIf Alibaba gains a significant lead in South Asia and Southeast Asia over Amazon it will have an oversized impact on the stock of both the companies Both these regions have a lower GDP compared to Europe North America and China But they are growing at a faster rate and have a rapidly growing middle classAlso this is more of a neutral ground where the two giants have fought away from their home base Amazon will always have an upper hand in US and Alibaba will have an edge in China However it is also important to see how these two companies perform in regions where neither has a home team advantageBoth the giants are planting the seeds for a future expansion in Europe This would be another neutral ground The winner in South Asia and Southeast Asia should get a significant confidence boost to invest aggressively in Europe to replicate its successInvestor TakeawayEventually it will come down to the business model and execution Amazons bottomup approach of building its operations has taken a long time and can face regulatory hurdles due to lack of partnerships with local playersCurrently Amazon has a minor lead in India and Alibaba has a lead in Southeast AsiaIn another  months we should see one of these two giants cementing their position in South Asia and Southeast AsiaThere is a very high probability that Alibaba will come out on top which can also boost the bullish sentiment for its stock I have a strong buy rating for

watches TV series on Amazon but it bothers her when she needs to pay extra for certain programs not to mention Amazon delivery service isnt great in the rural area where she lives Amazon Primes price hike comes after blockbuster firstquarter earnings results which sent the stock AMZN soaring to record highs The increase will take effect for new users in May and apply to existing members in JuneFor the lucky subscribers whose membership expires in May they can still enjoy the old  price for one final yearWhile Wall Street sees the move as a positive the  increase has become a deal breaker for many current Prime members who are now rethinking renewalsAccording to a recent Yahoo Finance survey among almost  current Prime members  said they will discontinue their membership once the price goes up to  a year Twenty percent were unsure For those who are willing to pay more the vast majority cite fast and free delivery as the top reason for staying A recent poll from DealNews a comparison shopping website revealed similar results Almost half of Prime users surveyed said they wont pay the new price Respondents to the Yahoo Finance survey said they just dont shop enough on Amazon or they dont use perks like Prime video often enough to justify the higher upfront cost Some even said they would turn to other retailers like Walmart WMT to find competitive prices and services after dropping Prime Easier said than done of Amazon Prime users surveyed say they will discontinue the service when the price goes up Yahoo Finance SurveyMoreBut the actual membership dropout rate could be much lower than the initial survey results show according to Lindsay Sakraida director of content marketing at DealNews She said emotions and psychology come into play in peoples responses Amazons Prime membership price increase came one week after the ecommerce giant announced they have  million Prime members globally The companys first quarter  earnings also beat analysts expectations sending Amazon stock soaring to nearly  per share Some feel its greedy for Amazon to increase the price There is a perception that theyre doing very well and they dont need to do that to take advantage of people said SakraidaCrossing the  threshold also pushes people to reevaluate their expenses For some people they may adjust and opt for a monthly Prime membership which was also increased to  from

continued growth with Googles socalled bread and butter  ads via search  but also pointed out Amazon as a growing competitor to watch Story continuesIn more recent years Amazon AMZN has become more aggressive in building out its ads business which generated nearly  billion in ad revenues during the first quarter  up  yearoveryear That remains a small amount versus Googles own advertisinggenerated revenues which amounted to  billion during the companys own first quarter But Amazons ad business is currently growing at a faster clip fueled by aggressive sales efforts and the companys vast troves of retail data From a competitive standpoint all eyes should be on Amazon as its product search impacts the use case of Google search due to advances in Amazons ad business and as Alexa becomes a gateway to information but there is room for Google search revenue to continue to grow especially for intangible productsservices that do not lend themselves as readily to

PillPack in potentially disruptive drug retail pushReutersJune  ReblogShareTweetShareBy Ankur Banerjee and Bill BerkrotReuters  Amazoncom Inc said on Thursday it would buy small online pharmacy PillPack a move that will put the worlds biggest online retailer in direct competition with drugstore chains drug distributors and pharmacy benefit managersThe deals potential to disrupt major players across the drug supply chain nationwide prompted a selloff in shares of possible rivals while sending Amazon shares up  percentPillPack supplies presorted prescription drugs and other services to people who take multiple medications a growing market as the US population ages and requires treatment for multiple complex chronic conditionsAmazon is vying for a share of what is a more than  billion total US prescription drug market according to research firm IQVIA Although PillPack expects sales to exceed only about  million this year Amazons huge customer base and existing shipping infrastructure could allow the company to scale up quicklyAmazon could also negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies giving them the ability to offer cheap generic drugs even to customers without health insurance according to industry experts But it will face deeply entrenched competition dominated by pharmacies run by CVS Health Walgreen Boots Alliance and Walmart Inc and pharmacy benefits provided by CVS Express Scripts UnitedHealth GroupAmazons acquisition of PillPack is a warning shot in what is about to become a major battle within the pharmacy space said Neil Saunders managing director of GlobalData RetailThe value of the deal was not disclosed Bloomberg reported it to be  billion citing a person familiar with the matterPharmacy chains and drug wholesalers lost about  billion in market value on Thursday while Amazon gained about  billionShares of CVS closed down  percent while Walgreen fell  percent Shares of drug wholesalers McKesson Corp Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen all fellJOINT VENTUREThe news comes just a week after a joint venture of Amazon Berkshire Hathaway Inc and JPMorgan Chase  Co named a CEO who will be tasked with significantly cutting healthcare costs for its estimated  million employees and dependentsAlthough brickandmortar stores might feel the effects of Amazons competition the biggest battles will likely be fought by mailorder pharmacies which generally serve patients with chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease that may require drugs to control blood pressure cholesterol and other problemsPillPack said it has tens of thousands of customers across the country But its expectation of over  million in  revenue pales compared with larger rivals CVS last year had about  billion in revenue from its mail order pharmacy business accounting for about  percent of its pharmacy claimsPharmacy benefit managers PBMs negotiate prescription drug pricing for employers and health plans and run large mailorder pharmacies offering incentives to patients to fill prescriptions with themDoctors and PBMs have long said patients not properly taking their medicines is one of the main causes of increased healthcare costs leading to hospitalizations and more severe health issues Companies like PillPack and Express Scripts that offer care management services to improve patient compliance are seen as increasingly important in helping control rising costsWith Amazons announcement Mizuho analyst Ann Hynes in a note said pending health insurerPBM mergers of Aetna Inc with CVS and Cigna Corp with Express Scripts are even more critical nowNOT WORRIEDWalgreen CEO Stefano Pessina on a conference call after reporting quarterly results said he was not particularly worried about the PillPack dealThe pharmacy world is much more complex than just delivering certain pills or certain packages Pessina saidThat said Pessina added We know that we have to change the level of our services to the customers and we are working quite hard on that directionSome analysts played down the immediate threatI believe they bought this to learn about the market and to determine if they are able to make larger investments said Morningstar analyst Vishnu LekrajCantor Fitzgerald analyst Steven Halper noted that PBMs typically require health plan members to use their own mail order pharmaciesStory continuesHe said PillPack could be kicked out of current PBM networks especially if Amazon has designs of significantly ramping its prescription volumeExpress Scripts dropped PillPack from its network in April  alleging that it had misrepresented itself as a retail pharmacy The two reached an agreement a month laterPillPack holds pharmacy licenses in all  states It is an innetwork pharmacy for some PBMs and

aims to turn Alexa into a realtime universal language translatorJP MangalindanChief Tech CorrespondentYahoo FinanceMarch  ReblogShareTweetShareAmazon AMZN wants to make Alexa the popular voiceenabled assistant a contextsavvy realtime universal language translator Yahoo Finance has learnedAccording to several sources familiar with the matter the Alexa group at Amazon is seriously exploring ways to make Alexa more useful across different languages and cultures One way it plans to do that is by introducing the ability for Alexa to translate languages in a more sophisticated manner beyond the basic words and short phrases it can already translate in different languages including Spanish German French and Italian Amazon wants to turn Alexa into a multilingual assistant who can help in almost any situationAmazon did not comment immediatelyFor instance if a person from the US who only speaks English attends a wedding in Tokyo and doesnt speak Japanese Alexa would be able to help that person hold a conversationin Japanese Alexa would have an understanding of the Japanese culture which is generally more formal and conservative than American culture and would incorporate its knowledge into translations For example asking the virtual assistant Alexa what do I say to the father of the bride at a wedding in Japan would solicit a different response and tone from Alexa than if you asked the assistant What do I say to the master of ceremonies at a wedding in Japan The understanding being that remarks you make to the father of the bride would be more formal and reverential than to the weddings master of ceremonyIn another scenario Alexa could help a traveler entering a restaurant for the first time in India with the question Alexa I just entered a restaurant in New Delhi Who should I talk to and what do I say to get a table The crossculture crosslanguage piece is going to be big for Amazon and Alexa and it has a lot of potential one source familiar with the matter told Yahoo FinanceBig ambitions for AlexaSources also told Yahoo Finance that Amazon would like to get Alexa to a point where its translating languages for users through any device onthefly In other words Alexa could one day translate what the father of the bride at that wedding in Japan says into your native language as hes speaking in realtime Alexa would also one day be able to translate conversations with multiple people speaking in different languages at one setting Such a move makes sense for Alexa which Amazon has long said would evolve into a versatile Star Treklike super computer that accomplishes virtually anything you throw at it with a simple voice command It should be noted that one of the Star Trek super computers most compelling features across the numerous TV series included the ability to translate virtually any language in realtimeTo truly realize that vision youll want a number of things youll want to have it everywhere be able to talk to it from anywhere be able for it to do all of the things you would want an intelligent assistant do for you and ultimately do it in a very conversational way Amazon Vice President of Alexa Al Lindsay told Yahoo Finance during an onstage interview last NovemberAmazon is already well on its way to making that vision a reality Tens of millions of Alexaenabled devices have been sold since the first Echo speaker went on sale in  and according to eMarketer Amazon Echo will account for  of the voiceenabled speaker market in Race to translate languagesIf and when Amazon eventually rolls out such languagetranslation features Alexa will enter an area that companies like Google GOOG GOOGL and Samsung have tackled with mixed results In October Google initially made waves when it claimed its Google Pixel Buds with the help of Google Assistant could translate up to  languages spoken in realtime but the actual execution proved lacking Samsungs Bixby assistant fares somewhat better it uses augmented reality to translate text from more than  languages in realtime but it doesnt translate actual conversations yet Meanwhile other digital assistants like Apples AAPL Siri and Microsofts MSFT Cortana can currently translate words and phrases from English into less than a dozen other languages but the extent and success to which they do so remains limited Story continuesThe Alexa team is well aware of the stiff technical challenges in developing and releasing effective language translation features of its own based in part on the shortcomings of its direct competitors As such sources told Yahoo Finance Amazon wont roll them out unless and until theyre up to snuffWhen they likely do however Alexa will take its most impressive step yet towards realizing Amazons vision of creating a

Coders Can Now Use  Different Voices in Their SkillsJonathan VanianFortuneMay  ReblogShareTweetSharehas made it possible for coders to embed eight different computerized voices into their skills for the companys Alexa voiceactivated digital assistantThe online retail giant said Wednesday that developers can now apply to test the voices which were built to sound like US English speakers The point of having access to multiple Alexa voices is so developers can build skills apps in which users interact with a variety of voices instead of just oneFor instance if coders were to create interactive audio stories for Alexa they could use the new voices to represent different characters Amazon saidThe new Alexa voices are part of the companys Polly service which developers use to build skills apps for Alexa that can recognize text and convert it to a voice that can beam out of an Alexapowered device like the Amazon Echo smart speakerAmazon said that developers who are accepted to test the voices will be able to use them for free but that will likely change when the voices are available to the general public to be used outside of a previewIt should be noted that developers can already add multiple voices to their skills but its a more complex process that involves recording a voice as an audio fileAmazon currently has a number of different voices with different dialects and accents developers can currently bundle into their skills according to the companys websiteSome of the voices include Ivy a female voice that speaks in mannerisms akin to US English speakers Hans a male voice that speaks in German and Naja a female voice that speaks Danish Its unclear when developers will be able to embed eight nonUS English speaking voices into their skillsGet Data Sheet Fortunes

Lawsuit with Q Earnings Report Just Around the CornerNimah QuadriZacksOctober  ReblogShareTweetShareAmazon AMZN stock dipped almost  Thursday after facing a lawsuit filed by eBay EBAYMoreAmazon AMZN stock dipped almost  Thursday after facing a lawsuit filed by eBay EBAY Amazon is accused of illegally poaching sellers to its marketplace through eBays internal messaging system according to the Wall Street Journal Amazon and eBay are head to head competitors when it comes to both sellers and consumersAmazon focuses more on its buyers and invites them to check the website and make purchases based on their own needs Whereas eBay relies on its sellers to make a profit through their sales on eBays marketplaceWith its quarterly report coming out soon will this incident make any difference to how investors view AmazonLets list out the different accusations eBay set out in the lawsuit against Amazon and see if they will have any impact on the company EBay accused Amazon of having perpetrated a scheme over the years to infiltrate and get all of the information on eBays internal member email system The scheme is so widespread that it involves Amazon representatives spanning over many different countries all targeting eBay employees The accounts that were used to send messages came from devices linked to Amazon IP addresses as the scheme was coordinated through Amazons headquarters Amazon intentionally interfered with contractual and economic relations They also committed fraud and violation of the California penal and business professions codesThese are only some of the main points and it seems as though eBay had a lot more to say in relation to their competitor Currently Amazon has not said anything in response to this situation but note that it is investigating the claim Both companies shares were down through afternoon trading Thursday However does all of this really make any difference to Amazon in the long run We are aware that Amazon dominates the ecommerce space day by day According to the Wall Street Journal roughly  of US online sales come from Amazon It is certain that no matter what there will be rivalry and competition between companies within the same industry EBay has made efforts throughout the years to catch up to Amazon with an easier to navigate website and selling  new productsPlus Amazon has faced many lawsuits in different areas over the years so it is no surprise the company has not said anything yet as they are aware of how to handle these situations Yes it is deteriorating to a company to face a lawsuit and all of these accusations which may or may not be true in the shortrun However if we look at this from a longterm perspective the most Amazon will have to do is settle for monetary relief and as stated in the lawsuit permanently stop misusing eBays messaging systemWall Streets Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest

expectations on strength of Web ServicesDaniel RobertsSenior WriterYahoo FinanceApril  ReblogShareTweetShareAmazons firstquarter earnings on Thursday destroyed expectations across the board Its a far sunnier report than one quarter ago when the company missed on revenue Amazon AMZN stock surged more than  in afterhours trading thanks to the earnings and was still surging at the time of writing This was Amazons fourthstraight profitable quarterRevenue came in at  billion up  from last year and beating expectations of  billion earnings per share EPS came in at  way above expectations of  cents And revenue for Amazon Web Services AWS came to  billion edging out estimates of  billionIt is the latter figure thats most compelling Amazon is crushing it in cloudcomputing AWS provides storage services to General Electric GE Netflix NFLX Instagram FB and Spotify to name just a few of the major players that pay to use it AWS revenue is up  from the first quarter of last year and its operating income is up  That is staggeringAWS is also a profit machine It accounted for  of the companys profit this quarter and is the most profitable business at Amazon As analyst Jan Dawson pointed out on Twitter AWS generated more operating income in the quarter than Amazons entire US ecommerce business with less than one eighth the revenueIn a story last year The Atlantic called AWS the piece of infrastructure that has enabled the current tech boom It looked like hyperbole but less so now It has a murderers row of clients and those clients are willing to pay up to use itThere were other highlights in Amazons earnings International sales hit  billion for the quarter a rise of  from  billion one year ago showing huge growth outside the US That being said its international division is still not profitable And the company had some bragging to do about its own devices On its earnings call Amazon said its own devices are the bestselling hardware items on Amazon It sold twice as many Kindle Fire tablets as it did in the first quarter of last year and CEO Jeff Bezos pointed to Fire sales as a big contributor to overall sales growth though Amazon does not break out earnings for its hardwareIn its shareholder letter Amazon mentions that Amazon Studios acquired the rights to several highprofile films and names the seven films which include one directed by Woody Allen After each movie finishes its run in theatres each will become available exclusively to Prime members through Prime Video This simple statement of fact is a reminder that Amazon is eager to compete with Netflix HBO and Hulu in the originalcontent streaming gameFinally on a personal wealth note the earnings were especially nice for Bezos whose net worth jumped by more than  billionDaniel Roberts is a writer

Amazons Ad Business Is Taking Steps Beyond AmazoncomYahooSearchNo matching results for Tip Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsGive feedback on the new search

Taking Steps Beyond AmazoncomAdam Levy The Motley FoolMotley FoolMay  ReblogShareTweetShareLast month Amazon NASDAQ AMZN suddenly stopped buying Googles product listing ads Its now clear whyAmazon is reportedly testing its own ad product that will show display ads on other publishers websites to draw consumers back to Amazon The ecommerce giant previously purchased product listing ads from the Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGLsubsidiary on behalf of its advertising customers Now itll sell these new ads directly to advertisers instead of acting as an intermediary with GoogleThats a major step for Amazons ad business which management described as a multibilliondollar program and growing very quickly on the companys recent earnings callDuring that discussion one analyst called into question Amazons ability to increase its ad load or the number of ads shoppers see without hurting the customer experience Amazons solution Expand beyond AmazoncomCloseup of hands typing on a laptop computerMoreImage source Getty ImagesA massive opportunityLast year Google generated  billion in gross ad revenue from its network members That revenue come from sites or apps using Googles AdSense or AdMob products with which Google shares its ad revenue Google paid out a whopping  billion but still kept nearly  billion in net revenue for itself For reference thatsbigger than Amazons entire ad business last yearAnd that revenue from network members is extremely highmargin Google simply provides the tools for publishers to display AdSense ads on their sites or AdMob ads on their mobile apps but it doesnt have to maintain the sites or apps like it does with its owned and operated propertiesAmazon could quickly start taking share of the digital display ad market with its new ad product The companys ads will show web browsers items in which theyve previously expressed interest but didnt purchase which can produce high conversion ratesAdditionally Amazon has developed a technology for website publishers called a header bidding wrapper to help them maximize the value of their ad inventory by collecting bids from multiple suppliers Its allowed smaller supplyside platforms to compete with Google in recent years As such Google has seen the growth in network members revenue slow while its revenue share increasedWinning twiceAmazon may be able to offer better incentives to both advertisers and web publishers for using its ad products because it has the opportunity to win twice with these ads The first is just the same as Google When someone clicks on the ad Amazon gets paidBut that ad will take web browsers to Amazons marketplace where they can purchase the advertised item as well as pretty much anything else you can think of Whenever someone purchases an item on Amazon Amazon wins again  even for thirdparty merchantsAmazon collects certain fees from its thirdparty merchants for services like Fulfillment by Amazon or just a simple productlisting fee Last quarter thirdparty seller services revenue increased  year over year on a constant currency basis Thirdparty sales are an increasingly significant part of Amazons total revenueGoogle has far fewer opportunities to win twice like Amazon can with its advertisements That puts it at a potential disadvantage when it comes to how much revenue it can share with network members or what kind of pricing it can offer publishers Amazon on the other hand has lots of levers it can pull to take share of the thirdparty display ad market quickly and keep ramping up its ad business by stepping outside of

company based in Kent Washington and is the brainchild of Amazon AMZN CEO Jeff Bezos Founded in  the company aims to take private consumers to spaceBlue Origin made headlines earlier this week when it performed a successful highaltitude emergency abort test The company launched its New Shepard rocket and capsule to a recordhigh altitude and then simulated a catastrophic failure in the escape pods motor The motor is located at the bottom of the crew capsule and is meant to quickly lift it away from the rocket in the event of an emergency Even after igniting the engine at record altitudes both the capsule and rocket were able to land and be recovered safelyOut of this World Bezos who was named Time magazines Person of the Year in  turned his attention to space the following year when he quietly founded Blue OriginBlue Origin came under fire in  when it reported a failure in its suborbital rocket which went out of control and had to be destroyed Still Bezos and his team continued to work hard and each of the nearly dozen tests that have taken place since then have been successfulUntil Blue Origin relaunched New Shepard no space rocket had ever been used twice It marked what could historically be remembered as a key turning point in space exploration For Bezos it was the ultimate sign that his dream of lowering the cost of access to space is on the right track Today it remains an expensive endeavor which Bezos reportedly funds by annually liquidating  billion in Amazon assetsA growing amount of people believe in Bezos dream as well NASA first gave the company  million in funding in  and then  million in  Since then NASA has continued to provide it with support The company is also currently in the running to receive military funding from the US Air Force for support of new orbitalclass rockets Its proposal puts it up against Orbital ATK United Launch Alliance and Tesla TSLA founder Elon Musks SpaceX The contract is expected to be announced in late  A st Century Space RaceSpace exploration was initially a governmentonly venture But the turn of the st century has given rise to multiple public and privatelyowned firms which seek to bring regular citizens to the great beyondOn the public side large firms such as Boeing BA and Lockheed Martin LMT already have exposure to spacerelated ventures and are investing to expand their offerings Boeing collaborated to help create the International Space Station which saw its first component launched into orbit  years ago  ISS is expected to operate for another decade These firms also invest in GPS technology satellites and other spacerelated technology Meanwhile European power Airbus EADSY is developing the Gaia scope a billionpixel camera that the company hopes will allow it to create a detailed D map of the Milky WayOther players in the burgeoning industry include Virgin Galactic Rocket Lab Made in Space and Orbex In Britain Orbex raised  million in funding and plans to develop a launch vehicle using a governmentbacked spaceport that will be built in Northern Scotland with the help of Lockheed Martin Virgin also plans to launch from the UK and like Blue Origin hopes to take customers into spaceIt would be incorrect to assume that spacerelated activity is only taking place in America and Europe Ten private rocket companies have formed in just the last three years according to the China Global Television Network Russias space program has fallen on hard times due to budget restrictions meaning that it will not be as active as it was during the first space race Regardless the st century

Killing These Companies MarginsBilly Duberstein The Motley FoolMotley FoolMarch  ReblogShareTweetShareAmazoncomNASDAQ AMZN CEO Jeff Bezos once said Your margin is my opportunity and Amazon has truly backed that up over the years Despite explosive topline growth Amazon has consistently shown littletono GAAP profits in its core ecommerce businessOne of the biggest drivers of sales growth has been Prime Amazons  per year or  per month subscription serviceStarted back in  Prime offers a suite of intriguing benefits most notably free twoday shipping for an unlimited number of itemsToday it seems increasingly clear that this was a farsighted and ingenious invention As Prime has grown Amazon has added benefits spurring increased membership in a virtuous cycle Now Prime is so large its causing problems even at Amazons largest and wellrun competitorsWalmart NYSE WMT and Latin American ecommerce platform MercadoLibre NASDAQ MELIAmazon is competing hard against Walmart in the United States but recent rumors suggest its eyeing Latin America specifically Brazil potentially threatening MercadoLibres leading position there How are both companies trying to fend off the Amazon machine With free twoday shipping of coursea roll of hundred dollar bills at the end of a mousetrapMoreImage source Getty ImagesPrimes progressThe bet on Prime may have seemed crazy at the time it was launched in  Analysts often cited the fact that Amazon lost significant amounts of money on every Prime member due to shipping costsBut since then Primes annual price has increased from  to  and the service is now estimated to have between  million and  million members Amazon does not disclose these figures Those members contributed  billion in subscription revenue for Amazon or just under  of sales in the recent quarter Consumer Research Intelligence Partners estimates that Prime members spend roughly  per year with Amazon versus  for nonPrime members That has in turn bolstered Amazons thirdparty fulfillment business which has higher marginsAmazons stock has rocketed in recent years as Prime has grown winning over legions of loyal customers It is only now more than a decade after Prime launched that competitors are biting the bullet to invest in free shippingMercadoLibre claws aheadMercadoLibre rolled out free shipping in Mexico in  then added it in Brazil in August  Perhaps not coincidentally that change came not long before rumors that Amazon waslooking hard at the Brazilian marketThe introduction of free shipping has been a huge positive for MercadoLibres sales and gross market value GMV which grew a huge  and  respectively over the past yearBut the companys margins tell a different story Gross margins shrank from  to  and operating margins plummeted from  to  stripping out the effect of Venezuela which the company deconsolidated in December The largest cost difference Free shipping of courseMercadoLibre still applies volume conditions on free shipping which vary by country so its offering is not yet unlimitedLarger volumes should also generate more revenue from its fulfillment and payment businesses Mercado Envios and MercadoPago which have made encouraging progress to the point that optimism around these businesses offset concerns about MercadoLibres lower marginsStory continuesStill the freeshipping initiative combined with investments in fulfillment centers caused management to suspend its dividend going forwardWalmartUnlike MercadoLibre which is trying to stay one step ahead of Amazon Walmart is actually playing catchup in the mature US market Walmart began pivoting in earnest to becoming more of an ecommerce company in recent years buying Jetcom in  and even changing its official company name from WalMart Stores Inc to Walmart Inc in December highlighting the companys renewed focus on ecommerceWalmarts transition incorporated  you guessed it  free twoday shipping Initially Walmart tried to build its own Primelike subscription service called ShippingPass for which it charged  but obviously the endeavor wasnt working as the company scrapped the subscription service in January  in favor of free twoday shipping on eligible items included in orders over Trying to play catchup while fending off a giantAmazon has built quite a powerhouse in its Prime service and the companys longterm orientation and willingness to

again became the biggest sales day in its historySarah PerezTechCrunchJuly  ReblogShareTweetShareSujay Seetharaman ContributorMorePrime Day has once again broken records Despite serious glitches at its start Amazon announced this morning that Prime Day  grew to become the biggest shopping event in its history beating out Cyber Monday Black Friday and the previous Prime Day  Of course this years Prime Day was longer  a full hours in fact And while Amazon did make its comparisons to other sales holidays over the same period of time its not quite the same thing to compare a shorter sale to a longer one Last years Prime Day was  hours for exampleStill its a remarkable showing on Amazons part So much so that Amazon has taken the unusual step of actually providing some numbers around how much people bought Though it still declines to talk sales dollars as per usual it did say that Prime members worldwide purchased over  million products with small and mediumsized businesses on Amazon far exceeding  billion in sales this yearIt was unclear however if Amazon was counting sales at Whole Foods  which did participate in Prime Day for the first time  when calculating this  million products sold figure or its best day ever statements We asked the company to clarify this and confirmed that Whole Foods sales werenot being included in those calculationsThat said Amazon says that Prime members saved millions at Whole Foods during Prime Day where the top buy was organic strawberriesPrime Day  was also the biggest event ever for Amazon devices the retailer notedThis can be in part chalked up to the fact that Amazon put its device on sale  hours before Prime Day even began which allowed people more time to buy them at the reduced pricesIts bestsellers worldwide included theFire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote and the Echo Dot The Dot was a top seller in  too Its the most affordable of the Alexapowered speakers and was this year marked down  to  making it a good dealFire TV devices Kindle ereaders had their best day ever on Amazon globally on day one of Prime Day July   Prime Day was also the biggest sales event for Echo Show and Echo SpotAmazon didnt provide numbers for any of these sales but said millions of Fire TV devices were sold worldwideIn the US July  was the biggest day for smart home devices in history with over a million devices sold and Ring had its best day ever on July  with the Ring Video Doorbell Pro selling out The Amazon Cloud Cam also became the bestselling security camera in Amazon historyOutside of Amazon devices other US top sellers included the Instant Pot and LifeStraw water filtersMembers purchased more than  Instant Pot  Qt in Multi Use and  LifeStraw Personal Water Filters the retailer said Backtoschool items also did well with millions of pencils and pens soldDifferent countries had their own bestsellers which tended to include smart home items electronics gaming systems tools and other items for the homeAmong Amazons own brands top sellers included the Stone  Beam Ceramic Geometric Table Lamp Presto Ultra Soft Toilet Paper Daily Ritual Womens Jersey ShortSleeve VNeck TShirt Dress and AmazonBasics PreSeasoned Cast Iron SkilletThe company said that a record number of Prime members shopped Prime Day in  but this too can be explained partly by expanded access to the sale  Prime Day went live inAustralia Singapore the Netherlands and Luxembourg for the first time this year In total  countries had access to Prime Day salesMore importantly to Amazons bottom line was the increase in Prime membership signups In the end the actual sales are just icing on the cake  Prime Days larger goal is increasing the number of subscribers for its now  per year Prime membership program Turning online consumers into paying subscribers not only increases Amazons subscription revenues it boosts overall sales as those consumers begin to shop Amazon more often to take advantage of its free day shipping and other premium services  like Amazon Channels audiobook subscriptions ondemand music and moreThe retailer in April announced Prime had exceeded  million subscribers and Amazon didnt update that number todayStory continuesIts notable that Amazon Prime Day went well given how badly it began  glitches caused shoppers to lose the ability to even see the deals or complete checkout at the beginning of the sale potentially resulting in millions of lost salesPrime Day offers us a unique opportunity to thank Prime members with our best deals said Jeff Wilke CEO Worldwide Consumer Amazon in a statement Extending Prime Day to a day and a half this year allowed us to further reward members with unbeatable deals access to exclusive new products and unforgettable experiences that highlight the many benefits of a Prime membership All of this was made possible because of our many valued associates  the global team that continues to make Prime Day bigger and betterThis article

Holiday Shows Consumers Still Have Appetite for SpendingMolly SchuetzBloombergDecember  ReblogShareTweetShareBloomberg  Amazoncom Inc reported a recordbreaking holiday season as shoppers loaded their online baskets with items from Echo speakers to Calvin Klein clothes suggesting consumer optimism isnt being deterred by a tumbling stock marketThe internet retailer said tens of millions of people worldwide signed up for its Prime service which offers free twoday shipping on millions of items as well as video and music streaming In the US alone more than  billion items were shipped for free using Prime Amazon said in a statement WednesdayThe US was already headed into a blowout Christmas shopping spree as Americans are benefiting from higher employment and wages fueling higher household cash flow Consumers seemed to be merry despite a SP  Index that has tumbled a government shutdown thats entering its fifth day and ongoing trade tensions with ChinaAmazon wasnt the only one benefiting from an insatiable consumer appetite Mastercard Inc and Visa Inc rebounded after four days of declines Mastercard said holiday sales increased  percent to more than  billion this year the strongest growth in the last six years Online shopping saw gains of  percent compared with  according to Mastercard SpendingPulse Brickandmortar retailers also gained Nike Inc Macys Inc Kohls Corp and PVH Corp were all higher midmorning in New YorkPeople bought millions more of Amazons own devices compared with last year including the new Echo Dot speaker and the Fire TV Stick the Seattlebased company said At the same time Amazon said more than  percent of items sold in its stores came from small and mediumsized businessesAmong the most popular items under the Christmas tree were the LOL Surprise Glam Glitter Series doll Bose Corp wireless headphones and clothes from Carhartt Inc Other popular brands bought through Amazons Prime Wardrobe service which allows consumers to fill a box with selected items and return anything that they dont want included PVH Corps Calvin Klein and Hanesbrands Incs ChampionAmazon started the shopping frenzy out strong with Novembers Cyber Monday already pegged as the companys biggest shopping day in history Along with the Christmas sales report the picture seems much brighter than Amazon had initially projected in its latest earnings results In October Amazons revenue and profit forecast for the holiday quarter fell short of analysts estimates as investors worried about Amazons increased pace of spendingWhile Amazon has expanded into almost every area of retail from pharmaceuticals to groceries its more profitable units are cloud computing and advertising Still Amazon which dominates ecommerce in the US has relied on the growth of its Prime members who pay  a year for the service Recent estimates put subscribers at just under  million in the US Amazon didnt give any new numbers for Prime subscribers in its statement Wednesday but said millions of unique items in the US shipped with PrimeThat kind of volume presents a challenge for logistics services like FedEx Corp and United Parcel Service Inc In  a larger than expected surge in lastminute online shopping caught UPS off guard and forced it and Amazon and other retailers to offer refunds to customers who didnt receive their orders on time for ChristmasThis year UPS said it expects to deliver an average of more than  million parcels a day during the holidays and anticipates a peakseason total of about  million packages to rise  percent compared with last years tally To deal with the rush of deliveries the company invested in automation and new facilities to add sorting capacity of  packages an hour to its US systemWere so far pleased with the operational aspect of it said Glenn Zaccara a spokesman for UPS The investments that UPS made in the network technology people and planning across the season with our customers obviously paid offThe couriers are bracing for a second wave of business as people begin returning gifts in January UPS expects return packages to hit  million on Jan  The company said it had  million returns its highest for the season on Dec Story continuesWith the SP teetering on a bear market after a volatile fourth quarter and the worst December in more than a decade Baird analyst Colin Sebastian lists Amazon as one of the three best picks for investors in the event of a market rebound Amazon shares were up  percent to  at  am in New York Wednesday They have gained about  percent this year compared with an  percent decline on the SP If Amazons Echo speaker was one of its best sellers it appears to also have been a victim of its own success Powered by Alexa the voiceactivated software the smart devices appeared overwhelmed by an onslaught of new users on Christmas according to reports from the UK Owners asking Alexa to play music turn on the tree lights or recite turkey recipes were often met with the highly unsatisfactory

partner to cut US healthcare costsBy Caroline Humer and Ankur BanerjeeReutersJanuary  ReblogShareTweetShareBy Caroline Humer and Ankur BanerjeeReuters  Amazoncom Inc Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase  Co said on Tuesday they will form a company to cut health costs for hundreds of thousands of their US employees setting up a major challenge to an inefficient US healthcare systemThe move by three of the bestknown US business leaders  Amazons Jeff Bezos Berkshires Warren Buffett and JPMorgans Jamie Dimon  would take on the worlds most expensive healthcare system whose mounting costs have hurt corporate profits Shares in US healthcare companies fell across the boardThe new notforprofit venture will initially focus on technology for simplified highquality and transparent healthcare for their more than  US employees They did not elaborate on their strategy but said they are searching for a chief executive officerHealthcare industry experts say the new entity could eventually negotiate directly with drugmakers doctors and hospitals and use their vast databases to get a better handle on the costs of those servicesThat could undercut the industrys middlemen from health insurers to pharmacies and benefits managersThe ballooning costs of healthcare act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy said Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Warren Buffett Our group does not come to this problem with answers But we also do not accept it as inevitableISI Evercore analyst Michael Newshal said the selloff in healthcare stocks reflected the fear of disruption in a sector helped by rising prices year after year but is under growing scrutiny from US consumers regulators and politiciansThere are a lot of companies or arguably almost all companies in healthcare that benefit from cost inflation running as high as it has been for many years And if there is pressure to lower that that can flow throughout the entire system Newshal saidMAJOR DISRUPTORUS healthcare spending has been increasing annually faster than inflation and in  accounted for  percent of the US economy Corporations sponsor health benefits for more than  million AmericansMajor healthcare players have tried to reduce costs without losing their profit margins Most recently pharmacy network CVS Health Corp reached a  billion deal to buy insurer Aetna Inc arguing their combination could save money for the nations employersInvestors in the sector see Amazon becoming a major disruptor of healthcare just as it has done in the retail industry fuelled by media reports in recent months that the company was considering entering the pharmacy businessTeaming up with JPMorgan the biggest US bank and Berkshire the third largest public company in the world offers new opportunities to shake up the industry analysts saidFor example JPMorgan could help shape new payment models for consumers and providers and provide cost data CEO Dimon has for years expressed concerns about rising healthcare costsIn  he wrote in his annual letter that the company spent  billion on medical benefits for US employees  percent of companywide expensesBerkshire CEO Buffett has long complained that high healthcare costs were hurting American businesses and publicly began using the term tapeworm to describe their effects as early as The partnership will be spearheaded by Berkshire investment officer Todd Combs JPMorgan managing director Marvelle Berchtold and Amazon senior vice president Beth GalettiCombs  has been an investment deputy to Buffett since  and joined JPMorgans board in INSURERS FALLHealth insurers that provide benefit management or health plans to Amazon JPMorgan and Berkshire could be among the hardest hitJPMorgan uses UnitedHealth Group Inc and Cigna Corp for health benefits for its global workforce according to ISI Evercore analyst Ross Muken Neither company was available for commentAmazon uses Premera Blue Cross part of the Blue Cross Blue Shield network according to Muken Express Scripts the pharmacy benefits manager has disclosed it manages pharmacy benefits for AmazonShares in UnitedHealth Cigna Corp and health insurer Anthem Inc

what has changedKrystal HuReporterYahoo FinanceAugust  ReblogShareTweetShareDavid FosterYahoo FinanceMoreIts been a year since Amazon AMZN closed its  billion acquisition of Whole Foods Market The bombshell news once sent many othergrocery stocks tumbling amid investor concerns Some expected the ecommerce giant which has changed the way people buy books to disrupt how people shop for kale and cereals So here we are One year after Amazon took over Whole Foods the natural grocery chain has become a virtual mystery to analysts as Amazons earnings reports shed little light on key measures of its performance Whole Foods CEO John Mackey once gushed that the Amazon deal was love at first sight He later admitted at a conference in February if you want to stay in the marriage you change How has Amazon changed Whole Foods And whats ahead for Whole Foods Through interviews surveys and thirdparty data provided by Second Measure Yahoo Finance can provide some insightsWhole Foods sales remain flatDavid FosterYahoo FinanceMoreAmazons heavilypromoted price cuts have attracted attention but they didnt necessarily bring a big boost to Whole Foods Whole Foods sales since the acquisition have largely remained stable with only low singledigit growth according to data from Second Measure a company that tracks consumer spending The premium grocery stores growth has been stagnant since  New shoppers only account for  of its customers baseNeil Saunders the managing director of retail at GlobalData sees no further decline in sales as a sign of progress If Whole Foods hasnt been acquired by Amazon we could probably see sales reverse much more sharply he said The steep pricing strategy and limited investment in stores have kept the sales growth stagnant since  David FosterYahoo FinanceMoreAmazons selfcreated shopping holiday Prime Day did bring a bump This year Whole Foods celebrated its first Amazon Prime Day by offering  Amazon credit to Prime members who spend  or more at Whole Foods from July  Whole Foods average daily sales during the promotion week were  higher than the average summer dayThe Amazon Effect on Whole Foods is really tied to the ecommerce giants Prime Membership Amazons core subscription program now touts over  million users around the world Those members accounted for more than half of Whole Foods sales in the US In June   of Whole Foods new consumers were already Prime members compared to  one year ago However the increase doesnt necessarily mean the Prime sales and promotions are luring more shoppers During that same time period the percentage of Amazon Prime members among the US population also increased to  from David FosterYahoo FinanceMoreStory continuesCustomers see some product changesYahoo Finance surveyed more than  Whole Food shoppers about their experience in the past year Forty percent believe the price of products in stores arent really lower Nearly half of those surveyed say Amazon has brought positive changes to Whole Foods The most popular feature in the integration is the discounts for Prime members at Whole Foods stores Amazon has been gradually rolling out the perk since May Now Prime members can enjoy an additional  off sale items in stores nationwide plus exclusive weekly discounts on select itemsMeanwhile Whole Foods has been reorganizing its shelves by removing and adding products Instead of givingregional teams the autonomy to source local products the companys management team at its Austin headquarter now makes centralized buying decisions in an effort to standardize the supply chain and reduce cost From Nature Valley granola bars Tropicana Orange Juice to Starbucks cold brew coffee Whole Foods has opened its arms to common brand names found at other grocery chains like Walmart With consumerpackaged goods CPG Whole Foods now offers more options for shoppers Travis Christensen a Whole Foods shopper in Arizona said the chain has emerged as his primary grocery store since Amazons acquisition I like Amazon bringing value proposition rather than just premium and organic I use Prime discounts and appreciate the sprinkling of mainstream products Christensen wrote in the surveyBut introducing more CPG a different approach from Whole Foods longstanding reputation for sourcing natural and organic products locally has disappointed some loyal customers Local brand items are disappearing from the shelves This was something that made me loyal to Whole Foods in the past but is making me rethink if I want to continue shopping there versus other grocery stores in the future John Dixon from Louisville Kentucky told Yahoo FinanceSome longtime employees have also raised eyebrows at the push Brittain Ladd a retail consultant who had worked for Amazon believes phasing out some locally sourced products is a necessary pain for Whole FoodsThe way Amazon could reduce cost is standardizing the assortments across all stores and relying on a nationwide distribution model versus the locally sourced model said LaddWhats next for Whole FoodsDavid FosterYahoo FinanceMoreAnalysts believe Amazon has delivered on its plan for Whole Foods in the first year of the transition by focusing on reorganization and integrating Prime membership into the shopping experienceThe streamline and standardization process is ongoing Whole Foods has been working on consolidating its  regions across the country Yahoo Finance has learnedCustomers can expect more changes on the aisles too Amazon is expected to introduce more consumer packaged and private label products a move that

Jeff Bezos still personally reads customer complaint emails sent to him even though he doesnt reply to many of them he said during an onstage interview on FridayOften hell forward those emails on to the executives in charge with a single character a question markThe manager who receives the email is then on the hook to drop everything research the situation and write a wellcrafted responseAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos has a notorious habit of sending his executives an email which has a single character a question markWhen the executive gets an email from Bezos that simply says  they know that Bezos is concerned about something because a customer complained Bezos explained during an onstage interview at the George Bush Presidential Centeron FridayI still have an email address customers can write to Bezos explained Although he doesnt typically answer those emails himself he does read themI see most of those emails I see them and I forward them to the executives in charge of the area with a question mark Its shorthand for can you look into this Why is this happening Bezos saidGetting such an email is a pretty common thing at Amazon and its also big deal The executive in turn will often foward it along to the manager in charge of the area who will view the email with a sinking heart one of them recently told usThats because the manager is then on the hook to drop everything investigate and get back with an answer Sometimes that means a lot of research over nights and weekends the Amazon manager recently told usBut Bezos views that email addressjeffamazoncom as a way to stay close to customers which can otherwise be hard to do as an executive who is far removed from daytoday customer service and sees the company mostly through data and reportsWe have tons of metrics Bezos explained on stage When you are shipping billions of packages a year you need good data and metrics are you delivering on time Delivering on time to every city To apartment complexes  Whether the packages have too much air in them wasteful packagingSo those customer complaints gives him frontline insights If all of his data say one thing and a few customers say something else he believes the customersThe thing I have noticed is when the anecdotes and the data disagree the anecdotes are usually right Theres something wrong with the way you are measuring it he explainedThis is one of the ways Bezos expresses what he calls one of Amazons most important values customer obsessionWe talk about it customer obsession as opposed to competitor obsession he said Often companies say they are focused on customers but they really spend most of their energy reacting to and talking about competitorsIf your whole culture is competitorobsessed its hard to stay motivated if you are out in front Whereas customers are also unsatisfied always discontent always want more So no matter how far in front you get in front of competitors you are still behind your customers They are always

Google parent company Alphabets GOOG GOOGL own  Nest Cam Indoor But with a significant price advantage and a solid set of features the Cloud Cam makes a compelling case to hire Amazon as your own watchdogThe setupSetting up the Cloud Cam is incredibly easy Simply position the camera facing an area you want to monitor likely near a door or windows and plug it in Amazon includes mounting screws and drywall anchors if you prefer to screw the camera into your wall Once the camera is set up download the Cloud Cam app for your iPhone or Android device log in with your Amazon account and youre set The app will ask you to select the WiFi network youd like to connect the camera to and what youd like to name it to differentiate multiple cameras from each otherAnd thats essentially it I was genuinely surprised with how smooth the entire setup process wentSpying  on my catsThe minute I setup the Cloud Cam I knew I was going to use it to see what my cats do all day when Im not home Spoiler alert They sleep A lot The Cloud Cams interface is incredibly straightforward Youve got one large box that shows you a live feed from your camera In the bottom right corner of that box is a microphone that lets you speak with whomever or whatever is in your home The Cloud Cam is an easy way to spy on your pets from the officeMoreBelow the video box is a list of the various clips the Cams motion detector has recorded See unlike the Nest Cam Indoor which captures images when motion is detected Amazons Cloud Cam captures short video clipsYou can replay up to  hours worth of those clips with Amazons free Cloud Cam account If you want to save more youll have to sign up for a subscriptionBeyond that Amazon lets you adjust a number of settings in the app including whether the camera is on or off its name and how often you want to receive motion notification updatesYou can enable location tracking in the Cloud Cam app to automatically determine when your phone and the camera are at the same location and switch the camera offSign up for one of Amazons monthly plans and youll also be able to get notifications for whether movement is from a person or your pet and set up zones that you want to exclude from the motion detectors sensors for things like ceiling fans As with other such cameras the Cloud Cam has night vision capabilities so you can see whats happening in your home even if its darkThat person is not a personNone of this is unique to Amazons offering The Nest CamIndoor has the same features with a slightly wider field of view and sound detection so if the camera hears a loud noise youll receive an alert Amazons Cloud Cam cant do thatWhat it can do however is learn over time using Amazons own Amazon Web Services And thats good because while the Cloud Cam detected movement in my apartment it couldnt seem to differentiate between when my cats were wandering around and if someone was actually in my homeThe Cloud Cam can determine if movement in your home is caused by a person or petMoreStory continuesOver the course of a day I received a handful of notifications that said a person was detected when it was just my cat walking across my coffee table The vast majority of the time the Cam knew the movement wasnt a person but those false positives were still thereAmazon however says that as the Cam is used the software will become better at understanding the difference between pets and peopleThe Cloud Cam also works with your Fire TV and Echo Show so if you tell Alexa to show you the living room camera youll instantly get a live feed of

the Key smartlock and begin using the service The Cloud Cam is an integral part of Amazon Key as it allows homeowners to see that the delivery person dropping off their package isnt also making off

on This Vulnerable SegmentJames BrumleyInvestorPlaceJanuary  ReblogShareTweetShareEarlier this week Piper Jaffrey once again touted Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN as a top pick explaining its only scratched the surface of the amount of money it could extract from consumers Analyst Michael Olson even went as far as to raise his price target on Amazon stock from  to  Thats  above the stocks present priceIts an exciting even familiar refrain to shareholders of a company that can seemingly do no wrong And truth be told Amazon has largely earned its stature among investors with its topline growth even if bottomline growth hasnt matched itAt some point though the analyst community is going to have to start accepting and discussing the reality that the bigger Amazons ecommerce business gets the less profitable it is Indeed were it not for Amazon Web Services  the Amazons cloudcomputing arm  the company would be alarmingly in the red And even that may not be enough in the near futureInvestorPlace  Stock Market News Stock Advice  Trading Tips   ETFs That Will Beat the Market in   Piper Jaffreys Olson upped his target on Amazon stock mostly in response to the firms review of data regarding consumer spending during the allimportant holidayshopping spending period late last year In short as big as Amazon has become it still only captured about  of the money spent on giftgiving late last year Olson opines the company is still in the early innings of its sharegain potential which could be taken from rivals like WalMart Stores Inc NYSEWMT or Target Corporation NYSETGTIt all sounds very compelling  and believable  on the surface Amazoncom has become a juggernaut few competitors dare stand up to And its still growing the top line at a doubledigit paceThe funny thing is the bigger Amazons ecommerce machine gets the less profitable it becomes More of the same topline growth is likely to mean more of the same shrinking bottom line putting all the pressure of cash flow on Amazon Web ServicesDynamics of Amazon StockThe graphic below tells the tale strikingly The companys North American ecommerce arm is barely profitable and decreasingly so Its international ecommerce effort has been and continues to bleed money The only meaningful profits being produced right now are coming from Amazon Web Services Click to EnlargeHeres the same data presented as margins or as a percentage of revenue Click to EnlargeIts not the end of the world in and of itself Lots of companies manage different divisions of various profitability levels If it works for owners of Amazon stock then it worksIts a dynamic that should be questioned though as it may not be able to work foreverThere are two overarching liabilities packed into Amazons profit mix One of them is the one Tom Taulli explored last year pointing out that competition from names like Microsoft Corporation NASDAQMSFT and Alphabet Inc NASDAQGOOGL NASDAQGOOG is heating up now that Amazon has proven cloud computing and cloud storage is a viable market The more players who are in the race the thinner margins become as a price war ensuesThe other vulnerability of such a lopsided mix of earnings Its not even clear how profitable AWS actually isAmazons Cash Flow Isnt ReallyIts a bit complicated but heres the simple explanation Amazons touted cash flow isnt actually its cash flow The company expenses shortlived hardware used by Amazon Web Services as a capital lease obligation As such the cost of that equipment isnt deducted from cash flow though given the short lifespan of a server it arguably should be treated like a traditional recurring expense Amazon isnt bucking GAAP rules to be clear but the approach does obscure the true effective cost of keeping AWS up and runningStory continuesEither way the heavy cost of running AWS in an increasingly commoditized environment is creating some major liabilities A closer look at last quarters SEC filing shows  billion worth of debt and capitalized lease obligations Thats up from just a little less than  billion in debt and capitalized lease obligations Amazon was sitting on a year earlierThose are bills that are going to have to be paid sometime by a company that could be limping along more than it seems on the surfaceBottom Line for Amazon StockA pronouncement of death for Amazon stock Hardly If nothing else CEO Jeff Bezos has proven hes always got another trick up his sleeve to drive growth   Bitcoin Alternatives That You Need for   Still these are the basis of questions that diehard shareholders of AMZN should be asking The company is making a massive expensive bet on a cloud market thats not guaranteed to be dominated by Amazon If its not actually as profitable as it seems like it is theres no real backup plan or scenario that gets the company anywhere near its projected profit expectationsAs of this writing James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities You can

based on what it sees from consumersSo while Facebook and Google are heavily dependent on advertising Amazon has stuff like Amazon Web Services AWS  billion in operating income in the first nine

search experienceCancelSign inMailFinanceWatchlistsMy PortfolioScreenersMarketsIndustriesVideosNewsPersonal FinanceTechUS Markets closedSP Dow NasdaqRussell Crude OilGoldSilverEURUSDHow Amazon counterfeits put this mans business on brink of collapseAri LevyCNBCOctober  ReblogShareTweetShareMark Lopreiato was thrilled when he was invited to promote his Forearm Forklift on ABCs Good Morning America last month The chance for a small manufacturing business to reach  million viewers for free doesnt come around oftenLopreiato appeared on Buy it and Try It a segment for hosts to test out popular niche gizmos from infomercials in front of an enthusiastic New York studio audience The first product they tried was a steel nonstick pan which smoothly cooked up eggs without the use of oil or butterThen it was Forearm Forklifts turn After viewing a commercial for the product ABCs Lara Spencer and Gio Benitez pulled the heavyduty moving straps over their forearms and proceeded to lift up a washing machine and walk with itI was pretty impressed Spencer said to the crowdYoud think such a shoutout from the hugely popular morning show would provide a huge boost for Lopreiatos yearold family businessBut this is Amazoncoms NASDAQ AMZN world and Forearm Forklift like so many brands is uncomfortably inhabiting itOnce a thriving product for movers and contractors available at a dozen bigbox retailers including WalMart NYSE WMT Target NYSE TGT and AutoZone NYSE AZO Forearm Forklift has been ravaged over the past halfdecade by counterfeiters mostly selling on Amazon Scores of merchants have copied the patented product using its name images and labels and undercutting the real Forearm Forklift on priceWhen Good Morning America viewers go online to buy a set which retails between  and  odds are theyll be purchasing someone elses productIt just keeps funneling business to the knockoffs said Lopreiato  whose wife Sophia also works at the company and traveled with him to New York Its almost like winning the lottery if they choose our itemForearm Forklift is hanging on by a thread The company is down to  fulltime employees from  at its peak and recorded less than  in profit last year Annual revenue in  topped  million and has since plunged  percent Retailers stopped placing orders because they were finding what appeared to be the same thing online for much cheaperLopreiato has diversified his product line adding a harness for the shoulders a strap that goes over a single shoulder and straps for carrying boxes But nothing has come close to replicating the success of his flagship Forearm ForkliftMeanwhile Lopreiato bears the costs of workers compensation product quality control commercial insurance mortgage payments and patent management fees all so counterfeiters can act as freeloadersWere competing with people who are stealing our brand stealing our pictures and stealing our intellectual property Lopreiato said in an interview last week from his square foot warehouse in Baldwin Park about  miles east of Los AngelesAmazons growing dominance in commerce brings with it plenty of collateral damage The counterfeit problem in particular goes largely undiscussed by CEO  Jeff Bezos  and ignored by investors and analystsThe stock has climbed  percent over the last  months making Amazon the worlds fourthmost valuable company and  percent of analysts tracked by FactSet say shareholders should buy moreHeading into the Seattlebased companys thirdquarter earnings report Thursday investor focus is on Amazon Web Services Prime membership growth and additional investments in supply chain and fulfillment Analysts at Pacific Crest Securities in their earnings preview called Amazon one of the most disruptive forces in retail and technology todayConversations with merchants elicit a very different reaction Since CNBCcom  began reporting  on Amazons budding counterfeit issue in May weve spoken with dozens of merchants that have narratives similar to Lopreiatos but very few are willing to speak on the record out of fear of retribution from AmazonLopreiato an Army veteran and father of two middleschool daughters said he felt compelled to tell his storyIf Jeff Bezos knew exactly what was happening to us hed do the right thing he said Its not that hes a bad guy Its that there is in my opinion a lot of pressure put on folks at Amazon to increase sales increase sales increase sales Thats wonderful Thats the American way But do it rightStory continuesAmazons obsessive focus on pleasing consumers with discounts and service has come at the expense of brands like Forearm Forklift In trying to provide the lowestcost option for virtually every product on the planet the company  opened the doors  to merchants from across the globe with little respect for intellectual property despite an anticounterfeiting policy that prohibits the sale of inauthentic itemsThats enabled manufacturers largely from China to take advantage of cheaper production and labor costs to compete on the Amazon marketSome big brands have voiced their concerns Birkenstock  said in July that its no longer authorizing sales on Amazon starting in  Last week Apple NASDAQ AAPL sued a distributor named Mobile Star for selling counterfeit power adapters and charging cables on the site claiming the products pose an immediate threat to consumer safetyAmazon has taken steps to crack down of late by forcing new sellers of major brands like Nike NYSE NKE Hasbro NASDAQ HAS and Cuisinart to show invoices proving the items are legitimate and then pay a fee Thirdparty sellers are getting  suspended  in droves for activity that Amazon deems suspicious or for complaints from buyers sparking outrage from merchants who say theyre being punished for Amazons inability to control counterfeitingAmazon has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeits a company spokesperson said in an emailed statement We are working closely with manufacturers and brands to identify offenders and removing fraudulent items from our catalog We are also taking action and aggressively pursuing bad actors in this spaceThe company didnt offer a comment on Forearm Forklifts situationUntil now Forearm Forklift has been forced to selfpolice the site and take action to get unauthorized listings removed See an infringer Send a ceaseanddesist letter Suspicious of a counterfeit Buy it and prove to Amazon through a formal complaint that the listing should be taken downRepeat repeat repeat And pray it worksOn the second floor of Forearm Forklifts warehouse Lopreiato opens a closet filled floortoceiling with cardboard boxes from Amazon purchases Inside each supposedly is a version of his productTheres no subtlety The packaging includes not only his name and label but images of his family members and coworkers moving washing machines armoires and exercise equipment Open a box and find orange straps that are either too thin too short have loose stitching or are made of entirely different and weaker materialLopreiato said hes submitted more than  ceaseanddesist letters to thirdparty sellers and takedown notices to Amazon But go to Amazon today and infringers are easy to spot One listing for furniture moving straps contains an image that looks like a couple of seat belts Among the attached photos is one of Marks wife moving a mattressIn a July  email to Amazons patent team Marty Proops an Amazon marketplace expert who previously worked with Forearm Forklift on its account said he and Lopreiato had identified  separate sellers offering infringing products over the past yearBuyers who assume theyre getting the real thing are dismayed when the product cant possibly help them move a pound refrigerator Thus Forearm Forklift has onestar reviews from customers calling it a cheap knockoff dont purchase and very obvious counterfeitThat posts on our offer page on Amazon so a lot of people think were offering fakes Lopreiato saidHe never expected this to be easy He developed the original contraption while working as a mover and dealing with clients who didnt want dollies rolling across new wooden floors Carrying items by hand meant bending down with pound appliances to get through doorwaysLopreiato got started renting a small warehouse in  and had so little money that he lived in the office He had an evening gig at a law firm doing clerical work and waited tables on weekendsFor  years Lopreiato built the business by attending trade shows and networking with distributors and buyers He forged deals with companies ranging from UHaul and Home Depot NYSE HD to Ross Stores NASDAQ ROST and Canadian Tire Toronto Stock Exchange CTCACAHe was on QVC every two months or so starting in  selling more than  Forearm Forklifts per live show at the peak He started selling to Amazon as a vendor that same year but it was never a big part of his business representing under  percent of revenue in Lopreiato was fully prepared for competition knowing that patent protection only goes so far But he never expected a counterfeiting onslaughtThe slide started in  He got a call from an Amazon employee saying that other sellers were offering his product at a much lower price and he needed to cut his rate to keep the businessLopreiato investigated and quickly found the rival products were fakes He told Amazon that he would aggressively defend his intellectual property but that he couldnt compete with those prices and still make money Amazon was unhappy with that response and within weeks there were more than  knockoffs on the site Lopreiato saidSince that date its just been absolutely downhill he saidOver the past six years Lopreiato has seen vendor managers come and go without fixing the problem or notifying him that theyre leavingHe forwarded a number of emails from the past two years where he and Proops showed explicit infringement and asked for help In addition to jeopardizing Forearm Forklifts business Proops wrote in June  Sooner or later an Amazon customer is going to be seriously injured by one of these cheap knockoffsResponses ranged from terse to deflecting Amazon told Proops to send complaints to generic email addresses copyrightamazoncom and patentsamazoncom Other emails suggested that the company was looking into the matter but then the account would move to another representativeIn July  an Amazon lawyer told Proops by email that Forearm Forklift should take up infringement matters directly with the thirdparty sellers At this time we consider this matter closed

counterfeits put this mans business on brink of collapseAri LevyCNBCOctober  ReblogShareTweetShareMark Lopreiato was thrilled when he was invited to promote his Forearm Forklift on ABCs Good Morning America last month The chance for a small manufacturing business to reach  million viewers for free doesnt come around oftenLopreiato appeared on Buy it and Try It a segment for hosts to test out popular niche gizmos from infomercials in front of an enthusiastic New York studio audience The first product they tried was a steel nonstick pan which smoothly cooked up eggs without the use of oil or butterThen it was Forearm Forklifts turn After viewing a commercial for the product ABCs Lara Spencer and Gio Benitez pulled the heavyduty moving straps over their forearms and proceeded to lift up a washing machine and walk with itI was pretty impressed Spencer said to the crowdYoud think such a shoutout from the hugely popular morning show would provide a huge boost for Lopreiatos yearold family businessBut this is Amazoncoms NASDAQ AMZN world and Forearm Forklift like so many brands is uncomfortably inhabiting itOnce a thriving product for movers and contractors available at a dozen bigbox retailers including WalMart NYSE WMT Target NYSE TGT and AutoZone NYSE AZO Forearm Forklift has been ravaged over the past halfdecade by counterfeiters mostly selling on Amazon Scores of merchants have copied the patented product using its name images and labels and undercutting the real Forearm Forklift on priceWhen Good Morning America viewers go online to buy a set which retails between  and  odds are theyll be purchasing someone elses productIt just keeps funneling business to the knockoffs said Lopreiato  whose wife Sophia also works at the company and traveled with him to New York Its almost like winning the lottery if they choose our itemForearm Forklift is hanging on by a thread The company is down to  fulltime employees from  at its peak and recorded less than  in profit last year Annual revenue in  topped  million and has since plunged  percent Retailers stopped placing orders because they were finding what appeared to be the same thing online for much cheaperLopreiato has diversified his product line adding a harness for the shoulders a strap that goes over a single shoulder and straps for carrying boxes But nothing has come close to replicating the success of his flagship Forearm ForkliftMeanwhile Lopreiato bears the costs of workers compensation product quality control commercial insurance mortgage payments and patent management fees all so counterfeiters can act as freeloadersWere competing with people who are stealing our brand stealing our pictures and stealing our intellectual property Lopreiato said in an interview last week from his square foot warehouse in Baldwin Park about  miles east of Los AngelesAmazons growing dominance in commerce brings with it plenty of collateral damage The counterfeit problem in particular goes largely undiscussed by CEO  Jeff Bezos  and ignored by investors and analystsThe stock has climbed  percent over the last  months making Amazon the worlds fourthmost valuable company and  percent of analysts tracked by FactSet say shareholders should buy moreHeading into the Seattlebased companys thirdquarter earnings report Thursday investor focus is on Amazon Web Services Prime membership growth and additional investments in supply chain and fulfillment Analysts at Pacific Crest Securities in their earnings preview called Amazon one of the most disruptive forces in retail and technology todayConversations with merchants elicit a very different reaction Since CNBCcom  began reporting  on Amazons budding counterfeit issue in May weve spoken with dozens of merchants that have narratives similar to Lopreiatos but very few are willing to speak on the record out of fear of retribution from AmazonLopreiato an Army veteran and father of two middleschool daughters said he felt compelled to tell his storyIf Jeff Bezos knew exactly what was happening to us hed do the right thing he said Its not that hes a bad guy Its that there is in my opinion a lot of pressure put on folks at Amazon to increase sales increase sales increase sales Thats wonderful Thats the American way But do it rightStory continuesAmazons obsessive focus on pleasing consumers with discounts and service has come at the expense of brands like Forearm Forklift In trying to provide the lowestcost option for virtually every product on the planet the company  opened the doors  to merchants from across the globe with little respect for intellectual property despite an anticounterfeiting policy that prohibits the sale of inauthentic itemsThats enabled manufacturers largely from China to take advantage of cheaper production and labor costs to compete on the Amazon marketSome big brands have voiced their concerns Birkenstock  said in July that its no longer authorizing sales on Amazon starting in  Last week Apple NASDAQ AAPL sued a distributor named Mobile Star for selling counterfeit power adapters and charging cables on the site claiming the products pose an immediate threat to consumer safetyAmazon has taken steps to crack down of late by forcing new sellers of major brands like Nike NYSE NKE Hasbro NASDAQ HAS and Cuisinart to show invoices proving the items are legitimate and then pay a fee Thirdparty sellers are getting  suspended  in droves for activity that Amazon deems suspicious or for complaints from buyers sparking outrage from merchants who say theyre being punished for Amazons inability to control counterfeitingAmazon has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeits a company spokesperson said in an emailed statement We are working closely with manufacturers and brands to identify offenders and removing fraudulent items from our catalog We are also taking action and aggressively pursuing bad actors in this spaceThe company didnt offer a comment on Forearm Forklifts situationUntil now Forearm Forklift has been forced to selfpolice the site and take action to get unauthorized listings removed See an infringer Send a ceaseanddesist letter Suspicious of a counterfeit Buy it and prove to Amazon through a formal complaint that the listing should be taken downRepeat repeat repeat And pray it worksOn the second floor of Forearm Forklifts warehouse Lopreiato opens a closet filled floortoceiling with cardboard boxes from Amazon purchases Inside each supposedly is a version of his productTheres no subtlety The packaging includes not only his name and label but images of his family members and coworkers moving washing machines armoires and exercise equipment Open a box and find orange straps that are either too thin too short have loose stitching or are made of entirely different and weaker materialLopreiato said hes submitted more than  ceaseanddesist letters to thirdparty sellers and takedown notices to Amazon But go to Amazon today and infringers are easy to spot One listing for furniture moving straps contains an image that looks like a couple of seat belts Among the attached photos is one of Marks wife moving a mattressIn a July  email to Amazons patent team Marty Proops an Amazon marketplace expert who previously worked with Forearm Forklift on its account said he and Lopreiato had identified  separate sellers offering infringing products over the past yearBuyers who assume theyre getting the real thing are dismayed when the product cant possibly help them move a pound refrigerator Thus Forearm Forklift has onestar reviews from customers calling it a cheap knockoff dont purchase and very obvious counterfeitThat posts on our offer page on Amazon so a lot of people think were offering fakes Lopreiato saidHe never expected this to be easy He developed the original contraption while working as a mover and dealing with clients who didnt want dollies rolling across new wooden floors Carrying items by hand meant bending down with pound appliances to get through doorwaysLopreiato got started renting a small warehouse in  and had so little money that he lived in the office He had an evening gig at a law firm doing clerical work and waited tables on weekendsFor  years Lopreiato built the business by attending trade shows and networking with distributors and buyers He forged deals with companies ranging from UHaul and Home Depot NYSE HD to Ross Stores NASDAQ ROST and Canadian Tire Toronto Stock Exchange CTCACAHe was on QVC every two months or so starting in  selling more than  Forearm Forklifts per live show at the peak He started selling to Amazon as a vendor that same year but it was never a big part of his business representing under  percent of revenue in Lopreiato was fully prepared for competition knowing that patent protection only goes so far But he never expected a counterfeiting onslaughtThe slide started in  He got a call from an Amazon employee saying that other sellers were offering his product at a much lower price and he needed to cut his rate to keep the businessLopreiato investigated and quickly found the rival products were fakes He told Amazon that he would aggressively defend his intellectual property but that he couldnt compete with those prices and still make money Amazon was unhappy with that response and within weeks there were more than  knockoffs on the site Lopreiato saidSince that date its just been absolutely downhill he saidOver the past six years Lopreiato has seen vendor managers come and go without fixing the problem or notifying him that theyre leavingHe forwarded a number of emails from the past two years where he and Proops showed explicit infringement and asked for help In addition to jeopardizing Forearm Forklifts business Proops wrote in June  Sooner or later an Amazon customer is going to be seriously injured by one of these cheap knockoffsResponses ranged from terse to deflecting Amazon told Proops to send complaints to generic email addresses copyrightamazoncom and patentsamazoncom Other emails suggested that the company was looking into the matter but then the account would move to another representativeIn July  an Amazon lawyer told Proops by email that Forearm Forklift should take up infringement matters directly with the thirdparty sellers At this time we consider this matter closed and we will take no further action he wroteCJ Rosenbaum a lawyer who represents Amazon sellers said the rapid turnover in vendor managers and inconsistency in how they treat issues is a constant source of frustrationAmazons responses are very erratic said Rosenbaum who recently published the Amazon Law Library a book compiling the legal issues surrounding the company and platform You can send in one complaint through the system about an IP violation and they take down the listing and submit the same exact thing again and just failFor Lopreiato legal action presents an expensive option with little upside Individually going after infringers who hed first have to track down would require more time and money than hes got in the bank He filed one case in  against a domestic company and was awarded a settlement before trialTaking on Amazon directly has been a nonstarter for the three intellectual property lawyers Lopreiato has contactedMore than anything he needs Amazons help With

company ethos in a buttonEthan WolffMannSenior WriterYahoo FinanceMarch  ReblogShareTweetShareFor ages there was only a few ways to buy stuff You could go to a store or order from a catalog via phone mail or onlineIn the past few years Amazon AMZN in its position as a global juggernaut of retail has managed to singlehandedly wrench open new windows through which to buy thingsSo far two of the most interesting windows have been its Alexa system which allows ordering by voice and the Amazon Dash button Of the two theres little love for the Dash button It doesnt get Super Bowl ads and is generally relegated to order products that arent necessarily fun to shop for as one Amazon spokesperson put it to Yahoo FinanceBut the Dash button which launched in March  may be the best literal representation of the companys entire genius  it makes it possible to buy something with the push of one buttonThe true innovation was allowing someone to buy something with one click says Dean Seifert director Dash and Dash Replenishment Services at Amazon This is a physical representation of that same conceptLess and less frictionNo one is talking about the Dash button but people are using it to place orders in the millions A dash button order is placed four times a minute said Seifert who added that many customers have more than one if they have any Dash buttons also exist virtually on the Amazon website and mobile appThe stuff that people buy is the exact kind of stuff youd think they buy though theres more than  buttons worldwide Batteries soap laundry detergent are all amongst the top items that have a Dash button But the mostpressed Dash button of all time unexpectedly is Smartwater Bounty however led  according to SeifertAs mobile has become stronger and stronger   of traffic and  of sales were made by mobile devices according to Adobe Analytics  and Amazon Echos are popping up in more and more homes its likely that this is eating some of the Dash buttons lunch Were not trying to compete We just try to make sure the channels work well Seifert notedThe luster of the fullsend onetouch physical button ordering system Amazon pioneered might not shine as brightly as it once did with the myriad of new ordering options but it all appears to be part of Amazon D chessThe endgameSeifert is not just the head of Dash but the head of Dash Replenishment Services a part of Amazon thats endgame is even more dominating than that of a onetouch ordering system an integrated or even zerotouch systemThe virtual version of a Dash button thanks to the magic of APIs can easily be linked to the device it works with if theres a device The internet of things filled with smart fridges and coffee makers may not yet be the standard but should that be the future the Dash product and the automatic replenishment is the logical stepIn this system the milk is ordered automatically when the fridge says its low or it asks you depending on your preferences and the washer orders detergent when its low and so onAmazon isnt the only one betting on this Visa V for its part  and its a big portion of the payments landscape  has been looking at these types of internet of things payments as a part of the future recently telling CNBC you may end up with four five six eight places in your home where you could actually buy fromAmazon has already been making progress on this with new partners like Samsung and Whirlpool which could have a Dash function built into their appliances As a result it could become standard For many people however it would solve a problem that doesnt exist and would fail to give consumers a good reason to spend extra money on additional smart featuresBut for Amazon thats probably fine With Dash buttons Alexa subscriptions and more there are plenty

forecasts which reflect a weaker trajectory of sales starts and home prices the firm said in its note The revisions largely reflect the decline in affordability  which is likely to continue to deteriorate with further increases in rates  and a shift toward more negative perceptions regarding housingStory continuesA major economic story for some time has been the lack of affordable housing in the economyIn July Yahoo Finances Amanda Fung noted that the housing market had been losing significant momentum with the pace of existing home sales really starting to level off On Friday the September data on existing home sales indicated the pace of sales fell  from August to the lowest level since November A decades high mortgage rates are preventing consumers from making quick decisions on home purchases said Lawrence Yun chief economist at the National Association of Realtors All the while affordable home listings remain low continuing to spur underperforming sales activity across the countryAnd while the cost of housing is a story that continues to make itself felt the biggest economic shift this year has been higher interest rates The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates three times this year Investors expect the central bank to raise rates once more in December and up to four times in  even as the Fed forecasts a slowdown in economic growth as

for prospective home buyersPerhaps even more discouraging for those looking for a pickup in home sales  and the spending on things like furniture and home improvements  the gap between current sales prices and what folks think they can afford is very wideAccording to BAML respondents to the firms survey of more than  consumers respondents think they can afford to a home of  well below the median sale price of an existing home of  Millennials are perhaps not surprisingly the furthest away on the affordability scale indicating the ability to afford a  home against this  median priceWith home

developmentengineering legal accounting and administrative fieldsii Based on the homeownership rate in the fields Amazon is hiring for HotPads estimated how many renters the new headquarters would be expected to bring in each yeariii and how this influx of new renters would affect each metros supply of available rentalsAmong the US metros still vying for Amazons second headquarters Raleigh is one of the more affordable rental markets still in the running The median rent in Raleigh is  up about  percent over the past year Population wise Raleigh is the smallest metro still under consideration for HQ and typically has about  available rental units on the market each yearIf Amazon HQ went to Columbus rental supply would need to increase by  percent to keep rent growth steady which equates to building about  additional rental units a year Nashville would need to increase its supply of available rental units by  percent a year or  additional rental units The median rent in Columbus is  a month and the median rent in Nashville is  a monthAn influx of new residents will inevitably influence the rental market particularly in smaller markets like Raleigh and Columbus said Joshua Clark economist at HotPads Both Raleigh and Columbus have seen remarkable growth in recent years but if selected theyll have to undergo the most dramatic building boom to accommodate Amazon HQ and keep rent inflation at current levels However finding available land has been a recurring issue for both Amazon and housing developers in Seattle  so areas with more buildable space like Raleigh and Columbus may have an advantage when it comes to building for Amazons future No matter which city is chosen for HQ planning in advance will be critical as developers city officials and renters adapt to a new normal that includes a strong and evergrowing tech workforceAmong the US metros on Amazons shortlist the New York City metro would see the smallest impact on available rental inventory from HQ New

most lists of the worlds wealthiest people and his fortune currently hovers around  billion according to estimates by both Forbes and Bloomberg Virtually all of that is tied up in the nearly  million shares of Amazon stock currently worth about  billion that Bezos owns translating into a  percent stake in the Seattle company Bezos  also owns rocket ship maker Blue Origin and The Washington Post which he bought for  million in Because the pair were married before Amazon was founded its likely that MacKenzie Bezos a yearold novelist holds a large claim to that fortune though details hinge on where the couple files for divorce and if they had a prenuptial agreementKing County where their home is located confirmed on Twitter Wednesday that the Bezoses had not filed for divorce in court The couple own a home in a wealthy Seattle suburb within the county Jeff Bezos also bought a mansion in a swanky Washington DC neighborhood last year for  million The Bezoses have four childrenThe property acquired during the marriage is common property said Jennifer Payseno a family lawyer at the firm McKinley Irvin in Seattle That includes stock ownership although Amazon has not filed any regulatory documents to suggest Bezos stake in the company has changed Amazon didnt respond to inquiries about how the divorce may affect that stakeThe Bezoses will almost certainly settle the divorce outside of court if they havent already said Jacqueline Newman a Manhattan divorce lawyer and managing partner at Berkman Bottger Newman  RoddFor the most part theyre going to want to keep things private and quiet she said Especially in the case of a public company theyre not going to want information to leak because it could ultimately affect stock pricesAmazons stock edged up  Wednesday to close at  That left Amazon with a market value of  billion more than any other publicly traded company in the USThe amicable tenor of the Bezoses divorce announcement makes it highly likely that the couple already has reached an agreement on how to divide their assets Payseno saidJeff Bezos tremendous wealth has magnified the focus on him although his divorce seems unlikely to enthrall the public like highprofile breakups involving movie stars such as Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie Or even those of other billionaires such as Donald Trumps tabloidfodder split with his first wife Ivana in the early s long before he was elected presidentBut the Bezos divorce seems likely to attract more attention than when Google cofounder Sergey Brin  currently worth  billion  divorced his former wife Anne in Amazons origins trace back to a road trip that the Bezoses took together not long after they met in New York while working at hedge fund DE Shaw They got married just six months after they began dating according to BezosNot long after that Jeff Bezos quit his job at Shaw and started an online bookstore While his wife did the crosscountry driving Bezos wrote a business plan on the way to Seattle  chosen for its abundance of tech talent By July  Amazon was operating out of a garage with MacKenzie Bezos lending a hand according to a review she posted on Amazon in  panning The Everything Store a book about Bezos and the company written by Brad StoneI was there when he wrote the business plan and I worked with him and many others represented in the converted garage the basement warehouse closet the barbecuescented offices the Christmasrush distribution centers and the doordesk filled conference rooms in the early years of Amazons history she recalledStory continuesAmazon has since evolved from an upstart website selling books to an ecommerce goliath that sells virtually all imaginable merchandise and runs data centers that power many other digital services such as Netflix

Creates an Interesting Test Case for Amazoncom Inc StockVince MartinInvestorPlaceMay  ReblogShareTweetShareWhatever one thinks of Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN stock theres no question that the company still needs to grow into its valuation Thats going to require continued revenue growth  and margin expansion And that in turn makes the companys Amazon Fresh initiative an interesting glimpse into the future of AMZN stockThats because in many ways Amazon Fresh is a microcosm of the opportunities  and risks  facing Amazoncom The grocery homedelivery service needs to beat out competitors like Peapod and InstacartAmazon no doubt is losing money on its initial efforts with hopes of creating a profitable business somewhere down the line And longer term the core question is whether Amazon at some point can expand its margins  and its profits  before investors get anxiousInvestorPlace  Stock Market News Stock Advice  Trading TipsSuccess in Amazon Fresh doesnt necessarily make AMZN stock a buy But a failure here might raise some concerns about the rest of the companys potential in several key areasWhat Is Amazon FreshAmazon Fresh is the companys new grocery delivery service Like Peapod and Instacart the service allows for nextday and even sameday delivery albeit for now only in a few major areas Fresh requires a  per month fee on top of Amazon Prime membership and orders under  add on a  delivery fee   Unstoppable Stocks to Buy No Matter What  Whats interesting about the pricing is that unlike in many other categories Amazon isnt necessarily undercutting competitionPeapod for instance charges a fee per order but its just  per order with no membership charges A consumer would have to use Amazon Fresh at least twice a month for its fees to be lower The Instacart Express offering has a  annual fee which in turn generates free delivery for all orders over For now Amazons offerings are limited to mostly major metro areas And while Amazon hasnt broken out any numbers on the business in terms of sales it appears to be an exceedingly tiny part of the companys overall revenue  for now But for a number of reasons even this small effort is an interesting test case for Amazons broader strategyAmazon and CompetitionAmazon is behind in the space which traditionally hasnt served the company well The company has had huge success in online retail and in cloud services both areas where it was a first moverBut in hardware Amazons catchup efforts failed It still lags Netflix Inc NASDAQNFLX in video Its behind Spotify Technology SA NYSESPOT and Apple Inc NASDAQAAPL in musicFears of an Amazon entrance have cast shadows over stocks in pharmaceuticals health care and even photo prints But as I wrote last month theres some evidence that Amazons bark is much worse than its bite Traditionally the company has struggled to dislodge entrenched competition the recent rebound in shares of W W Grainger Inc NYSEGWW is an interesting exampleAnd given that bulls are expecting  revenue growth for years to come its going to need to prove that it can win in new areas not just threaten established operators If its scale and distribution cant drive it past two privately held smaller companies investors may begin to wonder if Amazon will be able to conquer territory held by larger more experienced operatorsThe Margin Question for AMZNJim Cramer made the point last week that No one is holding Amazon to a profit standard just a growth standard Ive long argued that Amazon stock cant be judged just on its skyhigh PEbecause investors need to understand that the company currently has depressed margins thanks to its myriad investments including FreshBut at some point Amazon is going to have to prove that it can actually start earning money And Amazon Fresh highlights two ways in which the company can do soFirst Fresh in theory should be a relatively simple expansion of its existing investments Amazon already has established a huge base of Prime users Its acquired Whole Foods Market Its built a distribution capability thats second to noneIt should be able to operate Amazon Fresh at a lower cost than anyone else whether thats Peapod and Instacart or Kroger Co NYSEKR and Walmart Inc NYSEWMTSecondly the company already is pushing its privatelabel products on Amazon Fresh Thats part of a broader strategy which also includes appareland which should in turn help Amazon marginsStory continuesThe third driver here is that Amazon Fresh fee income should be close to pure profit So is the recent price increase for Amazon Prime itself This is a company with  operating margins It only takes a few hundred basis points of improvement to double Amazons profits or more How Amazon Fresh rolls out could show how easy  or how difficult  that expansion will beIs AMZN Stock a BuyI still think Amazon has a clear path to a trillion valuation as I wrote back in November But Ill also admit that the recent run to almost  has undercut some of my longheld optimism toward AMZNFrom here AMZN looks attractive but perhaps not quite compelling Should the company post wins in Amazon Fresh and similar initiatives and those margins start rising theres an obvious path for the huge multiyear run in Amazoncom stock to continue  Amazon Rolls Out New Whole Foods Discount for Prime Members  But if investor confidence gets weakened at all at these levels there may be an

OilGoldSilverEURUSDReblogShareTweetShareAmazon Fresh vs Peapod Who won our grocery delivery battleAlyssa PryPersonal Finance Reporter Yahoo FinanceMarch  If youre looking to fill your fridge without the hassle online grocery delivery is stepping it up so you never have to step into a store We tested two popular online grocery delivery services Amazon Fresh and Peapod and compared cost convenience and service to see who came out on top Amazon Fresh is currently available in Seattle California New York and Philadelphia Currently you must be a Prime member to use Fresh and theres an additional monthly membership of  Peapod has a wider reachits available in  states and Washington DC Theres no membership fee though it does have optional membership programs through its PodPass program You pay a fee and receive free deliveries Otherwise delivery costs range from Orders and deliveryWhen it came to ordering Amazon has no delivery minimum compared to Peapod which had a  minimum Both offer a hour delivery window but Peapod had some discounted options depending on the day and time you place your order We placed our orders the day before at  pm and set a delivery window of  am The Amazon groceries arrived at  am and we were notified with a text from the driver directly Peapod experienced delays and didnt arrive until  am While we did receive text updates from customer service we couldnt reach our driver directly aWe were told the driver couldnt find our address so anytime we wanted an update on delivery time we had to go through customer service who would call the driver and then call us back So this round goes to Amazon for promptness and more direct communication When we got our groceries Amazon gave us coolers which get picked up with your next order The frozen items were packed with dry ice and ice packs in a separate cooler Peapod puts everything in regular plastic bags which means no ice packs Peapod customer service told us the groceries are kept in insulated coolers and packed with dryice on their delivery trucks and our frozen items were still wellfrozen on delivery Still Amazon takes another win in this round PriceWhen it came to the price of our groceries it was a tie for the two grocery giants Amazon Fresh was cheaper for produce meat and fish and dairy items A pack of avocados on Amazon was   less than Peapods price of  Their chicken was also a bargain buster at  per pound compared to  at Peapod But Peapod inched ahead it when it came to staples grains and frozen items A ounce container of olive oil was  compared to Amazons price of  Their brand of frozen peas was just  slightly cheaper than  at Amazon That spare change adds up We spent  at Peapod and  at Amazon Fresh They both had a  delivery fee though Peapod varies from  depending on the size of the delivery But Peapod offers coupons through the mail which often negate the cost of delivery Peapod snags a last round win for being more affordable overall with no monthly fee So who reigns supreme If you dont mind the extra fees or are already a Prime Member our moneys on Amazon But if youre looking at your bottom line Peapod is the better bargain and is available in

it less than  billion from the  trillion level Apple AAPL crossed for the first time  days earlier While Wall Street looks toward that milestone one technical analyst is betting on a sharp pullback

OilGoldSilverEURUSDAmazon Increases Some Workers Pay So Its BonusCutting MinimumWage Plan Wont Lower Their WagesGlenn FleishmanFortuneOctober  ReblogShareTweetShareAmazons recent move to raise the minimum wage of its directly employed and contracted workers to at least  an hour led to some employees calculating they would earn less with the elimination of bonuses and stock awards The company said today it plans to adjust wages and bonuses to ensure those workers dont receive lower wages as a resultSenator Bernie Sanders critical of large firms paying low wages praised Amazons initial announcement then questioned the company after reports indicated some workers would have lower annual incomeA company spokesperson told Fortune that all hourly employees will see an increase in their total compensation as a result of this announcement Amazon said it has worked site by site and person by person to adjust wagesFor warehouse workers at lower pay tiers in particular routine productivity bonuses that the company offered and which were increased around the holidays could add hundreds or thousands of dollars a year in income Amazon cut these bonuses as part of its rise in base pay but said the higher hourly rate would more than compensate for the difference Because its no longer incentivebased the compensation will be more immediate and predictable a spokesperson saidThe company also formerly issued warehouse workers restricted stock units RSUs which vest on their employment anniversary after which point employees own the shares and may retain or sell them Workers received  RSU for each anniversary and an additional one to mark five years with the company Existing grants that vest in  and  remain in place and those employees will receive the stock if they remain employees to those anniversaries while also receiving increased wagesIn lieu of stock Amazon will pay a cash bonus of  at five years and  at each subsequent fiveyear employment anniversary An Amazon share is worth nearly  on Oct  Warehouse workers making below  an hour currently will receive raises that amount between  and  more a year depending on location length of employment and positionIn a particularly apt remark given todays stock market decline especially among tech stocks Amazon said that while employees have benefited from a bull market and the unusually strong appreciation of Amazons stock price in recent years its not guaranteed to continue However Amazon will offer a direct stock purchase plan for employees starting in The Seattle Times and other outlets interviewing workers by name and anonymously have found that information about the anhour minimum wage and other wage and bonus changes have been unevenly communicated to

a Whole Foods flopMyles UdlandMarkets ReporterYahoo FinanceJune  ReblogShareTweetShareAmazon AMZNannounced Fridayit would buy Whole Foods WFM for  billionAnd while this news sent shares of potential grocery competitors lower and saw pundits and analysts proclaim this the beginning of a new era in American shopping its also possible this deal might not workWhich would probably be fine byAmazonRecall that it was just a short few years ago that Amazon made a big entry into the smartphone space with its Amazon Fire phone And it was an even shorter one year later that it bailed on its projectWe want to be a large company thats also an invention machine wrote Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in his  letter to shareholdersWe want to combine the extraordinary customerserving capabilities that are enabled by size with the speed of movement nimbleness and riskacceptance mentality normally associated with entrepreneurial startups Can we do it Im optimisticAmazon CEO Jeff BezosMoreBloomberg reported that it took a lot of convincing for Bezos to be comfortable with the deal which was far bigger than any acquisition Amazon has made in its historyMost decisions should probably be made with somewhere around  of the information you wish you had Bezos wrote in this years letter to Amazon shareholders Ultimately then Bezos took something like his own adviceIf you wait for  in most cases youre probably being slow Bezos wrote Plus either way you need to be good at quickly recognizing and correcting bad decisions If youre good at course correcting being wrong may be less costly than you think whereas being slow is going to be expensive for sureIn other words act boldly and decisively Acquiring a grocery store chain for almost  billion is most would agree a bold and decisive moveBut that it was an acquisition large in size need not mean it is one Amazon will be committed to if it does not further the companys goal to be earths most customer centric companyBecause while so much of the commentary around the deal has focused on what this deal might mean for consumers Stratecherys Ben Thompson arguedon Mondaythat Whole Foods did not get snapped up by Amazon as a selling platform but as a customer of Amazons servicesIn this sense then Amazons ability to leverage its logistical expertise to service Whole Foods better will be the marker of the deals success not an increase in samestore sales at Whole Foods locationsAnd with Amazons investor base clearly having been trained to give Bezos and his management team the benefit of the strategic doubt expect investors to be willing to look past a continuation of discouraging sales trends at Whole FoodsIt may still however turn out that Amazon which has tried to make a splashin the fresh food space with its AmazonFresh business cannot leverage Whole Foods resources as an answer to its efforts to break into food And if this is the case Amazon will probably be fine with itMyles Udland is a writer at Yahoo Finance

sentiment January  expected  previouslyI keep trying to figure out what the narrative isNobel Prizewinning economist Robert Shiller is perplexedI keep trying to figure out what the narrative for the stock market is Shiller told Yahoo Finances Jen Rogers in Davos this past week I think that economists have to be more expansive in this dimension They dont like to talk about narrativesFor Shiller the most likely story right now is that the current run were seeing in the stock market is a descendent of the  stock market which boomed under a probusiness president before the crash of  which ushered in the Great Depression And whether youre a stock market bull or bear no one likes to hear that a repeat of the  crash is right around the cornerBut Shillers probing for one big story to explain the market comes at a time when it does seems as if there are a few market themes most investors agree onRobert ShillerMoreFor one global economic growth is strong and likely to remain strong through the end of the decade as the IMF laid out this week Another is that the tax cuts passed by the Trump administration last year were not priced into the market This second idea is of course related to the first  strong growth will continuebecause taxes are now lower in the worlds largest economy And the market is only now accepting this relationshipStory continuesBut a third idea gaining traction is that whether its wage announcements due to lower taxes investor optimism on the rise orparticipation among retail investors surging everything happening in markets and the economy right now is late cycle behavior So everything is good right now but everyone also knows it wont last foreverThe current enthusiasm about markets and the economy then appears less an echo of the  market which saw proclamations of markets having reached a new permanently high plateau and more a reflection of an investor class that knows business cycles still exist Central bank actions after the financial crisis may have changed the length and shape of the current cycle but ultimately rising employment rising asset prices and rising leverage overheat an economy and the excesses are burned offWhat ends each economic cycle and what the negative impacts are from a cycles end are unique in each downturn But the story right now might be that for all of the optimism among consumers politicians business leaders and investors no one thinks there wont be another downturnMyles Udland is a writer at Yahoo Finance Follow him on TwitterMylesUdlandRead more from Myles hereOne candidate

startups get to the next levelMelody HahmJuly  ReblogShareTweetShareUnlimited Engineering launched a Kickstarter campaign that makes any skateboard an electric oneMoreKickstarter is a great way to crowdfund a startup But what happens once the campaign is over Enter Amazon AMZN which launched a new partnership that hopes to keep the momentum going even after a Kickstarter project meets or exceeds its funding goalAhead of the companys blowout quarter on Thursday Amazon announced a collaborationwith Kickstarter that now features more than  products hatched on the crowdfunding platform The new collaboration with Kickstarter is part of LaunchPad a oneyearold program that showcases products from startups Now products launched on Kickstarter will be available for purchase on Amazoncom In addition to being available on a standalone landing page the  products are listed on Amazoncom in their respective categories eg electronics wireless devices Those products range from Prynt  a case that turns your phone into a Polaroid camera  to Zivix a portable smart guitar The companies dont need to pay Amazon an extra fee the financial relationship is just like that between Amazon and any vendor on its site Amazon offers two selling plans to its vendors  the professional plan costs  per month plus peritem selling fees which vary by category and the individual plan costs sellers  per item sold plus additional fees The partnership is intended to be a mutually beneficial comarketing experience says Amazon PR manager Lori Richter Kickstarter takes companies up to a certain point she told Yahoo Finance And Amazon can help them get the product on a retail platform and really execute in a bigger wayKickstarters communications manager Justin Kazmark says the partnership helps startups keep up the success theyve accrued on Kickstarter Now they have a second home by landing on Amazon he says They are in a place with a huge global reach and the project can continue to be discovered One of the concerns with Kickstarter is that youre betting on a product that hasnt been created yet Even if youre promised a pair of shoes or a keyboard waffle iron by a certain date a manufacturing or shipping issue may delay when you actually receive the product from a company youve invested inWhen youre pledging to something on Kickstarter it really is just an idea Youre taking a chance on somebody And delays do occur but there is more success than anticipated Kazmark says Amazon requires that the  Kickstarter companies ensure that their products will be ready to ship before their product is made available on their Launchpad program according to Richter She says Amazon consults with  venture capital firms and startup accelerators to get a sense of the coolest new startups it would like to feature on its site Its a huge win for the startups because without paying additional cost they get to take advantage of Amazons fulfillment center All the entrepreneur needs to do is handle the manufacturing Amazon takes over to handle the customer service shipping and delivery This initiative is part of Amazons larger push to let consumers know it offers a bevy of products that arent ones youd necessarily search for The company often referred to as the everything store is frequently used by consumers who know exactly what they are looking for whether it be a TV or baby foodMike Burtov the founder of GeoOrbital a company that makes an electric bike wheel raised  million from  people during its day campaign on Kickstarter The company met its goal of  within  minutes of being online This puts GeoOrbital in the top  of all crowdfunding platforms in terms of capital raisedHe says  of the purchases were being shared organically by friends of the company but he needs to find a retail partner in order to get to the next level  sales The virality of Kickstarter is super important in order to get exposure but afterward we thought What happens next he says Amazon could be that next chapter Its an excellent thingMelody Hahm is a reporter at Yahoo Finance Read more fromherHere are the Prime Day deals Amazon didnt want you to seeMalcolm Gladwell sees one good

competition with Wal Mart de Mexico WALMEXMX to claim shoppers in a nascent ecommerce marketOnline shopping represents a fraction of total retail sales in Mexico but has grown swiftly putting Amazon and its rivals in a race to ramp up investments in logistics technology and product offeringsAmazon views food and drink sales as key to growth eyeing routine purchases to stock pantries as a way to generate other types of sales but has yet to dominate the categoryThe new items on its Mexico site which it launched in  span coffees teas liquors wines and beers as well as cooking ingredients nonperishable snacks and sweetsWere committed to offering our clients as many products as we can Fernando Ramirez Amazon Mexicos senior product manager said in a statementThe launch shows Amazons intent to claim more of Mexicans wallets said Gene Munster research head at Loup VenturesNonperishables are the first step to capturing food spending and likely indicate Amazons ambitions to increase

Launched Its HQ Hunt One Year Ago Today Heres Where the Search StandsGrace DobushFortuneSeptember  ReblogShareTweetShareWilly Wonka would be pleased One year ago today Jeff Bezos announced Amazons search for a second headquarters triggering a flood of publicity and a frenzy of interest from cities hoping to nab a golden ticket The  HQ applicants were narrowed down to  finalists back in JanuaryAmazon  amzn  promises to invest more than  billion in the city it chooses for its second headquarters and create  wellpaying jobs over the next decade Its effect on its current hometown of Seattle has been staggering The company employs more than  people there and claims each dollar it has invested in Seattle generated an additional  for the citys economyThe ecommerce giant has said it will make its final HQ decision by the end of this yearSo where does the search stand today As Amazon hovers around a  trillion market cap the list of candidate cities remains at  across the US plus Toronto CanadaGeekwire tried to divine the HQ location by analyzing Amazons recent job postings The Washington DC metro area had the most open positions this summer and three finalist cities are in that region the District of Columbia itself Northern Virginia and Montgomery County Md Online betting shops also say Northern Virginia is the most likely to win itA CNBC analysis found that Texas was the most attractive location with Dallas and Austin among the top  finalists An earlier analysis by ATTOM Data Solutions ranked Raleigh NC and Atlanta at the top of the list Atlanta was an early favorite and Wells Fargo Securities predicted Boston would be the frontrunnerCNN reports details about the economic climates of these cities as included in their proposals are attracting other investors as wellCities often woo corporations that are considering building in their region but its rare to see a company openly audition cities this way The candidate cities have been falling over themselves to offer the most attractive tax incentive packages but its difficult to tell what will make Bezos pick a city  and theres no telling how tax cuts might affect the chosen citys bottom lineWhile courting Amazon for its second headquarters seems like an obvious win experts warn of downsides such as increased traffic and inflated housing prices It feels like Willy Wonka and the

for nowDaniel RobertsSenior WriterYahoo FinanceJune  ReblogShareTweetShareApple AAPL this week unveiledits first smartspeaker HomePod Thedevice is aimed squarely at rival Amazon AMZN which released its Echo three years agoThe smart home speaker as a category appears to be takingoffGoogle jumped in with Google Home released six months agoMicrosoft MSFT is getting in with a Harman Kardon speaker called Invoke which it announced last month Each of these devices is also a showcase for each companys voice assistant technology HomePod is powered by Siri Echo runs on Alexa Google Home is powered by Google Assistant its very Google to avoid a cute human name Invoke will use Microsofts voice tech CortanaBut for the time being Amazon is miles ahead in this raceand not just because it was first out of the gateThe Amazon Echo portfolio of products is definitely the one to beat right now says Adam Wright research analyst at IDC Amazon has leapt ahead of the competition once again with the launch of its latest addition to the portfolioHe means the EchoShow coming onJune  which looks nothing like the rest of the Echos its a standing rectangle with a video touchscreen It more closely resembles a portable DVD player if you remember those relicsThe Echo Show has not gotten a ton of press attention but insiders are impressed with its inch color screen and its megapixel camera Adding a visual experience to the speaker Wright says affords Amazon a lead over Google for now Inside Higher Ed predicts the Echo Show will revolutionize higher educationAmazon currently controls more than  of the voiceenabled speaker business eMarketer estimatesLR Amazon Echo Google Home Apple HomePod images via Amazon AP Photo AppleMoreGoogle Home does offer an impressive conversational experience And itcould further this edge Wright says with the expected continued incorporation of Google Assistant with new features like handsfree phone calls and with other Google devices like Lens But Amazon was first to the space and is iterating so fast with Echo that its daunting to competeAnd now theres Apple Its speaker comes along three years after Amazons six months after Googles and is almost three times asexpensive  than either of those  and  respectively As Mizuho Securities wrote in a new research note after Apples Worldwide Developers Conference keynote on Monday HomePods pricing is at a premium to competing offerings Thats an understatement And HomePod isntjust competing with those but also with highend wireless speakers like Sonos and Jawbone JamboxIts unclear Wright says whether Apple cancompete well in this spaceIndeedtech media as well as some analysts have criticized Apple for its late entry accusing the company once known for its innovations as being acopycat now HomePod even looks a lot like Google HomeBut this race is in its early days The market for voiceactivated home assistant devices is still in its infancy Wright says Former Apple analyst Gene Munster now a partner atLoup Ventures told Fox Businessthe same on Monday Theyre about two years late but I would also point out that this market hasnt even startedAmazon and Google dont typically break out sales oftheir individual devices but Mizuho estimated that Amazon sold  million Echos last year and predicts Echo revenue could balloon to  billion by  RBC predicts  million units by If only  million units of smart home speakers have sold thats small potatoesMunster pointed outthat it takes  million units to really consider a categorymainstreamIn other words Apple has ample timeDaniel Roberts covers

some caveats to keep in mindFor one the feature isnt available on any packages that are being shipped through traditional carriers like UPS FedEX or the US Postal Service Instead youll only be able to track packages that are shipped entirely through Amazons own logistics chainAnd as noted above the feature launched last month and has been slowly making its way to people across the US Theres still a chance that you wont have access to the tracker yet and if youre living outside the US you wont have access to itAmazon shed little light on the rollout schedule and international availability in a statement to CNET which earlier reported on the feature Instead the company said that its Map Tracking feature is another delivery innovation that aims at improving convenience for our customersAmazon has unveiled a variety of new technologies to improve deliveries including options to have packages delivered in your home or even your car trunk And as it tries to build out its logistics network to

The Motley FoolMotley FoolJuly  ReblogShareTweetShareA report from The Information on Friday sent shares of networking hardware companies like Cisco Systems NASDAQ CSCO Juniper Networks and Arista Networks tumbling Amazoncom NASDAQ AMZN the ecommerce and cloud computing giant is reportedly toying with the idea of selling cheap whitebox networking switches to enterprise customersA gateway to AWSAmazon is already using whitebox switches inside its data centers according to The Informations sources Other large internet companies have taken that path as well including Facebookand Alphabets Google Google has gone even further designing its own custom chips for artificial intelligenceData cables plugged into hardwareMoreImage source Getty ImagesBut selling custom hardware to thirdparties is a new frontier Some customers are already reportedly testing Amazons switches with a launch planned within the next  months Amazons strategy will be focused on price with plans to undercut the switches from Cisco by  to Amazons switches will be unbranded and run opensource software Theyll have builtin connections to Amazon Web Services AWS enabling customers to more easily operate in a hybridcloud configuration where onpremise hardware is mixed with public cloud computing That could help make the process of moving to the cloud simpler and less painful for large enterprisesGiven the reported pricing Amazon probably wont make much money from selling the hardware itself Instead the switches could drive more business to AWS which is by far the most profitable part of AmazonSpeaking to The Information a Cisco spokeswoman downplayed the report Only Cisco offers an endtoend intentbased networking portfolio that delivers assurance industryleading security policybased automation and segmentation We look forward to continue leading the industry on innovation and helping our customers simplify and manage their networksShould Cisco be worriedOne thing to remember Cheap whitebox

and Google are already collaborating working on developing software that will connect data centers with Cisco hardware to Googles cloud services Cisco is also a partner for Azure Stack Microsofts hybrid cloud solutionAmazon certainly shouldnt be underestimated but selling enterprise hardware for use in onpremise data centers is a very different business than renting public cloud computing resources Swapping out hardware from Cisco or other providers isnt trivial  there are meaningful switching costs And AWS certainly isnt the only game in town when it comes to hybrid cloud Whether companies would want to lock themselves into AWS with Amazons switching hardware is an open questionAmazon may ultimately abandon this effort instead sticking with using the hardware in its own data centers Even with low prices winning market share will be a slog Cisco has revamped its business model in recent years moving to a subscription model with its latest Catalyst  line of switches Those products have proven popular and the fact that theyre bundled with subscription software may make it even more difficult for customers to move away from Cisco Cisco has increasingly become a seller of networking solutions and that makes its products and services even stickierStory continuesCisco has been under attack from cheap commodity hardware for years The companys dominance has so far held up

Microsoft back campaign against California privacy actMariella MoonEngadgetJune  ReblogShareTweetShareAmazon Microsoft and even Uber have joined Google and other tech titans inMoreAmazon Microsoft and even Uber have joined Google and other tech titans in actively opposing the California Consumer Privacy Act As The Verge saw in the states disclosure records the three giants contributed a significant amount of money to a campaign pushing back against the initiative Amazon and Microsoft donated  each while Uber pitched in a smallerbutstillnoteworthy donation worth  Google ATT Facebook and Verizon  four of the first corporations that backed the fight against the initiative  all plunked down  Facebook and Verizon eventually withdrew their support however with the former doing so after Mark Zuckerberg was hauled in front of Congress to answer questions about the Cambridge Analytica scandalThe California Consumer Privacy Act aims to give California residents the right to know what kind of data companies have on them and to tell those companies not to sell their personal info Tech companies believe that it could ruin the way they develop their products and do business A spokesperson for Amazon told The Verge for instance While we share the initiatives overarching goal of protecting consumer privacy we are concerned by unworkable requirements that would hinder our ability to innovate on behalf of our customersCommittee to Protect California Jobs spokesperson Steven Maviglio echoed that in a statement to Govtech He said that bill author Alastair Mactaggart didnt consider the workability of his proposal and that its nigh impossible for tech giants to comply with it Anyone who orders anything from Amazon can request where their information went and that can not only overwhelm a large company like Amazon but also smaller ones too the spokesperson explained Microsoft also released a statement that pretty much said the same thing We believe the California measure could have unintended consequences for both businesses and consumers and that there is a better way to give consumers the privacy rights they deserveSo far the Californians for Consumer Privacy Act has already collected  signatures Authorities have to be able to verify  signatures for the proposal to make it to the November ballot  well know for sure after the California Secretary of State announces the result on June th Even if it does make its way to the ballot the opposition now has a lot of money to spend on campaigns to fight its approval The Committee to Protect California Jobs

OilGoldSilverEURUSDAmazon is now selling home security services including installations and no monthly feesIngrid LundenTechCrunchApril  ReblogShareTweetShareAmazons made a slew of acquisitions in the area of smart home services and now its offering a product that brings them together under one roof  your roofAmazon has quietly launched a portal offering home security services  which include all the equipment you would need and inperson visits from Amazon consultants to advise and install the kit The packages are being sold in five price tiers at a flat fee  no monthly service contracts a significant disruption of how many home security services are sold todayThe least expensive  for Outdoor Base gives you an Echo Dot plus indoor and outdoor lighting designed to make it look like youre home The most expensive tier  for Smartest includes an alarm siren motion sensors safety sensors a camera and Echo Dot the lighting and a video doorbell  potentially rolling in previous security launches from the company like Amazon Key and Cloud Cam All include two visits from Amazon employees to consult you and help with the installationThe Last July it emerged that Amazon was quietly working on its own answer to Best Buys Geek Squad  offering repairs and installations of home WiFi smart home devices Alexa installations and other hardwarerelated servicesAmazon never appeared to confirm it at the time but that service now officially seems to be called Smart Home Services and it has expanded toWashington Oregon California Arizona Texas Nevada North Carolina Georgia Illinois New Jersey Washington DC and FloridaThe security offering we are describing here  which was initially flagged to us by a reader  falls under that general banner and it is being promoted at the top of the Smart Home Services homepageGiving consumers the option of a more fullservice security offering beyond selling alarms and other devices a la carte makes sense for a couple of reasonsThe first is that while there are some early adopters who might like the challenge of installing these services themselves there will be many middle and later adopters who will not be interested in facing that learning curve Amazon has positioned itself in the smart home security space as more than just a reseller of thirdparty devices  although it sells those too  with acquisitions of the smart doorbell startupRingand the smart camera and doorbell startup BlinkThe second is that most often home security systems are coupled with service installations it in your home that include maintenance contracts so if Amazon hopes to eat up some of that market it needs to offer something comparable to the marketIts an interesting development also of the companys wider strategy to move into selling services beyond physical products  one of Amazons various efforts to diversify its business by targeting different categories of commerce and different demographicsAnother foray into humanpowered services was its Thumbtackstyle competitor Amazon Home Services a marketplace it launched back in  for finding tradespeople and other freelance service providers like masseurs and language tutors Notably Amazon makes a big deal in its security pages of using Amazon employees to install its security systemsEarlier this month it also emerged that Amazon was stealing a march on Apple in smart homes specifically by inking deals with smart home builders who were opting for Amazon as their preferred supplier for consulting and installing such services for their home buyersA report in The Information noted that one such home builder Lennar was prioritizing Amazon in its recommendations while still working with Apple in part because of the former companys stronger efforts to integrate with more thirdparty products giving buyers a wider range of choicesRamping up into security services fits with this too Lennar as it happens is directly linked now on Amazons security homepage but to be clear the

popped  in morning trading the day after Christmas after the ecommerce powerhouse said that its customers made more purchases worldwide than ever before during the holiday season The question now is should investors consider buying Amazon stock on the dip as we move into Holiday Shopping Amazon posted recordbreaking sales during the vital holiday shopping period according to a company statement Wednesday The company sold millions of more Amazon devices which include the new Echo Dot and Fire TV Stick K compared to Overall Amazon shipped more than one billion items for free as part of its Prime membership offerings in the US alone Jeff Bezos firm also saw tens of millions of people start their free Amazon Prime trials and begin their paid membershipsAmazon stock jumped  to reach  a share in morning trading Wednesday Despite this surge AMZN stock still sat  below its week high of  a share Investors should note that other beatendown stocks including Facebook FB and Apple AAPL also surged as the larger market tries to rebound from a rough DecemberOverviewAmazon is coming off a Q that saw its revenue grow far slower than recent periods Third quarter sales climbed  to reach  billion which came in below Qs  surge and Qs  climb The question for investors is can they find new reasons to be excited about AmazonRight off the bat Amazon is projected to capture approximately  of the total US ecommerce market in  up from  last year This should help the ecommerce giant remain strong compared to Target TGT Walmart WMT and Costco COST Meanwhile Amazon grabbed  of the cloud infrastructure services market last quarter which helped it come in well above secondplace Microsofts MSFT roughly  as well as IBM IBM Google GOOGL and Alibaba BABAOutlook Looking ahead our current

skyrocket  to reach  per share AMZNs fullyear earnings are also expected to soar  Plus fiscal s EPS figure is projected to come in  higher than our  estimate It is also worth noting that Amazons positive earnings estimate revision activity helps it earn a Zacks Rank  Buy at the momentBottom Line Amazons days of insane topline growth might be overfor now at least But the firm has some newer businesses that look poised to help it continue to expandOne with some serious potential is Amazons digital advertising segment The company is set to move into thirdplace this year behind only Google and Facebook Amazon will continue to grow its ad business as more consumers begin their product searches across its website and app Plus Amazon has jumped deeper into the pharmaceutical industry with its PillPack purchase which should help it challenge CVS CVS and Walgreens Boots WBAAmazon is also ready to expand its Prime Video offerings to help it stand out against Netflix NFLX and soon enough

expectationsThe Seattle tech giant reported earnings of  per share on  billion in revenues for the quarter Wall Street analysts were generally expecting  per share on revenues of  billion In the same quarter last year earnings were  per share on  billion in revenuecaThe stock surged over  in afterhours tradingAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos pointed to Amazon Web Services or AWS as one of the companys ongoing key revenue drivers The rapidly evolving service remains one of the most widely used goto cloud computing services for over  million businesses and organizations including McDonalds MCD Netflix NFLX Spotify SPOT and UnderArmour UAA AWS had the unusual advantage of a sevenyear head start before facing likeminded competition and the team has never slowed down Bezos said in the earnings release published on Thursday  As a result the AWS services are by far the most evolved and most functionalityrich AWS lets developers do more and be nimbler and it continues to get even better every day Thats why youre seeing this remarkable acceleration in AWS growth now for two quarters in a row A huge thank you to all our AWS customers and you can be sure well keep working hard for you One of the biggest bit of news Amazon dropped on Thursday Itss raising the price on its popular Amazon Prime program from  a year to  a year effective May  Previously the company announced Prime had over  million subscribersThe last several months have been busy for Amazon In late March and early April President Trump criticized Amazon via Twitter and said Amazons agreements with the US Postal Service are not a level playing field and that Amazon is putting many thousands of retailers out of business Amazon stock temporarily took a hit in the immediate wake of President Trumps unfavorable tweets but has since recoveredPresident Trumps current antiAmazon stance could affect AWS odds of landing an exclusive year multibilliondollar contract its competing for  alongside Alphabet GOOG GOOGL and Microsoft MSFT that would modernize the US Department of Defenses information technology systemIn an interview with Yahoo Finance this month Amazon CTO Werner Vogels declined to offer an update on the process other than to suggest that the company remained unfazed by Trumps attacks Regardless Amazons chances of scoring the government contract are pretty good given the company already hosts classified systems with the CIA as well as other top defense contractors like Lockheed MartinAmazon executives have also been preoccupied in recent months with its ongoing search for a second US headquarters dubbed HQ Since Amazon announced last year it planned on opening a new  billion headquarters outside of Seattle the company has narrowed its search down from  US cities and towns to  finalists with news outlets speculating Washington DC and Boston could have the edge based on those markets local talent pool Amazons significant presence in those areas not to mention the fact Amazon

Compares to These  Leading MembershipBased BusinessesEvan Niu CFA The Motley FoolMotley FoolApril  ReblogShareTweetShareEcommerce juggernaut AmazoncomNASDAQ AMZN dropped a bombshell disclosure last night It now has over  million Prime members Thats a massive global member base of customers that pay Amazon for the privilege of shopping on the site enjoying a growing collection of benefits most notably free twoday shipping While its hard to figure out exactly how much revenue Amazon is bringing in from Prime membership fees since members are located all around the world and pay varying fees based on geography its clear that Prime is one of the most successful membership programs everFor context heres how Prime compares to other membershipbased businesses including some subscription businesses that may not technically refer to customers as membersAmazon warehouse showing huge racks full of different productsMoreWhat cant you buy with Amazon Prime Image source AmazonCostco  millionThe wholesale warehouse chain is the most relevant comparison as CostcoNASDAQ COST operates a global network of retail locations that similarly sells everything under the sun at aggressive price points At the end of the last quarter Costco had a totalof  million cardholders that it counts as membersCostcos model has long been to sell products at modest markups just enough to cover its operating expenses If you were to ignore membership fees Costco would have made just  million in operating income last quarter or just a meager  operating margin In other words the  million that the company collected in membership fees during the quarter comprised nearly  of reported operating income which is why Costco is so focused on member satisfactionIts worth noting that Costco only has  million paid memberships as families with multiple shoppers are able to share memberships within the household Membership fees range from  per year to  per yearNetflix  millionWhile it operates in a completely different industry online video streamer Netflix NASDAQ NFLX also refers to its paid subscribers as members At last count the company had  milliontotal memberships making it relatively comparable to Amazon Prime Netflix acquires members with a free trial of which there are about  million The remaining  million memberships are paid Investors cheered last quarter when Netflix crushed its own subscriber targets againThe majority of Netflixs member base is concentrated within the US which accounts for  million total memberships  million paid memberships Netflix continues to aggressively expand internationally which will require a lot of localized original content and marketingSpotify  millionSpeaking of streaming content Spotify TechnologyNYSE SPOT went public last month Ahead of the direct listing the company estimatedthat it had  million to  million premium subscribers at the end of the first quarter or  million at the midpoint Technically the Swedish music streamer doesnt refer to paying customers as members but rather premium subscribersSpotifys total monthly active user MAU base is  million to  million topping Prime but free users are under no obligation or ongoing need to continue using the service unlike a shared Costco membership for example everyone needs groceries Still Spotify is the dominant musicstreaming platform by a significant margin enjoying roughly twice as many paid subscribers as its next closest rivalMembership and subscriptionbased businesses are the way to go these days More From The Motley Fool    Growth Stocks at DeepValue Prices

inMailFinanceWatchlistsMy PortfolioScreenersMarketsIndustriesVideosNewsPersonal FinanceTechUS Markets closedSP Dow NasdaqRussell Crude OilGoldSilverEURUSDAmazon Prime Day  How to get the best tech dealsDaniel HowleyTechnology Editor Yahoo FinanceJuly  ReblogShareTweetShareAmazon Prime Day  kicks off July  Prepare your bank accountMorePrime Day  is upon us And that means if youre an Amazon AMZN Prime member someone who likes a good deal or simply have a pulse youre going to spend an inappropriate amount of time browsing the site for some incredible deals beginning July  Naturally you can expect plenty of tech deals this year But before you click Add to Cart or get fired for gross negligence for spending the entire hour sale shopping rather than you know working brush up on the best tips for buying everything from smartphones and laptops to TVs and smart home gadgetsWhatever you decide to buy weve got you coveredWhat to look for in a new TVIf youre hoping to score a sick new TV during Prime Day and chances are there will be at least one there are a few important thoughts to keep in mind The first is size My rule is always go big or go home Just dont go too big or it wont fit in your roomThe point is you want to find a television thats the right size for your home Check out the size of the TV on sale during Prime Day then measure the space you want to place it to make sure itll fit And remember youre definitely not going to be able to make your friends jealous with a new TV thats smallA Sony TV that was on sale during last years Prime DayMoreIf youre buying that sweet new television to upgrade from your current p set youll want to purchase a K model K TVs have a higher resolution than p panels creating a sharper image Its worth noting though that youll only really see a difference in sharpness on TVs that are  inches or larger A inch K TV is pretty much pointlessIts also worth checking to see if your new TV offers highdynamic range HDR compatibility HDR increases the contrast ratio of the image on the screen making for a wider array of colors as well as deeper blacks and brighter whites Chances are if youre buying a TV that offers HDR capability itll also be K Youll also want to make sure that the TV youre buying is compatible with HDR and Dolby Vision two of the more popular HDR formatsA TCL TV from Prime Day MoreFinally if youre buying a new TV make sure it has enough HDMI ports for all of the devices you want to connect Sure you can always get an HDMI splitter but those dont necessarily work with every device you useWhat to look for in a new smartphonePast Prime Days have included sales on smartphones which means well likely see the same this year But when youre buying a smartphone online there are a few important options to considerFirst things first Make sure the handset youre buying is compatible with the network you use For instance if you see a deal on a Huawei or ZTE smartphone you might not be able to use it in the US if youre a Verizon or ATT customer because of the handsets antennas Not every phone uses the same bands needed to be compatible on US networks especially if theyre from overseas companiesIf youre interested in buying a smartphone during Prime Day make sure it works with your carrierMoreStory continuesYoull also want to look at how much storage the smartphone offers If you tend to keep all your photos music movies shows and documents saved on your phone rather than in the cloud youll need a handset with a good amount of storage space Id recommend going with a phone with GB of storage just to make sure you have plenty to spare in the future If youre a serious storage hog then opt for a handset with  GB You can also check out smartphones with microSD card slots to add your own amount of storageFinally make sure that the phone youre buying is the right size for you Some people prefer smaller handsets others love pocketbusting behemoths Just be sure to note the size and make sure the one you buy fits your needs What to look for in a computerShould you find a sweet sweet laptop for sale during Prime Day dont pull the trigger before you check out exactly what youre getting If youre the kind of person who wants the best of the best when it comes to your tech youll definitely want to look at the kind of processor graphics chip and RAM comes packed into the machine youre checking outHoping for a laptop this Prime Day Youll need to make sure it offers the kind of specs for your needsMoreYoure not going to want to buy a slick new laptop that has a twoyear old processor and graphics chip that cant handle the best games on the market Do your research and make sure youre getting a system with a CPU thats from this or last yearIf youre going to be doing some serious multitasking on your computer youll want to get a machine with at least GB of RAM Last year Amazon was selling some completely insane gaming laptops so buckle up because this year could be even betterSmart home devicesGot a smart speaker at home and want to grow your tiny electronic outpost into a fully connected digital empire Then Prime Day might be the best way to get started Importantly youll have to make sure that whatever connected device you buy works with your particular systemThe vast majority of smart home devices work with Amazons Alexa the most popular system available Up next is Googles Home followed by Apples AAPL HomeKit If you want to set up an Applecentric smart home system youll have to make sure that your devices are compatible with HomeKitThe Amazon Echo dotMoreGot an Echo in the house Then you can buy pretty much any device itll likely work without issue More of a Google GOOG GOOGL fan Youll also find what youre looking for But if youre an Apple person getting the smart home device you want could be more difficult since there arent as many on the market All that being said just be sure that the device youd like to buy actually works with the smart home assistant youre usingNow grab your credit cards check your bank account and get ready to drop some cash on what should be some solid tech deals Or just browse aimlessly until you stumble on a price cut for bulk underwear purchases At least thats what Ill be doingIllo by David FosterMoreRead more about Prime DayAmazon Prime Day  tech shopping guideYour superquick guide to Amazon Prime

LangoInvestorPlaceJuly  ReblogShareTweetShareAmazons NASDAQAMZN annual Prime Day has become an icon in the retail worldA few years ago Prime Day wasnt even a thing Now it is one of the biggest shopping events in the world Its such a large shopping event and it has grown so quickly that Prime Day has some significant investment implicationsFirst off investors want to judge whether or not Prime Day performed well relative to expectations to see whether Amazon remains an ecommerce juggernaut Secondly investors also want to see what sold well on Prime Day to glean insights as to where consumer demand is strongestInvestorPlace  Stock Market News Stock Advice  Trading Tips   Alternative Internet of Things Stocks to Buy  With that in mind heres a list of three winners and one loser from this years Amazon Prime DayAmazon Prime Day Winner Amazon AMZNSource AmazonPerhaps it goes without saying but the biggest winner from Prime Day is the events host AmazonDespite website glitches and worker strikes thirdparty data and Amazon statements have come together to paint a picture that Prime Day was a huge success for Amazon According to algocommerce company feedvisor total sales in the first  hours of Prime Day were up  versus an  gain in the prior year Google Tends shows a huge spike in search interest to alltime highs for both Amazoncom and Prime DayMeanwhile Amazon said in a press release that more than  million products were purchased worldwide during Prime Day They also said that the best selling products of those  million were Amazon products likeFire TV Stick andEcho DotThus not only did Prime Day generate a ton of sales through Amazons ecommerce platform but it also helped Amazon sell a ton of its own products That is a double win for Amazon and it comes despite noise in the background from website glitches and worker strikesWhat does all this mean The Amazon ecommerce powerhouse remains as strong as important and as irreplaceable as everAmazon Prime Day Winner Royal Philips PHGSource ShutterstockIn the world of smart devices everything is going smart We arent just talking smartphones and smartwatches but also smart appliancesThe smart appliance market is admittedly limited in scope at the present moment But there are pockets of it that are booming and one of those pockets that is booming is the smart lighting categorySmart lights have been a consumer favorite for some time now This popularity continued on Prime DayPhilips Hue smart lights and related appliances made by RoyalPhilips NYSEPHG were a top seller on Prime Day across multiple countries including the United Kingdom Netherlands Belgium and Australia Also PHGs smart toothbrush was the top topselling item on Prime Day in ChinaWhat does all this mean Clearly PHG is at the forefront of the smart appliance trend In many respects that makes PHG stock an Internet of Things IoT stock with huge growth drivers on the horizon   Cybersecurity Funds for Growth Investors  Indeed PHGs growth strategy is all about the connected health market and consequently results have been quite good for the past several years That is why PHG stock has nearly doubled over the past two years Further gains seem possible considering the huge tailwinds in connected health and smart appliancesAmazon Prime Day Winner Sony SNEStory continuesSource Dalvenjah via FlickrThe PlayStation gaming console made by Sony NYSESNE had a strong showing on Prime DayPlayStation gaming consoles games and related accessories and memberships were topsellers on Prime Day across multiple countries including Germany France and Australia In Australia PlayStation made a particularly strong showing with the top two selling items a PlayStation  gaming console and the FIFA  game for PlayStation What does all this mean Sony isnt purely a gaming company But gamesare a big part of what the company does This business has been doing well thanks to growing demand for nextgen video game consoles as well as the explosion in eSports and the huge digital shift in the video game industry With augmented and virtual reality catalysts right around the corner this business also promises to keep doing well over the next several yearsA strong PlayStation showing on Prime Day simply bolsters the bull thesis on Sonys gaming growth prospects As such it looks fairly certain that Sony experiences strong growth in gaming over the next several quarters and years and that this growth helps power SNE stock higherAmazon Prime Day Loser Newell Brands NWLThe biggest loser from Amazon Prime day is Newell Brands NYSENWL the company behind the once megapopular CrockPotThe CrockPot has been on its way out for a few quarters now The new fad centers around multipurpose cookers like the Instant Pot which are widely viewed as more versatile and less dangerous Indeed over the past several quarters as Instant Pot has stolen market share from CrockPot NWL has reported sluggish sales growth and even reported negative core sales growth in the past two quartersPrime Day suggests there is more pain ahead for NWL stockThe Instant Pot which was the topselling Prime Day item in the US and Canada in  was again the topselling Prime Day item in the US and Canada in  Considering the US and Canada are presumably two of Amazons biggest markets Instant Pot nabbing the topselling spot means that a lot of Instant Pots were sold through Amazon on Prime Day   Strong Earnings Stocks to Buy PostNetflix Plunge  What does all this mean The CrockPot continues to lose popularity and that will continue to show up in NWLs numbers Bad numbers usually lead to a weak stock so I think there is more weakness ahead for NWL stockAs of this writing Luke Lango was long AMZN and PHG Compare Brokers The post Amazon Prime Day

upgrade to the annual plan Of course Amazon would prefer customers on the annual plan because Prime members tend to spend more on Amazon and it can foster longterm relationships with those customers

number theyd need to know the mix of monthly subscribers vs annual subscribers as well since the change only affects the former groupThe value is still therePrime offers such incredible value that its extremely unlikely that the price increase will cause any type of mass customer exodus Its comparable to Costco memberships or Netflix subscriptions  both of which also receive price increases every

this file photo taken November   REUTERSRalph D FresoFilesMoreBy Phil Wahba and Deepa SeetharamanReuters  Amazoncom Inc plans to hike the annual fee for its popular Prime service by  percent to  starting next week a move announced on Thursday that risks losing customers for a feature that has helped drive its businessThe increase comes about six weeks after Amazon warned that it may raise prices by as much as  to offset rising fuel and shipping costs Prime which offers unlimited twoday shipping among other perks had cost  since its introduction in Later on Thursday Amazon rival ShopRunner offered a free oneyear membership to its own ayear service to disgruntled Prime users who have not renewed their subscription at the higher rate ShopRunner partners with brickandmortar retailers like Nieman Marcus and offers unlimited twoday shippingThe  hike for Prime is unlikely to spur users to drop the service en masse analysts said But it may temper Amazons ability to attract new customers to Prime seen as instrumental to boosting purchases of goods and digital mediaWe wonder if a meaningful price increase would dissuade some onthefence potential Amazon Primers from ponying up for the membership RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said in a research noteThe move comes as Amazon faces mounting pressure to show sustained bottomline growth following years of rapid revenue expansion at the cost of profits In  Amazons shipping costs grew almost  percent to  billion as its sales grewThe increase in Primes fee could add about half a billion dollars to Amazons annual operating income according to some analyst estimatesIf you consider things like inflation and fuel costs a Prime membership valued at  in  would be worth more than  today Amazon spokeswoman Julie Law said She declined to say how the company calculated the figurePrime customers get a limited selection of book downloads as well as film and television streams as part of the service which has helped expand Amazons presence on mobile devicesThere are about  million Prime members in the United States and they spend at least twice as much as nonPrime members in a given year according to some analyst estimatesOne analyst said the hike was expected and consumers would get accustomed to paying moreBased on our surveys of consumers key reasons to shop on Amazon and online more generally include convenience selection and price comparisons RW Baird analyst Colin Sebastian wrote in a research note Prime helps to amplify the first two driversBut others said consumers tended to strongly resist online fee hikes such as when Netflix Inc tried in  to raise its annual subscription fee by what it called the price of a latte It backtracked after a customer revoltSome Prime members bristled at the increase in Prime saying it was unfair to Prime users who spend more than nonusersIm going to cancel My thought is that the price should be going down Prime customers order more from Amazon

secret AI recruiting tool that showed bias against womenReutersOctober  ReblogShareTweetShareRepeats for additional clients with no changes to text By Jeffrey Dastin SAN FRANCISCO Oct  Reuters  Amazoncom Incs machinelearning specialists uncovered a big problem their new recruiting engine did not like womenThe team had been building computer programs since  to review job applicants resumes with the aim of mechanizing the search for top talent five people familiar with the effort told ReutersAutomation has been key to Amazons ecommerce dominance be it inside warehouses or driving pricing decisions The companys experimental hiring tool used artificial intelligence to give job candidates scores ranging from one to five stars  much like shoppers rate products on Amazon some of the people saidEveryone wanted this holy grail one of the people said They literally wanted it to be an engine where Im going to give you  resumes it will spit out the top five and well hire those But by  the company realized its new system was not rating candidates for software developer jobs and other technical posts in a genderneutral wayThat is because Amazons computer models were trained to vet applicants by observing patterns in resumes submitted to the company over a year period Most came from men a reflection of male dominance across the tech industry For a graphic on gender breakdowns in tech see httpstmsnrtrsOfPWoD In effect Amazons system taught itself that male candidates were preferable It penalized resumes that included the word womens as in womens chess club captain And it downgraded graduates of two allwomens colleges according to people familiar with the matter They did not specify the names of the schoolsAmazon edited the programs to make them neutral to these particular terms But that was no guarantee that the machines would not devise other ways of sorting candidates that could prove discriminatory the people saidThe Seattle company ultimately disbanded the team by the start of last year because executives lost hope for the project according to the people who spoke on condition of anonymity Amazons recruiters looked at the recommendations generated by the tool when searching for new hires but never relied solely on those rankings they saidAmazon declined to comment on the recruiting engine or its challenges but the company says it is committed to workplace diversity and equalityThe companys experiment which Reuters is first to report offers a case study in the limitations of machine learning It also serves as a lesson to the growing list of large companies including Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc that are looking to automate portions of the hiring processSome  percent of US human resources managers said artificial intelligence or AI would be a regular part of their work within the next five years according to a  survey by talent software firm CareerBuilderEmployers have long dreamed of harnessing technology to widen the hiring net and reduce reliance on subjective opinions of human recruiters But computer scientists such as Nihar Shah who teaches machine learning at Carnegie Mellon University say there is still much work to doHow to ensure that the algorithm is fair how to make sure the algorithm is really interpretable and explainable  thats still quite far off he saidMASCULINE LANGUAGE Amazons experiment began at a pivotal moment for the worlds largest online retailer Machine learning was gaining traction in the technology world thanks to a surge in lowcost computing power And Amazons Human Resources department was about to embark on a hiring spree Since June  the companys global headcount has more than tripled to  workers regulatory filings showSo it set up a team in Amazons Edinburgh engineering hub that grew to around a dozen people Their goal was to develop AI that could rapidly crawl the web and spot candidates worth recruiting the people familiar with the matter saidThe group created  computer models focused on specific job functions and locations They taught each to recognize some  terms that showed up on past candidates resumes The algorithms learned to assign little significance to skills that were common across IT applicants such as the ability to write various computer codes the people saidStory continuesInstead the technology favored candidates who described themselves using verbs more commonly found on male engineers resumes such as executed and captured one person saidGender bias was not the only issue Problems with the data that underpinned the models judgments meant that unqualified candidates were often recommended for all manner of jobs the people said With the technology returning results almost at random Amazon shut down the project they saidTHE PROBLEM OR THE CURE Other companies are forging ahead underscoring the eagerness of employers to harness AI for hiringKevin Parker chief executive of HireVue a startup near Salt Lake City said automation is helping firms look beyond the same recruiting networks upon which they have long relied His firm analyzes candidates speech and facial expressions in video interviews to reduce reliance on resumesYou werent going back to the same old places you werent going back to just Ivy League schools Parker said His companys customers include Unilever PLC and HiltonGoldman Sachs has created its own resume analysis tool that tries to match candidates with the division where they would be the best fit the company saidMicrosoft Corps LinkedIn the worlds largest professional network has gone further It offers employers algorithmic rankings of candidates based on their fit for job postings on its siteStill John Jersin vice president of LinkedIn Talent Solutions said the service is not a replacement for traditional recruitersI certainly would not trust any AI system today to make a hiring decision on its own he said The technology is just not ready yet Some activists say they are concerned about transparency in AI The American Civil Liberties Union is currently challenging a law that allows criminal prosecution of researchers and journalists who test hiring websites algorithms for discriminationWe are increasingly focusing on algorithmic fairness as an issue said Rachel Goodman a staff attorney with the Racial Justice Program at the ACLUStill Goodman and other critics of AI acknowledged it could be exceedingly difficult to sue an employer over automated hiring Job candidates might never know it was being usedAs for Amazon the company managed to salvage some of what it learned from its failed AI experiment It now uses a muchwatered down version of the recruiting engine to help with some rudimentary chores including culling duplicate candidate profiles from databases one of the people familiar with the project saidAnother said a new team in Edinburgh has been formed to give automated employment screening another try this

noticed over a dozen missed phone calls and messages alerting him that his books had been pulled from the Kindle store and that his ability to publish through KDP was suspended It was the worst week of my life Cipriano said We spent the entire vacation in the hotel worried if I was ever going to make another penny again and worrying about how I was going to pay off all of the expenses for

people who abuse the systemSince it launched in  the Kindle Direct Publishing platform has become a behemoth in selfpublishing cementing itself as one of the largest marketplaces for authors looking to independently publish their work In the years since thousands of authors have flooded KDP with books across many genres from fictionand romance to business and investing The KDP platform has become successful enough such that Amazon in addition to having its own book publishing imprints like  North and Grand Harbor Press offers a slew of tools aimed at helping aspiring independent authors get

experienceCancelSign inMailFinanceWatchlistsMy PortfolioScreenersMarketsIndustriesVideosNewsPersonal FinanceTechUS Markets closedSP Dow NasdaqRussell Crude OilGoldSilverEURUSDAmazon is selling facial recognition tech to law enforcementJon FingasEngadgetMay  ReblogShareTweetShareIf youre nervous about the privacy implications of Amazons camera technology there might be a good reason for it The ACLU and a coalition of civil rights groups are calling on Amazon chief Jeff Bezos to stop offering Rekognition facial detection system to government customers after learning that the company is actively helping law enforcement implement the potentially invasive technology Police in multiple regions have partnered with Amazon on surveillance projects including an Orlando proofofconcept that lets Amazon search for people of interest through city cameras as well a Washington County Oregon initiative that lets officers scan people to see if they turn up in a mugshot databaseThe ACLU also learned that Amazon provided Washington County a roadmap under a nondisclosure agreement and offered to link the county to other government customers interested in Rekognition such as a body camera manufacturer Thats particularly problematic when facial recognition on body cameras is illegal in Oregon Amazon deleted mentions of body cams from its site after the ACLU raised the issueThe concern as you might guess is that law enforcement and governments could easily use this for all the wrong reasons Rekognition is powerful enough to track faces in crowded scenes and could theoretically be used to locate activists and dissidents New York police for instance have already been caught filming protesters as an intimidation tactic  Rekognition could automate that process by flagging people who routinely show up at protests no matter how innocent they are The ACLU also warns of immigration officials abusing this to track newcomers legal and otherwise while cities could routinely surveil residents regardless of their crimesIn a statement Amazon didnt directly address the civil rights complaints It said that it would suspend access to Amazon Web Servicesbased features like Rekognition if a customer abused them and pointed to positive uses such as finding lost children or identifying guests at the recent royal wedding in the UKIts not certain if Amazon will formally address the objections However the outcry highlights some of the problems with the adoption of this surveillance technology companies are shopping it around to governments and police with no real public input and little consideration for privacy violations and other abuses The ACLU and other organizations are clearly concerned that tech giants like Amazon focus on profit while neglecting the social impact of their productsACLU AmazonThis article originally appeared on EngadgetReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is emptyWhat to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its FirstQuarter

the online grocery wars survey findsHeidi ChungReporterYahoo FinanceDecember  ReblogShareTweetShareThe online grocery wars are hot and Amazon AMZN is still on fire according to a survey by RBC Capital

demonstrably leading position amongst online grocery channels RBC saidRBCs fourth annual grocery ecommerce survey collected responses from  people aged  and over whom identified themselves as the primary decision maker for groceries in their respective householdsEcommerce behemoth Amazon took the top spot as the most frequently used site for online grocery shopping however the survey found that other platforms have started to steal market share in the space Walmartowned Jetcom Click  Collect and Instacart are now solid competitors in the online grocery warsAccording to the survey while online grocery shopping has gained significant momentum conventional grocery shopping still remains the most frequent grocery channel Walmart WMT Supercenters came in second and clubswarehouses such

shopping in general price came in at the top with  saying that it was the leading decision driver While location was the second most important driver the number decreased from  in  to  in  RBC

percent of respondents said they purchased groceries online in  and  said that they purchased groceries online through Amazon Last year  of online grocery shoppers turned to Amazon but that number

Amazon Stock Has Taken the Market Cap Crown and It Isnt Giving It BackYahooSearchNo matching results for Tip Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsGive feedback on the new search experienceCancelSign inMailFinanceWatchlistsMy PortfolioScreenersMarketsIndustriesVideosNewsPersonal FinanceTechUS Markets closedSP Dow NasdaqRussell Crude OilGoldSilverEURUSDAmazon Stock Has Taken the Market Cap Crown and It Isnt Giving It BackLuke LangoInvestorPlaceJanuary  ReblogShareTweetShareAmid recent stock market volatility the market cap crown has changed hands a few times Long time market cap king Apple NASDAQAAPL ceded the crown to long time runner up Microsoft NASDAQMSFT after announcing weak third quarter numbers Then Microsoft stock started to drop Meanwhile the third horse in this race Amazon NASDAQAMZN started to regain lost ground Amazon stock became number one before too longThose trends persisted in early  Now AMZN has officially taken the market cap crown That marks the second market cap crown exchange in roughly just as many monthsThe buck stops here There will be no more market cap exchanges in the foreseeable future Amazon stock is the ideal combination of big innovative disruptive and rapidly growing which warrant it wearing the market cap crownInvestorPlace  Stock Market News Stock Advice  Trading Tips   Stocks You Can Set and Forget Even In This Market  Microsoft is just big and innovative There isnt enough disruption or growth there Apple is just big Innovation disruption and growth are all lacking Alphabet NASDAQGOOG is big and innovative But growth and disruption lag AmazonThere also isnt any other contestant The next largest company after the aforementioned Big Four is Berkshire Hathaway NYSEBRKA at under  billionIn other words Amazon stock has taken the market cap crown and its not giving it up any time soonWhy Amazon Deserves the Market Cap CrownIf you were to talk about the largest publicly traded companies with individuals who dont follow the stock market the Big Four of Amazon Apple Microsoft and Google would make sense to pretty much everyone These are all companies that touch consumers and enterprises on a daily basis and which have widely recognized and valuable brandsBut Amazon stands out from the pack in terms of innovation growth and expansionWhen you think of Apple you think of the iPhone and other legacy hardware products Sure theres something to be said for the Apple Watch But its no iPhone For Microsoft you think about all the cloud offerings and while those are growing nicely the company really isnt expanding dramatically beyond its core cloud businessFor Google you have a company that represents the backbone of the internet and has a rapidly growing cloud business But until the self driving business gets off the ground this company too isnt the gold standard for growth or expansionNow lets talk Amazon We all know Amazon for its huge and still rapidly growing ecommerce business We also all know Amazon for its marketleading cloud business But thats just the tip of the iceberg for this companyAmazon is rapidly developing an offline retail business which projects to go from essentially zero stores two years ago to  Whole Foods locations and  Amazon Go convenience store locations by The company is also rapidly building out a digital advertising business that has gone from hardly being on the scene a few years ago to a  billion annualized revenue business todayThere is also the nascent but promising logistics and pharmaceutical businesses both of which represent multibillion dollar opportunitiesOverall Amazons innovation growth and expansion are simply unparalleled That isnt a knock against Apple Microsoft or Google Those are all great tech companies with stocks that are long term winners But its simply to say that no one matches Amazon when it comes to combining size with growth driversBecause of that Amazon stock rightly deserves the market cap crownThe Case for  TrillionGiven the companys multifaceted and longrunning growth drivers there is a case for Amazon stock to not only regain its  trillion valuation but eventually hit a  trillion valuation in the long termThe math is pretty simple You can see it here But the brief synopsis for where Amazons businesses could be by  are as followsEcommerce  billionplus revenues  operating margin  billionplus operating profitsCloud  billion revenues  operating margin  operating profitsAdvertising  billion revenues  operating margin  billion operating profitsAdding it all up Amazons potential operating profit opportunity by  sums to nearly  billionTaking out  for taxes thats about  billion in net profitsA biggrowth X multiple on that to account for growth potential in pharma and logistics implies a  valuation of  trillion for Amazon stockStory continuesBottom Line on Amazon StockIts fair to say that Apple is in the later innings of its growth narrative Microsoft and Google are both in the middle innings Amazon is still in the early inningsAs such now that AMZN has taken the market cap crown it wont give it up anytime soonAs of this writing Luke Lango was long AAPL AMZN and GOOGMore

Service Is Neat But Its Not a DisruptionJosh EnomotoInvestorPlaceJanuary  ReblogShareTweetShareIn recent years Amazon NASDAQAMZN has found ways to surprise people such as its takeover of Whole Foods Market Such moves lend credence to the disruptive nature of Amazon But in other cases the disruption could be seen a million miles away Thats the case for the latest rumor centering on an Amazon streaming video game serviceAccording to inside sources Amazon is developing a platform to stream video games over the internet This decision pits the company directly against Alphabet NASDAQGOOG NASDAQGOOGL which is working hard to launch a similar service The ecommerce giant is also going up against videogame powerhouses Sony NYSESNE and Microsoft NASDAQMSFTThe news couldnt come soon enough Despite its dominant presence the markets havent been kind to Amazon stock Sure AMZN did return  for its shareholders last year which is a deeply impressive haul considering the circumstances But since the end of August shares are down nearly  Plus the choppiness over the past three months isnt helping mattersInvestorPlace  Stock Market News Stock Advice  Trading TipsIn theory a groundbreaking reveal like Amazons streaming games service should bolster the case for the company In the nearerterm I can see Amazon stock tick a little higher But over the long run the forecast is a little hazy   Stocks at Risk of the Global Smartphone Slowdown  Lets take a look at both sides of the issue beginning with the positivesAmazon Stock Has a New WeaponThe appeal for Amazon stock doesnt just rely on the underlying companys disruptive strategies In many cases it creates new markets and subsequently dominates them A prime example is their smart speakers While Alphabet is catching up Amazon owns the greatest market share by a country mile More importantly rival Apple NASDAQAAPL has no answerConsidering this track record I can appreciate the optimism for Amazonsupcoming streaming games service For starters it brings a new revenue stream for the company that previously didnt exist Moreover as its Prime mediacontent platform has demonstrated Jeff Bezos  Co can compete with anyone even wellestablished players That should make the management teams at Sony and Microsoft uncomfortableAdding to that point Amazon could possibly put physical gaming consoles on the endangeredspecies list Rather than producing its own console an Amazon streaming service would store the energyintensive hardware inhouse This allows the tech company to transmit data through the internetTwo advantages readily stand out First such a mechanism will entirely forego a physical console This saves space and cost for the gamer Second streaming allows consumers to enjoy graphically intense games on smaller devices like smartphones or tablets If thats the case Sony and Microsoft are futilely spinning their wheels developing their nextgeneration consolesAmazon Streaming Service Is Not Practically FeasibleOn asurface level the bullish argument for video game streaming as a catalyst for Amazon stock is extremely convincing Apparently its a nobrainer Considering the rapid proliferation of gaming culture the ecommerce giant has another guaranteed moneymaker on its handsBut does it really While I generally have a positive view on AMZN stock Im not entirely convinced that Amazons video game streaming service will get the job done The venture might even lose money for the vaunted organizationWe must consider why consoles exist in the first place Essentially they are purposedriven computers their entire functionality revolves solely on gaming Additionally these devices utilize graphics processor units GPU from leading companies like Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQAMD and Nvidia NASDAQNVDA GPUs are processors designed to accommodate the intensive data requirements of todays top video gamesAmazon intends to replace this physical platform through streaming Even with G technology this is an ambitious undertakingMore critically Amazons intended input devices  smartphones tablets TV controllers  dont work well with most modern games For example a Call of Duty game is tough enough as it is on a traditional console and dedicated controller I cant imagine the frustrations involved playing that on my iPhoneStory continuesBottom Line on AMZNIf youre asking me about my overall opinion on Amazon stock I maintain my longterm bullishness AMZN already changed how we shop Eventually it will shape how an entire generation livesBut as a gamechanger in gaming Im not sure I can buy into that story Amazon may think it can stream stateoftheart video games from its data center But when Sony and Microsoft continue to pound out successor consoles eventually the inherent advantages of having a dedicated and decentralized platform will outweigh the conveniences of a streaming setupAs long as management keeps expectations in check and doesnt go overboard with expenses this new venture could work But if they think they can topple the alpha dogs in this sector theyre in for a rude awakeningAs of this writing Josh Enomoto is long SNEMore From InvestorPlace   Toxic Pot

which games amazon is streaming and how to watch
Amazons NFL streaming is an addata playYahooSearchNo matching results for Tip Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsGive feedback on the new search experienceCancelSign inMailFinanceWatchlistsMy PortfolioScreenersMarketsIndustriesVideosNewsPersonal FinanceTechUS Markets closedSP Dow NasdaqRussell Crude OilGoldSilverEURUSDAmazons NFL streaming is all about collecting ad dataDaniel RobertsSenior WriterYahoo FinanceSeptember  ReblogShareTweetShareAmazon paid a reported  million for the right to stream  NFL games this season and the fun begins on Sept  with the Green Bay Packers and Chicago BearsThe streams are only accessible to Amazon Prime members an estimated  million people so many expect the cordcutting option to help boost Prime membershipsBut the real opportunity for Amazon is to offer advertisers granular data that the company says has never before been available to brands that advertise during NFL gamesWhat to expect from Amazons ad packagesAs part of its agreement Amazon reportedly gets to sell two minutes of ads on its stream per hour Other reports say its ten second ads which would equal five minutes total which would be fewer than two minutes of ads per hour since the average game lasts for  hours  minutes Amazon will not answer which is correct The rest of the ads that youll see will be the same as the national spots that appear on cable networksFor the Amazononly ads Amazon has sold packages that reportedly cost  million Its unclear exactly how many minutes are included in each package and Amazon will not share how many separate packages it has sold but Amazon does say the packages include banner ads elsewhere on Amazoncom that dont run during the gamesThe ability to sell this volume of ads against the games likely accounts for the rise in price tag compared to the  million Twitter paid to stream  TNF games last seasonAnd Amazon will track sales data after each ad so that it can tell a brand exactly how many people purchased or looked up its products after seeing its ad Saurabh Sharma director of ad platforms at Amazon uses Gillette as an example Amazon will be able to tell Gillette how many people bought its razors and blades on Amazon during or immediately after a game stream Thats very exciting and has never been done says Sharma Were taking what we already do with digital ads and applying it to the NFLSo what can we expect from the Amazononly ads during the streaming TNF games You might assume since some Prime members will watch the game on a computer phone or tablet that some of the ads might be interactive or innovative in some other wayBut the likelihood is the ads wont look any different than the standard second or second spots you see on televisionUnfortunately I dont think were going to see much different which is a big mistake says Brian Cristiano CEO of ad agency Bold Worldwide Maybe someone surprises us and Im hopeful that they do but I think thats whats going to happen What should be happening is What story can we tell that starts before during and after the game that a brand can ownIndeed at a promotional event at its AWS Loft in Manhattan last week Amazon showed some of the ads that will appear during the first game Some of the ads are for Amazon itself and the rest are mostly from brands that are already official NFL sponsors like Pepsi Hyundai and Gillette owned by PG But there was also an ad from Showtime not an NFL sponsor for its series Ray DonovanEven if the ads dont look unique what matters is the data Amazon will get from them and give to the advertisers As Cristiano acknowledges sounding a lot like Amazon exec Sharma the ability tofigure out how many people purchased directly from Amazon after seeing an ad during the Amazon stream has never been done beforeWhich games Amazon is streaming and how to watchAmazon is showing  Thursday Night Football games and a Christmas Day this year a Monday game On television some of those games are

groceryanchored shopping centers in  climbed more than  percent JLL says Grocery store openings declined  percent last year as expansion plans cooled and some supermarkets prepared to file for bankruptcy in the year Amazon AMZN acquired Whole Foods according to a new report from Jones Lang LaSalleBut investments in groceryanchored shopping centers in  climbed  percent from  JLL found making it one of the only retail sectors to see deal growth in a year of low transaction volumeTraditionally retail has such a reputation right now of everybody being afraid of disruption by ecommerce James Cook JLLs director of retail research in the Americas told CNBC Grocery is considered to have a moat around it to defend against ecommerce and because of that these assets are seen by retail property investors as a safe investmentTo be sure these investors arent interested in all groceryanchored centers Cook cautioned Just this month for example Williamsville New Yorkbased Tops Friendly Markets filed for bankruptcy and reports surfaced that WinnDixie owner BiLo was preparing to do so too Theres a glut of shopping centers built around weak tenants that risk going dark just like many malls anchored by weak department storesIn many US markets you might have six or more grocery chains Cook said In most cases investors are only interested in the top one or two Those are the most defensibleThe short list for those top grocery contenders include Whole Foods Trader Joes Floridabased Publix Wegmans and some of Kroger KR s brands And for the most part today these chains are opening few new stores Instead they are investing in their existing locations to fulfill online orders and ease the delivery of groceries to homesThe strongest US markets for grocery stores where the most businesses continue to expand include California Virginia and North Carolina according to JLL Texas although its still a top market for grocers added fewer stores in  than in  The growth in that state has stemmed from a spurt of new residential development Where there are homes people need more grocery storesSource Jones Lang LaSalle Retailers die but retail does not Cook said about the ongoing evolution in the grocery space Theres just churn as retailers are either disrupted by new business models or they go out of fashionGermanybased Lidl was one new player in the US grocery market that everyone had their eyes on in  when it began opening stores across the Southeast Shortly thereafter Lidl halted several of its construction projects local news outlets have reported as the company admitted it might have started expanding too quickly Lidl opened nearly  stores across the US last yearIn turn Lidl offered other supermarket chains a warning sign Many markets werent ready for another grocer in town The German company also had to fix a few snags internally Its still working out its privatelabel items its layout of US stores and its marketing strategy for American consumersThe most successful grocers today have wellknown private labels fresh food at affordable prices and digital platforms that allow for shopping online Cook saidWeve got two types of classes in grocery right now One is about offering the best goods at the lowest prices  its a price play thats targeted at the families in America shopping on a budget so someone like Aldi is a part of that he said Another avenue of success is offering a great shopping experience to shoppers who arent as price sensitive  those leaders are Whole foods and Wegmanstrends to watch for in grocery retail in  according to JLLSmaller grocery stores Companies including Whole Foods and Publix are testing new store formats Technology implemented in stores that gives retailers more data about their shoppers

MangalindanChief Tech CorrespondentYahoo FinanceDecember  ReblogShareTweetShareNowhere was Amazons position as a retail juggernaut better symbolized than a photograph last July of a buff Jeff Bezos strutting around Sun Valley Idaho guns blazing The shot of the CEO which went viral and inspired a stream of breathless coverage like GQ Magazines Jeff Bezos bigass biceps will shame you into working out this weekend served as a stark symbol of how far he and Amazon have come since Bezos jumpstarted Amazon in his Seattle garage to peddle books online Amazon AMZN still sells books of course But it does so much more now from cloudbased services to food delivery much to the delight of more than  million shoppers spoiled by its competitive pricing and fast shippingWhile Amazon continues to account for a relatively small share of retail overall the company continuously made business headlinesThe ecommerce giants broad reach is also drawing the attention of lawmakers like Senator Cory Booker who argue that big tech companies like Amazon and Google have simply become too big and should face greater antitrust scrutinyAmazon has had quite the year which is why Yahoo Finances editors selected the Seattle tech giant as s Company of the Year Credit David FosterYahoo FinanceMoreIndeed Amazons massive size and influence is part of the reason why when the time came once again for Yahoo Finances editors to select a Company of the Year the answer was clear Amazon  which has innovated moved markets and pushed boundaries  joins past winners such as Facebook FB Disney DIS and Nvidia NVDA While it might seem like an obvious choice for Company of the Year theres no denying that  was huge for AmazonTo be sure Amazon wasnt the markets strongest performer in Still Amazon shares soared nearly  in   following moves like the  billion Whole Foods deal strong quarterly earnings Amazon Web Services  billion annual revenue run rate and reports that Amazon could break into pharmaceuticals At the same time Alexa became the undisputed market leader for voice assistantsBut while Amazons achievements uptodate are praiseworthy see our timeline for Amazons path to domination in  some of the companys most exciting offerings appear yet to come Were not focused on conqueringOur focus is pioneering Amazon Worldwide Consumer CEO Jeff Wilke told Yahoo Finance recently during an interview at the companys Santa Monica California offices Were not focused on conquering Thats a business model some people could choose but were trying to invent  not disrupt If customers like what weve invented theyre going to choose our invention sometimes and that may lead to disruption for others but we expect it to accelerate invention and there will be more opportunity for others to build great models tooDespite Wilkes assertions disrupt is what Amazon did so much so that Amazon was cited over  times on corporate earnings calls this year One of the years largest deals  CVSs CVS  billion acquisition of health insurer Aetna AET  is viewed by many pundits as a preemptive strike should Amazon barrel into pharmaceuticals the way it has into other areas like retail groceries and food delivery That seems to be the nature in which every business operates now RBC Capital Markets analyst George Hill explains pointing to moves like Targets TGT  million acquisition of Shipt a sameday delivery company which was announced in December Has Amazon led this charge Absolutely As Amazon continues to up its game in owning the last mile theyre going to force every participant to up their game as wellStory continuesAmazons obsession with that last mile  the final journey of an order from the warehouse to the shoppers doorstep  has forced virtually every retailer to rethink delivery since the tech giant launched Amazon Primes twoday delivery in  and spearheaded an allout arms race for faster shipping Before Prime anyone who wanted their orders quickly would have to pay FedEx or UPS big bucks or just have to wait Now twoday or sameday shipping is the norm for an estimated  million Prime members or  of Amazon customers in the US A genius acquisitionOne pundit calls Amazons acquisition of Whole Foods Market which closed in August the second best acquisition of the decade  second only to Facebooks acquisition of Instagram in  Source Francisco AntunesFlickrMoreThe tech giants boldest move this year was also its most surprising In June Amazon announced it would acquire Whole Foods for  billion  its largest acquisition to date Although it toyed with groceries before  most visibly with an inhouse groceries delivery service called Amazon Fresh  the Whole Foods acquisition was by far Amazons biggest signal yet that it is serious about expanding its overall presence in brickandmortar retail starting with taking over Whole Foods plus stores Scott Galloway a professor of marketing at at NYU Stern School of Business and author of the book The Four The Hidden DNA of Amazon Apple Facebook and Google calls Amazons acquisition of Whole Foods the secondbest acquisition of the decade  second only to Facebooks FB  billion acquisition of the popular photosharing app Instagram in  For Amazon buying Whole Foods was genius Galloway contends It gives them access to the wealthiest refrigerators in the world one of the best and largest consumer brands in the world and lets them pick up  new warehouses all in one purchaseThe week Amazons acquisition of Whole Foods Market closed Whole Foods started selling Amazon Echo speakers instoreMoreThe effect on competition was immediate That same Thursday in August when Amazon announced it would cut prices Kroger KRSprouts Farmers Market SFM SuperValu SVU Costco COST Target and WalMart Stores WMT stock all took a nosediveWhole Foods meanwhile saw new life after announcing its sixth consecutive quarter of falling samestore sales early this year Foot traffic to its stores jumped  yearoveryear during the week Amazon initially cut prices according to the data analytics firm Thasos Group Of those new shoppers  came from Walmart  came from Kroger and  crossed over from Costco The purpose of the acquisition was very simple were fans explained Wilke who added that the grocery chains healthier selection helped change the way he consumed food soon after he relocated from Pittsburgh  years ago to work with Bezos at Amazon I think we had a great opportunity to partner with a terrific company and a great brand They essentially invented the natural and organic category Amazons other home runAmazon may not have invented the voice assistant but that doesnt seem to matter to the tens of millions of shoppers who now own an Echo speaker According to estimates from digital research firm eMarketer the Echo cornered roughly  of the US market for voicecontrolled speakers this year You knew Alexa had entered the pop culture lexicon when Saturday Night Live aired its geriatricthemed spoof in May Unlike Apple AAPL which keeps Siri under lock and key Amazon early on opened up access to Alexa so outside companies and developers could develop functions for it even integrate it into their own devices It was a risky business move to be sure but one that turned out to be a masterstroke At last Januarys Consumer Electronics Show hundreds of Alexaenabled devices from outside parties  fridges selfdriving cars even baby monitors  lined the convention halls We envisioned Alexa and all the products that connect to her to be based mostly in the cloud and I think thats the kind of paradigm shift that weve seen with this technology as opposed to previous technologies in consumer electronics because Alexa being up in the cloud allows us to improve her every single day Dave Limp Amazon SVP of devices and services told Yahoo Finance at Amazons Seattle headquarters recently And because developers can extend her through software skills and through hardware partners youre seeing her now in refrigerators and cars and baby monitors and camerasThe hunt for HQAlthough Amazons Seattle headquarters is already sprawling the tech giant plans on opening a second headquarters elsewhere in the US Source AP PhotoElaine ThompsonMoreAs Amazon expanded its brickandmortar footprint in  it also made headlines by announcing it planned on opening a second headquarters somewhere else in the US dubbed HQ with an estimated cost of  billionSoon after the tech giant received  proposals from across North America several of which got creative in wooing Amazon Arizona representatives sent Amazon a foot cactus and a Pittsburgh sandwich chain offered to feed every Amazon employee But the city of Stonecrest Georgia dangled the most outrageous deal of them all in offering to create an entirely new city called Amazon where Bezos could serve as mayor for life Yes really Media reports suggested a number of cities as top contenders from Austin Texas to Boston But Stonecrest Georgia may have the edge In early December Amazon registered an inhouse lobbyist specializing in clean energy and technology with the Georgia State Ethics Commission ahead of the states legislative session in JanuaryAn Amazon spokesperson confirmed on Tuesday to Yahoo Finance that this is not at all related with the search of Amazons second headquarters and is part of their ongoing investment efforts across the country through different projects The spokesperson also pointed out that over the last  years Amazon has invested more than  billion in the US in fulfillment center infrastructure they have now  fulfillment centers in the US data centers wind farms regional tech hubs corporate offices and compensation to its teamsFor his part Wilke contends that Amazon is still in the early process of evaluating bidsWe dont want to overdescribe or overconstrain what were interested in because there will be tradeoffs probably in all of these cities he said but it needs to have a large enough pull a large enough workforce where we can attract and retain the kind of people that work at Amazon including technical folksWhats in store for  In the months and years to come Wilke says Prime members in particular will reap the benefits of the Whole Foods purchase with more exclusive discounts For Amazon Whole Foods also represents a trove of logistical and supply chain data As the company expands its physical footprint

sales versus online sales and sales technology  all things Amazon needs to master if it wants to expand its Amazon Go store beyond its employeesonly Seattle location The Amazon employeesonly Amazon Go store in Seattle uses a tracking system with sensors and cameras to determine what a customer has bought without anyone ever having to scan an item Source AP PhotoElaine Thompson FileMoreOne day regular shoppers in the US will eventually pick up any item they want to buy instore and simply walk out without ever having to interact with another human being or having to scan their items to purchase them Amazon naturally wants to be at the forefront of that change As for Alexa Wilke suggests more skills for the popular voice assistant are coming in  focused on letting shoppers do more on Amazoncom simply using their voice Its early days but you can imagine that the way were communicating right now would be a natural way to communicate when theyre something you want to buy Wilke hints could also prove to be the year in which regulators pay closer attention to Amazon not to mention other big tech companies like Google and Facebook as public sentiment with Silicon Valley has soured Just over the weekend news emerged that Amazon could face an investigation by UKs Advertising Standards Authority over complaints that Prime didnt come through on its promises of unlimited oneday delivery with some shoppers Still Wilke isnt concerned about regulators or critics who argue Amazon is too oppressive on competition or needs to be broken up into smaller pieces In typical Amazon fashion hes more concerned about winning over consumersI would just direct them to the fact that we have less than  of worldwide retail and there are several companies many companies actually who are larger than us even in retail Wilke emphasizes Were not at a place where we should worry about that We should be continuing to take care of customers We Amazon should worry about continuing to take care of customers invent on their behalfHe also points to the fact that over  of all sales on Amazoncom are sales done by thirdparty sellers and between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday alone  million products were ordered and fulfilled by thirdparty sellers Our services are being used by third parties to build businesses independently of Amazon adds Wilke If that continues  and it will  there will be many winners in retail The caveat being of course those winners are beholden to Amazon for its revenues whether they like it or notSource David FosterYahoo FinanceMoreClick here to find out more

MangalindanChief Tech CorrespondentYahoo FinanceDecember  ReblogShareTweetShareNowhere was Amazons position as a retail juggernaut better symbolized than a photograph last July of a buff Jeff Bezos strutting around Sun Valley Idaho guns blazing The shot of the CEO which went viral and inspired a stream of breathless coverage like GQ Magazines Jeff Bezos bigass biceps will shame you into working out this weekend served as a stark symbol of how far he and Amazon have come since Bezos jumpstarted Amazon in his Seattle garage to peddle books online Amazon AMZN still sells books of course But it does so much more now from cloudbased services to food delivery much to the delight of more than  million shoppers spoiled by its competitive pricing and fast shippingWhile Amazon continues to account for a relatively small share of retail overall the company continuously made business headlinesThe ecommerce giants broad reach is also drawing the attention of lawmakers like Senator Cory Booker who argue that big tech companies like Amazon and Google have simply become too big and should face greater antitrust scrutinyAmazon has had quite the year which is why Yahoo Finances editors selected the Seattle tech giant as s Company of the Year Credit David FosterYahoo FinanceMoreIndeed Amazons massive size and influence is part of the reason why when the time came once again for Yahoo Finances editors to select a Company of the Year the answer was clear Amazon  which has innovated moved markets and pushed boundaries  joins past winners such as Facebook FB Disney DIS and Nvidia NVDA While it might seem like an obvious choice for Company of the Year theres no denying that  was huge for AmazonTo be sure Amazon wasnt the markets strongest performer in Still Amazon shares soared nearly  in   following moves like the  billion Whole Foods deal strong quarterly earnings Amazon Web Services  billion annual revenue run rate and reports that Amazon could break into pharmaceuticals At the same time Alexa became the undisputed market leader for voice assistantsBut while Amazons achievements uptodate are praiseworthy see our timeline for Amazons path to domination in  some of the companys most exciting offerings appear yet to come Were not focused on conqueringOur focus is pioneering Amazon Worldwide Consumer CEO Jeff Wilke told Yahoo Finance recently during an interview at the companys Santa Monica California offices Were not focused on conquering Thats a business model some people could choose but were trying to invent  not disrupt If customers like what weve invented theyre going to choose our invention sometimes and that may lead to disruption for others but we expect it to accelerate invention and there will be more opportunity for others to build great models tooDespite Wilkes assertions disrupt is what Amazon did so much so that Amazon was cited over  times on corporate earnings calls this year One of the years largest deals  CVSs CVS  billion acquisition of health insurer Aetna AET  is viewed by many pundits as a preemptive strike should Amazon barrel into pharmaceuticals the way it has into other areas like retail groceries and food delivery That seems to be the nature in which every business operates now RBC Capital Markets analyst George Hill explains pointing to moves like Targets TGT  million acquisition of Shipt a sameday delivery company which was announced in December Has Amazon led this charge Absolutely As Amazon continues to up its game in owning the last mile theyre going to force every participant to up their game as wellStory continuesAmazons obsession with that last mile  the final journey of an order from the warehouse to the shoppers doorstep  has forced virtually every retailer to rethink delivery since the tech giant launched Amazon Primes twoday delivery in  and spearheaded an allout arms race for faster shipping Before Prime anyone who wanted their orders quickly would have to pay FedEx or UPS big bucks or just have to wait Now twoday or sameday shipping is the norm for an estimated  million Prime members or  of Amazon customers in the US A genius acquisitionOne pundit calls Amazons acquisition of Whole Foods Market which closed in August the second best acquisition of the decade  second only to Facebooks acquisition of Instagram in  Source Francisco AntunesFlickrMoreThe tech giants boldest move this year was also its most surprising In June Amazon announced it would acquire Whole Foods for  billion  its largest acquisition to date Although it toyed with groceries before  most visibly with an inhouse groceries delivery service called Amazon Fresh  the Whole Foods acquisition was by far Amazons biggest signal yet that it is serious about expanding its overall presence in brickandmortar retail starting with taking over Whole Foods plus stores Scott Galloway a professor of marketing at at NYU Stern School of Business and author of the book The Four The Hidden DNA of Amazon Apple Facebook and Google calls Amazons acquisition of Whole Foods the secondbest acquisition of the decade  second only to Facebooks FB  billion acquisition of the popular photosharing app Instagram in  For Amazon buying Whole Foods was genius Galloway contends It gives them access to the wealthiest refrigerators in the world one of the best and largest consumer brands in the world and lets them pick up  new warehouses all in one purchaseThe week Amazons acquisition of Whole Foods Market closed Whole Foods started selling Amazon Echo speakers instoreMoreThe effect on competition was immediate That same Thursday in August when Amazon announced it would cut prices Kroger KRSprouts Farmers Market SFM SuperValu SVU Costco COST Target and WalMart Stores WMT stock all took a nosediveWhole Foods meanwhile saw new life after announcing its sixth consecutive quarter of falling samestore sales early this year Foot traffic to its stores jumped  yearoveryear during the week Amazon initially cut prices according to the data analytics firm Thasos Group Of those new shoppers  came from Walmart  came from Kroger and  crossed over from Costco The purpose of the acquisition was very simple were fans explained Wilke who added that the grocery chains healthier selection helped change the way he consumed food soon after he relocated from Pittsburgh  years ago to work with Bezos at Amazon I think we had a great opportunity to partner with a terrific company and a great brand They essentially invented the natural and organic category Amazons other home runAmazon may not have invented the voice assistant but that doesnt seem to matter to the tens of millions of shoppers who now own an Echo speaker According to estimates from digital research firm eMarketer the Echo cornered roughly  of the US market for voicecontrolled speakers this year You knew Alexa had entered the pop culture lexicon when Saturday Night Live aired its geriatricthemed spoof in May Unlike Apple AAPL which keeps Siri under lock and key Amazon early on opened up access to Alexa so outside companies and developers could develop functions for it even integrate it into their own devices It was a risky business move to be sure but one that turned out to be a masterstroke At last Januarys Consumer Electronics Show hundreds of Alexaenabled devices from outside parties  fridges selfdriving cars even baby monitors  lined the convention halls We envisioned Alexa and all the products that connect to her to be based mostly in the cloud and I think thats the kind of paradigm shift that weve seen with this technology as opposed to previous technologies in consumer electronics because Alexa being up in the cloud allows us to improve her every single day Dave Limp Amazon SVP of devices and services told Yahoo Finance at Amazons Seattle headquarters recently And because developers can extend her through software skills and through hardware partners youre seeing her now in refrigerators and cars and baby monitors and camerasThe hunt for HQAlthough Amazons Seattle headquarters is already sprawling the tech giant plans on opening a second headquarters elsewhere in the US Source AP PhotoElaine ThompsonMoreAs Amazon expanded its brickandmortar footprint in  it also made headlines by announcing it planned on opening a second headquarters somewhere else in the US dubbed HQ with an estimated cost of  billionSoon after the tech giant received  proposals from across North America several of which got creative in wooing Amazon Arizona representatives sent Amazon a foot cactus and a Pittsburgh sandwich chain offered to feed every Amazon employee But the city of Stonecrest Georgia dangled the most outrageous deal of them all in offering to create an entirely new city called Amazon where Bezos could serve as mayor for life Yes really Media reports suggested a number of cities as top contenders from Austin Texas to Boston But Stonecrest Georgia may have the edge In early December Amazon registered an inhouse lobbyist specializing in clean energy and technology with the Georgia State Ethics Commission ahead of the states legislative session in JanuaryAn Amazon spokesperson confirmed on Tuesday to Yahoo Finance that this is not at all related with the search of Amazons second headquarters and is part of their ongoing investment efforts across the country through different projects The spokesperson also pointed out that over the last  years Amazon has invested more than  billion in the US in fulfillment center infrastructure they have now  fulfillment centers in the US data centers wind farms regional tech hubs corporate offices and compensation to its teamsFor his part Wilke contends that Amazon is still in the early process of evaluating bidsWe dont want to overdescribe or overconstrain what were interested in because there will be tradeoffs probably in all of these cities he said but it needs to have a large enough pull a large enough workforce where we can attract and retain the kind of people that work at Amazon including technical folksWhats in store for  In the months and years to come Wilke says Prime members in particular will reap the benefits of the Whole Foods purchase with more exclusive discounts For Amazon Whole Foods also represents a trove of logistical and supply chain data As the company expands its physical footprint beyond lockers stuffed with shoppers orders physical bookstores and autonomous stores like Amazon Go the tech giant is looking to better understand aspects of brickandmortar like foot traffic instores sales versus online sales and sales technology  all things Amazon needs to master if it wants to expand its Amazon Go store beyond its employeesonly Seattle location The Amazon employeesonly Amazon Go store in Seattle uses a tracking system with sensors and cameras to determine what a customer has bought without anyone ever having to scan an item Source AP PhotoElaine Thompson FileMoreOne day regular shoppers in the US will eventually pick up any item they want to buy instore and simply walk out without ever having to interact with another human being or having to scan their items to purchase them Amazon naturally wants to be at the forefront of that change As for Alexa Wilke suggests more skills for the popular voice assistant are coming in  focused on letting shoppers do more on Amazoncom simply using their voice Its early days but you can imagine that the way were communicating right now would be a natural way to communicate when theyre something you want to buy Wilke hints could also prove to be the year in which regulators pay closer attention to Amazon not to mention other big tech companies like Google and Facebook as public sentiment with Silicon Valley has soured Just over the weekend news emerged that Amazon could face an investigation by UKs Advertising Standards Authority over complaints that Prime didnt come through on its promises of unlimited oneday delivery with some shoppers Still Wilke isnt concerned about regulators or critics who argue Amazon is too oppressive on competition or needs to be broken up into smaller pieces In typical Amazon fashion hes more concerned about winning over consumersI would just direct them to the fact that we have less than  of worldwide retail and there are several companies many companies actually who are larger than us even in retail Wilke emphasizes Were not at a place where we should worry about that We should be continuing to take care of customers We Amazon should worry about continuing to take care of customers invent on their behalfHe also points to the fact that over  of all sales on Amazoncom are sales done by thirdparty sellers and between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday alone  million products were ordered and fulfilled by thirdparty sellers Our services are being used by third parties to build businesses independently of Amazon adds Wilke If that continues  and it will  there will be many winners in retail The caveat being of course those winners are beholden to Amazon for its revenues whether they like it or notSource David FosterYahoo FinanceMoreClick here to find out more

search experienceCancelSign inMailFinanceWatchlistsMy PortfolioScreenersMarketsIndustriesVideosNewsPersonal FinanceTechUS Markets closedSP Dow NasdaqRussell Crude OilGoldSilverEURUSDAmazons Alexa chief Youll have minute chats with Alexa one dayJP MangalindanChief Tech CorrespondentYahoo FinanceNovember  ReblogShareTweetShareVoice technology makes technology available to anyone of all ages from all skill sets and backgrounds Amazon VP of Alexa Al Lindsay said Source WebSummitMoreAmazon VP of Alexa Al Lindsay has a bold goal for Alexa the popular voicecontrolled personal assistant one day Alexa should be capable of holding conversations up to  minutes long A lot of what people ask Alexa for today are fairly short interactions Lindsay told Yahoo Finance at the annual Web Summit tech conference held this week in Lisbon Portugal Longer conversations arent yet the normIndeed use any one of the voicecontrolled personal assistants currently on the market such as Alexa Siri Google Assistant or Cortana and youll quickly realize Lindsay and his competitors still have a lot more to work to do before five  or minute conversations are possible For now interactions with Alexa are a startandstop affair where users instruct it to perform one or two of over  different tasks telling you the latest news calling an Uber or playing the latest Nick Jonas album off Spotify But what Alexa cant do for instance is book an entire trip to the Bahamas in one go You can do bits and pieces  book a hotel check your flight status  but its not as intuitive as booking it yourself online yet or talking to an oldschool travel agentThats still the stuff of Lindsays longerterm unfulfilled dreams a truly versatile Star Treklike computer that accomplishes virtually anything you throw at it with a simple voice command To truly realize that vision youll want a number of things youll want to have it everywhere be able to talk to it from anywhere be able for it to do all of the things you would want an intelligent assistant do for you and ultimately do it in a very conversational way Lindsay added A long road aheadGetting there will require a lot of work accomplished by the  or so Amazon employees who now work on Alexa in places as farflung as Germany and India as well as outside developers Perhaps realizing that making Alexa a conversational whiz was a herculean task Amazon readily shares Alexas software development tools with third parties Last year Amazon announced the Alexa Prize a  million competition for university students who develop social bots using Alexas technology that can convincingly chat with people about pop culture and news events for up to  minutes This March Amazon announced the Alexa Fund a  million venture capital fund that gives cash to companies and developers who drum up new skills that let Alexa perform new tasks If we can actually get to the point where its truly conversational and equivalent to speaking to another human anyone will be able to interact with it effectively Lindsay explained You wont have to learn how to use a touchscreen or how to use an app You just speak to it The Amazon executives goal of having Alexa become truly ubiquitous could become reality faster than many think The voicecontrolled assistant started simply enough in  when the first Echo speaker launched but if this years CES in January was a good indicator Alexa could soon be everywhere you want it to be There were Alexacompatible smartphones baby monitors air purifiers selfdriving cars even refrigerators Its an ambitious effort though hardly an altruistic one The more Alexaenabled devices there are in the world  and Lindsay tells Yahoo Finance there are already tens of millions of Alexaenabled devices now  the more people interact with Alexa And the more engaging Alexa becomes the more likely they are to use Amazons wide array of services and buy things whether its a new album off Amazon Music or dinnerware from Amazoncom After all Amazon has a  market shareof the home smart speaker market in the US according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners and the Seattle tech giant clearly wants to keep it that way JP Mangalindan is

the siteEthan WolffMannSenior WriterYahoo FinanceJune  ReblogShareTweetShareAmazons new Solimo brandMoreThis month Amazon informed some of its customers of a new inhouse brand Solimo which is selling an array of everyday items like sunscreen razors soap coffee pods and moreThe new brand had scarcely been around for a few days before netting over  reviews on some of its products and the coveted Amazons Choice badge for at least one product search coffee podsAmazon brandssurprisingly strong performances in professional product review testing and the instant success of Solimo illustrates Amazons careful foray into generic inhouse brandsAmazon now boasts dozens of private brands  names that both trumpet its connection to the company AmazonBasics Amazon Essentials and downplay it Rivet a furniture and furnishings brandLark  Ro womens apparel Mama Bear organic baby food For nearly every product category Amazon is offering curated options that are priced very competitively and consistently please the massesThe list of categories  which began in  with AmazonBasics and Pinzon another home essentials brand  was already growing quickly when it gained another boost by Amazons acquisition of Whole Foods and its popular  brandWhole Foods itself illustrated a distinct take on generics as its upscale reputation gave its generic brand  prestigeThis strategy according to SunTrust analysis could carry the business to sales of  billion a year by  far above s current projection of  billionAmazon has found the missing piece for generics with its techIn many ways Amazons approach to generic products isnt that different from classic instore generics Generics sit next to their namebrand counterparts at the pharmacy or grocery store like Costcos Kirkland brand CVSs CVS brand or Whole Foods  Their location subtle design hints like packaging shape and color active ingredients and the occasional compare to Listerine would serve to inform consumers of the lowercost alternativeThe Amazon model is largely the same thing but in search results  instead of on the shelf You search for sunscreen on Amazon and you see Amazons compare to Coppertone next to the Coppertone But there are a few secret weapons inherent to Amazons platform that make its current forays into generics a force that could reshape retailOne trick up its sleeve reviews If a shopper were ever on the fence deciding between a generic and a namebrand product a chorus of  Amazon reviews with a star average is often enough to make someone trust the inhouse generic No one wants to pay more than they have to and if you dont care about buying a brandname suitcase or electric kettle the cheaper generic has a very good shotBut Amazon itself has also become a name brand of sorts as its brand connection may be seen as a pro not a con for some itemsAmazon Essentials mens clothing AmazoncomMoreSince the Amazon marketplace is filled with countless inexpensive largely anonymous brands  like Yungsong and Qianxiang for iPhone cables  Amazons often similarly priced offerings stand out Unlike the unknown brands Amazons products are backed by a large established company with a track record of customer satisfaction and a customerobsessed CEO who has a stake in the reputation of products carrying the brandA big advantage of AmazonBasics is being able to deal directly with Amazon for warranty replacement wrote one commenter on the Wirecutter a popular online review site owned by The New York Times For me that often helps tip the scalesStory continuesEven if an Amazonbranded product appears to be identical to a competitors its branding carries an implicit promise of quality control customer service and a generous return policy that makes it riskfree to try Like Whole Foods elevating generics with its  brand the Amazon mark may be a valueaddAmazon said it adds products too quickly to have metrics to share about the average reviews or return rates of its inhouse branded products but a Yahoo Finance analysis across multiple product categories found very strong showings that regularly match or exceed their counterpartsAmazon is a search engine and its products are doing well on itAmazons most overlooked quality may be the fact that its marketplace is a search engine and one that research has shown has supplanted Google as the first place an online shopper goes to buy somethingAmazon search results have longbeen a battleground for retailers looking for prominent placement because customers seldom look beyond the first page The retailer has unsurprisingly become savvy at playing the placement game with its own privatelabel productsSearch for anything on the site and youll see an Amazon brand in the first few results as well as sponsored products at the top The company sponsors Amazonbrand items on its own site Yahoo Finance searched dozens of product categories with a cleared browser and Amazons house brands were staples among the first three resultsThe Amazon algorithm sellers have told Yahoo Finance is based on a handful of factors including positive reviews number of reviews sales SEOquality copy and price a characteristic that enables the company to be especially competitive given its tolerance for microscopic marginsThese marketplaces always have new requirements things theyre testing said Neha Gajwani CEO of SmackTom which sells electronics accessories and more on Amazon and other platforms earlier this year All of that goes into where they put you in searchAmazon refines its search algorithm continuously and like a grocery store it has no obligation to treat its own products and competitors equally Neutral or not Amazon says that it is focused on providing a broad selection including both inhouse and independent brandsData quality and recognitionAmazons review system and generous return policy have allowed it to expand generics into hundreds of categories throughout its site Armed with a precise understanding of the products people search for Amazon can tailor its offeringsIf for example watt light bulbs or bocce ball sets become popular items  and they have good reviews and a low price  Amazon may give the product its coveted Amazons Choice badge in a search result There are also Best Seller badges The idea behind Amazons Choice is similar to the reviewing model used by the Wirecutter In short the model is This product works well for most peopleAmazons Mama Bear organic baby food AmazoncomMoreBut it has long been considered an open secret that besides using this data to give popular products a badge Amazon uses the data on what people are searching for buying and reviewing positively to jump in to provide its alternative especially if its an everyday product thats easy to get for a private labelGot a Hot Seller on Amazon asked one Bloomberg headline from  Prepare for ETailer to Make One TooThe open secret holds that if Amazon housebrand products dont already dominate these badges theyre probably strong possibilities for whats coming next Amazon launched its own pet food brand Wag in MayAmazon didnt directly confirm this open secret but told Yahoo Finance that the idea for inhouse products began by listening to and learning from customers to bring them products theyll likeAmazon declined to elaborate on its data use and about how many data scientists work on these projects but from CEO Jeff Bezoss comments in the past and Amazons behavior in product rollouts data likely plays a major roleThere is a right answer or a wrong answer a better answer or a worse answer and math tells us which is which These are our favorite kinds of decisions he wrote in a  letter to shareholders Quantitative analysis improves the customers experience and our cost structurePractically all manufacturers and retailers use data but Amazons datadriven approach may be the key to its successOn the Wirecutter Amazon brands have performed well earning prominent spots over the years in cables umbrellas paper shredders and spots on its travel guide As Courtney Schley wrote for the site in  Wetest AmazonBasics offerings whenever theyre relevant and even recommend its stuff as a top pick or alternate in our guides to paper shredders HDMI cables school backpacks and  other reviews as of this writingSchley advised consumers to read the customer reviews noting the quality for some was really good but poor for others Amazons lightning pace of adding products every month means a nearimpossible task for professional reviewers for sites like Wirecutter and the StrategistAlready consumers are able to wake up with their phone plugged into an Amazon cable in an Amazon charger in an Amazon power strip sitting next to their Rivet Amazon bedside table with an Amazon basics light with Pinzon Amazon sheets shave brush and shower with Solimo shampoo put on Amazon clothing and so on we havent even gotten  minutes into the day yet If growth continues as SunTrusts analyst thinks it

Milestone Celebration Dinner in Washington US September   REUTERSJoshua RobertsMoreBy Munsif Vengattil and Jeffrey DastinReuters  Jeff Bezos Amazoncom Incs AMZNO founder and the worlds richest person said on Thursday he will commit  billion to helping homeless families and starting preschools for lowincome communitiesThe announcement marks a deeper foray into philanthropy for Bezos whose fortune has soared to more than  billion thanks to his stake in Amazon Dominance in ecommerce and the nascent field of cloud computing has made Amazon the worlds secondmost valuable public companyBezos solicited ideas on Twitter last year for ways to donate some of his wealth While he has financially supported cancer research and scholarships for immigrants among other causes Bezos has primarily devoted his fortune to his Blue Origin rocket company which he described on Thursday as an investment in the future of our planet through the development of foundational space infrastructureHis private ownership of The Washington Post which has published articles critical of the White House has also put him at odds with US President Donald TrumpThe new philanthropic effort is called the Bezos Day One Fund a nod to the executives management philosophy that organizations must view every day with the fervor of a new start or face stagnation and declineWithin this the Day  Families Fund will support existing nonprofit organizations that offer shelter and food to young homeless familiesThe Day  Academies Fund will start an organization to operate a new network of fullscholarship preschools for lowincome communities Citing the Amazon mantra of customer obsession Bezos said in a tweet httpstwittercomJeffBezosstatus The child will be the customerBezos said in remarks to the Economic Club of Washington that it is really really hard for a child to catch up if they fall behind in their early years The money will pay gigantic dividends for decadesHe said he did not know how much money he would eventually give awayBezos has yet to join The Giving Pledge created by fellow billionaires Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett whose more than  signatories have promised to give more than half of their fortunes to philanthropyThe Amazon chiefs wealth has become problematic for someEarlier this month US Senator Bernie Sanders a selfdescribed democratic socialist proposed

amazons allnew echo is a more attractive smart assistant
New Amazon Echo reviewYahooSearchNo matching results for Tip Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsGive feedback on the new search experienceCancelSign inMailFinanceWatchlistsMy PortfolioScreenersMarketsIndustriesVideosNewsPersonal FinanceTechUS Markets closedSP Dow NasdaqRussell Crude OilGoldSilverEURUSDAmazons allnew Echo is a more attractive smart assistantDaniel HowleyTechnology Editor Yahoo FinanceOctober  ReblogShareTweetShareThe new Amazon Echo packs an improved design and enhanced audioMoreBack in late  I was highly skeptical when Amazon AMZN introduced its Amazon Echo and Alexa voice assistant After all who would want a speaker in their homes they could talk toIt turns out a lot of people Enough in fact for Amazon to launch five more smart speakers since then including the allnew Echo Available now for   thats less than the originals  price tag  the new Echo improves upon both its predecessors looks and performanceIts a great buy for consumers who are just getting into the smart assistant market However there might not be much reason for existing users to upgrade since the cloudbased Alexa gets all the same improved functionality in both the new and old versions of the EchoAn Echo thats at home in your homeThe original Echo stood out for both its impressive capabilities as a smart speaker and almost alien design Amazon crafted the Echo in the shape of a tall black cylinder that was instantly recognizable But as competitors like Googles GOOG GOOGL Home and Apples AAPL upcoming HomePod opt for more traditionally decorative designs Amazon is adjusting the Echos lookThe new Echo is still a cylinder but its squatter than the original And like Googles Home which has a customizable base the Echo now has an interchangeable shell that you can fit to your homes style The base shells come in black or grey fabric and are genuinely attractive I can see both easily fitting in on my end table or night stand I can also see my cats deciding to tear into them like they did with my Google Homes fabric baseEvidence that my cats hate or love my Google HomeMoreIf you want a different look you can purchase walnut oak or silver finish shells for  a piece Replacing them is a snap You simply push the small indent in the bottom of the Echo and push the speaker out of the shell Slide it into your new one and youre all setUnlike the firstgeneration Echo this new version doesnt have a twistable volume ring at its top Instead Amazon has included volume up and down buttons Its not a big change and really makes no functional difference Still I liked the simplicity of being able to twist the top of the Echo to quickly adjust the volume when I needed to turn down Taylor Swift before the delivery guy got to my door and found me outAmazon did away with the Echos twisting top in favor of traditional volume buttonsMoreAmazon did however add an AUX jack to the new Echo which means you can connect it to any speaker Want to turn your big home entertainment center into a giant smart speaker Youve got itPump up the jamConsumers dont just use their smart speakers to talk to disembodied voices Theyre also solid standalone speakers for listening to music and podcasts But Amazon couldnt just release a new Echo with the same speakers as the previous model So the company upped the audio capabilities of the Echo by dropping in a inch subwoofer and inch tweeterStory continuesThe new Echo next to the older taller EchoMoreIm by no means an audiophile  I think the headphones that came with my smartphone are more than adequate  so Im not exactly picky when it comes to audio quality That said I found the new Echos speakers to be a bit clearer and deeper than the originalsIf youre the kind of person who needs the absolute best audio experience well the Echo probably isnt going to cut it But then thats what that AUX jack is forCan you hear me AlexaAmazon says the new Echo has improved beamforming microphones that allow it to hear your voice from farther away I live in a New York City apartment which means well theres not a ton of room to really put the Echos mics to the test I noticed it like other smart speakers had a bit of trouble hearing me over excessively loud music but both it and the older Echo picked up my voice with ease from a moderate distanceThe point is this Echo isnt going to blow away the last version which is great for owners of the originalThe Amazon Echo without its fabric shellMoreThat holds equally true when it comes to the new Echos overall capabilities The secondgeneration Echo can do everything its predecessor can That means you can call other Echo devices as well as people with the Alexa app make voice calls to your familys and friends mobile phones and landlines and set up multiroom listeningBoth Echos also have the ability to let you perform multiple tasks at once with one voice command You can for example say Alexa goodnight and it will run a set routine of tasks like lock the doors turn off the lights and more You can also train both Echos to recognize your voice so when you say Play my favorites playlist it will play your playlist and not your roommates The same feature also works with making calls So if you tell your Echo to call your Mom it will call your own mother and not your friendsShould you get itThe Amazon Echo is already the best smart speaker you can buy thanks to its ability to communicate with hundreds of connected devices as well as Amazons own massive online storeThe addition of a vastly improved design and slightly upgraded sound simply serve to make it a more attractive purchase for firsttime smart speaker buyers Should you ditch your current Echo for the gen  Not necessarilyId only suggest making the switch if youre sick of your current Echos look or you really want that AUX jack If not stick with your originalUpdate This post has been updated to reflect that the echo can make voice calls and recognize individual voicesMore from DanWhy Microsoft is playing nice with iPhones and AndroidThe biggest problem holding VR back right nowGoogle Pixel  and Pixel  XL review Android phones done

  CNN  It has the curves of a Lamborghini looks like something an astronaut might take into space and weighs only  ounces  
Amazons Kindle ereader is wireless and can hold about  books plus newspapers and magazines 
 Amazoncoms electronic Kindle reader  a device meant to remove the paper from the page and make reading both more convenient and ecofriendly  is celebrating its first birthday Released in November  the Kindle has sold more than a quarter million units Its texts account for  percent of Amazons book sales despite the fact that  titles  a tiny fraction of the books offered on the site  are available in digital form  While exact sales figures are hard to come by recent estimates have put the Kindles sales on par with other highprofile mobile devices in their first year Amazoncom says that the Kindle is currently sold out due to heavy demand   So what has spurred its success After all electronic books have been around in small numbers for about a decade Even Jeff Bezos Amazons founder and CEO has admitted that the book is elegantly suited to its purpose Its hard to improve on   One thing thats helped the Kindle is marketing Where other readers failed to connect with consumers the Kindle has excelled The mediasavvy Bezos has hardly been publicity shy gaining his electronic toy a level of exposure most CEOs couldnt begin to fathom You cant discount the prominence of having Amazon behind this says Paul Reynolds technology editor at Consumer Reports Jeff Bezos is respected for what hes done with Amazon and if he feels this is a future product in media people are willing to trust him

 Second the gadget has been heralded by Oprah Winfrey whose influence in the publishing world is immense Its also been embraced by some prominent writers including Nobel laureate Toni Morrison and bestselling thriller author James Patterson Third with more and more consumers accustomed to reading text on their cell phones and BlackBerrys the world finally may be ready for an electronic version of a book I checked it out on Amazon and thought it was an intriguing idea a great way to have a lot of books that dont take up a lot of space says Emily Branch of Florida who was moved to buy a Kindle after seeing the hosts of The View chatting about it I figured if I didnt like it I could return it within  days Branch says There wasnt a chance of that happening once I got it in my hands though    One clutterkilling Kindle can hold about  books And while other ereaders such as Sonys Reader must connect through a USB port to upload content the Kindle is a wireless device thanks to Whispernet which is powered by Sprints highspeed data network  I think the Whispernet is what sets the Kindle apart from all the other ereaders on the market says Leslie Nicoll of Portland Maine who coauthored The Amazon Kindle FAQ book after her techloving teenage daughter urged her to get a Kindle Like Branch Nicoll says she likes the Kindles lowimpact effect on her bookshelves I dont have to worry about giving it to someone else reselling it on Amazon or finding a place to store it in my house she says For the enjoyment and convenience it has given me in the past seven months I consider that it has paid for itself already  Readers can visit Amazons online store and upload a new book right to their Kindle Subscribers also can have electronic versions of The New York Times and other newspapers and magazines delivered automatically to their Kindles in time for reading with their morning cup of coffee  The large and tightly interacting collection of Kindle features that go far beyond those of any other previous eBook attempt will cause the Kindle to be the first eBook to succeed wrote one reviewer on an Amazon discussion board But not everything in Kindle world is roses and gumdrops Theres a difference between modest early success and making a centuriesold print format obsolete The Kindle sells for  a steep price for the average reader in the current economic climate  Im not going to pay  for that I can get books for free says Nikki Johnson a college student in Atlanta Georgia speaking for traditionalists who are wary of giving up their bound paper volumes  Theres nothing like reading a nice paperback she says Theres nothing like holding or carrying a book having that tangible quality and it being more than just a piece of data So in an unforgiving economy and in a stubbornly oldfashioned medium will the Kindle ever expand from a tech novelty to a mainstream accessory It might be too soon to tell  Blockbuster writers such as JK Rowling author of the Harry Potter series have said theyll never allow their books to appear on the market in electronic form Yet future better versions of ereaders may seduce younger consumers who grew up on PSPs and iPhones A nextgeneration model of the Kindle is due in  Early reports indicate the new device will be thinner and will have fixed some current design bugs such as poorly placed buttons that cause readers to turn pages accidentally I think its certainly a ways away from hitting the mainstream  because of the price and the experience a reader gets from longform reading says Reynolds of Consumer Reports Whether these  are successful standalone devices remains to be seen From what Ive seen and heard I think the technology is here to stay

   Amazon Glitch caused gay censorship errorStory Highlights Amazon Move was caused by embarrassing hamfisted cataloguing error  Titles from authors such as Gore Vidal Annie Proulx lost bestseller ranking  Ranking is number that Amazon uses to show how well one title sells  Book titles removed from charts are gay and lesbianthemed Next Article in Technology    By  Paul Armstrong CNN 



 


 

  LONDON England CNN  Online retailer Amazon has said a system error caused it to remove a number of gay and lesbianthemed books from its sales charts 
American novelist Gore Vidal has long been known as a liberal intellectual 
 On Sunday a number of distinguished writers including Gore Vidal Annie Proulx and EM Forster suddenly lost their bestseller ranking  which is the number that Amazon uses to show how well one title sells compared with another As a result famous novels such as Proulxs Brokeback Mountain and Vidals The City and the Pillar were unranked Tuesday morning However Playboy The Complete Centerfolds by Chronicle Books which features pictures of over  naked women remains ranked  Amazon spokeswoman Patty Smith told CNN partner Web site CNET News that the glitch was being fixed but declined to elaborate This is an embarrassing and hamfisted cataloging error for a company that prides itself on offering complete selection she wrote in an email statement  It has been misreported that the issue was limited to Gay  Lesbian themed titles  in fact it impacted  books in a number of broad categories such as Health Mind  Body Reproductive  Sexual Medicine and Erotica the statement said  This problem impacted books not just in the United States but globally It affected not just sales rank but also had the effect of removing the books from Amazons main product search  Craig Seymour author of gay memoir All I Could Bare wrote in his blog craigspoplife that his sales rank was dropped earlier this year only to be restored after a month Amazon said his book had been classified as an adult product

 I brought this to the attention of my publisher and they started looking into it Seymour wrote I also did some snooping around and it turned out that the only books I could find without a sales rank had gay content like mine   Thousands of users have voiced their concerns online with many accusing the retail giant of blatant censorship This prompted Amazon to deny the move was part of a strategy to make the chart more family friendly It said the changes were caused by a glitch in the system  The ranking removal appeared to depend on how Amazon originally categorized each book  According to the Guardian newspaper a paperback edition of British broadcaster and actor Stephen Frys autobiography Moab Is My Washpot which Amazon tags as gay is unranked whereas the original hardback filed under memoir is   The issue quickly became a hot topic over the weekend among Twitter users In conversations under the hash tag amazonfail people tagged hundreds of titles affected by the apparent glitch Others simply mocked the etailer Share your views here Looks like Amazon did a government style uturn Of course it was an error yes was the sardonic response from Jonnyp Houseinrlyeh meanwhile said apologies work best when they contain an actual apology and not just an explanation   Nara Filippon was one of the many outraged Facebook users to make their feelings known on various discussion boards After describing herself as a loyal customer she said Unfortunately your new policy to ban LGBT books has disappointed me and I wont be buying anything else from your Web site from now onwards Wendy Sumner Winter who described herself as a straight college professor said I am sickened to see that the powersthatbe have deranked some of my favorite authors and their books including James Baldwin are you serious Mark Doty and Paul Lisicky

 WikiLeaks Amazon and the new threat to internet speech By Rebecca MacKinnon Special to CNN      STORY HIGHLIGHTSRebecca MacKinnon says many differ on whether media should publish WikiLeaks cablesWhats troubling she says is that Sen Joe Lieberman can get Amazon to dump it from serverShe asks What are private sectors responsibilities to prevent erosion of free speechWriter Future of free speech on internet turns on companies accountability to public interestEditors note Rebecca MacKinnon is a Bernard L Schwartz Senior Fellow at the New America Foundation cofounder of the international bloggers network Global Voices Online and a founding member of the Global Network Initiative Her book Consent of the Networked will be published late next year by Basic Books  CNN  In the physical world WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is a wanted man In the virtual world his website is under attack and on the run There isnt much question that the person who obtained the WikiLeaks cables from a classified US government network broke US law and should expect to face the consequences The legal rights of a website that publishes material acquired from that person however are much more controversial There are many prominent Americans  and a great many ordinary Americans  who have made their views clear over the past week that WikiLeaks cablegate website should not be considered constitutionally protected speech  Others however believe equally strongly that now that the material is out news media and website owners have the right to publish the material What is troubling and dangerous is that in the internet age public discourse increasingly depends on digital spaces created owned and operated by private companies The result is that one politician has more power than ever to shut down controversial speech unilaterally with one phone call After suffering aggressive cyber attacks last weekend Assange removed his cablegate site from servers in Sweden and purchased a new home for it on Amazons web hosting service On Tuesday Amazon talked on the phone with the office of Sen Joe Lieberman chairman of the Senates committee on homeland security

Shortly thereafter Amazon booted WikiLeaks The senator responded with a statement I wish that Amazon had taken this action earlier based on WikiLeaks previous publication of classified material The companys decision to cut off WikiLeaks now is the right decision and should set the standard for other companies WikiLeaks is using to distribute its illegally seized material This is not the first time Lieberman has demanded that an American internet company take down controversial material Last time the outcome was different In  Lieberman wrote to Google CEO Eric Schmidt demanding immediate removal of content produced by Islamist terrorist organizations from YouTube  While YouTube did remove a few videos that violated community guidelines against violence and hate speech it refused to remove most of them Googles lawyers determined that the material Lieberman wanted removed while upsetting to many Americans was clearly protected under the First Amendment While we respect and understand Liebermans views YouTube encourages free speech and defends everyones right to express unpopular points of view Schmidt wrote in his response  He continued We believe YouTube is a richer and more relevant platform for users precisely because it hosts a diverse range of views and rather than stifle debate we allow our users to view all acceptable content and make up their own minds The New York Times editorial page chimed in While it is fortunate that Mr Lieberman does not have the power to tell YouTube that it must remove videos it is profoundly disturbing that an influential senator would even consider telling a media company to shut down constitutionally protected speech Amazons dumping of WikiLeaks at one senators request brings into stark relief one of the core problems Americans have grappled with since before our country even existed Where is the right balance between security on one hand and civil liberties on the other   We have always disagreed passionately Much of American politics and a large number of constitutional battles center on this question One might even argue that our political and legal systems are designed to enable this argument to continue indefinitely as new technologies and challenges arise But the WikiLeaks Amazon case also highlights a new problem for American democracy  and ultimately for the future of freedom and democracy more globally A substantial if not critical amount of our political discourse has moved into the digital realm This realm is largely made up of virtual spaces that are created owned and operated by the private sector As far as the law is concerned Amazon is off the hook Speech within the kingdom of Amazonia  run by its sovereign Jeff Bezos and his board of directors with help from the wise counsel and judgment of the companys executives  is not protected in the same way that speech is constitutionally protected in Americas public spaces  The law gives Amazon the right to set its own rules The companys terms of service clearly state that it reserves the right to refuse service terminate accounts remove or edit content in its sole discretion By clicking agree the customer has legally consented to represent and warrant that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to the content and that said content will not cause injury to any person or entity Given that citizens are increasingly dependent on privately owned spaces for our politics and public discourse however the fight over how speech should be governed in a democracy is focused increasingly on questions of how private companies should or shouldnt control speech conducted on and across their networks and platforms We are facing new questions on which Americans have no clear consensus and which were not covered in civics class How will decisions made by private internet and telecommunications companies about what content they will or wont allow affect the ability of citizens to carry out informed debate on important matters of public concern What are the private sectors obligations and responsibilities to prevent the erosion of democracy While Amazon was within its legal rights the company has nonetheless sent a clear signal to its users If you engage in controversial speech that some individual members of the US government dont like  even if there is a strong case to be made that your speech is constitutionally protected  Amazon is going to dump you at the first sign of trouble Lets hope that there will always be other companies willing to stand up for our rights as enshrined both in the US Constitution and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  and by extension their right to do business with us  The future of freedom in the internet age may well depend on whether we the people can succeed in holding companies that now act as arbiters of the public discourse accountable to the public interest The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Rebecca MacKinnon

  CNN  Researchers have produced aerial photos of jungle dwellers who they say are among the few remaining peoples on Earth who have had no contact with the outside world 



 Taken from a small airplane the photos show men outside thatched communal huts necks craned upward pointing bows toward the air in a remote corner of the Amazonian rainforest The National Indian Foundation a government agency in Brazil published the photos Thursday on its Web site It tracks uncontacted tribes  indigenous groups that are thought to have had no contact with outsiders  and seeks to protect them from encroachment More than  uncontacted tribes remain worldwide and about half live in the remote reaches of the Amazonian rainforest in Peru or Brazil near the recently photographed tribe according to Survival International a nonprofit group that advocates for the rights of indigenous people All are in grave danger of being forced off their land killed or decimated by new diseases the organization said Thursday Illegal logging in Peru is threatening several uncontacted groups pushing them over the border with Brazil and toward potential conflicts with about  uncontacted Indians living on the Brazilian side Survival International said Its director Stephen Cory said the new photographs highlight the need to protect uncontacted people from intrusion by the outside world These pictures are further evidence that uncontacted tribes really do exist Cory said in a statement The world needs to wake up to this and ensure that their territory is protected in accordance with international law Otherwise they will soon be made extinct 




   The photos released Thursday show men who look strong and healthy the Brazilian government said They and their relatives apparently live in six communal shelters known as malocas according to the government which has tracked at least four uncontacted groups in the region for the past  years  Watch a report on the tribe  The photos were taken during  hours of flights conducted between April  and May

  Life of Pis Yann Martel blogs from Amazon BasinStory Highlights Author Yann Martel blogs for CNN from the Amazonian basin in Peru  On a threeweek trek with Cape Farewell to see impact of climate change  Trek involves  artists and scientists started June  ends July    First Cape Farewell land expedition after seven voyages to the High ArcticNext Article in World    By  Yann Martel Author 



 


 

 Yann Martel awardwinning author of the Life of Pi has spent the last three weeks trekking in the Andes mountains in Peru Hes there with Cape Farewell a British organization that aims to increase awareness of climate change by taking artists and musicians to see its impact first hand Here he writes exclusively for CNN PUERTO MALDONADO Peru  I am writing these words in Puerto Maldonado a hot and bustling town in the southeast of Peru 
The team of  artists and scientists prepare to camp overnight near the Humantay Glacier Lake 
 The town is bustling because its economic prospects look good It lies near fields of oil and gas gold mining has been going on in the nearby rivers for years tourism brings in its share of revenue and  the final blessing  the paving of the InterOceanic Highway is nearly complete This highway links Peru to South Americas economic superpower Brazil and will make commerce with Puerto Maldonado easier and more appealing So the future looks bright right Not quite Why Because Puerto Maldonado sits in the Amazonian basin The town is surrounded by the greatest biodiversity this planet has to offer The average hectare of North American forest contains five species of trees The average hectare of forest in the Amazon boasts over two hundred A single tree here may be home to over a hundred species of termites Professor Yadvinder Malhi of Oxford University an expert on ecology told me that likely  percent of animal species in the Amazon rainforest are still unknown to science Life here is so abundant its claustrophobic and overwhelming

Climate change report Seasons have changed


 But its not indestructible And thats why Im here with others from the Cape Farewell project Cape Farewell is a British NGO that brings together artists and climate change scientists The scientists come to work the artists come to watch learn and eventually each in his or her own way to react The aim is to broaden the dialogue about climate change so that it becomes a broader cultural issue involving each of us in a wholeperson way beyond the narrower strictures of politics or science   Cape Farewell has organized a number of expeditions to the Arctic that canary in the coalmine when it comes to climate change Witness of these expeditions can be found on the organizations excellent Web site This trip to Peru has been the first organized by Cape Farewell to look at the effects of climate change in the tropics Its been a memorable trip We started high and dry at  feet to be exact camping near some fastdisappearing Andean glaciers not far from Cusco and weve been moving steadily downwards in the last three weeks to the low and the very wet
