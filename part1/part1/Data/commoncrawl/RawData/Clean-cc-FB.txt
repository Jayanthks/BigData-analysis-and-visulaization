feedback on the new search experienceCancelSign inMailFinanceWatchlistsMy PortfolioScreenersMarketsIndustriesVideosNewsPersonal FinanceTechUS Markets closedSP Dow NasdaqRussell Crude OilGoldSilverEURUSDFacebook Bankers Secretly Cut Facebooks Revenue Estimates In Middle Of IPO RoadshowHenry BlodgetDaily TickerMay  ReblogShareTweetShareFollow The Daily Ticker on FacebookAnd now comes some news about the Facebook FB IPO that buyers deserve to be outraged aboutReuters Alistair Barr is reporting that Facebooks lead underwriters Morgan Stanley MS JP Morgan JPM and Goldman Sachs GS all cut their earnings forecasts for the company in the middle of the IPO roadshowThis by itself is highly unusual Ive never seen it during  years in and around the tech IPO businessBut just as important news of the estimate cut was passed on only to a handful of big investor clients not everyone else who was considering an investment in FacebookThis is a huge problem for one big reasonSelective dissemination Earnings forecasts are material information especially when they are prepared by analysts who have had privileged access to company management As lead underwriters on the IPO these analysts would have had much better information about the company than anyone else So the fact that these analysts suddenly all cut their earnings forecasts at the same time during the roadshow and then this information was not passed on to the broader public is a huge problemAny investor considering an investment in Facebook would consider an estimate cut from the underwriters analysts material informationWhats more its likely that news of these estimate cuts dampened interest in the IPO among those who heard about them Reuters reported exactly thisthat some institutions were freaked out by the estimate cuts as anyone would have beenIn other words during the marketing of the Facebook IPO investors who did not hear about these underwriter estimate cuts were placed at a meaningful and unfair information disadvantage They did not know what a lot of other investors knew and they suffered for itSelective dissemination of this sort could be a direct violation of securities laws Irrespective of its legality it is also grossly unfair The SEC should investigate this immediatelyWe first heard rumblings about this last week and we were so startled that we assumed the reports were wrong Then over the weekend when Reuters reported the basic story again we said that if it was true Facebook IPO buyers deserved to be mad as hell about it And now Reuters has the details and they sound as bad as we had fearedThere are a couple of possibilities for what happenedThe first one is bad news for Morgan Stanley and the other lead underwriters on the dealThe second is also bad news for FacebookAccording to Reuters the underwriter analysts cut their estimates after Facebook issued an amended IPO prospectus in which the company mentioned vaguely that recent trends in which users were growing faster than revenue had continued into the second quarterTo those experienced in reading financial statements this language was unnerving because its mere existence could have been taken to mean that Facebooks revenue in the second quarter wasnt coming in as strong as Facebook had hoped why else would the language have suddenly been added at the th hourTo those who arent experienced at reading filings however the real meaning of this language could easily have been missed Facebooks users have been growing faster than revenue for a while so why would it be news that this was continuingIn response to the amendment meanwhile all three lead underwriter analysts suddenly cut their estimatesNow regardless of why the analysts cut their estimates and this will be important estimate cuts of any sort are material information so if this news was given to some institutional clients it also obviously should have been given to everyoneThats the first problemThe second potential question and problem is whether Facebook told the underwriters to cut their estimateseither by directly telling them to or more likely by suggesting that the analysts might want to revisit their estimates in light of the new disclosures in the prospectusIf there was any communication at all between Facebook and its underwriters regarding the analysts estimates Facebook will likely be on the hook for this tooSpeaking as a former analyst it seems highly unlikely to me that the vague language in the final IPO amendment would prompt all three underwriter analysts to immediately cut estimates without some sort of nod and wink from someone who knew how Facebooks second quarter was progressing To get this message from the language you really have to read between the lines But even if this is what happened it is still unfair that news of the estimate cut wasnt disseminated quickly and clearly to everyone considering buying Facebooks IPOThe bottom line is that even if dissemination laws were followed to the letter which frankly seems unlikely the selective disclosure here was grossly unfairStory continuesThe SEC needs to look into thisAnd as it does the SEC should also revisit the practice that allows underwriter analysts to develop estimates that are used to market IPOs to institutional clients but are not shared with the public In Europe research analysts publish full reports on companies BEFORE they go public This is a much better system and the US should switch to it But at the very least the SEC should mandate that any information given to some clients eg earnings estimates and changes in earnings estimates be given to all clients ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is emptyWhat to Read Next Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks

Watch on MarketWide WeaknessJames Brumley Contributing Writer KiplingercomKiplingerOctober  ReblogShareTweetShareGetty ImagesSeveral companies that have been redhot over the past few months have suddenly become stocks to watch for all the wrong reasonsStocks do suffer setbacks from time to time Too many investors have forgotten it largely thanks to the markets mostly unfettered advance since  But we caught a brief glimpse of that reality in early  when the Standard  Poors stock index fell roughly  from its peak The biggerpicture backdrop was so overwhelmingly bullish however that investors were quick to forget it and rekindle the rallyThis more recent stumble in October was a notsogentle reminder that stocks arent bulletproof Indeed equities  still up  since early April and headed into a time of year known for marketwide weakness  appear ripe for the bearish pressures of heavy profittaking And some stocks that have outperformed their peers of late suddenly seem more vulnerable than othersHere are a dozen stocks to watch that may well take the biggest hits should the market tide turn fully bearish Theyve been big winners of late but they dont appear to have the kind of staying power they need to hold their ground when things get rockySEE ALSO  Companies Already Hurt by President Trumps TariffsFacebookGetty ImagesMarket value  billionFacebook FB  has been contending with some noncyclical problems of late putting serious selling pressure on the stock The  loss from its July peak however may only be part of its repricing should the markets broad tide worsen any furtherMuch of Facebooks weakness has been spurred by its own hand such as the fallout from the Cambridge Analytica debacle There have been other external drivers too including the possibility that the company is nearing its maximum user headcount Whatever the case the collective impact of Facebooks headwinds prompted Chief Financial Officer David Wehner to caution a quarter ago that the company expects revenue growth rates to decline by high singledigit percentages from prior quartersWehner also warned that operating margins likely would fall from Qs  to somewhere in the mid area in the foreseeable futureFurther fanning the selling flames is a frothy valuation that was deliberately dismissed for too long Even after losing  of their value FB shares trade at nearly  times trailing earnings and  times  profit expectations that may be too optimisticCombine all that with the increasingly troubling market backdrop and Facebook is among a handful of megacap stocks to watch as potential liabilitiesSEE ALSO Millionaires in America All  States RankedNetflixStory continuesCourtesy NetflixMarket value  billionNetflix NFLX  is undeniably a story stock bid up to nosebleed valuations based on its premise and hopes for significant profits in the future  at the expense of comfortable nearterm resultsThe dynamic works when things are good But when the backdrop turns rocky the fragility of mere stories  rather than actual results  becomes a liabilityDespite the stocks  advance so far this year the pros maintain their price target of  up another  from current levels They also still mostly rate it a buy even if not an outright strong buy That optimism also may quickly turn into a liability however if traders start seeing the Netflix glass as halfempty In that case that trailing pricetoearnings ratio of  starts to look really really ugly and the potential for downgrades adds to the threatAnother pitfall could just as easily put Netflix shares into a nosedive in the foreseeable future Should subscriber growth come up short again as it did a quarter ago investors may assume its a sign that Netflixs service is within reach of saturationSEE ALSO  SellRated Stocks to

shares are up more than  since Aprils low and are up nearly  since the end of  in anticipation of sales growth that ended up panning outSooner or later though Advanced Micro Devices must turn that revenue into a respectable profit Its not clear whether AMD will be able to do that well enough to justify a forwardlooking PE ratio of Rival Intel INTC admittedly was caught unaware by AMDs overhaul

relationship management platform provider Salesforcecom CRM  has been pegged as a buyout candidate for a while now However it has largely sidestepped any prospective overtures by being a buyer  of companies including MuleSoft and Demandware  more than dressing itself up as a buyeeInvestors have loved all the growth organic and inorganic alike that dealmaking has driven CRM shares are up a whopping  so far this year even factoring in the stocks recent weakness theyve roughly doubled since the end of Those bulls may have gotten ahead of themselves Salesforcecoms revenues are projected to rise  this year and another  in  while pershare earnings are expected to improve from  in  to  this year and  next But the stocks current valuation is nearly impossible to justify outside of the nowwaning market euphoria CRM is priced at  times its forwardlooking earnings and traders are taking notice hence the  slide in just two weeks And the bears might not be done repricing Salesforcecom to reflect newly realized market risksSEE ALSO  LowCost Gold ETFsAdvance Auto PartsCourtesy Mike Mozart via FlickrMarket value  billionAdvance Auto Parts AAP  is a company that has been strangely resilient of late defying the broad tide But its still just as prone to a pullback amid greater weakness and has more to pay the piper than its peers should the ball get rollingBy almost all accounts Advance Auto Parts should be fighting a losing battle Not only is it competing with Amazoncom AMZN its fighting a war against more durable longerlasting vehicles Newcar sales may be slowing but with so many barely used cars on the road and much older vehicles still working just fine repairs and maintenance needs are minimizedThe proof is in the numbers Advance Auto Parts revenues and operating income have been down more often than not since late  Yet AAP shares are up  yeartodate translating into an uncomfortably frothy forwardlooking PE of   and have given up very little ground since the end of August despite all the red flagsDont blindly rely on this apparent strength This may be a case where the wouldbe sellers havent gotten around to tearing into Advance Auto Parts and are instead waiting on just the right trigger With so much pentup downside however AAP could get hard in one sweeping selloffSEE ALSO  of the Markets Most Shorted StocksIlluminaCourtesy IlluminaMarket value

CINF sharesTripAdvisorGetty ImagesMarket value  billionTripAdvisor TRIP  already was in trouble before the market bumped into a headwind While TripAdvisor still is a destination within the online travelbooking arena its role and value are being increasingly questioned by at least a couple of its biggest customers Bookingcom BKNG and Expedia EXPEMany consumers assume all these companies are doing the same thing in competition with one another Thats not exactly the case Expedia and Booking rely on TripAdvisor to connect its customers with their clients and they pay TripAdvisor for those referralsAs time marches on though Expedia Bookingcom and their peers increasingly dont need TripAdvisor to serve as a middleman Meanwhile Alphabet GOOGL division Google  which has been in this business for a while  just rolled out a few more tools that allow it to more effectively act as an online travel agentBoth are problematic for the beleaguered TripAdvisor But more than that its a

several other similar platforms before that deal and even a couple more in the meantime all in the name of greater scale that would lead to wider profit marginsBut online consumer services is an increasingly crowded market with an increasingly limited potential for profit growth And IACs strategy hasnt worked out all that well Some would say it hasnt worked at allMost growth has been inorganic and losses on operating and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles bases remain the norm That might be a key part of why CEO Chris Terrill will be stepping down at the end of this year and passing the torch to the companys chief product officer Brandon Ridenour But ANGI may not have a personnel problem  it may the product or products itself that is the crux of the companys growth challengesBetween the sheer disruption of a CEO transition and the lingering doubts incited by the change the  stumble ANGI shares have suffered since the Ridenour announcement may only be the beginning of the stocks weaknessCarvanaGetty ImagesMarket value  billionUsedcar sales venue Carvana CVNA  already is feeling the pressure of a cyclical slowdown in automobile sales If the broad market hits a speedbump it may feel worse than it really is but itll still feel bad enough to bring Carvana to a screeching haltPeak auto in the United States was a real thing marked by an annualized sales pace of  million new cars in November  That peak caused a ripple effect spurring the turnins of millions of barely used vehicles before and after the newcar mania Now both face a slowdown most anyone who wanted to purchase a new or relatively unused automobile now has oneCarvana still is growing its top line though the pace of growth has diminished over the past couple quarters Meanwhile the company has logged a net loss in each of those two quarters pulling it back into red ink  something CVNA hadnt planned on happeningThat brewing concern is a big part of the reason CVNA has peeled back roughly  from the high hit in September But with  yeartodate gains still in its pocket Carvana is one of several stocks to watch for continued profittaking potentialSEE ALSO  Smart Financial Moves You Can Make in an Hour or LessTwilioGetty ImagesMarket value  billionTwilio TWLO  has had an amazing  Shares were up more than  for the year at one point and even the recent pullback leaves TWLO with an impressive  gainBut like Carvana those big gains leave Twilio vulnerable to further downsideTwilio offers businesses a variety of cloudbased services ranging from login authentications to text marketing to callrouting and more Theres clearly a growing market for such services as the world becomes increasingly digital and consumers are increasingly connected to their smartphones This paradigm shift and Twilios real solutions made for an easy bullish argumentThe bulls have arguably gotten more than a little overzealous however TWLO shares are trading at nearly  times next years adjusted earnings estimates and at  times the companys trailing month sales The marketwide PS average is a bit below Translation Even if Twilio squeezes the most profit it possibly can out of its revenue its still going to be valued well beyond the norm Investors are more apt to sell off such wildly overpriced stocks if the market gets any hairierIridium CommunicationsGetty ImagesMarket value  billionIridium Communications IRDM  isnt exactly a household name but that doesnt make it any less vulnerable to a setback The stock is up more than  from Mays low despite a sizable pullback since the end of September so theres room for profittakers to plow in Theres reason tooIridium Communications makes and market satellitebased communications solutions It names the US government as a customer but it also offers services to and with private enterprises Its partnering with Amazoncom for instance to codevelop a platform that will power the Internet of ThingsBusiness has been stable but not impressive It hasnt recorded sustained revenue growth since  and operating income has been slipping since So why this years big rally Investors as they usually do are looking past the present into the future The market believes Iridiums Amazon partnership could become a model for similar deals rekindling revenue and profit growth for good That may happenBut the difference between the companys GAAP and nonGAAP adjusted earnings is difficult to handicap and investors tend to be forgiving of actual losses when the backdrop turns bleak Never even mind that nonGAAP profits are currently edging

Facebook NASDAQFB had been one of the best FANG performers during December a surprise to many investors given how poorly the name has done since JulyThe sentiment is starting to charge not only around Facebook stock but around stocks in general That has left investors wondering if now may be the time to get long the social media giantAfter all Facebook possesses platforms like Instagram and WhatsApp not to mention its own legacy platform Thanks to its rich vault of user data its able to offer advertisers pinpoint accuracy when it comes to targeted ad searches For years that paved the way to enormous growth at Facebook not to mention its huge marginsInvestorPlace  Stock Market News Stock Advice  Trading TipsThe company has been under attack this year though The media has been slugging Facebook left and right for its questionable data use and business practices while management hasnt exactly been upbeat That has put a beating on the stock as youll see in the two charts belowTrading FB Stockchart of FB stockMore Click to EnlargeA look at the month weekly chart shows how quickly Facebook stock price has retreated Shares sank from almost  at its highs in July to sub last month From peak to trough were talking about a roughly  decline   Stocks You Can Set and Forget Even In This Market  Thats a bigtime beating for what was one of the markets bestperforming stocks over the last few years After falling below the week moving average in December FB stock has regained this level In fact its pushing over downtrend resistance purple line as well as the week moving average Thats an encouraging sign for bulls and if the market can maintain momentum FB stock could be ready to make a large move perhaps back to the ish levelWe can also see that momentum is slowly progressing to a potentially bullish setup highlighted by the blue circle at the bottom Should resistance succeed and knock FB back down I want to see if  holds as support If it doesnt  could be on the tablechart of FB stockMore Click to EnlargeOn the shortterm chart above we see Facebook stock poking over the day moving average However its near downtrend resistance blue line and just below the day moving average Over the day and FB stock will look much better and it could pave the way to a rally up to the  to  areaUltimately I need to see what levels hold up as support for FB rather than what levels hold up as resistance Resistance gives bears a lowrisk shorting opportunity but those looking to buy need to know what level is safe Right now thats not entirely clear I would love to see FB hold this  to  area on a marketwide pullbackBottom Line on Facebook StockFacebook has a lot of positives despite floating in a sea of negatives at the moment It owns some of the internets most prized possessions and makes plenty of money in the process However the company has very much become a proveit storyThe proveit thesis holds solid ground on the technicals as you can see above Facebook stock literally has to prove to investors that it has what it takes to rally and that means it has to get out of this nasty downtrend On the fundamental front management needs to prove it can achieve growthWhile  will probably still be a solid year for Facebook fundamentally  is not the same Facebook is forecast to grow sales and earnings about  this year In  earnings expectations slow to just  growth despite almost  revenue growth That leaves FB stock at about  times this years earningsStory continuesNot an outrageous valuation but without a return to earnings growth investors wont want to pay up to own

Put Facebooks Returns to ShameTimothy Green Travis Hoium and Jeremy Bowman The Motley FoolMotley FoolJuly  ReblogShareTweetShareFacebook NASDAQ FB has been a winner for investors steadily moving higher since the social media network went public in  The stock is up about  overall and its more than doubled over the past three yearsBut Facebook is facing some problems adata privacy scandal thats still unfolding leading to investigations from the FTC and SEC evidence that teens have little interest in using Facebook and a valuation that bakes in some optimistic assumptions about growth and profitabilityIf you want to invest in a stock that could outperform Facebook in the coming years three of our Foolcom contributors have some ideas Heres why you should take a look at Proto Labs NYSE PRLB Walmart NYSE WMT and Axon EnterpriseNASDAQ AAXNThe Facebook app on a smartphoneMoreImage source FacebookA new kind of manufacturing companyTravis Hoium Proto Labs Its no small feat to upend the manufacturing industry but thats exactly what Proto Labs is doing The company is making it easier to develop products with rapid prototyping tools like D printing CNC machiningand smallbatch injection molding These are valuable tools as product development cycles get shorter and companies need ondemand services to quickly expand production test materials and offer customization all more quickly than traditional manufacturing methodsPRLB Revenue TTM ChartMorePRLB Revenue TTM data by YChartsThe financial growth Proto Labs has shown from its rapid prototyping model speaks for itself Over the last decade both revenue and net income are up over  and show no sign of slowing down The company continues to add both manufacturing facilities and capabilities for rapid prototyping that make it more useful to designersIts also technology agnostic adding and subtracting technology and tooling as necessary rather than betting its future on one technology that may go out of favorWhere I think Proto Labs has a durable advantage over the competition is as a preferred supplier to the key decision makers in the design process Its not trying to sell D printers to consumers or schools a mistake D printer manufacturers made Instead Proto Labs is working directly with the designers building parts and making manufacturing decisions If the company is able to please those customers itll be able to build on its already solid foundation and generate outstanding returns for investors in the long termStory continuesA retail resurgenceTim Green Walmart With Facebook valued at around  billion and facing investigations into its lax data security I dont think its a stretch to say that the stock may be in for a rough ride Walmart the megaretailer thats reinventing itself for the age of ecommerce could end up producing better returns for investorsYou may not consider Walmart to be a growth stock but I think thats a mistake Comparablestore sales have been steadily growing for years at a time when the retail industry is going through a reckoning Walmarts online business is also booming with the company expecting around  growth this year Online grocery as well as free twoday shipping are helping to drive customers to the retail chainBecause Walmart is so big even modest growth translates into big increases in sales With about  billion of annual revenue each percentage point of growth leads to  billion of additional revenue The bottom line is taking a hit as the company invests in ecommerce but the end result will be an even bigger retailer with a solid foothold in online retailIf you think Amazon is going to dominate online retail indefinitely I think youre in for a surprise Walmart should not be counted out If the company can keep growing its ecommerce sales at a brisk pace while maintaining the solid performance of its stores the stock could be a winner over the next few yearsAn emerging security leaderJeremy Bowman Axon EnterpriseFacebook has become one of the biggest companies in the world thanks to its dominance of social media the power of network effects and platforms like Instagram and WhatsApp which create a multiplier effectAxon Enterprise the company formerly known as TASER International and maker of the eponymous stun gun has many similar qualities in its industry security and law enforcementLike Facebook Axon is the market leader in its own niche of conducted electrical weapons better known as Tasers However thats not the companys only business as its also the leader body cameras which are growing more popular amid controversy over police shootings and violenceIt also has its own cloudbased digital evidence management software Evidencecom Those three business components support and reinforce each other to create a tight web of network effects as the information from body cameras incar video and audio recordings can easily be uploaded onto the Evidencecom databaseThat combination of businesses has delivered solid growth for Axon Revenue increased  in its most recent quarter to  million and its operating margin nearly doubled from  a year ago to  That margin expansion is due to its software and sensors segment and should continue as Evidencecom is a subscriptionbased business a model that naturally expands as it draws more users As a result adjusted earnings per share in the quarter more than doubled from  to Thanks to a surge after both of its earnings reports this year Axon shares are up a whopping  so far in  but with a potent combination of businesses and the increasing need for security and evidence

Will Go Up   and BeyondWill HealyInvestorPlaceMay  ReblogShareTweetShareFacebook Inc NASDAQFB has begun to rise again The Facebook stock chart took a beating following the Cambridge Analytica scandal However with a solid earnings report FB stock gained some of that value back Now as FB recovers from the lowered focus on ads and Cambridge Analytica FB again resumes its growth path FB currently trades  below its week high I believe FB can recoup lost advertising revenue and gain the  back in the near term for three reasonsReason  Less EmotionDriven TradingThe year  has proven itself to be a roller coaster ride for the Facebook stock chart As many might recall the downward moves on the Facebook stock chart began with negative FB stock news CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the FB News Feed would have more of a friends and family focus The equity sold off further on Facebooks alleged role in influencing the  presidential electionHowever traders need to exercise perspective in this regard InvestorPlacesJosh Enomoto correctly stated that traders made an emotiondriven decision in selling off FB The theory that Russian hackers influenced the outcome of the  Presidental election has persisted in the news cycle for months For that reason stock analysts might understand why even the hint of involvement from the social media giant might motivate investors to sell the stockInvestorPlace  Stock Market News Stock Advice  Trading Tips   SmallCap Stocks With LargeCap Potential  Still I think sellers failed to see the big picture The idea that FB which is having to manage perceptions of anticonservative bias influenced the election in favor of President Trump comes across as lacking credibility Further as Enomoto stated in his analysis who did the actual voting Fortunately for FB stock investors the emotions that drove this downward move have begun to fadeReason  The Facebook Dating AppWhile arguments about Facebook influencing elections may lack credibility its strategic moves do not Much like its big tech counterpart Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN FB strikes fear amongst potential competitors Twitter Inc NASDAQTWTR and Snap Inc NYSESNAP have reeled under Facebooks competitive threat FBs next victim has become Match Group Inc NASDAQMTCH MTCH stock fell  upon Facebooks announcement of its dating appMTCH investors should be afraid FB already has the most of the data needed to present its users as dating prospects With the new app users will have an easier time filling out a profile Also they will not have to pay high fees to belong to a dating site This app serves as another powerful way to apply FBs massive data trove It also opens up a new avenue to sell ads Furthermore FB thrived through the years because users voluntarily handed over personal data A dating app gives users reasons to share more data  sometimes of a very personal nature  which FB could find more ways to monetizeReason  Compelling Chart and FundamentalsIf dating apps or the emotiondriven trading decision of recent months do not show FB stock as a buying opportunity perhaps other factors will The Facebook stock chart saw a dramatic reversal to the upside following earnings With the earnings beat both the moving average convergence divergence MACD and the stochastics indicate the uptrend has returnedEven after the  increase in earnings FB stock trades at a forward pricetoearnings PE ratio of  Moreover earnings estimates project an average annual growth rate exceeding  over the next three yearsThe Facebook stock chart and the fundamentals show FB can rise  to return to its week high More importantly it can return to the growth trajectory that has given FB one of the largest market caps in the worldConcluding Thoughts on FB StockFacebook stock will rise back to its week high and beyond for several reasons FB stock took a hit first by reducing ad space and second by its supposed role in the Cambridge Analytica scandalHowever both the earnings numbers and the stock chart show this correction in Facebook was driven by one thing  feelings The latest earnings report shows these feelings to be largely unfounded Moreover with the upcoming Facebook dating app Facebook will be wellpositioned to recoup lost ad revenue and gain new data which could they potentially monetize Furthermore the stock trades at a forward PE of about  and enjoys a nearterm earnings growth rate above   Warning  Stocks to Ditch in May and Go Away Including Tesla Inc  As for the question of Should I buy Facebook stock today both the fundamentals and the charts

 Stocks That Could Be Added to the Dow NextYahooSearchNo matching results for Tip Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsGive feedback on the new search experienceCancelSign inMailFinanceWatchlistsMy PortfolioScreenersMarketsIndustriesVideosNewsPersonal FinanceTechUS Markets closedSP Dow NasdaqRussell Crude OilGoldSilverEURUSD Stocks That Could Be Added to the Dow NextSean Williams The Motley FoolMotley FoolJuly  ReblogShareTweetShareWith the exception of the Dow Jones Transportation Average the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJINDICES DJI is Americas oldest and most prized stock index Despite a handful of glaring flaws including the Dows reliance on shareprice weighting as opposed to marketcap weighting many Wall Street professionals and retail traders look to the Dow for reassurance on the health of the US economy and stock marketChange is commonplace with Americas most watched stock index However over its year run as Americas most watched stock index the Dow has undergone plenty of change Originally introduced as a component index on May   it would later expand to  components in  and finally to the  components were familiar with today in  Just one of those  stocks in the Dow on its expansion date in October  still remains today ExxonMobil which back then was known as the Standard Oil Co of New JerseyA welcome mat lying on a deckMoreImage source Getty ImagesSince May   the Dow has undergone more than  component changes to the index A committee that meets a few times annually and decides whether or not to make changes attempts to present the best picture of the US economy using only  stocks This means packing the Dow with meaningful companies while also attempting to represent as many sectors and industries as possible Its not an easy task and any number of changes in a companys corporate structure via a merger spinoff or perhaps just poor performance could mean the removal of a Dow component from the indexRecently we witnessed industrial conglomerate General Electricget the boot from the Dow after what was a more than year run in the index ExxonMobil still has another  years to go if it wants to top that mark set by GE But General Electrics departure demonstrates that change is a relative constant in the DowEarlier this week I looked at the next three stocks that I believe have the best chance of being kicked out of the Dow with DowDuPontbeing my likeliest selection Considering that DowDuPont has plans to break up into three separate but focused companies by the first half of  its relevance in the Dow could fall prompting the SP Dow Jones Indices committee to show the industrial giant the doorWhich stocks could be added to the Dow next But the real question is Which stocks could be the next to join the DowWhile its nothing more than dart throwing at this point I have my eye on three possible substitutesA customer with a basket of fruit waiting in line at the supermarket to payMoreStory continuesImage source Getty ImagesCostco Wholesale With plenty of healthcare and technology sector representation in the Dow one interesting aspect about the index is that theres very little representation from the food industry Yes beverage giant CocaColaand fastcasual restaurant chain McDonaldsare part of the index but that doesnt tell us enough about the food industry or consumers buying habits Thats why I believe the addition of Costco Wholesale NASDAQ COST to the Dow would be a nice fitTo begin with approximately twothirds of Costcos sales are food items which would give the Dow a considerably more accurate representation of the food industrySecondly unlike a majority of retailers Costco isnt a company that relies on netting the bulk of its profit in two or three months out of the year Most of its margin is derived from a membership fee charged annually to customers who wish to shop at its warehouses This membership fee actually allows Costcos profits to frontrun consumer purchases as opposed to lagging those purchases as is common with mallbased retailers That should allow for earnings consistency not often seen with consumerbased companies included in the DowAnd finally because these membership fees which often have a very high renewal rate among existing members provide the bulk of Costcos profits the company tends to keep the margins on its food items razor thin This can provide an even more accurate glimpse of how the food industry is performing as well as how those prices are impacting consumer buying habits Lets not forget that around  of US gross domestic product is consumptionbasedWith a  share price and a meaningful market cap of  billion Costco would make for a smart addition to the DowSurgeons in an operating room with an individuals vitals displayed on a computer screenMoreImage source Getty ImagesMedtronic David Blitzer managing director and chairman of the index committee at SP Dow Jones Indices opined in a statement when booting GE out of the Dow that Consumer finance healthcare and technology companies are more prominent today Thats sort of a clue to Wall Street and investors that the committee will be looking to ensure strong representation in these sectors in the years to comeAssuming Pfizergets the heaveho at some point in the future which I predicted as a possibility earlier this week a possible replacement might be medical device behemoth Medtronic NYSE MDTRight now the Dow is represented by five healthcare companies the nations leading insurer UnitedHealth Group pharmacy giant Walgreens Boots Alliance healthcare conglomerate Johnson  Johnson NYSE JNJ and drug giants Pfizer and Merck While most healthcare avenues are covered here theres a redundancy with two drugmakers Pfizer and Merck in the Dow Even with Pfizer being the larger company by market cap it has the lowest share price in the index making it potentially expendable remember the Dow is entirely a priceweighted indexMedtronic would be a solid fit since it would be the largest pureplay medical device maker that the committee could add Dont get me wrong  Johnson  Johnsons global device unit is huge  but its not a medical device pure play JJ has its hands in consumer healthcare products and drug development as well In fact the percentage of Johnson  Johnsons sales derived from pharmaceuticals has been steadily growing for more than a half decade and nearly hit  of total sales in the second quarterWith Medtronic the Dow would get a  billion company with a reasonably high  share price More so it would position the index to take advantage of an aging American population thatll likely require a growing number of medical devices to live longer and healthier lives If Pfizer were to be shown the door I believe Medtronic is a logical replacementA Facebook engineer writing code on his computerMoreImage source FacebookFacebookLastly theres always the potential that social media kingpin Facebook NASDAQ FB could get added to the Dow Sporting the fifth largest market cap in the US at  billion and a  share price the argument can clearly be made that this is a relevant businessAccording to the companys firstquarter operating results there were an average of  billion daily active users up  year over year with  billion monthly active usersIn fact the companys four main assets  Facebook Messenger WhatsApp and Instagram  represent four of the seven most visited social media sites in the world That type of relevance shouldnt be overlooked by the SP Dow Jones Indices committeeHowever Facebook has two knocks against it that could thwart its addition to the Dow First its a relatively young company Even though its been dominant Facebook only debuted six years ago as a publicly traded company The committee generally only adds companies after theyve demonstrated that they have a timetested business model Were not exactly there yet with FacebookThe other issue is that there are already six technology stocks represented in the Dow note Im lumping Applein as a tech stock even though its occasionally referred to as a consumer goods company Thats  of the index If a company like IBM which has struggled to keep up with the changing tech landscape were shown the door then a company like Facebook would be a potentially logical addition But without removing any tech stocks it could be a tough sell to get Facebook into an already techheavy DowStill its hard to ignore a company worth  billion with a huge economic moat  meaning theres still a chance Facebook gets the call

Would Buy if He Were a MillennialJeremy Bowman The Motley FoolMotley FoolFebruary  ReblogShareTweetShareIts easy to see why Warren Buffett is considered the greatest investor of all time His companyBerkshire HathawayNYSE BRKANYSE BRKB has become one of the most valuable in the world largely due to his investments both in stocks and the companies hes bought Investors who were lucky or smart enough to buy Berkshire stock in its early days have become millionaires as shares gained an amazing  from  to Thats an annual growth rate of  more than double the  that theSP has returned in that time with dividends includedInvestors flock by the thousands to Berkshires annual meeting in Omaha Nebraska and his aphorisms about economic moats value and other subjects have become virtual gospel in the marketHowever like anyone Buffett is a product of his time and generation and as an yearold his perspective on investing is skewed by his ageFor instance he ignored the greatest story in business in the last generation  the emergence of the tech industry  as he long refused to buy tech stocks because he said he could not value them or predict where they were going Today the tech industry is more valuable than any other In fact the five most valuable American companies and the only ones bigger than Berkshire are all tech companiesWarren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaways annual investor meetingMoreImage source The Motley FoolWhen Buffett finally broke his personal boycott of tech stocks he did so by dumping more than  billion in  into IBM in part because he was so familiar with the company after reading its annual report for  years That investment turned into a terrible betas IBM shares dropped around  during the seven years Buffett owned them while the SP  more than doubled He later said he should have boughtAlphabet orAmazon insteadEven Buffetts own personal tastes seem to color his stock picks For instance he is a big fan of junk food in general andCocaColaNYSE KO products in particular and the beverage giant is his secondlargest holding Buffett once even mockedWhole Foods Market saying he doesnt see many customers smiling there However Coke stock has also significantly underperformed the market over the last  yearsIf Buffett had been born  years later his investing style would be the same but his stock picks would probably be much different Its impossible to know what the Oracle of Omaha would buy if he were just getting started today but here are three stocks that would likely be on his radar FacebookMillennial Buffett would be all over social media of course communicating with investors and posting selfies on Instagram No doubt hed be a fan ofFacebookNASDAQ FB and not just the platform but the stock too Facebook has plenty of the qualities that a techsavvy value investor like Millennial Buffett looks for First off it has a huge economic moat thanks to the network effects of a platform with more than  billion members and the unique value it offers advertisers The yearold Buffett has long been a fan of newspaper stocks noting that newspapers can essentially act as local monopolies if they have no nearby competition Facebook offers this same advantage but on a global scale in the digital age thanks to the power of the internetStory continuesBuffett himself also recognized the power of digital advertising noting that he should have bought Google after he realized the click rates that GEICO his auto insurance subsidiary was paying the search giant Facebook like Google has similar pricing powerAt a PE of  Facebook may not look like a typical value stock but considering its earnings per share jumped  to  last year and it had a  operating margin the stock looks cheap for its growth rate StarbucksMillennial Buffett was into the kombucha craze for a minute but these days hes a devoted coldbrew aficionado While he likes to visit independent coffee shops from time to time hes been a longtime StarbucksNASDAQ SBUXRewards member and he keeps the java giants app handy on his phoneYoung Buffett also recognizes the market power of Starbucks In many ways Starbucks is to his generation what CocaCola was to the real Buffetts He once boasted that CocaCola was such a strong brand that if you gave him  billion to take away Cokes market leadership in soft drinks he would give it back to you and say it couldnt be done However these days Starbucks seems to be doing just thatDomestic soda sales have declined every year since  and the coffee chain is a big reason Millennials are largely turning away from sugary sodas and the artificial sweeteners in diet beverages but coffee consumption seems likely to continue to grow as workplace culture for millennials has been moving out of the traditional and into places like coffee shopsStarbucks has also capitalized on the huge opportunity in China which chairman Howard Schultz believes will one day be its biggest market ahead of the US Its also established itself as a consistent dividend payer likely to be a Dividend Aristocrat one day and trades at a reasonable PE of  not much higher than Coke at  PayPalSplitting checks is so GenX After Millennial Buffett grabs a bite with his buddies at happy hour he just Venmos them a few bucks on the Uber ride homeThe actual Buffetts favorite investing play has traditionally been banking and insurance companies Buffett loves the business model in insurance as the float or the money he gets from premiums that have yet to be paid out can be invested to earn a profit PayPalNASDAQ PYPL offers the same business model but again has the power of mobile and digital behind it Like credit card companies PayPal collects transaction fees of around  on payments with debit and credit cards but the company also benefits from the float or money that users leave in their PayPal accounts that PayPal earns interest onIn  PayPal acquired Venmo the app thats become popular with millennials for sending money to reimburse one another for expenses like drinks or rent PayPal has been slow to monetize Venmo but has been taking steps recently such as testing Venmo payments at retail locationsNonetheless PayPal is growing fast as the opportunity for digital payments could be huge In  earnings per share grew  on a  increase in revenue and management expects to increase another  in EPS this yearAt a PE of  the stock may not be cheap but if the company maintains its lead in digital payments investors should reap the longterm benefits More From The Motley Fool    Growth Stocks at DeepValue Prices

Stock Near the LowsVince MartinInvestorPlaceDecember  ReblogShareTweetShareThe fundamental case for Facebook NASDAQFB looks close to absurd at this point Facebook stock trades at barely x earnings Back out some  per share in cash and the priceearnings multiple assigned to FB stock gets closer to x For a tech giant expected to grow revenue  next year that multiple seems absurdYes spending is going to rise next year hitting earnings Guidance for that spend led Facebook stock to the largest oneday loss in stock market history back in August But spending will normalize going forward meaning Facebook should get back to growth as soon as  Yet a x excash multiple suggests hardly any growth is priced in at this pointDespite the attractive numbers however there are reasons to sell Facebook stock And those reasons are mounting Facebook continues to run into problems and Mark Zuckerberg  Co continue to manage those problems poorly At some point the risk here is that Facebook is going to turn off users and not just investorsInvestorPlace  Stock Market News Stock Advice  Trading Tips   BlueChip Stocks That Could Break Their Bull Trend  If that happens even a price that is threatening a month low wont be cheap enough or closeThe Never One Cockroach Problem for Facebook StockAs Warren Buffett put it regarding scandalplagued Wells Fargo NYSEWFC What you find is theres never just one cockroach in the kitchen when you start looking around That old investing saw has been proven yet again when it comes to Facebook stockFor most of  theres been a steady drip of negative news It started with the Cambridge Analytica scandal in March FB stock bounced back quickly from those declines before the postQ earnings plunge But even then bad news was starting to build upWhatsApp founder Jan Koum departed reportedly over privacy issues In June the Wall Street Journal reported that Facebook gave developers access to user data after it had insisted otherwise The paper disclosed an SEC probe the following month At the same time concerns about the platforms use in lynchings in India and violence in Myanmar began to riseThe company itself disclosed a security issue in September In November as Larry Ramer pointed out the New York Timesreported that COO Sheryl Sandberg had tried to keep Russian misinformation efforts quiet  and that a Facebookhired lobbying firm had tried to tie Facebook opponents to billionaire activist and target of rightwing disdain George SorosNow the company is being sued by the District of Columbia And the Times is reporting that the company gave away much more data than it disclosed to partners including Microsoft NASDAQMSFT Amazoncom NASDAQAMZN and Netflix NASDAQNFLX FB stock is down nearly  on the newsCan we be sure that no more bad news is on the way And do investors really want to wake up every morning waiting for the next shoe to drop  and for Facebook stock to do the sameThe Management Problem for FB StockFacebook admittedly has had more than its share of problems of late But its also done a terrible job responding to those problems The company increasingly seems tonedeaf and authoritarian Sandberg hemmed and hawed her way through the Soros scandal She first denied any knowledge that the company had hired lobbying firm Definers The Facebook COO then acknowledged that some of their work was incorporated into materials presented to me and I received a small number of emails where Definers was referenced  in a post that the company tried to bury by releasing it on the day before ThanksgivingCEO Mark Zuckerberg seems to alternate between saying the problems arent that big will be fixed have to be fixed or already have been fixed A post from another Facebook executive in regard to Wednesdays Times story insisted that no data was released without users permission  then pointed out that most of the features were shut down anyway while the company is already in the process of reviewing all our APIs Which is it Does anyone trust that response at this pointTheres simply a constant perception here that Facebook has something to hide Theres a consistent response of delay deny and deflect as the Times put it Even beyond that theres a sense that Facebook cant even control itself Why are privacy issues only being reviewed in  Why was data privacy not a greater focus in the pastStory continues   SmallCap Stocks That Look Like Bargains  Even giving the company the benefit of the doubt it repeatedly seems like Facebook itself is surprised to see all the ways in which its data can be abused That further erodes confidence in management at this pointWill Users LeaveThe risk in the near to midterm is that users will stop giving Facebook the benefit of the doubt The story of Facebook stock cant be separated from the story of Facebook users as I wrote in April The DeleteFacebook movement fizzled out admittedly And user growth has been stable if slowing thats hardly surprising given the sheer size of the user baseBut bad news and clumsy responses are going to affect Facebooks brand image And once defections start they may not stop Facebook is the classic beneficiary of the network effect each incremental user adds to the experience and value of the existing base Its fun to go to Facebook because everyone is on FacebookThat effect works in reverse as well Users now have multiple reasons to leave the platform  or at least limit their usage Some may not want to further line Zuckerbergs already full pockets Others may see too much privacy risk For some myself included the sheen has worn offThis isnt to say that Facebook necessarily is the next Myspace WhatsApp and Instagram can cushion any weakness in the namesake platform But even at x earnings user declines probably arent priced inAre Regulators ComingBig tech firms are seeing increased political risk  and Facebook probably faces the most at the moment Its alienated liberals by attacking Soros and allowing Russian disinformation to spread Conservatives believe the platform and the company have an intrinsic leftwing bias Facebook probably doesnt have many allies in Congress  or the White HouseIm skeptical a legallyforced breakup of Facebook is on the way But stranger things have happened At the least Facebook already is facing increasing regulation around privacy in Europe US regulators and legislators could followAnd because of its missteps of late Facebook has put itself in the crosshairs Zuckerberg just a few years ago appeared a wholesome American success story He now looks like a villain in many citizens eyes As such politicians can score points attacking Facebook now The more bad news that gets released the higher those scores go   Best Stocks to Buy That Represent the Future  The broad point is that the bad news for Facebook likely isnt over And the effects of that bad news are unclear At the least the risks to Facebook stock from user fatigue and political action are rising As long as that continues FB stock will stay stuck at bestAs of this writing Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentionedMore From InvestorPlace   Toxic Pot Stocks You Should Avoid     SmallCap

Hoium The Motley FoolMotley FoolJanuary  ReblogShareTweetShareVirtual reality has been a hot topic in the tech industry ever since Facebook NASDAQ FB paid  billion for Oculus in  but the sector has yet to reach any kind of critical mass The user base is still small and many big companies are leery of investingIn  however we could see some shifts in the VR landscape as new hardware and software are introduced Here are the five companies Ill be watching to see where VR is headedDigitized woman in VR headsetMoreImage source Getty ImagesFacebookIt may be a small part of Facebooks business but Oculus is a giant in the world of virtual reality Its one of the two main highend VR devices  along with HTC Vive  and Oculus is quickly expanding its VR platform In  it launched the Oculus Go a lowend device thats great for  videos and comes at an accessible price point of In  Oculus expects to launch the Quest headset which will be the first highend standalone VR headset at a price point of  The product could make VR much more accessible to consumers and help increase the install base beyond the few million units in the market todayFacebook is trying to become the platform of choice for VR consumers and developers If the Oculus Quest goes well  could be the year it takes a big step in that directionSonyIt may sound surprising but Sony NYSE SNE is actually the leader in virtual reality headsets worldwide In August the company passed  million PSVR headsets sold far exceeding around  million for Oculus Rift and HTC Vive Sony has the benefit of having sold over  million PS units which power the PS headset but users seem to like the devices value proposition over competitorsThe challenge for Sony will be staying ahead of devices like the HTC Vive Pro which brings better graphics and performance for highend users and Oculus Quest which will be great for the masses PSs computing power will ultimately be a limiting factor for PSVR unless the company decides to upgrade in Rumor has it that Sony will upgrade PSVR when it releases PS which should be out in  or  Thats a long time to wait for another headset upgrade but for the leading VR headset on the market today its the best that enthusiasts are going to getVideo games power trioConspicuously absent from the VR industry thus far have been Activision Blizzard NASDAQ ATVI Electronic Arts NASDAQ EA and TakeTwo Interactive NASDAQ TTWO They look at the relatively small install base of VR headsets compared to PC console and mobile which combined have billions of potential customers and just dont see an opportunity worth investing in yetI think  could be the year at least one of these companies dips its toes into the VR waters Quests introduction should help expand the market and improve the accessibility of the technology If the install base of that device reaches a million or more in the first few months it could make the industry more enticing for large developersThey also dont want to risk losing the industry to upstart competitors Population One a Fortnitelike VR game is expected to be introduced by BigBox VR in spring  and games like Beat Saber are growing in popularity These could be the equivalent of Candy Crush or Clash of Clans which took over mobile building a brand and user base lead that big game makers can only acquire not build organically themselves Someone needs to be an early mover but who will it beStory continuesVR will have a big year one way or anotherGiven all of the developments coming to the VR industry  is going to be a big year Either the billions of dollars of development money will start to pay off or they wont I tend to believe the technology is good enough and content is coming out fast enough for adoption to grow and Facebook Sony and video game companies could be big winners But the industry has had high hopes before only to be dashed by weak adoption rates  and ultimately the user base size will decide if  is a good year for VR

Messengers chief sees for messaging in JP MangalindanChief Tech CorrespondentYahoo FinanceJanuary  ReblogShareTweetShareFacebook Messenger head David MarcusMoreIf messaging was a huge deal in  Facebook Messenger head David Marcus thinks  will prove even bigger for the billions of people who send one another emojihappy messages around the world On Tuesday Marcus published a post outlining the six major trends or themes he sees influencing Messenger  and its  billion monthly active users  throughout the yearHis predictions outline a mix of logical extensions and coursecorrections for the messaging service he joined in  More realtime features If s deluge of political and pop culture news reinforced anything it was that onthefly communication proved instrumental not just for keeping in touch but for keeping tabs on what happened in the world There were grim stories of sexual harassment in Hollywood posted across social media there were survivors of natural disasters who communicated their safety on Facebook FB And of course there were President Donald Trumps tweets Regardless of the kind of content those examples illustrated the klout of messaging and social media once again To wit Marcus foresees Messenger rolling out more ways to make sure users stay connected whether its in the US or in emerging markets This year youll see us continue investing in realtime communications to make sure that no matter where you are you can easily stay connected to your loved ones Marcus wrote in the post No one wants to miss a special moment but realtime communication is what connects us in times of crisis too and we unfortunately saw more than our share of that last year Beefier group chatsGroup chat was one of Messengers most popular features In  alone the messaging service said  million new group chats were created on Messenger everyday with the average group chat having  people In addition to group chat features rolled out last year like the mentions ability to call out someone in a chat by their username Marcus suggested that the Messenger group chat experience will grow further in  by for instance finding ways to integrate group chat into live video group chat A more streamlined experience While Messenger grew to  billion monthly active users in September it also got flack by some tech media for trying to do too much As part of Facebooks larger push to emulate Snapchats Stories for example Messenger launched a similar feature of its own at the beginning of last year  a feature that was consolidated with Facebook Stories in November Earlier this month the Messenger team said M the humanpowered personal digital assistant being tested with some  users would be retired A Facebook spokesperson told Yahoo Finance in early January that Facebook would take its learnings from M and use them to power other artificial intelligencerelated projects at the social network Over the last two years we built a lot of capabilities to find the features that continue to set us apart Marcus explained A lot of them have found their product market fit some havent While we raced to build these new features the app became too cluttered Expect to see us invest in massively simplifying and streamlining Messenger this yearMore visual ways to communicate Marcus thinks visual messaging  using images videos GIFs and stickers  to fully explode Thats probably of little surprise to some given Messenger users sent over  billion emojis and shared  billion animated GIFs last year in  Expect Messenger to roll out even more ways for users to visually express themselves as it works to draw more emojiloving GIFhappy teens and millennials to its service Messaging as a preferred method of customer service Likewise Marcus also remains bullish on messaging platforms shouldering more customer service requests as more people learn they can message and interact with companies on platforms like Messenger rather than having to dial a companys customer service number the oldfashioned way To wit according to a Facebookcommissioned study by Nielsen published in December  of people prefer to message a business rather than call customer service while  of those same people expect to message businesses even more over the next two yearsWhile calling still plays a prominent role in customer service this has opened the door for brands and businesses to communicate with their customers in a variety of new ways to not only respond to issues or oneoff questions but to offer an upsell opportunity to benefit both people and the business Marcus wrote Story continuesMessaging as a marketing channelMore and more Marcus has learned that people expect to find businesses with some sort of messaging component a live chat box on a companys website a customer service chat bot inside an app or the ability to interact with a business on a fullblown service like Messenger Likewise more marketers over the past  months have expressed interest in using messaging as a way to connect with their customers Weve been encouraged to see that bigger brand names are bringing a presence to Messenger LEGO Katy Perry Apple Music which signals the acceptance from CMOs chief marketing officers that its time to create a unique and effective experience that can reach more people at scale Marcus wrote Look for investment in rich messaging experiences not only from global brands but small businesses who need to be creative and nimble to stay competitive While Facebook has taken heat at times over tweaks and changes  last weeks

a data leak that happened in  regarding political analytics firm Cambridge AnalyticaA few weeks later Facebook reported what was arguably its best earnings report everFacebook reported its best financial results ever against the backdrop of its worst PR incident ever That is shocking More importantly its a testament to just how powerful and necessary the Facebook machine has becomeInvestorPlace  Stock Market News Stock Advice  Trading TipsAs such Facebook stock has rallied off its postCambridge Analytica lows of  to trade in the s That is right around where it was trading prior to the data leak news hitting the wireHave you missed the rallyHardly This was just a rebound A minor blip in the overall upward trajectory for Facebook stockThis upward trajectory will persist Facebook stock is supported by some of the strongest fundamentals in the market with a big growth narrative converging on a relatively discounted valuation That creates a compelling opportunity to buy and hold FB stock for the longrunFacebook is so massive that it has become an integral part of how the internet functions and it is poised not only to grow more but to provide more services in one place  and the markets are not currently valuing it this wayHeres an indepth look at why Facebook stock is a mustown here and now  out of  People Who Can Have a Facebook Account Do Have a Facebook AccountPerhaps the most important and most attractive thing about Facebook is its sizeThe social media behemoth has  billion monthly active users The world has about  billion people and of those only roughly  billion have access to the internet About  million of those internet users are in China where Facebook is blocked Therefore the global internet population that has legal access to Facebook numbers around  billionAgain Facebook has  billion monthly active users That means that essentially  out of every  people in the world that can have a Facebook do have a Facebook accountNo other company in the world has that scale Not Amazoncom Inc NASDAQAMZN Not Netflix Inc NASDAQNFLX And not even Alphabet Inc NASDAQGOOGL or Apple Inc NASDAQAAPLFacebook is on its own playing field in terms of global size reach and scaleAnd that doesnt even consider Facebooks newly minted Family of Apps Those  billion monthly active users are on the core Facebook platform alone Facebook has another  billion monthly users on WhatsApp  billion monthly users on Messenger and  million monthly users on Instagram   Tech Stocks That Will Turn It Around Soon  Put it all together and that is  billion users Granted there is heavy overlap between users so it isnt  billion distinct users But the entire Facebook ecosystem essentially acts like and has the power of a platform that has  billion combined monthly users because what matters isnt distinct users but rather the number of eyeballs you capture and for how long you capture them if a user goes from Facebook to Messenger to Instagram that same user will have used  different apps but stayed within the Facebook ecosystem the whole time Facebook Is the Internet IDIn many senses Facebooks massive size is its greatest asset Because it is so big Facebook has become an irreplaceable part of the internetI like to think of Facebook as the internet ID In the physical world everyone has a physical ID that they use to identify themselves and get into places If you are walking into a bank they ask for your ID to confirm identity If you get pulled over by the cops they also ask for your ID And if you want to a drink at a restaurant or a bar chances are they will be asking for your ID toofbMoreStory continuesSource ShutterstockFacebook is exactly this for the digital world Facebook is your digital ID complete with a profile picture life details like birthdate and workplace and a list of friends and recent activity Because of this it has all the information and data that anyone needs to identify you Also because everyone has a Facebook it is a universal means for digital identificationThis is why there are so many Login with Facebook options across the internetStreaming music platform Spotify Technology SANYSESPOTuses Login

professional networking site LinkedIn  owned byMicrosoft CorporationNASDAQMSFTsports news platform ESPNa Walt Disney CoNYSEDIS property and many many moreThey all use this feature because  it is easier  everyone has a Facebook  is it arguably more secure and  Facebook has all the data in the world that any of them need in order to get started on creating a personalized account for new users It doesnt matter that Facebook is in direct competition with some of these companies Thats how vital Facebook has becomeFrom this perspective it is easy to see how Facebooks size and data have allowed it become to the internets ID In doing so Facebook has become part of the underlying fabric of the internetMoreover because Facebooks database is so large the company has indeed become an irreplaceable part of the internet Facebook has relevant information data on more than  billion people globally Until another platform can rival that scale Facebook is irreplaceable Facebooks Size Is Also Its Greatest Financial WeaponFrom a financial perspective Facebooks size is so important for two reasons  unparalleled reach and  unparalleled targeting abilities All advertisers want is the most bang for their buck and that means max reach with max engagement Facebook is the only platform that maximizes both due to its sizeOn a raw basis its  billionplus user base is unrivaled and naturally Facebook offers the most global reach for advertisers On a deeper lever Facebook has a lot of data on  billion peopleplus and can use that unparalleled database to create unparalleled targeted advertising solutions Thus Facebooks size allows it to offer advertisers max reach with max engagement a combination which has allowed Facebook to dominate other social media peers in the digital advertising spaceMoreover Facebooks size makes it a successful imitator Case and point Instagram Stories and WhatsApp Status Snap Inc NYSESNAP was killing Facebook for several years and teens were ditching Facebook and flocking to Snapchat Then Facebook cloned Snapchats core feature Stories and put it into its app ecosystemThe net result was that because of the initial size of Instagram and WhatsApp Instagram Stories and WhatsApp Status became huge hits Now Facebook is behind the two largest Stories platforms in the worldFacebooks size allows it do this replication in essentially any space and be successful in doing so That is why Facebook Dating poses a meaningful threat toMatch Group Inc NASDAQMTCH and why Facebook can jump into almost any business that it wants to Facebook User Growth Is High in Low Internet Penetration MarketsA lot of folks are concerned that the growth in Facebooks user base has stalled out While the numbers support this slowing growth trend I dont think its fair to say that Facebook is done growing its user baseUser growth has come down from  to  to  and lower over the past several years But that is simply a result of the law of large numbers Once you get to a point where  out of every  internet users is on your platform user growth is naturally going to slowSource ShutterstockBut dont underestimate the global internet growth narrativeRoughly  of the entire North American population is on the internet That is a maxed out market As such Facebooks US  Canada monthly user base grew by only  last quarterEurope also has a pretty high internet penetration rate of  That is also a maxed out market Not surprisingly Facebooks Europe monthly user base growth was also weak It grew just  last quarterEverywhere else however is a completely different storyAsias internet penetration rate is below  while Facebooks AsiaPacific monthly user base grew by an impressive  last quarterIn other parts of the world the internet penetration rate is right around  which is why Facebooks Rest of World monthly user base grew by  last quarterOverall what we see is not too surprising In markets where internet penetration is high Facebook user growth is slow around  But in geographies where internet penetration is still low and growing Facebook user growth is still strong in the  to plus range Facebook Could Hit  Billion Users SoonOn a global scale it looks Facebook still has a ways to go in terms of user growthThe global internet penetration rate is just  miles below North Americas rate of  Presumably internet usage globally is only growing and that  global rate will continue to grind higher towards  As that happens Facebooks total addressable market will expand If Facebook can maintain its share in that growing market then Facebooks user base could easily keep growing at a healthy rate for the next  years  The Bottom Line on a Really Encouraging Earnings Season  How much bigger can it getWell it is unlikely global internet penetration rates hit North America levels but a  rate seems achievable in  years Assuming global population heads towards  billion then that would imply  billion global internet users including China Assuming Facebook maintains a roughly  penetration rate among global internet users including China then you are looking at nearly  billion Facebook users in  yearsAnd that doesnt even include the billionplus users on WhatsApp and Messenger and the nearly billion users on Instagram Thanks to global internet expansion those numbers will head higher as well Messenger and WhatsApp Give The Advertising Business a Lot of Unused FirepowerUser growth through global internet usage expansion is a promising growth driver for Facebook stock going forwardBut it isnt the only oneIndeed Facebook stocks explosion in   and  from  to  was largely driven by a ramp in monetization trends Namely Facebook started monetizing Instagram and that added extra firepower to average revenue per user ARPU growthFor the longest time Facebook wasnt making any money from Instagram It was just a platform with a ton of users but not many ads and not much money running through the systemThen in  Facebook decided to get serious about putting ads on Instagram and making money from the platform I remember the initial gut reaction from users was Ugh More ads Im going to stop using Instagram so much But that never happened Because the ads were nonintrusive and actually relevant thanks to the companys huge database nobody quit Instagram Instead the platforms user base has nearly tripled since then from  million to  millionMeanwhile Facebook started making a ton of money off InstagramBetween  and  Facebooks domestic ARPU grew at a  rate from roughly  to roughly  During that same stretch global ARPU grew at a  clip from roughly  to around Once Facebook started seriously monetizing Instagram in  everything changed For the betterFrom  to  Facebooks domestic ARPU grew at a  rate to nearly  Global ARPU meanwhile grew at a  clip to nearly In other words despite dramatically increasing scale and tougher laps Facebooks unit monetization growth actually accelerated in  versus Why InstagramNow the Instagram ad ramp is largely in the rearview window but Facebook is still sitting on two other much larger platforms that have yet to be monetized in Messenger and WhatsApp That means Facebook stock has two Instagramlike catalysts still in the pipelineFacebook has barely monetized these platforms so farRight now Messenger only has ads on the contact list which are unintrusive to the point that many users dont register them Facebooks most recent earnings mention Messenger as a component of ad revenue but dont spike out the individual numbers for the app WhatsApp has no adsThus far management hasnt figured out the ideal way to monetize on a messaging app whether it be through ads or social commerce or anything else Eventually though management will figure this out At that point in time Facebook will start making big bucks from Messenger and WhatsAppFinancially that means that ARPU although it is really big right now could get a lot bigger If so Facebook stock could explode higher Watch  Workplace Are Big Growth Drivers for Facebook StockUp until this point this article has focused exclusively on Facebooks advertising business and why that business isnt going to slow anytime soon As a result Facebook stock should head higher even if Facebook was just its advertising businessBut its notFacebook stock has been hammered falling  from the highs it made just last month While hard to do its time to start nibbling FB stockMoreFacebook is building out multiple nascent hypergrowth businesses that could one day be huge contributors to both the top and bottom lines The sum of these businesses not only strength the fundamentals supporting Facebook stock but also add significant longevity to Facebook stocks growth narrativeFirst there is Facebook Watch Facebook launched Watch in mid after it become crystal clear that streaming ondemand entertainment was the way of the future At that time Netflix was just carving up the traditional cable industry and there was a massive shift happening from the cable model to the streaming model As such Facebook launched Watch to get into this spaceWatch hasnt made much of a splash just yet but again it is only matter of time before Watch scales into something meaningful After all Facebook does have the largest potential streaming audience in the world  billionplus users and a whole bunch of cash on the balance sheet Thus once Facebook appropriately deploys its massive amount of resources to developing andor acquiring content Facebook will be able to stream that content to the largest ondemand streaming audience in the worldConsidering how much money Netflix is making in the streaming world Facebook Watch could easily morph into a huge moneymaker for Facebook stock   Consumer Goods Stocks That Will Rise Again  Second there is Facebook Workplace which is a highly undervalued part of the Facebook business Workplace is the social networks enterprise edition Its essentially a cloudbased communication tool designed for businesses of all sizes And its exactly like Slack the hypergrowth startup which has made a killing selling enterprise communication toolsFormerly known as Facebook at Work Workplace debuted in October  to very little fanfare Most investors have since forgotten about it But Workplace scored a big win last year by signing on the worlds biggest employerWalmart IncNYSEWMT And that will likely be only the first in a series of major wins for Workplace as enterprise social networking goes mainstream IDC expects theESN market to growat a  clip annually to  billion by Facebook makes money off of Workplace by charging a subscription fee At  per month per user for premium Workplace could easily scale into a material revenue stream for Facebook if the ESN market gains momentum over the next several years Marketplace  Native Payments Are Bigger Growth Drivers for Facebook StockBeyond Watch and Workplace there is Facebook Marketplace Much like Watch Marketplace has been around for a few quarters but hasnt made much of a splash just yet But also like Watch it really is only a matter of time before Facebook turns Marketplace into something bigAs it stands Marketplace looks like a digital garage sale of  billionplus potential buyers and sellers That model makes sense but isnt a complete version of what Marketplace could be It will eventually morph into a place that accommodates those  billionplus buyers and sellers while also making room for official retailers to sell goods to a targeted group of buyers yet another usecase of Facebooks massive database In this sense Marketplace could one day scale to be the place for all ecommerce transactionsAlong the same lines as Marketplace Facebook is rolling out native payment capability across its ecosystem Pretty soon Buy Now features will be common across all of Facebook Imagine you see an advertisement and that ad interests youCurrently there is a decent amount of friction in the process of turning that interest into financial action You have to click that ad likely veer away from Facebook open another window enter separate payment and delivery info so on and so forthSource iStockcomkravcsIn the future Facebook will add capability which removes those frictions You will be able to store your payment and delivery info within the Facebook ecosystem so that if you see an ad on Instagram or Facebook that interests you you are literally just a few clicks away from turning that interest into financial actionThis capability at scale could be huge for Facebook Facebook could take a commission off every sale that happens through its platform much like a payments processing company does If so Facebook could make a ton of money off people buying and selling directly through the Facebook ecosystem Facebook could also charge higher rates for its digital real estate in a world where they reduce commerce friction thus adding even more firepower to the already supercharged advertising business The Street Underestimates Facebooks GrowthTo recap Facebooks size gives the company perhaps the biggest moat in the world while also enabling the company to replicate essentially any business at scale FurtherFacebooks advertising business is on fire and the future monetization of social conversation apps Messenger and WhatsApp mean that the ad business still has a ton of firepower Meanwhile Facebook is developing multiple nascent hypergrowth businesses like Watch Workplace Marketplace and native payments the sum of which could add meaningful contributions to the financials over the next  yearsPut that all together and I really dont understand why the Street thinks revenue growth is going to slow all the way to  next year versus nearly  last quarter Yes I understand the law of large numbers Growth is supposed to slow with scaleBut that hasnt happened at Facebook Revenue growth last quarter was nearly  In the year ago quarter it was also nearly  Two years ago it was a hair over  Three years ago it was a hair under Why then is Facebooks revenue growth going to all the sudden plummet to  after spending multiple years right around Law of large numbers The company has defied that trend for a while and revenues are still less than  billion Google has revenues in excess of  billion so I really dont see law of large numbers kicking in just yetMuted user growth Maybe But global internet usage expansion should keep user growth healthy in the plus range and that level of growth led to  revenue growth this past quarter That trend shouldnt change any time soonInstagram ad ramp is over Again maybe But also unlikely Judging by Snaps recent results Instagram is kicking Snaps butt and that means a ton of teenoriented ad dollars are flowing into Instagram Plus Messenger and WhatsApp still have yet to be monetizedDigital ad business is nearing saturation Again maybe but unlikely And largely irrelevant By the time the ad business does near saturation after WhatsApp and Messenger have been fully monetized the other businesses like Watch Marketplace and Workplace will be the big growth driversOverall then I really dont see why Facebooks revenue growth is slated to come off the rails over the next several years The biggest growth drivers remain strong and there are more growth drivers in the pipeline As such it looks like Facebook stock will continue to benefit from successive beatandraise quarters over the next several yearsHow Much Is Facebook Stock WorthGiven that last quarters  growth rate has been consistent for the past several years and there are big growth drivers still in the pipeline I dont think revenue growth will come down by all that much over the next several years At around  billion in revenues I do expect law of large numbers to start kicking in I also expect ad revenues to slow some as Facebook and Instagram start to get maxed out But the overall growth rate will remain robustAll things considered I think this is a  revenue growth company per year over the next  years I also think that operating margins will stay high in the  range thanks to robust demand for the companys ad products That combination leads me to believe that FB can earn around  per share in  years   Stocks That Are Screaming Buys Right Now  A marketaverage growth multiple of times forward earnings on those  earnings implies a fouryear forward price target for FB stock of  Discounted back by  per year that equates to a fair value for FB stock of above Bottom Line on Facebook StockFB stock is a case of big growth converging on a discounted valuation That convergence normally results in significant shareprice outperformance in a multiyear windowThat is exactly what will happen over the next several years with

PegoraroContributing Editor Yahoo FinanceApril  ReblogShareTweetShareFILE PHOTO Silhouettes of mobile users are seen next to a screen projection of Facebook logo in this picture illustration taken March   REUTERSDado RuvicIllustrationFile photoMoreHow Facebook FB makes money can confuse anybody Just ask Sen Orrin Hatch RUtah who during Tuesdays Senate interrogation of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg asked the yearold how the social network stayed in businessZuckerbergs fourword answer Senator we run adsBut its how those ads come together thats interesting and everybody on Facebook should understand how the company can use its deep knowledge of our interests to attract advertisers anxious to aim their pitches at customers with the greatest potential returns Fortunately Facebooks ad machinery isnt a secret anybody who maintains a public page myself included can use the same basic tools to target ads at people by telling Facebook what kind of interests and demographics they want to attract  or excludeAddress for successZuckerbergs refrain we do not sell data to advertisers holds up on this closer inspection Facebook has never let me see details about individual users or target them by nameFacebook ads work the other way You tell the social network what kind of people should see your ad and Facebook obliges as best as it canCompanies and individual with Facebook pages can use the companys vast array of user information to target specific groups for their adsMoreIt starts with a request to select the target audiences gender your only choices are male or female and age range you can set that as low as  Facebooks minimum age Then you choose a locationSince in this test I would be boosting a post about what Facebook should do to restore trust among its users there was one obvious choice Facebooks street address of One Hacker Way Menlo Park CA  I then included anybody within  miles of thereThats not too different from digital advertising as offered by Facebooks competitors  including Yahoo Finances corporate parent Verizon VZYour interests can be interestingBut you can also target people on Facebook by their interests something Facebook knows better than most other online companies Type a term or phrase and Facebook will suggest possible matches from an immense inventory of demographics interests and behaviorsThe word minority for instance yields suggestions like Lesser Poland Los Angeles Dodgers minor league players and Nucleic acid double helix Youre more likely to be surprised by interests you cant target  for instance HBOs comedy Silicon Valley is in Facebooks database but not Showtimes drama BillionsAn example of how companies can set up ads to target specific Facebook usersMoreWords and phrases tied to various sorts of bigotry also appear offlimits to judge from experimentation that hopefully doesnt have Facebook thinking Im a Nazi Thats a change from what Pro Publica found last year when its reporters could buy ads with antiSemitic termsIn this ad test I added such interests as Facebook and Privacy the Federal Trade Commission and Personally identifiable information I tried adding General Data Protection Regulation but the European Unions sweeping privacy rule isnt on Facebooks list Facebook predicted this exercise in targeting could reach  million people  if I paid generously Limiting my ad budget to  would only reach  to  people in a dayStory continuesYou can also exclude demographics and interests from an ad Last year Pro Publica found that this system let advertisers hide housing ads from minorities but this dialog didnt let me add ethnic racial or religious termsCustom audiencesThe other way to target people by Facebook requires first finding them outside the social network Its Custom Audiences feature lets you upload a customer list and have Facebook show your ad to those people  if your information matches what it knows about themThe easiest way to do this is to create and upload a simple spreadsheet with peoples email addresses phone numbers names birthdays and other details You dont however need their street addresses  just city state and Zip code I tested this with my own info and that of three Yahoo Finance colleagues  with their permission since Facebooks rules require that upfront The minimum size for a Custom Audience upload is  I filled out the rest with madeup entriesFacebook allows advertisers to target specific users but only if they have the users permissionMoreRoughly a half hour later Facebook had matched my database with Facebook accounts  but it didnt tell me which ones It then offered to expand this lists reach by creating a lookalike audience of people who match the Facebookdetermined traits of my custom audienceYou can also generate a Custom Audience by adding a Facebook Pixel to your site to track and record what visitors do thereI didnt actually purchase this ad after going to all this trouble but I have bought Facebook ads before  in the spring and fall of last year the site offered me a credit to try boosting a post on my page The results werent all that impressiveWhat remains a mysteryAs a Facebook user much of the social network remains a black box to me  I can only guess about some of its People You May Know suggestions for instance And while the Ad Preferences interface facebookcomadspreferences lets me see and edit what Facebook thinks fascinates me it doesnt tell me how it learned thatBut as an advertiser much of this is mysterious too I cant tell how Facebook decides which users will be interested in a particular topic And while I may want to avoid looking like a practitioner of surveillance capitalism I couldnt tell Facebook to consider only data based on peoples activity on Facebook itselfBut Facebook ads clearly work  according to the research firm eMarketer it accounted for  of digital ad spending in  second only to Google GOOG GOOGL If you dont like that all I can suggest for now is this try not to click on too many Facebook adsMore from RobNew study finds  of shared links on Twitter came from botsWe need a federal law protecting consumers from data leaksHow Facebook should fix

evidence of how malicious users in the US are increasingly copying the techniques Russian trolls used in the  US electionAmericans are taking a page out of Russias playbookMalicious Facebook users are creating hundreds of fake accounts and pages in attempts to politically influence users Facebook said in a blog post on ThursdayThe Silicon Valley social networking firm has announced a crackdown on the these removing  pages and  accounts that have consistently broken our rules against spam and coordinated inauthentic behavior Facebook did not cite the source of these accounts but The New York Times reported that they were run by AmericansMany were using fake accounts or multiple accounts with the same names and posted massive amounts of content across a network of Groups and Pages to drive traffic to their websites Nathaniel Gleicher Facebooks head of cybersecurity wroteMany used the same techniques to make their content appear more popular on Facebook than it really was Others were ad farms using Facebook to mislead people into thinking that they were forums for legitimate political debateAccording to The New York Times the removed accounts included Right Wing News  a page that sometimes spread fake news with a rightwing slant  as well as the leftwing pages Resistance and Reverb PressThe activity echoes the actions of Russia during the  US election when it attempted to influence American politics using a coordinated campaign of fake accounts that spread hoaxes and misleading informationFacebook said it looked at the behavior of the accounts rather than the content posted in its decision to ban themToday these networks increasingly use sensational political content  regardless of its political slant  to build an audience and drive traffic to their websites earning money for every visitor to the site And like the politically motivated activity weve seen the news stories or opinions these accounts and Pages share are often indistinguishable from legitimate political debate Gleicher wrote This is why its so important we look at these actors behavior  such as whether theyre using fake accounts or repeatedly posting spam  rather than their content when deciding which of these accounts Pages or Groups to removeA Facebook spokesperson did not immediately respond to Business Insiders request for clarification on the sources of the accounts and details of the accounts themselvesSome critics have attacked Facebook on the timing on the removals coming just weeks before the US midterm electionsEarly voting is already happening in some states and Election Day is a few weeks away so its especially inexcusable that Facebook is only now deleting political disinformation pages Facebook has long been aware of the presence and activities of these pages but did nothing until the company sensed a potential public relations disaster as reporters started working on stories about rightwing networks intentionally promoting misinformation through their operation of these pages Angelo Carusone president of media watchdog Media Matters said in a statementSo while its a good thing that Facebook is finally taking this action its yet

in favor of the European Unions revamped copyright directiveCritics say the law could block internet users from being able to post content like memes and links to articlesThe copyright battle pits media companies and musicians against tech over the widespread availability of their content onlineEuropean parliamentarians have passed a controversial overhaul of copyright law that could force tech giants to install filters that prevent copyrightprotected content from being uploadedLawmakers in Strasbourg France  voted on Wednesday in favor of the European Unions revamped directive  which is aimed at bringing the blocs rules on copyright into the st centuryThe copyright reform was passed with  votes in favor  against and  abstentionsBut critics say such a law would normalize censorship and restrict internet freedom preventing users from being able to post content ranging from memes to links to articles from news outletsThe controversy mainly surrounds two sections of the law  Articles  and Article  would grant press publications copyright over the sharing of their content online meaning they would be able to charge services like Google News for aggregating their stories Critics have dubbed this as an effective link tax but proponents say hyperlinks will be exemptMeanwhile Article  calls for effective content recognition technology to filter out copyrightprotected content Detractors hold that this part of the law could threaten social media users ability to share anything from internet memes to snippets of music and filmReacting to the result of the vote Julia Reda a German Pirate Party lawmaker said it was catastrophic that the parliament voted in favor of the most controversial pieces of the legislationFinal vote for Parliament position on the copyright directive with UploadFilters and LinkTax adopted she wrote in a tweet Parliament has failed to listen to citizens and experts concernsTweetOpponents of the directive have been using the hashtag SaveYourInternet on social mediaThe legislation is now better balanced answering many of the concerns of journalists publishers and musicians whose work was being shared freely online without stifling innovation or fundamentally changing the nature of the internet Sajjad Karim a British Conservative lawmaker said in a statement following the voteIt also takes into account the rights of users ensuring that materials used for teaching and research and by cultural and heritage organizations are not encumbered by unnecessary restrictionsWhats nextWednesdays vote wont be the last youve heard about the EUs copyright reformsLawmakers had initially voted to delay the vote rejecting the version of the directive that had been agreed by a committee at that timeNow that politicians in Strasbourg have come to an agreement the next stage for the law will be whats known as trilogue which consists of talks between European Parliament EU executive body the European Commission and a collective of the leaders of EU member states known as the European CouncilAnd even once the directive goes through this process it will still require each individual EU nation to decide on how they will implement the new rulesThe EU copyright battle pits media companies and musicians against tech giants over the widespread availability of their content online Supporters of the law argue that people and companies in the creative industries are being starved of revenues lost to the sharing of their intellectual property on digital platformsIt could particularly impact platforms like Facebook FB and Googles GOOGL YouTube which rely on usergenerated content Google has been accused of lobbying aggressively to prevent the directive from being passed into lawThe issue has drawn attention from notable

Facebook data leak Regulation is necessaryKrystal HuReporterYahoo FinanceMarch  ReblogShareTweetShareFacebooks data leaksent the company stock FB plunging more than  in the past week and raised heated debate on the tech companys privacy policy and whether it  and other firms that collect user data  should be more heavily regulatedOnSaturdayApples CEO Tim Cook commented on the issue calling for wellcrafted regulations at theannual China DevelopmentForumin BeijingWeve worried for a number of years that people in many countries were giving up data probably without knowing fully what they were doing and that these detailed profiles that were being built of them that one day something would occur and people would be incredibly offended by what had been done without them being aware of it Unfortunately that prediction has come true more than once Cook said when asked about the Facebook data misuse by Cambridge Analytica I think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some wellcrafted regulation is necessaryApple has emphasized security and privacy as an important selling point in its products Unlike Google or Facebook whose revenue is driven by ads Apple mainly makes money by selling premium devices like iPads and iPhones Cook finds the idea of collecting data and selling them to marketers unacceptable The ability of anyone to know what youve been browsing about for years who your contacts are who their contacts are things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life  from my own point of view it shouldnt exist Cook saidApples business model is differentUnlike other tech giants like Facebook and Google Apple says it doesnt profit from collecting user data AP PhotoElise AmendolaMoreCook said he has been careful of inviting government regulations Back in  Apple had a wellknown dispute with the FBI over obtaining access to an iPhone used by a shooter in the San Bernardino attack Though the FBI ultimately broke into the phone without Apples help Apple pledged it would go to court to protect user privacy Last year Sen Al Franken raisedprivacy issues on the iPhone XsFace ID authentication technologyApple soon responded by clarifying the data would never be sent to Apple nor is it included in device backupsIts not the first time that Cook has critiqued peer tech companies In an open letter in  he emphasized that Apple doesnt build profiles of its users from their email content or browsing habits to sell to advertisers essentially calling out Google and Facebook Our business model is very straightforward We sell great products he wrote We dont build a profile based on your email content or web browsing habits to sell to advertisers We dont monetize the information you store on your iPhone or in iCloud

Engineeringspeaks during an announcement of new products at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose Calif Facebook and other companies routinely track your online surfing habits to better target ads at you Two web browsers now want to help you fight back in whats becoming an escalating privacy arms race New protections in Apples Safari and Mozillas Firefox browsers aim to prevent companies from turning cookie data files used to store signin details and preferences into broader trackers that take note of what you read watch and research on other sites AP PhotoMarcio Jose Sanchez MoreNEW YORK AP  Facebook and other companies routinely track your online surfing habits to better target ads at you Two web browsers now want to help you fight back in whats becoming an escalating privacy arms raceNew protections in Apples Safari and Mozillas Firefox browsers aim to prevent companies from turning cookie data files used to store signin details and preferences into broader trackers that take note of what you read watch and research on other sitesLance Cottrell creator of the privacy service Anonymizer said Apples effort was particularly significant as it takes aim at a technique developed by tracking companies to override users attempts to delete their cookiesSafari makes these protections automatic in updates coming Tuesday to iPhones and iPads and a week later to Mac computers Firefox has similar protections on Apple mobile devices and is rolling out them out to personal computers in the coming monthsTo get the protections youll have to break your habit of using Googles Chrome browser which by some estimates has more than half of the worldwide browser usage Safari and Firefox have less than  percent combinedEven then Safari and Firefox cant entirely stop tracking For starters they wont block tracking when youre using Facebook or Google itself Nor can they help much when you use phone or tablet apps unless the app happens to embed Safari as Twitters iPhone app doesBut Will Strafach a mobile security expert who is designing data security tools for phones said imperfect protection is better than no protection He notes that burglars can still break down a door but that doesnt mean you shouldnt bother locking itCookies and other trackers can be used by companies to keep track of who you are as you move from website to website The companies can build a digital profile as you say read about Democratic or Republican viewpoints buy a particular brand of pet food or indulge in the entire season of Keeping Up With The KardashiansNews video and other thirdparty sites use Google and Facebook cookies to customize ads to your hobbies and interests rather than hawking products you might never buy Thats why you might see an ad for shoes soon after searching for them elsewhereApple says its tests show that some popular websites are embedded with more than  such trackers Many of these are from Facebook and Google which are expected to command a combined  percent of the  billion US digital advertising market this year according to the research group eMarketerThough general awareness of data collection has grown in the wake of Facebooks Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal  how trackers work behind the scenes remains a mystery to many peopleGhostery and other products have long offered tracking protection The browsers are now trying to incorporate that directly so you dont have to go looking for browser addonsSafari will try to automatically distinguish cookies that are useful from ones that are there just to track you Apple notes that cookies can appear in unexpected places such as sites that embed like and share buttons Now those cookies will be blocked until you click on one of those buttons in which case youll be prompted for permission to allow the tracking If you dont your like wont registerSafari is also attacking a technique developed to circumvent cookie deletions Through fingerprinting a company can identify you through your computers characteristics such as browser type and fonts installed Your new cookie can then be tied to your old profile Safari will now limit the technical details it sendsFirefox has an antitracking feature that also tries to distinguish tracking cookies from useful ones Its on by default only on Apples mobile devices Mozilla is testing a broader rollout for personal computers though its plans for Android are not yet known For now you need to turn it on or use a privatebrowsing mode which gets more aggressive at killing cookies including useful onesFor PCs Firefox also has an optional addon called Facebook Container to segregate your Facebook activity from everything else Think of it as a wall that prevents Facebook from accessing its data cookie as you surf elsewhere A version is available for other trackers too but requires configuration on your partStory continuesNone of the Firefox tools though address fingerprintingUnsurprisingly advertisers arent happyIn a statement Interactive Advertising Bureau executive Dennis Buchheim said that even as browsers makers feel pressured to deliver privacycentric features they should consider the importance of advertising in enabling free servicesThe new Safari and Firefox tools dont block ads But without cookies websites might get paid a lot less for them said Jed Williams chief innovation officer at the Local Media Association an industry group for news publishersApple and Mozilla are able to push the boundaries on privacy because neither depends on advertising Google makes most of its money from selling adsFacebook and Google declined comment on the Safari and Firefox tools But Google said its Chrome browser offers tools to control and delete cookies and set preferences for certain websites Google says users can also decline personalization and get generic ads instead though tracking continues in the background while using the companys

Engineeringspeaks during an announcement of new products at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose Calif Facebook and other companies routinely track your online surfing habits to better target ads at you Two web browsers now want to help you fight back in whats becoming an escalating privacy arms race New protections in Apples Safari and Mozillas Firefox browsers aim to prevent companies from turning cookie data files used to store signin details and preferences into broader trackers that take note of what you read watch and research on other sites AP PhotoMarcio Jose Sanchez MoreNEW YORK AP  Facebook and other companies routinely track your online surfing habits to better target ads at you Two web browsers now want to help you fight back in whats becoming an escalating privacy arms raceNew protections in Apples Safari and Mozillas Firefox browsers aim to prevent companies from turning cookie data files used to store signin details and preferences into broader trackers that take note of what you read watch and research on other sitesLance Cottrell creator of the privacy service Anonymizer said Apples effort was particularly significant as it takes aim at a technique developed by tracking companies to override users attempts to delete their cookiesSafari makes these protections automatic in updates coming Tuesday to iPhones and iPads and a week later to Mac computers Firefox has similar protections on Apple mobile devices and is rolling out them out to personal computers in the coming monthsTo get the protections youll have to break your habit of using Googles Chrome browser which by some estimates has more than half of the worldwide browser usage Safari and Firefox have less than  percent combinedEven then Safari and Firefox cant entirely stop tracking For starters they wont block tracking when youre using Facebook or Google itself Nor can they help much when you use phone or tablet apps unless the app happens to embed Safari as Twitters iPhone app doesBut Will Strafach a mobile security expert who is designing data security tools for phones said imperfect protection is better than no protection He notes that burglars can still break down a door but that doesnt mean you shouldnt bother locking itCookies and other trackers can be used by companies to keep track of who you are as you move from website to website The companies can build a digital profile as you say read about Democratic or Republican viewpoints buy a particular brand of pet food or indulge in the entire season of Keeping Up With The KardashiansNews video and other thirdparty sites use Google and Facebook cookies to customize ads to your hobbies and interests rather than hawking products you might never buy Thats why you might see an ad for shoes soon after searching for them elsewhereApple says its tests show that some popular websites are embedded with more than  such trackers Many of these are from Facebook and Google which are expected to command a combined  percent of the  billion US digital advertising market this year according to the research group eMarketerThough general awareness of data collection has grown in the wake of Facebooks Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal  how trackers work behind the scenes remains a mystery to many peopleGhostery and other products have long offered tracking protection The browsers are now trying to incorporate that directly so you dont have to go looking for browser addonsSafari will try to automatically distinguish cookies that are useful from ones that are there just to track you Apple notes that cookies can appear in unexpected places such as sites that embed like and share buttons Now those cookies will be blocked until you click on one of those buttons in which case youll be prompted for permission to allow the tracking If you dont your like wont registerSafari is also attacking a technique developed to circumvent cookie deletions Through fingerprinting a company can identify you through your computers characteristics such as browser type and fonts installed Your new cookie can then be tied to your old profile Safari will now limit the technical details it sendsFirefox has an antitracking feature that also tries to distinguish tracking cookies from useful ones Its on by default only on Apples mobile devices Mozilla is testing a broader rollout for personal computers though its plans for Android are not yet known For now you need to turn it on or use a privatebrowsing mode which gets more aggressive at killing cookies including useful onesFor PCs Firefox also has an optional addon called Facebook Container to segregate your Facebook activity from everything else Think of it as a wall that prevents Facebook from accessing its data cookie as you surf elsewhere A version is available for other trackers too but requires configuration on your partStory continuesNone of the Firefox tools though address fingerprintingUnsurprisingly advertisers arent happyIn a statement Interactive Advertising Bureau executive Dennis Buchheim said that even as browsers makers feel pressured to deliver privacycentric features they should consider the importance of advertising in enabling free servicesThe new Safari and Firefox tools dont block ads But without cookies websites might get paid a lot less for them said Jed Williams chief innovation officer at the Local Media Association an industry group for news publishersApple and Mozilla are able to push the boundaries on privacy because neither depends on advertising Google makes most of its money from selling adsFacebook and Google declined comment on the Safari and Firefox tools But Google said its Chrome browser offers tools to control and delete cookies and set preferences for certain websites Google says users can also decline personalization and get generic ads instead though tracking continues in the background while using the companys

trackersDaniel HowleyTechnology Editor Yahoo FinanceJune  ReblogShareTweetShareEver since Facebooks FB massive Cambridge Analytica scandal broke Apple AAPL CEO Tim Cook has made no bones about his distaste for the social media giants mishandling of its users data Now Cook and company are taking their own steps to jam up social media sites webtracking tools by blocking them in both the upcoming macOS Mojave and iOS  versions of Apples Safari browser In other words the war of words between Facebook and Apple seems to have just gone hotBlocking social trackingIn Safari enhanced Intelligent Tracking Prevention helps block social media Like or Share buttons and comment widgets from tracking users without permission Apple said in a statementThe move wont completely stop you from being able to use Like and Share buttons or make comments on sites using Facebook plugins on websites but it will require you to take the extra step of confirming that you want to have Facebook share your data via a popup that warns of as muchIf you dont confirm you want to use the Like or Share buttons or leave a comment they wont be able to track your data at all This is especially important for people who dont have Facebook but can still be tracked through these social featuresSocial tracking will be curtailed in macOS Mojave and iOS MoreThats a big move on Apples part and follows Cooks comments that consumers data and privacy is a civil right and human right When he was asked how he would handle Facebooks data scandal during an interview with MSNBC Cook he wouldnt be in this situationThis isnt the first time that Apple has hit out at social media sites and other platforms for trafficking in users data Cook previously expressed how Apple could easily monetize user data to make an enormous sum of cash but chooses not to on moral groundsOf course Apple has had issues of its own when it comes to how its iPhones are builtFacebooks Mark Zuckerberg hasnt taken the criticism lying down though In an interview with Vox he called Cooks comments extremely glib and said that if you are going to build a service that connects people around the world some of whom cant afford to pay an

on the kinds of devices they use Called fingerprinting this technique allows advertisers to track web users based on the machine they use the kinds of fonts they use and legacy plugins they useApple says that these kinds of indicators can make it easy for advertisers to accurately track users across multiple sites and get a better picture of who you are With the macOS Mojave version of Safari though Apple is making it harder for advertisers to see who you are and what you likeIts a move that will surely make privacy advocates happy but will raise the ire of your advertisers and

information to FacebookApples new App Store rules appear to be intentionally worded to target apps like Onavo Photograph Greg BakerAFPGetty ImagesMoreApple has updated its rules to restrict app developers ability to harvest data from mobile phones which could be bad news for a Facebookowned data security app called Onavo ProtectOnavo ostensibly provides users with a free virtual private network VPN which it claims helps keep you and your data safe when you browse and share information on the web What is not immediately obvious is that it feeds information to Facebook about what other apps you are using and how much you are using them back to the social networking giantThe problem with Onavo is that it talks about being a VPN that keeps your data private but behind the scenes its harvesting your data for Facebook said Ryan Dochuk CEO of the paidfor VPN TunnelBear It goes against what people generally expect when they use a VPNOnavo has been a Trojan horse for Facebook in the classical sense not as malware allowing it to gather intelligence on the apps people use on tens of millions of devices outside its empire This realtime market research highlights which apps are becoming popular and which are struggling Such competitive intelligence can inform acquisition targets and negotiations as well as identify popular features it could copy in rival appsAs first reported by Bloomberg Apples new App Store rules explicitly ban the collection of information about which other apps are installed on a users device for the purposes of analytics or advertisingmarketing which appears to be intentionally worded to clamp down on apps like OnavoApple has been very clear that its proprivacy  said Joseph Jerome a privacy specialist from the Center for Democracy and Technology and with every iteration of iOS Apples mobile operating system has been trying to restrain the ability of apps to know whats going on on the device if a user hasnt authorised itOnavo started life in Tel Aviv in  as a startup that helped people reduce their wireless bills by compressing incoming data on an iPhone or Android device It also highlighted which apps were using the most data For mobile publishers it provided analytics to help them keep track of how their apps were performing against competitors In May  it launched a VPN called Onavo Protect which promised to

provides information to Facebook about what other apps you are using and how much you are using them Photograph Christophe MorinIPGetty ImagesMoreVPNs work by redirecting and encrypting all data leaving your computer phone or tablet and sending it to another server in another location They position themselves as tools for protecting peoples privacy and security but that very much depends on who is running the VPN and how they make their moneyThis server is in a really privileged position said Dochuk Essentially it needs  of consumer trust because  of their data is going through that serverThis means whoever runs the VPN knows which apps are installed on your device and how much you use them which websites you visit and your device type and locationThere are some VPNs such as TunnelBear that cover their server and bandwidth costs through paid subscriptions and others like Hola and Onavo that provide a free service to the end user but extract value from the data they collect or by selling peoples unused bandwidthStory continuesIf youre not paying with your money you are probably paying with your data said Will Strafach a security specialist who has analysed the Onavo appAccording to the Wall Street Journal Facebook employees have put the Onavo data to good use by monitoring the performance of rival Snapchat particularly after Facebooks Instagram app launched similar features Onavos data also reportedly helped guide Facebooks decision to buy WhatsApp for bn in  and to clone the popular group video chat app HousepartyIn written questions following CEO Mark Zuckerbergs congressional testimony in April lawmakers asked Facebook whether its use of data gleaned from Onavo violated the privacy consumers expect of a VPNFacebook said that it explained what data it would receive when a user installed the appThis helps us improve and operate the Onavo service by analysing your use of websites apps and data Onavo Protects App Store messaging reads Because were part of Facebook we also use this info to improve Facebook products and services gain insights into the products and services people value and build better experiencesUsers have to accept these terms before using the appThe company has acknowledged it uses Onavo to monitor competitors but it insists this is not unusual Websites and apps have used market research services for yearsFacebook said it did not connect the app usage data collected through Onavo to the data collected from an individuals Facebook accountStrafach said it would be easy for Facebook to connect the data if the person also had the Facebook app installed on their phoneYou just have to trust that they are not doing that he saidGiven Facebooks recent track record with data privacy that trust may have slightly

   Commentary Will Obama use Facebook politicsStory Highlights Julian Zelizer Obama is proposing ambitious initiatives on many fronts  He says getting  votes in the Senate for the programs will be a challenge  Webbased politics helped build support for Obama during the election he says  Zelizer This will be a test of whether Facebook politics is really powerful Next Article in Politics    By Julian E Zelizer Special to CNN 



 


 

   Editors note Julian E Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton Universitys Woodrow Wilson School He is completing a book on the history of national security politics since World War II to be published by Basic Books Zelizer writes widely on current events 
Julian Zelizer says Obamas programs could be a key test of the power of Webbased political organizing 
 PRINCETON New Jersey CNN  The battle over the federal budget is about to begin President Obama has laid out an ambitious agenda  He told Congress it would not be sufficient to stimulate the economy in the shortterm Now is the time to act boldly and wisely  to not only revive this economy but to build a new foundation for lasting prosperity Obama said  Now is the time to jumpstart job creation restart lending and invest in areas like energy health care and education that will grow our economy even as we make hard choices to bring our deficit down As the president pushes for Congress to enact his budget he is unlikely to receive much Republican support The vote over the first economic stimulus bill revealed that partisanship is alive and well in Washington   In addition the budget proposal will open the president up to the familiar Republican attack of being a taxandspend liberal Obama should not underestimate how effective such criticism can be He can just ask Bill Clinton who saw Republicans take over Congress in  following the defeat of his health care proposal President Obamas biggest problem is the Senate where Democrats do not have the  votes they need to end a filibuster In the past few decades the congressional minority has been able and willing to hold up almost any piece of legislation with the threat of a filibuster Unlike earlier eras the filibuster is no longer reserved for high profile legislation but instead is a normal tool of partisan warfare Unlike in the House where only a majority is required to pass a bill in the Senate a small group of centrist Republicans and Democrats can play a commanding role Last month Sens Nelson and Collins forced Obamas hand by convincing him to ask for much less spending than he believed necessary

   Now the battle starts again One of the most potentially powerful tools President Obama could use is the netroots which some think he can use to build pressure in the states where  Republican Senate seats will be in play in the  midterm elections Using what might be called Facebook politics the netroots could raise money to campaign against opponents of Obamas budget proposals They might also encourage volunteers to explain and promote Obamas policies to their neighbors  They could also provide a forum to counteract Republican attacks and remind senators of the kind of voter turnout they might encounter in the midterm elections if they decide to stand in the way of Obamas program  Of course Republicans could counter with their own Webbased politics but so far they have lagged behind the Democrats   When Obama proposed the economic stimulus legislation in January he didnt really use Facebook politics and instead relied on an insidethebeltway approach He let legislators hammer out the details without heavyhanded presidential intervention Obama traveled around red states to build support for his plan but not until after the deal was essentially done There was some advertising activity by groups such as MoveOnOrg in the home states of Republican senators but coordination appears to have been limited Now comes the big test If President Obama follows through on his promise of using the tools of his campaign for the challenges of governance we will learn just how strong the netroots really is The ambition for many who put this network together is to provide the same sort of political support that political machines offered in the late th and early th century  organizational powerhouses that brought people into office and built support for their legislation Obamas presidency will allow us to see whether the netroots can provide a viable alternative The potential weakness of the netroots was recently captured in a BBC parody of Facebook the social networking site In the video a young gentleman Edward Baxter opens his door and is greeted by a school mate named Todd We sat next to each other in math we didnt get on remember Todd reminds Edward The schoolmate asks him to confirm or ignore convincing the confused Edward to accept this request   The video moves through a series of jokes that reveal how shallow these interactions can be such as when Todd explains he can put embarrassing pictures for all of his real friends in his proper life to see Asking if his mother is a friend the classmate yells out status update as another person writes all over the outer wall of the house The satire is biting unmasking the thinness of so much of our modern interaction We dont know how much of this parody is true of the netroots The stakes are high If Obama can show that Facebook politics is as organizationally strong as the party politics of yesteryear then he would on to something big Not only would the president be able to tap into a powerful political army that could pressure legislators into supporting his agenda but he very well could introduce a new paradigm for governance one that would remain a model for future presidents On the other hand when he calls on the netroots to support him against those pesky senators he might learn that many of his virtual supporters have already clicked onto another page The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer

  Secret Service investigating Facebook poll on ObamaStory HighlightsSite member built poll asking if president should be killedSocial networking site pulls thirdparty application that allows users to create polls Possible poll responses yes maybe if he cuts my health care and noFacebook lets thirdparty developers create applications such as polls quizzesNext Article in Politics   Read VIDEO   



 


 

  CNN  The social networking site Facebook on Monday pulled a thirdparty application that allows users to create polls after a site member built a poll asking if President Obama should be killed 
There are more than  applications on Facebook The company says it disables any that violate its terms 
 The US Secret Service the agency assigned to protect the president has launched an investigation agency spokesman James Mackin said As is usually the case our vigilant users reported it to us first Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt told CNN The USSS Secret Service sent us an email late this morning PDT asking us to take it down At that point it had already been removed and we let them know   Schnitt said the application was immediately suspended while the inappropriate content could be removed by the developer and until such time as the developer institutes better procedures to monitor their usergenerated content  Watch report on Facebook poll  Facebook allows thirdparty developers to create applications  such as polls and quizzes  which are then made available to Facebook users who use the applications to create specific content Users may choose to make their content available to the general population of Facebook or limit it only to their friends   In this case Schnitt said the user made the poll asking whether Obama should be killed available to the general public 





 The possible responses to the poll were yes maybe if he cuts my health care and no Schnitt said the poll appears to have been posted over the weekend

 The company also alerts antifraud partner MarkMonitor which passes the phishing URL on to the major browsers to block it and contacts ISPs to take the site down according to Schnitt To protect against phishing scams Facebook users should make sure that the URL they are visiting says wwwfacebookcom If it doesnt use that domain its likely to be spam Also members that are already logged in to Facebook will not be asked to log in again People should have a healthy dose of suspicion and ask themselves why did I get logged out Schnitt said If something looks a little strange you should check the address bar Facebook users who think they have been affected by the scam should change their passwords and review their Facebook stream for any unauthorized changes If they use their Facebook password for other sites they should change those passwords as well  And if they are using their Facebook authentication to log in to any other sites they should check for any unauthorized changes on those sites

  WIRED  The US Marine Corps has banned Twitter Facebook MySpace and other social media sites from its networks effective immediately 
The Marine Corps fears that social media sites such as Facebook could pose a security risk 
 These internet sites in general are a proven haven for malicious actors and content and are particularly high risk due to information exposure user generated content and targeting by adversaries reads a Marine Corps order issued Monday  The very nature of SNS social network sites creates a larger attack and exploitation window exposes unnecessary information to adversaries and provides an easy conduit for information leakage that puts OPSEC operational security COMSEC communications security and personnel at an elevated risk of compromise The Marines ban will last a year It was drawn up in response to a late July warning from US Strategic Command which told the rest of the military it was considering a Defense Departmentwide ban on the Web  sites due to network security concerns  Scams worms and Trojans often spread unchecked throughout social media sites passed along from one online friend to the next

FriendFeed consolidates updates from social media and bookmarking sites blogs and RSS feeds 
 Facebook and FriendFeed share a common vision of giving people tools to share and connect with their friends FriendFeed cofounder Bret Taylor said in a release  We cant wait to join the team and bring many of the innovations weve developed at FriendFeed to Facebooks  million users around the world TechCrunch reported the news on Monday a matter of minutes before Facebook confirmed the acquisition Im going to go out on a limb and say it This is not as ridiculously huge of a deal as the Silicon Valley hype machine is going to have you believe Basically FriendFeed has been coasting on a lot of hype and not a lot of mainstream recognition and its not a bit surprising that it would be seeking an exit at this point

 Facebook acquired it for its talent prior to FriendFeed Taylor was part of the team that helped launch Google Maps So the real story here is that Facebook made the rather expensive hire and we dont know the terms of the deal of some very talented former Googlers  FriendFeeds cofounders will hold senior roles on Facebooks engineering and product teams according to the release and the rest of the companys  employees will also join Facebook This would also be consistent with Facebooks minimal past acquisition history the company bought littleknown startup Parakey two years ago with the primary objective of getting its founders the creators of the Firefox browser on board  Its also wellknown that Facebook tried hard to acquire Twitter  which wouldve been a far more significant acquisition than FriendFeed  and was turned down Well there was also ConnectU whose assets Facebook acquired pretty much just to get that pesky lawsuit off the table The release from Facebook repeatedly hinted that this is about talent more than product Since I first tried FriendFeed Ive admired their team for creating such a simple and elegant service for people to share information Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in the statement  As this shows our culture continues to make Facebook a place where the best engineers come to build things quickly that lots of people will use Yup As we spent time with Mark Zuckerberg and his leadership team we were impressed by the open creative culture theyve built and their desire to have us contribute to it said FriendFeed cofounder Paul Buchheit another exGoogler who was instrumental in building Gmail  It was immediately obvious to us how passionate Facebooks engineers are about creating simple groundbreaking ways for people to share and we are extremely excited to join such a likeminded group But Facebook director of product Christopher Cox said to CNET News later I wouldnt call it a talent acquisition  He elaborated We really have a vision thats focusing on Facebook being not just a destination but being a service  We think FriendFeeds been focused on how thats going to work in an open way and thats something were excited about not just the people but the product theyve built FriendFeed earned praise from prominent voices in Silicon Valley  most notably Robert Scoble  but its aim to aggregate all of a users social networking activity feeds in one place didnt catch on with the mainstream  But Facebook eventually began to mimic the FriendFeed model through upgrades to its central news feed feature letting members pull in select thirdparty updates Bret Taylor said that FriendFeed wasnt shopping itself around We werent up for sale We had a healthy amount of financing and a really efficient company he told CNET News  As we noticed our products were really converging in terms of product vision we started having casual conversations with Facebook Its not clear what will happen to the FriendFeed service because it sure sounds like Facebook is eager to get its team onto the engineering fast track FriendFeedcom will continue to operate normally for the time being a post by Taylor on the FriendFeed blog read  Were still figuring out our longer term plans for the product with the Facebook team Taylor elaborated more to CNET News later on Monday Anything that we would do would be more of a transition not shutting down I think our users have invested in our product by putting their data in it sharing it with their friends We absolutely wouldnt shut FriendFeed down

  Facebook makes privacy changesStory Highlights Facebook to overhaul its privacy policy following Canadian investigation  Social network site will make it clearer for users to know what info is being shared Canadian Privacy Commissioner flagged thirdparty applications as privacy concern  New Facebook policy will mean user consent needed by all app developers Next Article in Technology    By  Dean Irvine CNN 



 


 

  CNN  Facebook has announced it is to overhaul its privacy settings to make it clearer for users to know who has access to their personal data  
Facebook has agreed to update its privacy settings after a Canadian Privacy Commission report 
 The news follows an investigation into the privacy policy of the social networking site by Canadas Privacy Commissioner  The social networking site has agreed to make changes that it believes will provide its users with greater transparency and control over their personal information and how it is used  These changes mean that the privacy of  million Facebook users in Canada and around the world will be far better protected said Canadas Privacy Commissioner Jennifer Stoddart in a press statement  In July Stoddart issued an initial report on an investigation into Facebook that followed a complaint from a privacy advocacy group the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic at the University of Ottawa  The main concerns highlighted by the report were the lack of clarity over privacy settings and how much personal information is shared with thirdparty developers of applications such as games and quizzes

 In response to the investigation Facebook has agreed to make significant enhancements over the next  months WHO says This would include clarifying its privacy policy so that users can clearly understand why personal information like date of birth is requested the difference between deactivating and deleting an account and how its advertising works  Another key amendment is that Facebook will retrofit its application platform in order to prevent developers from accessing users personal information  unless users provide explicit consent  Application developers have had virtually unrestricted access to Facebook users personal information The changes Facebook plans to introduce will allow users to control the types of personal information that applications can access Stoddart said in her statement  Work on the planned changes will begin immediately although Facebook has said some changes will take some time before they are visible Updates to Facebooks privacy policy will require a notice and comment period for users  It has also said the changes to how users share information with thirdparty applications will require time and resources both for the updating and testing of the new Facebook application platform and for thirdparty application developers to reprogram and test their applications  We will be communicating regularly with developers about the changes and were going to take our time to make sure the outcome is something users understand and that developers have ample time and notice to adapt Ethan Beard Director of Platform Product Marketing at Facebook said in a statement  Elliot Schrage Vice President of Global Communications and Public Policy at Facebook added in a prepared statement that the changes would provide even greater transparency and control for Facebook users  We believe that these changes are not only great for our users and address all of the Commissioners outstanding concerns but they also set a new standard for the industry

Information Privacy

 CNN  A large popup box will greet Facebook users logging on to the socialnetworking site on Thursday asking them to modify their privacy settings The company says the changes will help streamline privacy controls that have confused many of its  million users and were sprawled over six separate pages  What is getting the thumbsdown Complaints have started flowing in focusing on three areas The changes treat as publicly available information the following your name profile picture current city gender and networks and the pages youre a fan of Until now you had the option of restricting much of that information That option has been removed  The ramifications as the nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation sees them For example you might want to join the fan page of a controversial issue like a page that supports or condemns the legalization of gay marriage and let all your personal friends see this on your profile but hide it from your officemates relatives or the public at large You cannot do so now The foundation says These changes are especially worrisome because even something as seemingly innocuous as your list of friends can reveal a great deal about you In September for example an MIT study nicknamed Gaydar demonstrated that researchers could accurately predict a Facebook users sexual orientation simply by examining the users friends list  Facebook counters that a users friends list can be made nonviewable But it is either viewable by all or by no one Another source of consternation is Facebook apps such as the quizzes developed by third parties that many users are fond of taking Until now Facebook provided an option so you could specify that your information not be shared with others when one of your friends adds such an app But now whenever a friend adds an app your publicly available information becomes accessible to the developer So why did Facebook undertake the changes  The Weblog TechCrunch explains it this way If a user retains the Everyone option the information is accessible by the Web at large In short this is Facebooks answer to Twitter  That means Facebook can leverage it for realtime search and can also syndicate it to other places like Google and Bing The feature has been available in the sites privacy settings since last summer but most people didnt use it and probably didnt even know it was there The new privacy launch today puts this as the default option for many users The changes have met with mixed reaction By early Thursday more than  users had approved of the changes on the Facebook blog But about  people said they were unhappy The new settings are ridiculous commented user Victoria Anne Archer I have less control than before and my friends are visible to everyone  I cant hide them  but I have no choice  because if I select only friends  then NO ONE CAN FIND ME What is getting the thumbsup The most commended aspect of the new settings is that they allow users to micromanage who can access every bit of information on the site One way to do so is to separate your friends into lists and grant those lists varying levels of accessibility For example if you would rather your bosses not know what you do on downtime you can place them on a specially created list In addition a user can specify accessibility post by post After each status update you type or photo you post you can pick from a dropdown menu whether you want that item visible to everyone to just your friends or to friends of friends as well  How to access the changes The new controls will be available under the Settings link at the top right of every page in addition to being available in the dialogue box For each section  profile information contact information applications and search  users will be asked to pick from three options about who can access the information Friends Friends of friends or Everyone The changes do away with regional networks which let users designate themselves as residents of a geographic area But Facebook is retaining school and companybased networks It is worth noting that many users will find their privacy options set at Recommended settings by default If you retain those your information will be available to everyone If you would rather the site not share your information publicly you will need to click through each section and restrict it to Friends only This applies for photos as well A user will have to specify album by album how much access to grant others In addition you will have to go under Search and specify whether you want Facebook to make your information available to users who look for you on Facebook and on the Web

   Facebook users wage condom campaign against PopeStory Highlights Facebook users plan to send condoms to Pope Benedict XVI  Pope Benedict XVI recently said condoms are not the answer to stop HIVAIDS  Vatican has long opposed use of condoms other forms of birth control Next Article in World    By  Faith Karimi CNN 



 


 

  CNN  Critics took to the social networking site Facebook to voice their fury over Pope Benedicts remark that condoms do not prevent HIV 

Pope Benedict XVIs anticondom comments have raised the ire of some Facebook users 


 Thousands have pledged to send the pontiff millions of condoms to protest the controversial comment he made to journalists as he flew to Cameroon last week You cant resolve it with the distribution of condoms the pope told reporters On the contrary it increases the problem  Pope Benedict XVI has made it clear he intends to uphold the traditional Catholic teaching on artificial contraception The Vatican has long opposed the use of condoms and other forms of birth control and encourages sexual abstinence to fight the spread of the disease  About a dozen Facebook groups have sprung up mostly from European countries criticizing the pontiff   The clergy arent supposed to have sex at all but they are free to tell people how to conduct themselves Thats like a girl who wears no makeup as the CEO of CoverGirl one member posted on the page Condoms for Pope Benedict XVI It frightens me that a man who has devoted his life to moral guidance  and is undeniably a learned intelligent man can be at the same time so narrowminded bigoted and irresponsible posted another person on a different page

 The online campaign added another voice to a deluge of criticism which includes the governments of France Germany and Belgium Aid agencies and other health organizations have also chimed in The Lancet a British medical journal urged the pope Saturday to issue a retraction for the outrageous and wildly inaccurate statement to journalists aboard his plane When any influential person be it a religious or political leader makes a false scientific statement that could be devastating to the health of millions of people they should retract or correct the public record The Lancet said in an editorial Anything less from Pope Benedict would be an immense disservice to the public and health advocates including many thousands of Catholics who work tirelessly to try and prevent the spread of HIVAIDS worldwide Some in the Catholic Church have rallied to the pontiffs support   Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco head of the Italian Bishops Conference told Times Online in Britain that Benedict was simply pointing out that condoms had not solved and could not solve the AIDS problem Despite the controversy the popes pilgrimage spurred excitement in Africa An estimated  million people turned out to hear him preach a Mass in Angola on Sunday the last major event of his trip He spoke of the need for reconciliation in the country which has endured a brutal civil war Look to the future with hope trust in Gods promises and live in his truth In this way you will build something that will stand and endure he said

 The Frisky  Social networking on the Internet is the easiest way to keep in touch with your pals tell people what youre up to without you know talking to them promote your parties and bask in your buddies love  Back in the day MySpace was like the Wild West  you could post do and say anything you wanted Heck it turned hussies like Tila Tequila into stars with their own TV shows But now everyone  including our parents  has jumped on the Facebook bandwagon Its so mainstream theres already a scripted movie about the start of Facebook The Social Network which opened last week So how do you keep your page fun to use yet still appropriate for your family and coworkers to read Here are  important tips The Frisky  celebs who showed way too much in Twitter pics  Tag youre it Every time someone posts a picture of me with my eyes closed a chubby double chin sweat stains and a face full of runny mascara I want to die andor kill them But luckily its easy to do some easy damage control Simply click on the offensive pic then remove the tag  Dont drink and type After a funfilled party night youre all amped Then you come home and surf the Internet because youre not ready to go to bed Its only natural But beware Perusing Facebook is one thing trying to drunkenly express yourself in a comment or befriending someone you wouldnt if you were sober is another  So look but dont touch your page or your friends pages when youre loaded You dont want to wake up with a hangover and a rude awakening from something stupid you wrote The Frisky Angelina Jolie joins Twitter  Do not delete exes Sure you want to get rid of them from your life physically but unfriending them after youve established Internet friendship makes you look pathetic and bitter Besides if theyre obsessed enough with you to check your page let them stalk away  After all its as close to you as theyll ever get again And if you manage your page right youll always be there looking good  the best revenge you could possibly have But there IS an exception to every rule so of course if your ex is like OJ Simpson you should for sure delete him  ChChChChChanges Everyone modifies their interests hobbies and headlines And sure updating your status is a great way to draw attention to your page but you dont want negative attention  Never click update more than once in a day Nothing makes you look more like a paranoid obsessed loser than changing your info multiple times in the stretch of mere hours  nothing is private on Facebook including the frequency of your activity So commit to your changes and let them go at least a little while before you change them again The Frisky  biggest Facebook dating mistakes  Manage your image Dont empty your camera memory card onto your page Your photo album shouldnt have  snapshots of you from last Halloween in a barely there costume  Edit the way you want to be seen especially now that many employers dig into their potential hires personal info by looking them up online Keep your sexy selfportraits a secret A couple shots with cleavage are OK but overall keep it pretty lowkey and tame  Keep it classy You have the right to choose what is printed about you on the Internet If someone posts a comment about something wild you did back in college you can and should erase it  Save that stuff in your memory bank for reunions because those are inside jokes otherwise the joke will be on you when it hits the public domain And in turn when you write on someones page about something crazy they did its guilt by association  so dont incriminate yourself The Frisky  super annoying ways people abuse Facebook and Twitter  Postpersonality Your page should look and sound like you Post a couple pics with cool cultural references fill in your faves and dont be afraid to be funny Its cool to see what music TV shows and YouTube videos you have in common with your friends  But reading your interests shouldnt take as long as War and Peace Trim down your likes to the essentials With everyone from potential bosses to potential boyfriends scouring the web for dirt why not broadcast the best version of yourself they have plenty of time down the road to see your dark side  Stay away from strangers The Internet is a great matchmaker And sure that hot guy who friendrequested you may seem totally cool but if you dont know him or his band its best not to accept him into your inner Facebook circle Who knows what hell do once he has carte blanche on your page  Granted these people will probably just spam you but still why give them the access And just because you have friends in common doesnt mean you have to accept them Dont give in to peer pressure If you dont know them you dont know them Be more discriminating than the friends you have in commonTM    TMV Inc  All Rights Reserved

 CNN  Rants about your boss or your job may have once been reserved for during afterwork drinks at a bar but employee gripes are now being voiced in the social media sphere Workplace complaints posted on popular sites such as Facebook Twitter and MySpace could get you fired But one federal agency has taken an unusual step to protect one complaining worker The National Labor Relations Board issued a complaint against a Connecticut ambulance service company after it fired a worker for posting unflattering and sometimes vulgar comments about her boss on Facebook The organization accused the company of illegally terminating Dawnmarie Souza and denying her access to union representation during an investigatory review The federal agency is arguing that Souzas criticism of her boss on Facebook is generally a protected concerted activity  But workers should still be wary about what they post on social media sites About a quarter of employers surveyed by the Society of Corporate Compliance and Ethics in  had disciplined an employee for improper activities on social networking sites If a worker posts something negative and a manager finds it he or she can legally be fired some employment attorneys say CNN asked experts on social media etiquette in the workplace How can you engage in online forums without losing your job  Think before you post Imagine if the comment you posted or tweeted will appear in the local newspaper the next day says Tyson B Snow an employment attorney at Manning Curtis Bradshaw  Bednar LLC in Utah While that rule of thumb may sound extreme Snow says it is a safe way to manage your content  On a social media site the audience is unlimited and the content is permanent An employee may post one photo and quickly remove it but someone could still archive the page or make a copy he says  Be picky about who you friend Only allow people you trust into your social network says Shanti Atkins president of ELT Inc an ethics and compliance training company Instead of casually accepting all the coworkers or managers who ask to friend you be selective about who you allow to view your posts  Atkins says employees may forget who they let into their network and that could lead to problems later on  Do it on your own time and computer Try to limit your Facebook and Twitter activity to your personal computer several experts say If you engage in problematic activity on the company property and time this can provide the managers more leverage say several workplace experts  Many employers and workplaces already ban the sites at the workplace to prevent social media spats from becoming an issue  Watch what you post at home Many workers are unaware that mentioning their company in a negative light on the internet  even if its done on personal time at home  could lead to disciplinary measures says John Lusher a social media consultant He says many organizations have departments that monitor social media comments and photographs that pertain to the company  Keep the dialogue positive Social media can be a great way to foster conversations about an employees recent promotion or a company event says Josh Whitford president of Echelon Media a company that specializes in social media But he says certain topics such as trade secrets should never be disclosed online  Figure out privacy settings Social media privacy settings may be tricky but take the time to consider all the different settings says Shanti Atkins at ELT Inc She suggests implementing filters and grouping coworkers and bosses so that certain information does not reach everyone  Learn your employee rights Employees need to make the effort to understand corporate policy regarding the use social media at work and at home says Tyson Snow an employment attorney However most companies dont have such policies in place Only  percent of companies had specific polices to deal with social networking sites according to The Society of Corporate Compliance and Ethics

 Facebook politics is fleeting By Julian E Zelizer Special to CNN      STORY HIGHLIGHTSJulian Zelizer Tea Party adept at Facebook politics rallying supporters via cyberspaceObama Democrats had same success but since election Web support is down he writesHe says Twitter Facebook cant sustain a movement when election drama is overFacebook politics lacks local element and commitment crucial to politics Zelizer saysEditors note Julian E Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University He is the author of Arsenal of Democracy and a book on former President Carter and editor of a book  assessing former President George W Bushs administration to be published this fall by Princeton University Press  CNN  The Tea Party has rekindled excitement in the potential of the internet to nurture mass political movements by using the Web to raise money and mobilize manpower  Activists have used many aspects of cyberspace Facebook pages Twitter feeds iPod apps and more to rally their supporters According to Investorscom Democrats and their allies dominated cyberspace for years Now the political right with the Tea Party explosion at the very least is matching the left The stories about the Tea Party movement resemble the narrative about Barack Obamas campaign In  Democrats used cyberspace to the same effect Relying on what I called Facebook politics the Democrats took Republicans by surprise by demonstrating how powerful a vehicle the internet could be in promoting a candidacy bringing likeminded citizens together and offering an organizational infrastructure for movement politics Yet will this form of organizing work over the long term Can it sustain a movement after the drama of an election is over The verdict is still out Since  President Obama and Democrats have discovered that the kind of movement created by the internet can be extraordinarily fragile and fleeting When Obama recently spoke to students at the University of Wisconsin he implored them not to be apathetic and urged them to return to the world of campaigns 
The experience of being in such a movement is often virtual requiring nothing but a few clicks on a keyboardJulian E Zelizer

In doing so he was acknowledging that the movement created by the campaign had disintegrated since the inauguration The movement has been largely absent from the policy battles that have shaped his administration and it lags in the months leading into  Obamas team may still have all the cell numbers that they collected before announcing their vice presidential pick but few people are answering or texting What makes Facebook politics vulnerable is that it lacks the local element that has always been so crucial to politics The most durable forms of political organization have usually depended on local organizing During the th century political parties were dependent on a dense bottomup structure rooted in the strength of local political machines After Election Day party operatives continued to remain in close contact with voters They worked hard  sometimes through illegal means but very often through policy and straightforward patronage  to retain their loyalty and make sure voters were kept abreast of why their party mattered The social movements of thcentury America depended on local organization as well Malcolm Gladwell recently recounted in The New Yorker that the civil rights movement of the s depended on local activists such as the four AfricanAmerican students who sat in an allwhite Woolworths lunch counter in Greensboro North Carolina and demanded service Their personal ties and friendship as well as their shared experiences inspired them to work together and risk their lives for this bigger cause The movement spread as students throughout the state and in other regions joined the cause Over the next few years activists from the North would travel into Southern states and join the civil rights cause It was the experience of directly participating in the struggles and witnessing the kind of racism that existed that forged their connection to the movement Conservatism in the s was forged through similar dynamics Ronald Reagan did not make modern conservatism Rather thousands of local activists around the country who interacted through church groups civic organizations and even reading clubs gave rise to the modern right It was their facetoface encounters in places such as Orange County California and the shared memory of influencing political leaders and public policy that made these Americans so loyal and willing to continue participating in these struggles over time Facebook politics seems different The cost of participating is much less National conversations are as powerful if not more powerful than local networks The experience of being in such a movement is often virtual requiring nothing but a few clicks on a keyboard Some of the potential weaknesses of Facebook politics can be seen with the new darling of the Tea Party movement Delaware Senate candidate Christine ODonnell Although ODonnell has been omnipresent in the national media she has been notably absent where it matters most Delaware  Matt Bai recently wrote in The New York Times that ODonnell reflects the modern political strategy in that her campaign barely exists at the state level Conservatives from all over the country helped boost her image and reputation online and through television and radio but she has barely had any public events in the state Republican leaders in Wilmington didnt know where she was campaigning Despite her surprise win she is way behind the Democrat in the polls Without question Facebook politics has reshaped the political landscape Local candidates can rake in millions of dollars within days and they can spread their name without anyone going doortodoor or holding fundraisers in the local Holiday Inn But Obama has already learned that this kind of organization can leave successful candidates without their base of support once the excitement of Election Day is over It is far too easy for the most fervent supporter of a candidate or cause to simply defriend the movement and move on to something else Rather than strong shared memories of participating in something bigger than themselves the experience might just leave behind the address of a Web page in the autofill mechanism of their browser or an occasional text alert to remind them of their political past The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer

 Washington CNN  Four Democratic senators called on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday to reconsider the recent changes in its privacy settings and asked the Federal Trade Commission to streamline guidelines regarding privacy on all social networks Now users have less control over private information and it was done without the users permission Sen Charles Schumer DNew York said on Capitol Hill Schumer and Sens Michael Bennet of Colorado Mark Begich of Alaska and Al Franken of Minnesota sent a letter to Zuckerberg about Facebooks decision to allow thirdparty sharing of users information We are writing to express our concern regarding recent changes to the Facebook privacy policy and the use of personal data on third party websites the senators wrote The expansion of Facebook  both in the number of users and applications  raises new concerns for users who want to maintain control over their information Last week Facebook began a small pilot program with Microsoft Docscom Pandora and Yelp that would offer personalized experiences when visiting those sites  These partners have been given access to public information on Facebook  such as names friend lists and interests and likes  to personalize your experience when youre logged into Facebook and visit their sites Austin Haugen a Facebook product manager wrote on the networks blog The senators specifically took issue with the changes because the new settings require users to opt out if they do not want to share any information The way to go is optin Schumer said The default position should be that the information is not shared not that the information is shared  Amplifying his colleagues concerns Schumer called on Facebook to reverse its policy so that users have to opt in to shared data rather than opt out  The New York Democrat added The onus here should be on Facebook not the user Franken emphasized the difficulty for users to opt out under the current settings saying he would read what you have to do to opt out but we really only have so much time Bennet who was a superintendent of the Denver Colorado Public Schools before being appointed to the Senate expressed concerns about children not understanding the privacy issues We want to make sure that when it comes to the very important question of privacy that the users of these websites are in control of their most personal information he said This is an evolutionary technology There is a huge amount of benefit that comes from Facebook and companies like Facebook But we have to be vigilant to protect the information that is in a sense personal Facebook defended its privacy policies in a letter to Schumer before Tuesdays news conference Elliot Schrage Facebooks vice president of global communications said the changes allow for enhanced personalization and social activity while providing users with the ability to limit who is able to view their information Facebook is designed to give people the tools to control their information online and our highest priority is to keep and build the trust of the more than  million people who use our service Schrage wrote These goals were central in the development of the new products we announced last week Specifically these new products and features are designed to enhance personalization and promote social activity across the Internet while continuing to give users unprecedented control over what information they share when they want to share it and with whom All of Facebooks partner sites interact with a users consent Schumer also called on the FTC to streamline guidelines on all social networks to allow users to easily understand privacy settings when signing up for sites Peter Corbett CEO of iStrategy Labs said Facebooks privacy policies are common among digital companies and websites The onus is on the user to opt out of data collection for every major site said Corbett whose firm consults for major brands on digital strategy  Corbett noted that Google collects search information and Amazon collects a detailed analysis of what books and music its consumers are browsing to recommend other products Most users probably dont understand how to opt out nor care Corbett said They want an easy way to buy books on Amazon or connect with friends on Facebook We have sacrificed privacy for convenience CNN has a business relationship with Facebook that allows CNNcom users to recommend and share stories with their Facebook friends This kind of arrangement is not what the senators expressed concern aboutCNNs Evan Glass contributed to this report

   More than  million people a month play FarmVille Zyngas most popular title 
Zyngas top title FarmVille is played by an estimated  million people each month   roughly equal to the number who have played the classic arcade and desktop game Tetris during its entire existence The massive growth was satisfying but not altogether surprising to Pincus whose previous startups had included Freeloader a Webbased informationgathering service techsupport company SupportSoft and Tribenet an early social networking site from  He said that starting the game company which he named after his late English bulldog was an effort to fill what he considered a surprising void in most peoples daily Internet use I thought in  that something had gone oddly wrong with the whole Internet experience Pincus said I would have thought games would have been one of the top two or three experiences people had on the Internet What Pincus got right according to gaming expert Scott Steinberg was a sort of return to the golden era of games like Pacman and Super Mario Bros Video games actually appealed to a huge crosssection They appealed to everybody said Steinberg publisher of DigitalTrendscom What happened is as we went through the mids to the mids you started to see gaming become more incestuous in terms of  to yearold males making games for people just like them

 Young jobseekers hiding their Facebook pagesBy  Stephanie Goldberg Special to CNN      Some Facebook users like Elana Borchers are using aliases  on the socialnetworking site while they hunt for jobs STORY HIGHLIGHTS Students and post grads are changing their names on Facebook while looking for jobs  Survey  percent of US hiring managers have rejected an applicant based on information they found online   Some young jobseekers say they try to keep their Facebook pages hidden from potential employers

 CNN  Justin Gawel says theres nothing too incriminating on his Facebook page There are a lot of pictures of drinking but nothing naked or anything  at least I dont think so he said jokingly Even so the Michigan State University junior recently changed his Facebook display name to Dustin Jawel to keep his personal life from potential employers while applying for summer internships Although Gawel ditched his rhyming alias after two weeks when he realized Facebook users also can be searched by email address school and network he is not alone in his efforts to scrub his online rsum Many students and recent graduates say they are changing their names on Facebook or tightening privacy settings to hide photos and wall posts from potential employers And with good reason A recent survey commissioned by Microsoft found that  percent of recruiters and hiring managers in the United States have rejected an applicant based on information they found online  What kind of information Inappropriate comments by the candidate unsuitable photos and videos criticisms of previous employers coworkers or clients and even inappropriate comments by friends and relatives according to the survey report titled Online Reputation in a Connected World Such prying into his online life makes Gawel uncomfortable I understand that when employers look at someones Facebook page theyre just trying to paint a bigger picture of the people theyre hiring  so theyre not just a name on a rsum he said But that doesnt demonstrate whether they can do the job It shouldnt matter what someone does when theyre not in the office Gawel said hes not sure that employers would object to the information on his Facebook page For him its more about personal privacy Too many people take pictures of you I didnt want to go through and untag all of them he said Theres nothing illegal or too ridiculous in the photos  but people dont take pictures of people studying or doing school work They take pictures of people at parties and doing silly things For better or worse online screenings may be a permanent part of the stcentury hiring process The Microsoft survey found that  percent of US hiring managers have used the Internet to better assess applicants Dan Eggers of Partners Marketing Group in Marietta Georgia is among that  percent We review and certainly do research on anyone were looking at hiring or using as a contract employee Eggers said We would Google their name look at LinkedIn Facebook and Twitter He said his firm usually only consults an applicants online reputation to make sure he or she hasnt misrepresented their work experience We try not to pay a lot of attention to wall posts from others It would take quite a bit for us to be reacting to that Eggers said But racist or homophobic comments will land your rsum and cover letter in the garbage he said People have a false sense of security about their personal information out there on the Web  they think only their friends will see it said Jack Rayman senior director of career services at Pennsylvania State University Elana Borchers an Indiana University senior said she exchanged her last name for her middle name on Facebook in November when she started applying for jobs Borchers even decided to keep her alias after landing a fulltime position a month later Not everything is certain she said If my employers saw something on my profile now that they didnt like they could take my job away Not that shes worried about the content on her Facebook page Theres nothing bad on my profile Id rather they learn about me in person Borchers said Big Ten schools have the reputation of excessive partying Thats something thats here with me in college I dont plan to take that partying with me in the future and I didnt want someone to see that and judge me Borchers said she thought about removing pictures of her partying but theyre my memories and I want to keep them for now Many of Borchers friends are playing the Facebook name game too  dropping their last names or using a nickname to hide from potential employers and gradschool admissions officers A lot of my guy friends changed their user names to a nickname that their friends call them so everyone still knows who it is she said Facebook spokesperson Kathleen Loughlin said she could not comment on the number of users who change their name on Facebook but students who spoke to CNN said that among their peers the trend is rampant Another Indiana University senior Jeffrey Lefcort changed his Facebook user name to Jeffrey David  his middle name  when he began applying for jobs even though he doesnt think his page has anything inappropriate I just didnt want to be found by someone who was looking for me that Im not friends with Lefcort said My Facebook profile is not intended for employers I didnt want them looking at my personal life Like Gawel Lefcort eventually ditched his pseudonym and opted instead to tighten his Facebook privacy settings  something Facebooks Loughlin said is encouraged With the Internet playing such a large role in business today few recruiters dont assess applicants online reputations in some capacity before hiring said George Matlock director of operations at Matlock Advertising and Public Relations in Atlanta Georgia And while Matlock said he almost always Googles a persons name before hiring them he steers clear of Facebook I havent looked at an applicants Facebook page he said I try to stay away from it myself I think its too personal  maybe Im just scared to see whats out there Facebook tends to be something pretty private Emily Mitnick a Michigan State University senior who also changed her name on Facebook said she has nothing to hide but wants to keep a low profile and avoid being searched by potential employers Mitnick uses LinkedIn to communicate with the professional world She describes Facebook as a place where I can be social with my friends and I dont have to be professional  I dont have any of my tagged pictures available to the public  just for precautionary measures not because theyre inappropriate she added I would just like to remain somewhat private Rayman the Penn State career counselor said he recommends that students with potentially incriminating photos or posts change their name on social networking sites But its not always that easy to escape your online reputation he said Web sites are almost impossible to eliminate Rayman said They get cached somewhere and theyll keep coming up It used to be if you had a poor reputation in one school youd move to another and your record didnt necessarily follow you Its getting harder and harder to do that as everyone is on the Internet and everyone knows everyones business

Editors Note Pete Cashmore is founder and CEO of Mashable a popular blog about social media He writes a weekly column about social networking and technology for CNNcom  London England CNN  Facebook this week announced a new way to express your interests  a Like button thats set to appear all around the web Click the button and the Web page is shared with your friends  Whats more every Like you submit ensures Facebook and its partner sites can deliver a more personalized experience to you  Its a simple yet powerful feature  one that delivers a significant blow to rival Twitter Once the network effects take hold its frankly hard to imagine how any company could unseat Facebooks social networking dominance in the months to come Without a counterattack even Google may one day be dethroned Facebook vs Twitter Size Matters  Twitter Facebooks direct competitor has so far been unable to match the social networks growth rate Twitter has  million users Facebook has  million The size of the network is important since Web publishers and Web developers want their products and services to gain the greatest exposure possible  given the choice theyll choose the social platform with the most users  Publishers for instance may choose to put a Twitter Retweet button or a Facebook Like button on their pages Given that the majority of Web site visitors have Facebook accounts the choice becomes an easy one  Not to mention that Facebooks buttons are far more powerful They tell a visitor how many friends have liked a story while an additional widget suggests other stories you might like The Like button will accelerate Facebooks growth by spreading its tendrils to every corner of the web  Likewise Web sites can offer the ability to Log in with Facebook or Sign in with Twitter Conversion rates will likely be higher for those sites that choose Facebook In every case the biggest site wins  Twitters Developer Troubles  Meanwhile Twitters relationship with its developer community  the coders who fueled its growth by creating Twitter applications for phones and the desktop  has hit a rough patch  Twitters acquisition of a popular iPhone app and the release of an official application for BlackBerry users has led some developers to wonder whether they should build Twitter applications at all  wont Twitter just release an official application for every device and kill off all the upstarts Facebooks Like buttons and new tools by contrast offer endless possibilities for developers  Unless Twitter can reboot its growth and convince developers that building Twitter applications is worthwhile Facebook will surely extend its lead  Google Vs Facebook Personalized Search  Facebook looks set to challenge the webs biggest players too Google is under siege by Facebooks newfound ability to target search results and ads Google dominated the web in the era of interlinked Web pages Every link from one Web site to another counted as a vote determining the most relevant pages for any search term The result An unbeatable search engine  Except that links between Web pages are no longer the most abundant source of relevant recommendations  instead people are sharing links with friends on social networks like Facebook and Twitter Now Google is paying those sites for access to public updates but it lacks key data that would allow true personalization of search results Google doesnt have a complete list of your friends combined with a list of their interests Facebook does  Facebook is in a position to build the worlds best search engine One that delivers results based on your friendships and interests The launch of the Like button meanwhile means that Facebook will know more about your individual preferences than ever before  Facebook The Worlds Best Ad Network  Google makes the vast majority of its money from ads  these ads typically match your search terms or the content of the Web page youre viewing Google has certainly worked to personalize these ads but its knowledge of your friends and interests is more limited than Facebooks The data gleaned from thousands of Facebook Like buttons around the web could make for an ad network that rivals Googles AdSense  Googles Social Stumbles  If Google is to maintain its once insurmountable lead in search and advertising the company surely needs to perfect social networking  Google Buzz the search giants most recent foray into the social space received criticism from privacy advocates who noted that a users email contacts were made public upon signup The early hiccups may have been fixed but Buzz has so far failed to catch on Other social projects from Google  OpenSocial Google Friend Connect  are so latent at this point that few are even aware of their existence  If Google is to fend off the Facebook threat it needs new ways to mine a users interests and social connections The hard way would be to develop a new competency in building social applications  something Google has struggled to do The easy way Buy Twitter  Facebooks Success is Not Guaranteed  While Facebook is perfectly positioned to lead the next charge success is by no means guaranteed Twitter is set to release annotations a way to append extra information to Tweets Google has enough money on hand to buy well whatever it wants  And Facebooks user base is volatile They may one day decide to embark on a mass exodus causing Facebook to fall like MySpace and Friendster before it   MASHABLEcom All rights reserved

Editors note Pete Cashmore is founder and CEO of Mashable a popular blog about social media He writes a weekly column about social networking and technology for CNNcom   London England CNN  Facebook dropped a bombshell on the tech industry last week in the form of a Webwide Like button and the launch of the Open Graph Using this new platform Web sites can drive Web traffic from Facebook by including Like buttons on their pages every Like posts an update to that users Facebook page  Whats more any Web site can customize its experience for you if youre logged into Facebook Suddenly CNNcom stories can be ranked not just by an editor but by your friends too  Likes replace links  Facebook announced Likes as a form of social links  better than a link because its related to a specific user If Like buttons take off thats really bad news for Google since its algorithm uses links between sites to determine their order in search results  Facebook seeks to replace this open system of links between pages with the social links or Likes that it controls Google and other search engines wont have full access to all these Likes so the company best positioned to rank the Web will be Facebook No wonder the open Web advocates are sounding the alarm concerned that a single company will stockpile all of our personal information and preferences  Already there are calls to create an OpenLike standard thats accessible to all reports Facebook watcher Nick ONeill  Facebook optimization  Can the measurement of an industry affect the output of that industry If an Academy Award is the ultimate measure of a movie do directors set out to create great films or Oscarwinning ones  Appearing on the first page of Google results for your chosen search term is perhaps the online equivalent of an Oscar win  As Google rose to become the barometer of all thats worthy on the Web publishers rushed to change their sites to appease the Google god Search Engine Optimization became a massive industry a multitude of SEO consultants sprung up offering to tweak your Web site to better fit Googles measure of the Web  What if Facebook Likes take off Or to use the proper jargon What if the Open Graph becomes the measure of the Web Will publishers change their sites to appease our new overlord  Im already seeing it Thousands of sites are adding Facebooks version of semantic data in preference to the open standards as Facebook becomes the new kingmaker In the week since launch more than  Web sites have added Facebooks social plugins All of which will make it blissfully easy for Facebook to organize the Web  Facebook Optimization may be the new SEO  Open Web advocates have reason to be concerned Privacy experts are also raising red flags No doubt theyll find an ally in Google Without access to the stitches that bind Web pages together the search engine could falter

Editors note Pete Cashmore is founder and CEO of Mashable a popular blog about social media He writes a weekly column about social networking and technology for CNNcom   London England CNN  Facebook dropped a bombshell on the tech industry last week in the form of a Webwide Like button and the launch of the Open Graph Using this new platform Web sites can drive Web traffic from Facebook by including Like buttons on their pages every Like posts an update to that users Facebook page  Whats more any Web site can customize its experience for you if youre logged into Facebook Suddenly CNNcom stories can be ranked not just by an editor but by your friends too  Likes replace links  Facebook announced Likes as a form of social links  better than a link because its related to a specific user If Like buttons take off thats really bad news for Google since its algorithm uses links between sites to determine their order in search results  Facebook seeks to replace this open system of links between pages with the social links or Likes that it controls Google and other search engines wont have full access to all these Likes so the company best positioned to rank the Web will be Facebook No wonder the open Web advocates are sounding the alarm concerned that a single company will stockpile all of our personal information and preferences  Already there are calls to create an OpenLike standard thats accessible to all reports Facebook watcher Nick ONeill  Facebook optimization  Can the measurement of an industry affect the output of that industry If an Academy Award is the ultimate measure of a movie do directors set out to create great films or Oscarwinning ones  Appearing on the first page of Google results for your chosen search term is perhaps the online equivalent of an Oscar win  As Google rose to become the barometer of all thats worthy on the Web publishers rushed to change their sites to appease the Google god Search Engine Optimization became a massive industry a multitude of SEO consultants sprung up offering to tweak your Web site to better fit Googles measure of the Web  What if Facebook Likes take off Or to use the proper jargon What if the Open Graph becomes the measure of the Web Will publishers change their sites to appease our new overlord  Im already seeing it Thousands of sites are adding Facebooks version of semantic data in preference to the open standards as Facebook becomes the new kingmaker In the week since launch more than  Web sites have added Facebooks social plugins All of which will make it blissfully easy for Facebook to organize the Web  Facebook Optimization may be the new SEO  Open Web advocates have reason to be concerned Privacy experts are also raising red flags No doubt theyll find an ally in Google Without access to the stitches that bind Web pages together the search engine could falter

A Facebook spokesman pointed out that many middle schoolage children are formally barred from the site We prohibit children under the age of  from using Facebook both for safety reasons and to comply with the Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act the spokesman said In his email Orsini also warned parents that the casual cruelty of an unsupervised yearold online is a more realistic threat to their children than the oftraised specter of sexual predators The threat to your son or daughter from online adult predators is insignificant compared to the damage that children at this age constantly and repeatedly do to one another through social networking sites he wrote In recent years Facebook MySpace and other socialnetworking sites have been blamed for the suicides of teenage girls in Missouri Massachusetts and New York Parents complained the girls were traumatized by nasty comments posted on the sites Inez Bunza the parent of a student at the Ridgewood New Jersey school said she agreed with the principals point but her daughter was completely up in arms when she broached the possibility of shutting down her Facebook account Wednesday She said she remains hopeful they can hammer out an amicable solution Orsini says that on the whole parental response to his email has been overwhelmingly positive and that parents as far away as Israel and Korea have emailed him to say thank you for saying something Fans of Orsinis zerotolerance philosophy toward student socialnetworking can also friend him on Facebook of which he is a member

 Sharing vs your privacy on FacebookBy  Doug Gross CNN      Facebook users can hide their info from applications but some fear not enough people know that STORY HIGHLIGHTSFacebook developers can get some users info without permission if friend authorizes itSite keeps tabs on developers and ban any who search for more info than they needSome critics say Facebook doesnt do enough to help users with privacy settingsDeveloper says he keeps minimal details on users doesnt see need for more CNN  Facebook is by its nature a social experience But as the undisputed king of social networking expands ways for its users to interact its raising more questions about how much of their information is made available to people they dont know  In some cases users may not even realize its happening One example is the hundreds of thousands of developers approved by Facebook to create games quizzes and other applications Some of those developers are able to access basic information about users after a Facebook friend has started using their application Facebook provides pages of instructions on how people can tighten up their privacy settings to hide their personal information from other users and outside applications  But some observers say that too many of the sites estimated  million users dont know how to do so Microsoft researcher and socialmedia analyst Danah Boyd speaking at last months South by Southwest Interactive festival said none of the nontechy users she talked to about their privacy settings knew how they were configured I ask them what they think their settings are and then ask them to look at their settings with me I have yet to find someone whose belief matched up with their reality said Boyd a keynote speaker at the Austin Texas festival That is not good news In January Facebook announced that  percent of its users had tweaked their privacy settings after a December change that made more information public

To be sure that represents millions of users But Boyd said that cant possibly be all the people who want at least some of the privacy features that Facebooks new default settings changed Are there Facebook users who want their content to be publicly accessible Of course she said But  percent of all Facebook users No way For Facebook its a balancing act The site wants to give users the privacy theyve come to expect but at the same time make information available to create experiences that will compete with other emerging applications such as Foursquare and Twitter Twitter as well as photo sharing sites such as Picasa default to open access making them more accessible by outside applications and search engines Facebooks material that is public can also be searched  for example by Googles new social search feature  while private material cannot The experience that were trying to provide through the Facebook platform is fundamentally a social one said Simon Axten a manager on Facebooks public policy team There are some really interesting and useful applications that have come out of that development that really allow people to have a social experience that involves the people that they are friends with Axten said the rules of the road for developers are pretty strict Basically developers are instructed to collect only the data they need for their application Anything else could land them in trouble he said For example an application that lets users send friends an electronic greeting card might need to know their birthday or anniversary Games that require players to work together must know which other friends play the game so it can send them alerts when they need to act Axten said Facebook can take a spectrum of actions when it discovers inappropriate use of peoples information  from warning developers who may not realize theyre misusing the data to disabling a developers access to the site No application can access a users most sensitive data such as contact information according to Facebook And the site announced late last year that theyre working on a new approval process that will require an application to more specifically state what information it wants to access Mike Rasmussen is president of Republic of Fun a game company with a crowdsourcing app on Facebook that lets users give feedback and advice on current games and in the near future to suggest new ones He said Facebooks list of rules for developers is a strict one Developers if they were creative could certainly abuse it he said But with Facebook its almost not worth it They make it so easy to get what you really need unless youre being malicious Rasmussen said his application stores a single identifier for users and does not even keep their names He said hes only heard second or thirdhand about developers getting into trouble for pushing the boundaries Evan Brown a Chicago technology and intellectualproperty attorney said hes not familiar with any legal cases involving private information gathered by a Facebook developer He said Facebooks rules governing outside developers are designed so the site may legally expel a developer easily They have the sole discretion to determine what the crime is and they have the sole discretion to determine the punishment said Brown who blogs about Internet legal issues Facebooks Axten said a team monitors complaints  which users can file simply by clicking a link thats on every Facebook application The team also regularly monitors popular and fastgrowing applications and conducts random checks he said And of course there are personal settings A user can click the Account tab at the top right of their Facebook home page then scroll down to Application Settings and Privacy Settings to make changes Increasing awareness about that ability is what Facebook and other socialnetworking sites need to work harder on Boyd said While you want your services to go viral help users walk through the value proposition first she said Not through a video but through an experience

 CNN  Before the explosion of social media Ken Altshuler a divorce lawyer in Maine dug up dirt on his clients spouses the oldfashioned way with private investigators and subpoenas Now the first place his team checks for evidence is Facebook Consider a recent story of a female client in her s who came to Altshuler seeking a divorce from husband She claimed her husband an alcoholic was drinking again The husband denied it It was her word against his word Altshuler says until a mutual friend of the couple stumbled across Facebook photos of the husband drinking beer at a party a few weeks earlier It was the kind of gotcha moment Altshuler knew would undermine the husbands credibility in court His firm presented the photos to the judge and the wife won the case in April he said Facebook is a great source of evidence Altshuler said Its absolutely solid evidence because hes the author of it How do you deny that you put that on Social media stalking skills have become invaluable to the legal world for divorce cases in particular Online photo albums profile pages wall comments status updates and tweets have become gold mines for evidence and leads Today divorce and family law firms routinely cull information posted on social media sites  the flirty exchanges with a paramour unsavory selfrevelations and compromising photographs  to buttress their case Posting hugging and kissing photos online can show a happily married relationship or it can expose a secretive affair At least  percent of attorneys surveyed by the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers cited a growth in the number of cases that used social media over the last five years The study was released earlier this year Divorce attorneys say social media sites have opened windows for infidelity because its become easier to rekindle romance with an old flame or flirt with a stranger And the posted shared and tagged evidence of infidelity is precisely the type of evidence attorneys look for online  You need to familiarize yourself with privacy settings to ensure there is no way personal information can be accessed said Adam Ostrow editor in chief of Mashablecom a social media guide  Facebook  where attorneys find most of the evidence and leads  has gradually relaxed privacy settings over the last year Attorneys say that enabled some members  personal details to be leaked without the user realizing it attorneys say On May th Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged the problem and in a blog announced new tools making it easier for users to tighten privacy settings and block outside parties from seeing personal information Its becoming all but impossible to protect your information unless you spend hours and hours figuring it out said Lee Rosen a divorce attorney in North Carolina who added he reaped the benefits of the tricky privacy controls in a recent case  Rosen was investigating a North Carolina husband in his s accused of cheating on his wife The husband failed to set privacy controls on his Facebook wall an area where users can post information Rosen noticed a suspicious message from the husbands younger female coworker The post was the hunch he needed to steer him in right direction Rosen reports about a quarter of his divorce cases use information found on social media sites 
Its becoming all but impossible to protect your information unless you spend hours and hours figuring it outLee Rosen North Carolina divorce attorney

Finding the Facebook profiles is so simple that Rosen says anyone could do it He goes to a site called Flowtowncom a site intended for marketers but is useful for attorneys too Type an email address and the site generates various social media profiles If that fails Rosen hires a private investigator At National Digital Forensics Inc a North Carolina company that mines digital sites for information requests for social media searches from divorce lawyers have surged says president and senior digital investigator Giovanni Masucci The social media detective work requires different snooping skills he says For example someone may be cheating but they are married Masucci explained If their status on the web page says single thats a major red flag Masucci estimated about half the social media cases they investigate expose some kind of cheating The happy reality for divorce attorneys is that most clients are bound to be on Facebook or another social media site Facebook is more popular than ever drawing in  million users the company reports on its website Each user creates an average of  pieces of content monthly and has an average of  friends  The most common way to gather information on Facebook relies on the battling couples mutual online friends who still have access to the spouses profile Many times the spouse will defriend a partner but forget about their shared friends who can play detective and access information on their profile  Another way of exposing damaging information is searching the profiles of the suspected other man or other woman says says Marlene Eskind Moses a divorce attorney in Tennessee Its amazing how people tell their life stories said Moses who represented a Tennessee woman who believed her husband was cheating on her After the wife found herself blocked from her husbands Facebook page she found the profile page of the other woman whom she suspected in the affair On that womans profile page a public album of photos taken on a romantic getaway appeared Scenic shots of South Carolinas mountains Her husband and another woman embracing in front of an art gallery Portraits of the couple with their faces nuzzled close together Elizabeth K Englander professor of psychology at Bridgewater State College in Massachusetts says people divulge information on social media because they believe no one will ever see the information they post The sense online is sort of like the mob effect Englander said You feel like youre one in a million and so who will ever notice you But when someone does notice thats when some divorce attorneys pounce Information copied from social media sites can sway the outcome of alimony payment disputes and custody fights attorneys say Some parents have even lost a child because of the behavior they exhibited online the lawyers say The ultimate goal after all is to catch a spouse in a lie Sometimes its a wife claiming she cant afford child support payments but subsequently purchased expensive jewelry and posted photos of the items on Facebook Or if a husband who claims he doesnt have anger problems while his social media profile is loaded with expletives Once there is evidence of a person caught in an obvious lie attorneys say it undermines the rest of their credibility with the judge Attorneys advise users of Facebook and other social media who are headed toward a divorce or custody battle to edit their profiles be cautious about updating statuses and double check to see who is really a friend Or to make things easier  at least until the trial is over or a settlement is reached  just get off Facebook completely

Editors note Pete Cashmore is founder and CEO of Mashable a popular blog about social media He writes a weekly column about social networking and tech for CNNcom   CNN  Google is working on a social service to rival Facebook if Web rumors are to be believed  And while Googles socialnetworking efforts have so far fallen flat even satisfied Facebook users should hope that the search engines efforts bear fruit First to the rumor A nowdeleted Tweet last weekend from entrepreneur Kevin Rose claimed that Google is working on a Facebook competitor called Google Me That claim gained credence as former Facebook CTO Adam DAngelo weighed in Posting a response on the questionandanswer service Quora DAngelo wrote This is not a rumor This is a real project There are a large number of people working on it I am completely confident about this  Google he added is threatened by Facebooks rise to prominence and feels the need to build a social network of its own  The Facebook threat The search giant has legitimate cause for concern As I wrote in this column two months ago Facebook is gathering masses of data through its recently launched Likes feature which lets Web visitors express interest in a piece of content  More than  websites implemented this Like button in the week after it launched providing Facebook with a treasure trove of data about the preferences of Web users This data could form the basis of a powerful search engine ranking Web pages by Likes rather than the links that Google relies upon  Whats more Facebook could serve up different search results to each user based on the preferences of his or her friends It gets worse for Google Facebooks mountain of personal data could also provide the backbone of an ad network many times more targeted than Googles keywordbased advertising If Facebook were to launch both a search engine and ad network it could put a significant dent in Googles more than  billion in annual revenue  But Google shouldnt be the only party concerned about Facebooks rapid ascent  the lack of a Facebook alternative is a threat to consumer choice providing no escape route when things turn sour  No real alternative Facebooks privacy issues over recent months have opened our eyes to a grim reality There is no real alternative While dissatisfied MySpace users hopped over to Facebook there is no truly competitive social network to which disgruntled Facebook users can elope  The demand for a legitimate alternative is so great that a project called Diaspora was able to raise more than  from Web users to develop its privacy aware personally controlled doitall open source social network  Until such a rival emerges Facebook has little incentive to maintain user trust  the only option available to unhappy Facebookers is to delete their accounts and lose contact with their friends  Googles social stumbles  Alas Google has a dismal track record when it comes to social networks Orkut an early socialnetworking effort has seen success in Brazil but in the US its virtually unheard of Google Friend Connect a possible rival to the recently renamed Facebook Connect went nowhere  Open Social a challenge to Facebook Apps has been forgotten And Google Buzz a recent attempt to add Twitterlike status updates to Gmail flopped  and generated a regrettable privacy backlash for the company  Google the narrative goes is exquisitely talented at solving problems with algorithms But when it comes to the touchyfeely stuff  like human interaction  it falls flat  Getting behind Google So while its definitely a long shot its time to rally behind Google If the search giant is able to pull off a halfdecent Facebook rival the fastgrowing social network will finally have a competitor to keep its power in check  That would be a win not just for Google but for the Web as a whole  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Pete Cashmore

 Mashable  Facebook has begun testing face detection technology for Facebook Photos This is the first of what seems like a series of new features for its popular photo product The tests which some users will see starting today Friday focus on decreasing the tediousness of tagging friends in Facebook photos In the current Photos feature users upload photos click on each face in a photo tag that photo with the friend pictured therein and continue the process until the album is tagged If youve got a large album or a lot of friends in a single photo this process is inefficient and tedious To solve this problem Facebook has implemented face detection technology that will automatically find faces in photos and select them eliminating one of the most tedious steps in tagging Facebook friends in photos Your friends are already selected by the software  all you have to do is answer the Facebook prompt Whose face is this The technology is the same as the facial detection technology most digital cameras use today While the tech itself may not be all that new it is a clever and very welcomed addition to the Facebook Photos feature set The company also promises that face detection is merely the first of many improvements that theyre trying out Its also interesting that the post was written by Sam Odio one of the cofounders of Divvyshot which Facebook acquired back in April in order to improve the Photos product What other improvements and features do you want to see implemented in Facebook Photos Do you think facial recognition  that is Facebook automatically knowing whose face is whose  could be on the horizon The company has a suggestion form for letting them know but we also encourage you to share your ideas in our comments section below  MASHABLEcom All rights reserved

 By the numbers Do we have Facebook fatigue 

By  Ryan Singel  Filed under Social Media     Privacy controversies might have slowed Facebook growth or maybe everyone who wants a page has one STORY HIGHLIGHTS Report says Facebook added  users in June down from massive  million in May  Possible privacy controversies hurt growth but could be an aberration  Also possible all internet users who want a Facebook page already have one  If the site has peaked Facebook may need to look for alternate funding sources

 Wired  Have we reached the Facebook saturation point Thats one possibility suggested by monthly growth data from Inside Facebook which reports that Facebook gained only  new US users in June after a blockbuster gain in May of more than  million  Moreover the nets dominant social networking site lost active users in the   and  demographic ranges while gaining users in their midteens and middle years One possibility is that the May and June controversies over Facebooks privacy policies and dominance have kept the company from tremendous new growth and even led some to curtail their use  Another possibility is that its just a statistical aberration or a result of changes to the advertising system where Inside Facebook says it gleans its numbers But theres also the possibility that almost every American who has any interest in joining Facebook already has Facebook says it has about  million active US accounts and is likely closing on half a billion accounts worldwide According to Inside Facebook some  percent of Americans have Facebook accounts a rate surpassed only by the UK and Canada which clock in at  percent and  percent respectively What would peakFacebook mean for the company  Certainly not irrelevance since Facebook is now the second most visited site in the world after Google and is the largest photo sharing site on the net However its yet to prove that it can create a moneymaking machine like Google found in tiny search advertising tied to what users search for not who they are Facebooks ads by contrast are all about knowing what you are interested in according to the data you tell it  Advertisers have powerful ways to target ads at users One techie even created an ad specifically for his wife by targeting his ad at very select criteria  geography degree gender and interest As a private company Facebooks revenues are not publicly disclosed but the company has confirmed that they are close to  billion Thats a pittance compared to Googles  billion in annual revenue Investors including Microsoft have invested in the company with a valuation of  billion But if Facebook has hit its peak in terms of US users the company will have to turn its attention to finding ways to make money off the site not just add more users  Its increasingly weaving itself into the fabric of the web and it now seems odder to see a news story without a Facebook Like button than with one even though that feature has only been around a few months The other problem with the possibility of hitting peakFacebook Theres only one way to go from there and thats down Users are finicky and Facebook could find itself caught in a battle of just trying to retain users who might jump ship to Googles rumored new network or even just decide they are tired of maintaining a social networking profile Facebook did not immediate respond to an email seeking commentSubscribe to WIRED magazine for less than  an issue and get a FREE GIFT Click here

 Mashablecom  Microsoft is announcing today that it has integrated Facebook and Windows Live Messenger into Outlook bringing the streams of millions of Facebook users into inboxes across the world Last year Microsoft launched Outlook Social Connector a plugin that syncs social networking feeds with your Outlook contacts giving you immediate data on what they are doing and thinking It started last year with LinkedIn integration but soon the company announced MySpace and Facebook were coming Today Outlook completes the cycle with not only Facebook integration but support for Windows Live Messenger as well Not only that but the company is releasing the plugin for Outlook  and  users as well bringing Facebook MySpace LinkedIn and Windows Live Messenger to millions of business and personal inboxes worldwide Last week we got a sneak peek at the new Outlook at Microsofts headquarters in Redmond Washington Heres what you can expect from the new Facebook integration as well some features that you can expect in the near future Facebook  Outlook  Realtime Contact Data Facebook and Microsoft worked together to get the launch of Facebooks integration in Outlook Social Connector right Facebooks Strategic Partner Manager Rick Armbrust told us that they worked closely with the Office team to make the experience more social One of the things he immediately highlighted was the pulling of Facebook profile pictures into Outlook The entire experience is a step above the OutlookLinkedIn integration which itself was pretty strong Not only does it pull Facebook profile photos so that you can associate a name to a face but it pulls the news feeds of your contacts into your inbox When youre looking at someones email youll also get a glance at their status updates picture uploads and wall posts among other activities When you combine that with LinkedIn MySpace Windows Live Messenger and Outlook data you get a very detailed history of your interaction with your contacts as well as an ataglance look at their activities and interests Knowing that a potential client just returned from a trip to Hawaii can be all that you need to have the upper hand against your competition Microsoft Group Product Manager Paco Contreras told us that theres another new feature to the Facebook integration realtime updates Thanks to a new update to the social connector platform also being released today updates from your contacts will automatically be pushed to your inbox Theres no need to refresh anything new Facebook status updates will pop up in realtime within Outlook The Facebook integration does have limitations though except for friend requests Outlook can only pull data from Facebook There is no liking posts or updating your status via Outlook at least right now Microsoft says that the next step is to provide a richer social experience by integrating the ability to push data to other social networks improving the look and feel of Outlook Social Connector and adding other social networks from other regions The Social Inbox Microsoft has known for a while that social technologies are going to dominate the web That was made evident by its  million stake in Facebook and its many partnerships and attempts at social media some of which have bombed However Outlook Social Connector has always felt like one of the companys smarter social media plays Facebooks Rich Armbrust probably put it best Whats unique is that its bringing social elements and context from Facebook form your colleagues and your friends into the Outlook experience which is pretty unique given that there are so many that use Outlook as their primary communiction tool Email isnt inherently a social experience its not a onetomany platform and attempts at integrating social into the inbox think Google Buzz have mostly fallen flat However social data can be incredibly useful in the business world especially when you need to understand what your client or colleague is thinking or doing right now While wed still love to see Twitter integration in Outlook Facebook is far larger and in most cases has far more useful information Microsofts also learned a few lessons from the privacy fiascos Facebook and Google have undergone in recent months Outlook will only pull data from emails connected to Facebook accounts If your business email isnt linked to your Facebook your data stream wont appear in Outlook Social Connector It gives users a choice although most people do choose to add their work emails to Facebook in order to join their companys Facebook network If you want to learn more about the announcement Microsoft has also released a short video articulating Outlooks new features  MASHABLEcom All rights reserved

Savage who says he has nothing against Facebook and uses it regularly to connect with childhood friends told HLNs Prime News Wednesday that the networking site is simply a tool for an affair He says that if there is trouble within a marriage or a relationship the affairs going to happen anyway but Facebook makes it much easier Andrew Noyes a spokesman for Facebook says the website is not responsible for breaking up marriages Its ludicrous to suggest that Facebook leads to divorce and we would suggest that anyone who purports to have conducted surveys about the topic also ask respondents about other popular communication channels such as text messaging chat sites and email before jumping to conclusions Noyes said Stacey Kaiser a psychotherapist and relationship expert says she estimates Facebook plays a much larger factor in divorces Its not just your everyday affair Kaiser told Prime News When it comes to something like Facebook you are reconnecting with a longlost love All those teenage feelings those college feelings come back again you feel young again and it drives you to do something you dont normally do Savage who is separated and living apart from his wife says communication with your spouse is key to keeping your Facebook page as a place to network not coordinate illicit rendezvous In the beginning when we first got on Facebook we would openly talk about shared friends new babies and other milestones posted on the site Savage told HLN When it got real quiet that was the problem he said Brenda Wade a clinical therapist whose selfproclaimed mission is to cut the divorce rate by half says the mistake most couples make is placing priorities on material things rather than partnership We need to put that energy that time that money into the relationship she told Prime News Thats where you want to feel the excitement and the rush

 Wired  Facebook is primed to announce this week that its amassed a half billion active friends a milestone reinforcing its status as the king of social networks  a company to be regarded with the seriousness and power if not revenue of Google Apple Yahoo and Microsoft Five hundred million and rising also makes it clear to anyone not paying attention that Facebook is no fad that it is a cultural force shaping our collective culture Even if you have no desire to ever set up a profile you cant ignore it and you are now oddly defined in the negative and left out of the zeitgeist A service of that size wont disappear anytime soon even if Facebook has hit its plateau in the US But net users are fickle and the webs short history includes dozens of sites that were once highflying that have either since died Geocities lost their luster Yahoo or faded into irrelevance Friendster So how could Facebook lose its place at the center of the web   Open distributed alternatives A pack of college kids drunk on Free Software launched an opensource federated alternative to Facebook called Diaspora After collecting an astonishing K in donations the group is knocking out code  Meanwhile theres other cool stuff going on including OneSocialWeb the Appleseed Project and WebFinger Get enough of these open protcols into decent shape and someone is likely to build them into an improbably powerful stack Research the LAMP stack if you dont get my drift What might that look like An elimination of the need for a centralized home and coordinator of social networking  where your social profile lives wherever you want it to as your email does and can interact with any other profile around the net on your own terms While it sounds farfetched a recent poll suggests that people are as happy with Facebook as they are with their cable company even if they do find it similarly indispensable   Google Me Theres rumors the search giant is hatching its own social network system despite the fact that its just not particularly good at social networking Its Orkut social network has flailed and even seems to be losing its final two treasures India and Brazil to Facebook Googles take on Twitter called Buzz isnt bad but its not been much of a hit  despite some fine features such as threaded coversations And then its got Wave and Google Talk and Google Chat and Google Profile and Google pages and Google Docs  I wonder if anyone has tried stacking any of those together over there in the Googleplex to create a place where people actually want to hang out  the clear difference between a site like Facebook and a site like Google search Interesting things happen when people hang out   Locationbased services and the mobile device With the stunning popularity of pocket computers  starting with the iPhone locationcentric services such as Foursquare are gaining users at the rate that Facebook used to Perhaps most importantly they are figuring out ways to use the addictive mechanics of gaming to create services even more engrossing than Facebook To compete Facebook has its own very wellliked mobile app and is set to expand how it interacts with the real world But theres a real threat here that Facebook could get outflanked by clever kids not too much unlike themselves who figure out how to create a more potent digital heroin   The US Postal Service For those who love dark horses or the old and familiar theres always a chance that the world suddenly tires of their Facebook wall or virtual farming and decide to get off the nets grid entirely Socializing will still be necessary of course so well see the return of sockhops neighborhood restaurants and church socials As for written messages the Postal Service is actually quite good at delivering handwritten correspondence anywhere in the States for a nominal fee The photo postcard will be huge again But since the Postal Service is proposing to cease Saturday delivery its social networking service would be a weekdayonly affair Vive la Poste   Overreaching on the part of Mark Zuckerberg Facebooks founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has changed the culture of the world with his singleminded devotedness to making people share more information with more people In a world where software can determine culture Zuckerbergs unwavering drive to make more and more of the details of our lives public by default has triumphed in nearly every instance over prevailing cultural norms  with the glaring exception of the Beacon project But as with all visionaries there is always the danger that in his attempt to lead his flock to the land of milk and honey there will come a moment where he steps too far ahead and the flock abandons the frontier for the pasture leaving him alone and howling in the wildernessSubscribe to WIRED magazine for less than  an issue and get a FREE GIFT Click here

 Who in the world isnt on FacebookBy  Doug Gross CNN  Filed under Social Media   A halfbillion users later Facebooks growth looks to come from countries outside the United States STORY HIGHLIGHTS With grandmas aboard who in the world hasnt already signed up for Facebook  Facebook announced this week that it has hit  million users  While US market may be saturated plenty of people overseas arent on the site  Only about  percent of computer users in Asia are on Facebook  percent in Africa CNN  Seriously  at this point whos not on Facebook Grandmas are commenting on their teen grandkids angstridden status updates One of your gradeschool teachers wants you to join their mafia Candidates for the Planning and Zoning Commission have fan pages So does actor Will Arnetts voice Not Will Arnett Just his voice On Wednesday Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the site hit a halfbillion active users Thats nearly five times as many people as watched this years Super Bowl  the most popular television broadcast ever  and about four times as many people as voted in the  US presidential election People spend more than  billion minutes per month on the site and according to Facebook  million of them have logged in during the past month Keep in mind there are only  million people in the United States  total So seriously  whos left In the United States the answer comes pretty close to this nobody who a would like to have an account and b is able to create one In certain countries particularly the United States and Western Europe Facebook has actually reached a point where it appears theyve saturated the market said Justin Smith founder of Inside Facebook which offers news and market research on the social networking giant Sure there are the people who just dont use computers And everyone knows that one guy who cant wait for Facebook to come up in conversation just so he can loudly and proudly announce hes not a part of the network There also were a handful of users who bolted in recent months over privacy concerns But in the United States it seems like thats about it Its people who are not computer users  either really young or really old and for whom using technology just isnt a part of their daily lives Smith said For people who do rely on technology Facebook has just really become a common way to function and get a lot of normal things done But while it might seem to US users like everybody is on Facebook most of the worlds internet users actually arent According to the International Telecommunication Union there are about  billion people in the world with internet access Since everyone on Facebook has to use the internet that means Facebook can count about  percent of the digitally enabled population as its users So the majority of Web users   percent  still arent on the site In densely populated India and the teeming cities of Brazil local social networking sites have won the loyalties of internet users But Facebook has them in its sights 
In certain countries  Facebook has actually reached a point where it appears theyve saturated the marketJustin Smith founder of Inside Facebook

Facebook says it has  million users in India up from just  million earlier this year And in statistics updated on Wednesday Facebook listed  million users in Brazil the first time it had offered statistics for that country Googleowned Orkut has been the top social site in Brazil And Brazil has the worlds secondhighest reach by social networking with  percent of internet users visiting the sites according to web stats firm comScore The number of active computer users on Facebook in Asia is just a little over  percent and its just about  percent in Africa two places Facebook is targeting And in those areas theres a familiarlooking pattern that might mean the Facebook boom could be on the way Students are becoming the early adopters followed by young adults  presumably opening up the possibilities that older and younger folks could be on the way Those growth patterns really are mirroring what happened in the US Smith said To analysts that means a halfbillion users might not even be close to Facebooks potential Is one billion users possible With revenue approaching  billion and extensive efforts underway in mobile that can help Facebook extend its reach in the developing world it certainly cant be ruled out wrote Adam Ostrow editorinchief of social media blog Mashable which is a CNN content partner So if youre a Facebook user in Cairo Seoul or Rio get ready Grandma just might be on her way

 Mashable  In an interview that will air tonight on ABCs World News with Diane Sawyer Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg talked frankly about an upcoming IPO the Facebook movie a shady lawsuit and much more As far as the movie The Social Network is concerned Zuckerberg seemed to echo Facebook cofounder Dustin Moscovitzs opinion that the film seems a lot more exciting than the reallife version of Facebooks history I just think people have a lot of fiction The real story of Facebook is just that weve worked so hard for all this time Zuckerberg said in his interview with Sawyer I mean the real story is actually probably pretty boring right We just sat at our computers for six years and coded Somewhere in that six years of coding however it is alleged that Zuckerberg signed a contract that would give ownership of his website to a web designer and former associate at Harvard one Paul Ceglia Although a Facebook lawyer said yesterday the company is unsure whether such a contract was ever signed Zuckerberg told Sawyer unequivocally We did not sign a contract that says that Ceglia has any right to ownership over Facebook As far as an initial public offering of stock is concerned Facebooks IPO is one of the most hotly anticipated by many in the tech world The company is currently valued at upwards of  billion and is expected to generate around  billion in revenue in   Zuckerberg told Sawyer that while he and the rest of the Facebook team are still rather singlemindedly focused on product At some point along the path I think itll make sense to have an IPO But were not running the company to do that Were running the company to serve more people Of course Sawyers interview also touches on the privacy debacle We have made mistakes for sure said Zuckerberg and the sites crossing the millionuser mark Zuckerberg said the journey had been surreal as well as several other topics Check your local listings to find out when the program will air in your area and in the meantime check out these two teaser clips from ABC  MASHABLEcom All rights reserved

Editors note Pete Cashmore is founder and CEO of Mashable a popular blog about social media He is writing a weekly column about social networking and tech for CNNcom  CNN  Facebook began rolling out an ambitious new product this week A question and answer service  Facebook Questions hopes to deliver relevant answers to your queries served up by friends and other members of the Facebook community But such QA services have a mixed record Some provide invaluable answers from topic experts while others simply spread misinformation Which camp does Facebook Questions fall into The quality question The poorest performing QA sites typically have a broad audience consisting of few experts Yahoo Answers which has built massive traffic from search engine queries is regularly cited for its inane questions and uninsightful answers At the time of writing the most popular question on Yahoo Answers is How to disguise weed smoke The toprated answer meanwhile is how bout not smoking weed This open model  in which users weigh in regardless of topicbased expertise  works well for Yahoo and its ilk since their primary interest is in building traffic to sell ads against For any question you type into Google the chances are that someone already asked it on Yahoo Answers  that page will show up in your search results creating traffic and ad revenue for Yahoo when you click But for those seeking genuine insight Yahoos offering falls flat Relevance and expertise A new breed of QA services uses online profiles to deliver expertdriven answers Aardvark now part of Google asks the user to log in using his or her Facebook account before directing the question to the most qualified people in that persons social network Unsurprisingly the answers received are of far higher quality than on Yahoo Answers Another QA service receiving critical acclaim is Quora founded by former Facebook CTO Adam DAngelo Quora also increases relevancy through the use of socialnetworking profiles Log in with your Facebook account and the site will suggest topics for you to Follow based on your expertise This system increases the odds of receiving answers from experts Is it a coincidence that two of the best new QA sites leverage information gleaned from Facebook to deliver more relevant answers If thirdparty sites can match questions to topic experts using socialnetworking profiles surely Facebook can do an even better job A good start Facebook Questions does bear many similarities to Quora and Aardvark  a very positive sign For instance you can tag your question with a topic and Facebook will direct the question to those users who list that topic in their interests  And of course Facebook understands that we tend to share a lot in common with our friends and friends of friends  so questions are targeted to your network to increase the chances of a useful answer But Facebooks new service could still go the way of Yahoo Answers While in testing mode Questions benefits from the fact that there is currently no public database of questions and the product is not being indexed by search engines  should Facebook open up the product in this way the quality of answers could fall Privacy issues remain While the product is still embryonic Facebook Questions looks to be a wellcrafted product that could deliver highly relevant answers to your questions But that doesnt mean it will be without its critics Every question asked with the tool is public  a fact that could raise the ire of privacy advocates Others might see Facebook Questions as yet another distraction  something to be blocked out along with fun quizzes and incessant FarmVille updates from friends The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Pete Cashmore

 Mashablecom  Facebook has begun the rollout of a new feature Facebook Questions which will allow users to get answers to their queries from the entire Facebook community Similar in concept to Yahoo Answers Quora and Mahalo Facebook Questions gives users the opportunity to ask questions just by clicking the Ask Question button on the homepage Questions is also available on friends profiles just as you would post on someones wall We first learned of Facebooks QA feature two months ago when the company started asking for volunteers to beta test the product The worlds largest social network even went so far as to promise beta testers a trip to Facebooks offices to meet with the QA team I had the chance earlier today to discuss the new feature with several Facebook employees Questions has several defining features  Photo questions For example if you take a picture of a bird but dont know what species it is you can post the picture on Facebook Questions and get your answer   Polling If youre simply looking for the answer to Which city is better Chicago or Dallas you can get your answer by creating a poll   Tagging The company seems to be placing a lot of emphasis on tagging questions based on category or topic The goal seems to be to make QA discovery an easier and faster process by making it simple to look up questions on cooking photography San Francisco or a variety of other topics   Topic exploration Facebook described this as a roulettetype feature that allows users to browse Facebooks eventual mountain of QA Under the Questions about dropdown menu theres a feature called Everything that allows users to browse the companys catalog of questions   Following You can follow specific questions for updates and new answers  Updated homepage Facebook Questions does actually change the homepage adding a new bar at the top of the page where you can choose to update your status ask a question add photos or post a link There was one more thing that Facebook made clear to me Facebook Questions is not an advertising product While brands with Facebook Pages will eventually be able to answer questions its not meant to be a promotional platform its meant to be a useful and insightful product for users Facebook Questions will roll out to a limited group of beta testers today but the company promises to bring this product to all of you as quickly as we can The entire feature is public so we dont suggest posting those awkward bedroom questions on Facebook Will Facebook Questions prove to be more useful than Quora or even Twitter as a QA platform We think so if only because it has the biggest advantage of them all  million users  MASHABLEcom All rights reserved

Kreisberg says that in addition to describing her supervisor in unflattering and sometimes vulgar terms on her Facebook page Souza also wrote about how the company allows a  to be a supervisor The  reference is the companys jargon for a psychiatric patient Kreisberg says The National Labor Act gives workers the right to form unions and it prohibits employers from taking action against employees  union or nonunion  for discussing working conditions says Kreisberg He adds that the case could be groundbreaking because it is in the uncharted legal territory of social networking sites on the internet It was Souzas  own page she did this on her own time in her own home This case is different because in this situation it happened online and the companys rules were unlawfully broad says Kreisberg In a statement to CNN American Medical Response says it believes that the offensive statements made against the coworker were not activities protected under federal law The company denies the allegations made by the NLRB and believes the facts will show that they are without merit The employee in question was discharged based on multiple serious complaints about her behavior the statement says An attorney representing the ambulance company adds This is not about Facebook This employee was terminated after the company received complaints on two separate incidents in  All pointed to Souzas rude and discourteous behavior with patients says attorney Jackson Lewis Souza who was fired last December and who is seeking reinstatement to her job declined comment to CNN saying only that granting an interview would jeopardize her case at this point On the issue of assistance from a union representative the labor board says Souza wanted help from the union representing the companys workers when she wrote up a response to the company The companys lawyer says she was not denied union representation Before submitting her response she checked in with her union representative says Lewis A labor board hearing for the case is scheduled for January

 Could Facebook replace your email inbox By  Pete Cashmore Special to CNN  Filed under Social Media     Facebook may want to compete with your current email provider Pete Cashmore says STORY HIGHLIGHTS Facebook may be overhauling its Messages feature next week  Pete Cashmore Facebook wants to become the hub of online communication   But for more serious correspondence Facebook unlikely to be medium of choice

Editors Note Pete Cashmore is founder and CEO of Mashable a popular blog about social media He writes a weekly column about social networking and tech for CNNcom   CNN  Facebook is inviting the press to a special event Monday leading some to speculate that the company is set to overhaul its Messages product The basis for the speculation The invite prominently displays Facebooks inbox logo With some additional features Facebook may even compete with your current email provider the theory goes Facebook hasnt confirmed the speculation of course and there are alternative explanations for what the social networking site may unveil One possibility Facebook could bring its chat product to mobile devices  But lets imagine that Facebooks longrumored overhaul of its Messages product does transpire either at this event or in the future Could it pose a threat to existing email providers Will Facebook users begin to use Facebook Messages more and their existing email accounts less While Im usually bullish on Facebooks ability to make any new product stick  with  million users even a minuscule adoption rate means millions of users  Im not sure the company would be able to dominate email completely In one context  personal communications  Facebook could certainly make inroads The service is already the leading venue to connect with friends online and providing standard email features such as POP IMAP attachments forwarding and an facebookcom email address would possibly lead some users to retire their accounts on Yahoo Windows Live Hotmail AOL or Gmail  For Facebook this would be a masterstroke Virtually all of its major competitors have popular email products Whats more by combining social networking chat and email Facebook would become the hub of online communication However theres very little chance that Facebook Messages will ever be used for professional correspondence Facebook is already banned in many corporate settings Its considered a timewaster and a potential security threat to some companies  Even for those unburdened by such restrictions its hard to imagine anyone conducting serious business through Facebook accounts For instance Would a job applicant appear more professional sending his or her resume via a Gmail address or a Facebook one Its clear that Facebook wants to become the ultimate contact list for everyone on the Web Its social graph is an attempt to map all of the connections between its users  And yet the name Facebook is still strongly associated with personal pursuits from photo sharing to playing FarmVille To shake off those associations would be an arduous task  Facebook could if it so desired become a leader in personal email between friends and family members  but for more serious correspondence its unlikely to be the medium of choice

I should only need those two things a person and a message Andrew Bosworth a software engineer at Facebook said at the companys news event Monday The system is definitely not email Weve actually modeled it more after chat Incoming messages pop up on the bottom of Facebooks site similar to the chat feature We think that we should take features away from messaging Zuckerberg said We think it should be minimal But like email users can attach files Sharing documents via Microsofts Office Web Apps service will be integrated over the coming months a Microsoft spokeswoman said The inbox is broken into three folders The social inbox contains conversations with your top contacts  people you message with most often An other folder keeps correspondences of less importance or those with people or companies that Facebooks system is not familiar with such as banking notices Operators of pages youve Liked can send messages to this folder as well Finally the service filters what it thinks is spam into a last bin Facebook will launch this with a slow rollout said Bosworth turning it on for more users over time Facebooks iPhone application will support the new inbox Monday for accounts that have it enabled Bosworth said The system may incorporate more services later Zuckerberg said he considered voice as one For instant messaging it supports Jabber  the underlying technology of Google Chat  but not Skype AIM or Windows Live Messenger Support for IMAP which would allow Facebookcom email users to access their inbox from a program such as Microsofts Outlook is in development Zuckerberg said Zuckerberg opened the announcement by talking about changes in how young people communicate He reminisced about a conversation with some high school students who said they primarily talked through Facebook and text messaging on their phones Email is too slow he recalled them saying Its not that email doesnt get delivered immediately Zuckerberg said Its too formal Numerous studies as recently as April of this year have found that email is a very small part of how young people keep in touch Facebook has modeled its new system to reflect those trends Zuckerberg said  million people use its system for private correspondences transmitting  billion messages a day Zuckerberg will take the stage again Tuesday during the Web  Summit presumably to elaborate on this new system which Bosworth said has been among the companys biggest undertakings The project took about  months of work from  engineers  the largest team the company has ever devoted to a new product Bosworth said

 Facebooks Mark Zuckerberg prefers underdogsBy Mark Milian CNN  Filed under Social Media   Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg predicts great opportunity for entrepeneurs whereas larger companies could struggle STORY HIGHLIGHTSFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg favors underdogs and entrepreneursApple and Google have struggled to make apps that work well with FacebookSmall companies can freely build apps that work with Facebook San Francisco California CNN  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg favors the little guy but that attitude can pose obstacles for popular websites that want to work with his company Apple and Google which are among the biggest technology businesses in the world find themselves stonewalled at times by Zuckerberg and company That sometimes results in less functional applications Apple launched its musiccentric social network called Ping as part of an iTunes update that contained a Facebook component But Apple had to remove integration with the worlds largest social network hours after Ping launched Last week Twitter announced an agreement with Apples Ping Steve Jobs Apples CEO spurned Facebook for what he considered were onerous terms  When questioned about this in an interview onstage at the Web  Summit in San Francisco on Tuesday Zuckerberg said with a shrug Its fine

Then Zuckerberg pointed out that the two work together in many ways For example Facebooks app is on the vast majority of iPhones he said at an event earlier this month at Facebooks Palo Alto California headquarters As for Facebooks relationship with Google the two are in the midst of a public spat about letting users import and export personal data between the social network and Gmail Facebook which launched an email service on Monday doesnt let users easily migrate addresses to other apps Zuckerberg said at the conference on Tuesday that this move was meant to protect the private contact information of a users friends He backtracked near the end of that fireside chat and highlighted the data export issue as a potential mistake Ive made so many mistakes in running the company so far he said We still make mistakes all of the time The trouble he said is figuring out which of the companys myriad problems really matter Zuckerberg also seemed to distance himself from Google the undisputed leader in search last month when Facebook announced a deal with Microsofts Bing Theyre just trying to rapidly gain market share by doing awesome stuff Zuckerberg said of Microsoft at the Bing event Theyre really the underdog here But Microsoft wasnt spared from criticisms during Tuesdays event Microsoft a massive computer software company and an investor in Facebook has thousands of engineers Zuckerberg pointed out Facebook has fewer and is therefore seen by developers as a more effective and attractive employer he said Zuckerberg makes it known that he has a soft spot for budding entrepreneurs When asked about The Social Network  the film based on the founding of Facebook  Zuckerberg boasted of fan mail from people who say his story inspired them to become entrepreneurs His mission is to enable others to build social networking services which can be accomplished using Facebooks platform he said Smalltime developers can freely make use of Facebooks offerings but larger companies must work directly or be locked out Despite amassing  million people actively using the service Zuckerberg still doesnt consider Facebook a giant company In some ways I actually think were only now entering the zone where a lot of entrepreneurs will consider working with us he said But during Yahoo CEO Carol Bartzs onstage interview earlier Tuesday she described Facebook as Yahoos competition This sentiment could create even greater disconnects between Facebooks service and popular apps as is the case with Gmail and Ping Without being specific Zuckerberg derided some large internet companies saying they wont make it past a social networking revolution Some arent going to make it he said on Tuesday I think theres an exciting opportunity for some entrepreneurs Zuckerbergs advice to incumbents as he calls technology giants Get on the bus But that doesnt mean hes going to make it easy for them to board

 The theology of Facebook an online altarBy Omar L Gallaga Special to CNN  Filed under Social Media   Is Facebook with its dreamlike constellation of friends and acquaintances from our past like a digital version of the afterlife STORY HIGHLIGHTS Omar Gallaga Commingling of people from various chapters of our lives has spiritual overtones The author went on a theological search for the spirituality of Facebook connections  Pope Benedict XVI suggested earlier this year priests should embrace digital media Editors Note Omar L Gallaga is a technology contributor to NPRs All Tech Considered segment on All Things Considered He writes about technology for the Austin AmericanStatesman and for the newspapers tech blog Digital Savant  CNN  I grew up an Air Force brat who typically moved to a new place every three years I switched schools made friends then had to write letters to stay in touch when I inevitably left Except for a precious few most of those friends went away forever lost to memory fading and eventually anonymous in aging photos But in the recurring dreams I had in my teenage years they were all together My friends from Oklahoma went to school with my classmates in Biloxi Mississippi My favorite teacher from my years in Germany got to see me grow up alongside my cousins from South Texas It wasnt until many years later when Facebook shot past its first  million users that I began to get that sensation again the one most frequent users are now well familiar with Its that sense of worlds colliding of unlikely paths crossing your work life home life past life and present all mashing together commented upon and decorated with photos from here and from there from then and in the now Facebooks enormous membership makes it a more likely spot than any other place on the Englishlanguage Web to connect with a multitude of family members friends former coworkers old classmates and anyone else you havent seen in the flesh for decades It wasnt until the May series finale Lost however that I made another connection  that this idea of people coming into your life and never going away is a lot like what many people believe the afterlife is like

Could it be that Facebook the digital Tower of Babel built by a cocky Harvard student is  to paraphrase singer Belinda Carlisle  sort of like what would happen if heaven were a place on earth The thought led me to a theological search for the spirituality of Facebook connections Amid the recent flood of political rants childrens Halloween photos and YouTube videos many of us have seen status updates from friends offering Bible passages spiritual quotes or information on upcoming religious services

Along with a few alarming blog posts Facebook killed the church one bluntly proclaimed I found a lot of theologians struggling to figure out whether mobile phones social networks and textmessaging harm their religions or help reinvent them in positive ways  Theres even debate on whether being so constantly connected to so many people is good or bad spiritually speaking Bruce Epperly a theology professor author and copastor in Lancaster Pennsylvania wrote a thoughtful piece about socalled Facebook theology likening the intricate web of relationships in our lives to our online social network He acknowledged that even the lowly shortform status update can carry a profound holiness It might surprise my high school friends to discover that I often pray for them as I read their posts Epperly writes I believe that Facebook can be an altar on the Internet and a place of spiritual awakening That seems to gibe with what Pope Benedict XVI proclaimed earlier this year In January the pontiff suggested that priests should embrace new digital communication mediums But he stopped short of blessing Facebook itself as a virtual holy land Facebook which recently passed the millionuser mark grew so quickly in such a short span of time that even its creators likely havent been able to stop and examine the spiritual significance of its nearconstant presence in so many lives To what do we owe our continually growing house of friends the ones we never see never call never write to but who contribute to our digital chatter our daily chorus Dont those connections count for some kind of community Wouldnt we miss it if all these nonstrangers were lost to us again What if Facebook itself which digitally houses not only the living but also the memorial page dead is a kind of preafterlife training where all those personal connections are forever maintained even after youve shuffled off this analog coil And if the afterlife exists and its anything like Facebook does it have an Unfriend option Because as much as I love all the connectedness eternity sounds like a really long time to spend reading everyones status updates

Editors note Pete Cashmore is the founder and CEO of Mashable a popular blog about social media He writes a weekly column about social networking and tech for CNNcom   CNN  In the spring of this year the Facebook alternative Diaspora achieved extensive media coverage  including an article in the New York Times  and raised tens of thousands of dollars in funding from online donors  The pitch was an appealing one In the midst of a privacy backlash at Facebook Diaspora proposed a more private alternative to the leading social network But Diaspora is no Facebook rival and history tells us it wont make a dent in Facebooks success A focus on privacy Diaspora which began sending out invites this week attempts to outclass Facebook in privacy features and user freedom Features include granular control over who sees your information the ability to download your photos and the option to delete your account without any hassle  With  now raised for the project youd think Diaspora was off to a great start In reality its impact on Facebook will be minimal There are plenty of ways for a social network to fail the fact that your friends are already on Facebook and not Diaspora is the most obvious issue But when it comes to toppling web giants one factor is frequently overlooked The replacement is usually radically different from its predecessor In other words If Facebook is ever beaten it wont be by a site that tries to be Facebook but better Rise of the Digg clones A cautionary tale emerged this year in the form of Diggcom The oncepioneering social news site allows users to vote on stories pushing those articles to the front page This concept inspired hundreds of Digg clones few of which were able to gain traction Most notably a muchhyped relaunch of Netscapecom with Digglike voting wasnt a success This year Digg entered a decline after a series of stumbles and some users were said to defect to rival Reddit And yet the sites troubles really began much earlier with the rise of Twitter and Facebook Although radically different in their execution these two social services served much the same purpose as Digg by allowing users to share interesting links they found around the web As web users found new outlets for these behaviors Diggs relevance dwindled The real threat to Digg wasnt a clone but rather a completely different approach MySpace in decline Likewise Facebook which usurped MySpace for the social networking crown did so with a radical innovation the launch of its News Feed in  This new feature wasnt just a better MySpace but a completely different approach to social interaction that replaced static pages with streams of constantly updated information Facebook vs Google Perhaps unexpectedly Google is now feeling the heat from Facebook Although hundreds of Google killers have come and gone all of them trying to tackle Google headon it looks like Facebook might be the most credible threat so far to Googles core search business What makes Facebook a possible Google rival is the massive amount of data it possesses on your individual preferences your network of friends and the links you share All this information could the pundits predict power a search engine with better results than Google Social networks pose another threat to Googles search business too By subscribing to Twitter feeds and Facebook pages users have relevant content delivered straight to them which reduces the need to use search engines In short The most likely Google killers look nothing like Google Diaspora is no threat So if recent history is a guide Facebook need not worry about Diaspora Such incremental improvements almost never create new market leaders Instead it takes a completely different approach to unseat incumbents  If a true Facebook killer should ever emerge it probably wont resemble Facebook at all

 Mashable   Today users can start connecting with all their favorite social causes in one online sphere as Facebook cofounder Chris Hughes has launched his muchbuzzedabout social network Jumo Hughes who left Facebook in  to become the Obama campaigns director of online organizing softlaunched Jumo last March  At that time the site existed merely as a homepage featuring a rather intriguing survey box that asked the site visitor an array of questions from If you had a daughter tomorrow which would you name her to Would you say the world is getting better or worse  Upon answering these queries you could also submit your email address to get more information as it came Since the site first came on our radar we here at Mashable have waited with interest to see what Hughes would reveal  Would the site have its desired effect Bringing together those interested in social change to expedite global dogooding And more simply what would it look like Would it be easy to use A couple of months ago we got a little more insight into the project when Hughes spoke at the Mashable  Y Social Good Summit in New York City about the inspiration behind Jumo  how after the January   Haiti earthquake he saw people reaching out those in need and the incredible response of the online community He also saw that reactions like this are not enough Instead of having the doinggoodatThanksgivingtime mentality ie being galvanized by big events and holidays people need to be involved with their causes of choice yearround And thats where Jumo comes in Jumo was designed to let users find follow and support the causes important to them and with  organizations on board at launch wouldbe philanthropists should be able to find and follow something of interest upon joining For comparisons sake  Apples Ping had  artists two months out of the gate We have yet to actually get our mitts on the site but Hughes gave us a walkthrough that revealed how easytouse and intuitive the layout is  In fact its very similar to Facebook Upon signing up via Facebook Connect which lets you easily find friends on the site you can begin to shape your Jumo experience by figuring out What Youre Interested In by way of selecting Issues This is to get a sense of who someone is what theyre passionate about whats meaningful to them Hughes says Its the first way to figure out what a person might want to see more of Every Issue also has a page that you can follow allowing you to discover more organizations over time After choosing your Issues you can either drill down to find more specific Issues think education reforms schools atrisk youth etc or sort through Projects affiliated with that space and select which ones you would like to follow You can also sort through Projects by location finding those close to you if you are so inclined Once you choose your Projects and click Done youre transferred to your homepage which again is very similar to Facebooks It even has a newsfeed of sorts with updates from all the projects people and issues youre following  It also has a Talk section showing social updates from Projects and people you follow Our real mission is to make it as easy as possible for people to be able to find these organizations and then connect with them in a substantive way Hughes says  The site even features its own Like buttons which allow you to Like a news story or video posted by a Project you follow and share that story on your own profile page which is basically a feed of your activity on the site  That way you can see what your friends are interested in and check out Issues and Projects they might be involved with You can also Like organization pages via Facebook Like buttons thereby sharing that info with your Facebook friends Its all geared to answer the question What does insert name care about Hughes says In addition to joining as an individual you can also add Projects to the site  so long as they pertain to social or environmental issues  Were an open platform where anyone can create a profile or an organization page You have to be vetted by the IRS to be able to receive any money from anyone on the Jumo platform via a donation button but anyone can create a page Hughes says By joining Jumo a Project can pull all its social streams into one place  Twitter Facebook Flickr blogs etc That way followers can check out a wealth of information on a single organization all in one framework Again Project pages are a lot like Fan Pages on Facebook however the key difference here is that the focus seems to be less on the individual than on the organization  On Facebook its more about the connections you make with friends than those you do with brandsbandsetc Jumo focuses much more on creating a space where you can learn more about organizations and thereby take action At this juncture youre probably thinking So what does this site actually do Isnt this just another form of the infamous slacktivism I think that when people click a Like button of follow something on Twitter or sign up for an email list its the first statement of support for any interest Hughes says It doesnt mean that they dont then go out and do things like knock on doors and go to protests or go to rallies or go volunteer or donate They do do these things We can make it easier for people to connect with the professionals working in a lot of fields in order to make change happen There are a million different groups out there working day in day out to provide healthcare or education services or do good government work and I think that our challenge is not to use social media to reinvent the engagement paradigm but instead to support the work of the people who are out there getting the job done day in day out  MASHABLEcom All rights

 CNN  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg talks about sharing info and connecting people to each other more than Kanye West talks about himself And the sites mission statement hits those themes hard saying Facebooks goal is to give people the power to share and make the world more open and connected So it might come as a surprise to Facebook users that the site takes a doasIsaynotasIdo approach to letting people share their own information with one of its biggest competitors In whats been called data hoarding Facebook will not let users export their Facebook contacts lists  which include pictures and emails  to Googles email system  Thats not new but Facebooks antisharing policy has come under scrutiny recently since Google last week retaliated by blocking users from uploading their Gmail contacts to Facebook according to TechCrunch Facebook in turn found a workaround that let it pull in contact lists from Google anyway  a sort of technical slap in the face to Google Were disappointed that Facebook didnt invest their time in making it possible for their users to get their contacts out of Facebook a Google spokesperson wrote in an email to CNN As passionate believers that people should be able to control the data they create we will continue to allow our users to export their Google contacts  Facebook did not respond to a CNN request for comment At first read this may sound kind of silly or irrelevant  two multibilliondollar tech companies bickering with each other But these companies hold the keys to millions of peoples online identities They control whether you can download or export lists of your contacts where on the internet you can use those lists and which data companies theyll sell this information to The new lockdowns on user data could signal a change in how the Web works writes Michael Arrington from TechCrunch The big tech companies are now in a data war and it may be hard to stop this escalation now that it has started writes Arrington who sees Facebook as the aggressor in this situation Facebook just pretty much refused to let users export social graph data even though they import it like crazy from every source they can get their hands on he says The Wall Street Journal compared the situation to what happens when a yearold and a yearold get in a fight Facebook is the yearold apparently Expect neither side to let go easily Geoffrey A Fowler writes Despite this fight its still possible to share your contacts among plenty of websites which makes it easier to find friends on social networks and to synchronize the digital contacts youve accumulated from various sources Below is a list of four of the big players in the online contacts space and who shares with whom compiled from each of these sites contacts pages This should give you an idea of how trapped your data is in any one of these services Note that companies who are friends  ie Facebook and Microsoft since that company owns a stake in Facebook  tend to be fans of sharing data Rivals like Google and Facebook  not so much Who holds onto your data Google Exports contacts to Facebook Microsoft and Yahoo Facebook Exports contacts to Microsoft Yahoo not Google Microsoft Exports contacts to Google Facebook and Yahoo Yahoo Exports contacts to Google and Facebook not Microsoft

 Photo sites work to hold out against Facebook upstartsBy  Doug Gross CNN  Filed under Web   Photo site staffers say that mobile tools like Photobuckets Android app are one key to fending off competition from Facebook STORY HIGHLIGHTS With growth of Facebook Photos and upstart apps established photo sites work to stay ahead  Sites like Photobucket Flickr and Picasa say advanced features mobility are keys to their success  Facebook had more photo views in October than all three other sites combined

 CNN  Theres a photosharing website that by some measures is more popular than Flickr Picasa and Photobucket combined You might have heard of it Its called Facebook The emergence of the socialnetworking giant as a way to store and share photos has those established photo sites working to stay relevant At the same time a handful of new upstart photosharing apps are seeking to carve out their own niches In the end the established photo sites say it will be their ability to do more  particularly in the rapidly expanding world of mobile photography  that will set them apart Most photo sites offer similar tools for cataloging editing and sharing photos along with ways to display them in albums and slide shows Until recently it has been easy enough for these sites to brush off any threat Facebook may pose  The easy argument and one that still exists to some extent is that Facebook is only good for simple snapshots that dont need any editing and are designed more to document an event than render an artistic image Our users like to share they like to edit they like to create said Tom Munro who took over as CEO of Photobucket last month All of that you cant do on Facebook Most people dont want all their photos on Facebook You really cant do a whole lot with them once theyre there But Facebook which can parlay its userbase of roughly  million into relative success with most anything Webrelated is trying to chip away at that argument Last month Facebook announced it was upgrading its Photos service to include highresolution photos group tagging and a lightbox for viewing photos from anywhere on the site Some of those changes were clearly designed to compete with the specialty photo sites Numberswise Facebook dwarfs the competition According to Web analytics firm comScore Facebook Photos had nearly  million visitors in October Photobucket remains narrowly atop the photo sites with a little over  million visitors according to comScore with Flickr at  million and Picasa drawing nearly  million users Picasa was the only photo site comScore charted a yeartoyear comparison for and its traffic increased about  percent from October  In comparison Facebook Photos users more than doubled from  million a year ago Its probably safe to say however that a lot of those clicks represent casual glances instead of folks who come to photo sites specifically More than  billion photos are uploaded to Facebook every month according to a recent estimate And in the past few weeks others have thrown their names into the online photo bucket Path aims to be a sortof antiFacebook or perhaps more of an antiTwitter where popular users can have  millionplus followers allowing users to share photos with no more than  friends The new app picplz pronounced pic please lets users share photos to Facebook Myspace and Twitter Pixable which just got a  million venture capital infusion turns photos from Facebook and other sites into animated videos At Yahooowned Flickr head of product strategy Matthew Rothenberg said he doesnt see Facebooks numbers as a problem We look at Facebook almost more as a partner than a competitor he said We have Facebook integration integration on Twitter  Our mission is to be the best place to put your photos and share with the people who matter to you If the people who you care about happen to be on Facebook we want Flickr to work great with all of those things He highlighted features like geotagging which embeds images with geographical coordinates The site hosts more than  million locationtagged photos he said Flickr also has been a leader in mobile photography offering mobile uploads since  The numberone mostused camera on Flickr right now is a camera phone  currently the iPhone he said I have a digital camera gathering dust in my closet right now Obviously theres still a place for highend cameras but we are increasingly seeing more and more camera phone usage Flickr has a mobile app for multiple platfoms It has been downloaded  million times for the iPhone alone Munro said Photobucket has its own slate of plans to keep up In the next few days the site has a planned ravamp to give it a more intuitive look and feel he said A second update he said will bring bigger and more fundamental changes to Photobucket Although he wasnt ready to give away details it seems likely that additional mobile features could be part of the package Youre kind of hinting at a direction were looking at for the future Munro said to a question about an app that could instantly share Photobucket images with multiple sites A spokeswoman for Googleowned Picasa provided a list of features the site trumpets as setting it apart  including automatic facerecognition software and tagging that really works photo montage and collage creation and a stateoftheart desktop client Picasa  Its those sort of advanced features that these photo sites say will keep them ahead of their new challengers The sites will need to constantly evolve to keep up with a rapidly changing digital world they said The real goal of online photo share is to make sharing photos online the same kind of rich and wonderful experience that sharing photos in the offline world is said Tara Suan Kirchner Flickrs head of marketing

Metaverse Roadmap


 This is backed up by blogger and writer Caleb Booker who has tracked virtual worlds from phone party lines through the first oneplayer textbased computer adventures to the two and threedimensional Internet worlds that are burgeoning today Booker believes that in a society thats increasingly mobile virtual worlds help us hold our farflung social networks together He cites the example of his motherinlaw who recently moved to a new city and uses Facebook to stay in touch with her three daughters Theyre all busy so virtual world technologies and Web  apps are the best and most convenient ways to keep up he told CNN Booker says that virtual worlds take this interaction to a more sophisticated level I dont even have to worry about cab fare if I want to have a little gettogether with my friends from the UK and the US tonight he said And he thinks that its only a matter of time before virtual worlds follow Facebook and explode in popularity Bottom line if people are using email for social interaction theyll probably be interested in other ways to be social online Lifelike avatars Interaction on Facebook MySpace and other social networking sites is mainly limited to text with the ability for users to add photos and video But in a virtual world people are represented by avatars computergenerated figures which can look uncannily like ourselves  if we choose They can walk like us theyll soon talk like us and they can interact with each other As D technology becomes increasingly sophisticated Booker says that photorealistic avatars are just around the corner and will become increasingly convincing Eye movement breathing and realistic expressions will be the easy part he revealed The hard part will come with things like synching mouth movements with voice recognition Thats something we might not quite have nailed by  but there will definitely be some kind of engine that attempts it by then Holographic projections of D objects are in development but it will be some time before virtual reality offers us experiences akin to Star Treks holodecks touching and tasting virtual matter is still some way off Were a long long way away from having a completely immersive Matrixlike world he told CNN But then again technology can surprise you I remember joking with a friend about a guy who bought a brandnew VGA monitor It could display  colors at once  who could honestly need something like that Spartan life offline exotic life online The authors of the Metaverse Roadmap a briefing document that explores the possible development of virtual worlds over the next  years agree that a boom within a decade is likely Their research has indicated that by  half of us will have interactive avatars with those aged between  and  spending around  hours a week socializing in D visual environments And the draw of virtual worlds may encourage some of us to forsake our mundane reallife surroundings for a luxury life online The Metaverse Roadmap points to the millions of youths who already use worlds like Habbo Hotel and Playdo and suggests that Youth raised in such conditions might live increasingly Spartan lives in the physical world and rich exotic lives in virtual space It makes a certain kind of sense why cripple yourself with huge mortgage payments on real realestate when on Second Life you can buy an entire island for  and month maintenance The uses for virtual worlds dont stop at socializing Virtual environments are already being built for education like Edward Castronovas Arden project at Indiana University which will transport users into a Shakespearean world The applications for interior designers are clear while a team at the US National Institute of Mental Health NIMH in Bethesda Maryland have used the virtual shootemup Duke Nukem to diagnose depression in players Business collaboration Booker believes that virtual worlds will be used increasingly as business tools Theyre very well suited to collaborative work he explained Were not sure why yet but theres something about seeing everybodys avatar in the room with yours that makes the whole experience far more effective than if you were to simply have a conference call It creates a real shared experience And with the launch of Sonys PlayStation Home  an online world for the games console  this autumn it seems the big players in the entertainment world are banking on virtual realms being part of the future too The common feeling is that by  virtual worlds will be as widespread as the World Wide Web is now states Booker With that popularity comes opportunity  and not only for Internet land barons like selfproclaimed Second Life millionaire Anshe Chung but also virtual builders landscapers and interior decorators designers of avatar clothing and accessories and even community moderators and governors A significant percentage of the worlds population will be able to make a living working in virtual worlds says Booker And he thinks that this potential is just around the corner The truth is that as far as virtual worlds go were living in the flash point at the beginning of the explosion      What future do you think virtual worlds hold Would you give up Facebook to hang out in a virtual space with your friends Share your views and read others thoughts in the Just Imagine forum Email to a friend

 The Frisky  For anyone who is remotely active on Facebook you no doubt have been faced at some point with inane updates on one of your friends kids colds or how weddingplanning was coming along for one of your engaged buddies  Thats why when parenting Web site Babble published Facebooks Most Annoying Parents I immediately thought But what about all the annoying couples So without further ado I present to you the top four most annoying couples on Facebook The toomuchinlove couple Between the constant I love my honey sooooo much and I have the most amazing husband in the whole world updates these couples do proclaim too much  Their updates are filled with flowery adjectives and almost always include the words amazing luckiest and best ever Sometimes the updates are even addressed to each other like Kelly it was exactly two months ago today I met you and became the luckiest man in the universe or Mark I loved every amazing second of our beautiful weekend together  Dont these people have personal email addresses Cant they actually speak to one another in person and leave the rest of us out of it But of course all these proclamations arent for their benefit theyre for ours  Were supposed to feel jealous of their burning love for one another and their incredible luck to have found each other Unfriend The pathetic couple Outside of their relationship this couple is miserable and empty If either of them so much as works outside the home and theyre forced to spend eight hours apart their updates are peppered with hourly countdowns until their endoftheday reunion  The Frisky Free teeth whitening for your Facebook photos  If one gets invited to a function without the other they use their Facebook update to announce how unfair the world is and how nothing else in life is as important as the time they spend with each other  I have to go to my BFFs bachelorette party tonight which means a whole evening without Nick No fair How these couples ever managed to survive in the world without each other is one of the great mysteries of life The boring couple Its clear that the Boring Couple who does nothing but constantly hang out at home has forgotten that other people actually have fun for fun They update with Excited to stay in for movie and pizza night with the hubby or Gonna cook a big dinner for wifey tonight  Well hey guess what the rest of us are going to eat dinner at some point too and unless its enjoyed with a mentor weve just been granted a meal with from the MakeAWish foundation it probably doesnt warrant two exclamation pointsor you know a status update on Facebook These people would be more sad than annoying if they werent so smug about their domestic bliss The Frisky Are social media sites making us rude  The passiveaggressive couple Perhaps the biggest offender of them all this couple hashes out their issues with one another in passiveaggressive embarrassing and often melodramatic updates like Would have gotten a lot more sleep if somebody didnt keep me up all night with his constant farting or Theres nothing I hate more than a man who cant make up his mind which he woman he wants  Every other day your feed is cluttered with messages that theyve broken up or gotten back together At least you can take comfort in knowing that they totally deserve each otherTM    TMV Inc  All Rights Reserved

   Fears of impostors increase on FacebookStory Highlights Media reports of impersonation on Facebook are increasing  Facebook says fewer than  percent of its  million users are affected  A Seattlearea man says someone impersonated him to get money from his friends  In Wisconsin a man was accused of using a false ID to solicit sex actsNext Article in Technology    Read  VIDEO   From  John Sutter and Jason Carroll CNN  



 


 

  CNN  Without his input Bryan Rutbergs Facebook status update  the way friends track each other  suddenly changed on January  to this frightening alert 
Fears of impostors are increasing as Facebooks membership grows 
 Bryan NEEDS HELP URGENTLY His online friends saw the message and came to his aid Some posted concerned messages on his public profile  Whats happening What do you need one wrote Another friend Beny Rubinstein got a direct message saying Rutberg had been robbed at gunpoint in London and needed money to get back to the United States So trying to be a good friend Rubinstein wired  to London in two installments according to police in Bellevue Washington  Meanwhile Rutberg was safe at home in Seattle Rubinstein told CNN he misses the money but its perhaps more upsetting to feel tricked by someone who impersonated his friend on Facebook a socialnetworking site where millions of friends converse freely online   Its an invasion of your whole privacy who your friends are he said  Watch Rutberg talk about his Facebook page being hacked  While reports of extortion and false impersonation have been common in phony phone calls and fake emails similar fraud hasnt been reported on Facebook until recently Now a number of complaints are surfacing 
Dont Miss 
KMGH Could Your Facebook Friend Be Stealing Your ID


Facebook turns   but can it survive


 In response to the trend the Better Business Bureau in late January issued a warning on its Web site intended for Facebooks  million users know who your friends are and keep your sensitive information private In the Seattle case a hacker appeared to steal Rutbergs identity to get money from his friends by toying with their emotions   In Wisconsin police accuse an yearold man of posing as a woman on Facebook to get high school boys to send him naked photos of themselves  Watch yearold accused in Facebook case  Anthony Stancl of New Berlin Wisconsin allegedly used the naked photos he had solicited to force the young men into sex acts with him according to a criminal complaint Stancl was arrested on  felony complaints including sexual assault of a child younger than  and possession of child pornography the complaint says CNN left multiple messages for Stancls attorney but did not receive a response Stancl is being held in lieu of  bail and has no previous criminal record according to CNN affiliate WISN There are primarily two ways to stay safe on Facebook said Jim Lewis director of the technology and policy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies First make sure your computer antivirus programs are up to date and tell online companies you want better privacy protection he said In a statement Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt told CNN that impersonation schemes affect fewer than  percent of Facebooks  million users He would not comment on whether the rate of such incidents is increasing but said any increase in the total number of impersonations could be due to the fact that the site is growing by  users per day In many cases the scammer has added a new contact email to attempt to maintain control of the account Schnitt said in a prepared statement To combat this were instituting changes that will better notify users when their account is modified and empowering them to reverse these changes Rutberg the Seattle man who had his Facebook page hacked said he worked with the site to shut down his profile within a day It was back up in a week he said All Internet users should be aware their identities can be compromised and every user of the Web should be better educated Rutberg said Like other types of Internet fraud Facebook impersonation cases are difficult to solve and costly to pursue said Officer Greg Grannis spokesman for the Bellevue Police Department in Washington We are not investigating this case he said noting that a report on the case had been filed with his office It is pretty much at a dead end Because the money went to London it would be nearly impossible to send officers out to investigate the case he said Facebook says it is taking measures to reduce impersonations The popular site also offers these preventative tips for those who want to take the security of their online profile into their own hands  Be suspicious of anyone  even friends  who ask for money over the Internet Verify their circumstances independently either by calling them directly or checking with mutual friends  Choose a strong password and use unique credentials for each of your Web accounts Facebook says hackers tap into one site and then try to reuse passwords on others  Use an uptodate browser that features an antiphishing blacklist  Use and run antivirus software on your computer 





  Reset your Facebook password if you suspect your account has been compromised  Have more than one contact email address This will help if one of them is hacked

   Facebook faces furor over content rightsStory Highlights Facebook answers users concerns about its ownership of images and other content  Flap arose after the socialnetworking site reorganized its terms of service last week  Blog phrased new policy as We Can Do Anything We Want With Your Content  Facebook We are not claiming  ownership of material that users upload  Next Article in Technology    By Caroline McCarthy 



 


 

 
 CNET  On an otherwise placid holiday weekend one blogs commentary on a change to Facebooks terms of service created a firestorm of banter on the Web does the social network claim ownership to any user content on the site even if the user deletes it 
Facebook is addressing users concerns about its ownership of images and other content 
 Facebook reorganized its terms of service last Wednesday In a blog post company legal representative Suzie White provided an explanation We used to have several different documents that outlined what people could and could not do on Facebook but now were consolidating all this information to one central place White wrote  Weve also simplified and clarified a lot of information that applies to you including some things you shouldnt do when using the site   The blog post sounded benign But the brouhaha arose on Sunday over a revision in the wording of Facebooks policy over what happens to profile contentshared items blog postlike notes photoswhen members delete their accounts Consumer advocacy blog The Consumerist phrased Facebooks fresh policy as We Can Do Anything We Want With Your Content Forever pointing out that Facebooks ToS spruceup removed several sentences in which the company said its licenses on user content expired upon account deletion  And thats where the hysteria began

 Facebook should now be called The Information Blackhole one Consumerist commenter proclaimed What goes in never comes out Be careful what you huck in there Truth be told most Facebook users wont give a hoot the same way that the flurry over the Beacon advertising program in late  was fueled by a few vocal privacy advocates while the general population didnt seem to care about it one way or the other  But for advocates of copyright reform and privacy not to mention photographers and writers who may want the photos they upload or notes they write on Facebook to eventually lead to some kind of profit the news was alarming Some prominent Twitterers and bloggers like New Yorker music critic Sasha FrereJones announced that they were deleting their Facebook accounts or pulling all uploaded content So Facebook issued somewhat of a clarification on Monday to explain what the change really meant We are not claiming and have never claimed ownership of material that users upload a statement from Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt read And indeed Facebooks terms of service do say that User Content and ApplicationsConnect Sites are exempt from its claims on content ownership The new Terms were clarified to be more consistent with the behavior of the site Schnitts statement continued That is if you send a message to another user or post to their wall etc that content might not be removed by Facebook if you delete your account but can be deleted by your friend The statement also noted a few fine points First Facebooks license only permits it to use user content in connection with the Facebook Service or the promotion thereof indicating that CEO Mark Zuckerberg does not plan to make the site profitable by selling scandalous user photos to the National Enquirer when those Facebook members run for elected office And second if that Facebook content was not public the site will respect the members chosen privacy settings In other words if your profile and the photos you have uploaded to it are only accessible to people on your friends list Facebook says it does not have the right to show those photos to anyone outside your friends list

 Facebook has expressed disapproval when photographs and profile screenshots normally protected by the sites login wall or privacy settings have been made public on the Web  The site reportedly threatened gossip blog mogul Nick Denton with an account deletion when one of his properties Gawker posted photographs found on a socialites Facebook profile Suffice it to say it would be hypocritical for Facebook to publicly distribute let alone sell the same content itself Things are a little bit murky for sure though Unlike the Yahooowned Flickr Facebook does not have extensive copyright preferences meaning that a professional photographer might want to choose a mediasharing site where theres less of a gray area as to what can actually happen down the road   But as Facebook becomes more and more of a contentsharing hub especially now that the Facebook Connect product expands its reach to thirdparty sites its likely there will be a louder cry among membersespecially those involved in creative industries who use their Facebook profiles for professional promotion or publicityfor clearer terms iReportcom Too much information posted online The way they stand now Facebooks terms of service claim that the company does not have ownership over content yet that it does have an irrevocable perpetual nonexclusive transferable fully paid worldwide license touse copy publish stream store retain publicly perform or display transmit scan reformat modify edit frame translate excerpt adapt create derivative works and distribute material as long as it doesnt violate the privacy preferences set by the user Considering Facebook content is loginprotected by default the outcry should be quelled somewhat by that subject only to your privacy settings phrasing Still this is a debate that might not go away so quickly  Zuckerberg wrote a post for the Facebook blog later on Monday about the issue We still have work to do to communicate more clearly about these issues and our terms are one example of this he wrote  Our philosophy that people own their information and control who they share it with has remained constant A lot of the language in our terms is overly formal and protective of the rights we need to provide this service to you Over time we will continue to clarify our positions and make the terms simpler Zuckerberg continued Were at an interesting point in the development of the open online world where these issues are being worked out Its difficult terrain to navigate and were going to make some missteps but as the leading service for sharing information we take these issues and our responsibility to help resolve them very seriously

   Facebook backs down reverses on user information policyStory Highlights Facebook this month changed its policy to say user content belonged to Facebook  Outraged members canceled their accounts or created online petitions  On Wednesday Facebook reviewed user feedback and reverted to its old policy Next Article in Technology    Read  VIDEO    



 


 

  CNN  Under fire from tens of thousands of users the social networking site Facebook said early Wednesday it is reverting to its old policy on user information  for now 
Backlash against Facebook began after a consumer advocate site flagged Facebooks policy change 
 The site posted a brief message on users home pages that said it was returning to its previous Terms of Use policy while we resolve the issues that people have raised The Terms of Use is the legalese tacked on to the bottom of most Web sites that details what the sites owners can do with the information that users provide Facebook the Webs most popular social networking site has been caught in a contentrights battle after revealing earlier this month that it was granting itself permanent rights to users photos wall posts and other information even after a user closed an account The popular site allows users to create personal profiles where they can then connect with one another upload photos and share links The site boasts more than  million active users Member backlash against Facebook began over the weekend after a consumer advocate Web site The Consumerist flagged a change made to Facebooks policy earlier in the month The company deleted a sentence from the old Terms of Use That sentence said Facebook could not claim any rights to original content that a user uploaded once the user closed his or her account

 It replaced it with You may remove your User Content from the Site at any time  However you acknowledge that the Company may retain archived copies of your User Content In response Chris Walters wrote in the Consumerist post Make sure you never upload anything you dont feel comfortable giving away forever because its Facebooks now   Thousands of indignant members either canceled their accounts or created online petitions Among them were more than  who joined a group called The People Against the new Terms of Service iReportcom Too much information posted online   On Monday Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg tried to quell the controversy by saying the companys philosophy is that people own their information and control who they share it with But members were not appeased because the site did not fix its Terms of Use The company in its post Wednesday said it was returning to its previous Terms of Use because of the feedback it had received    As Mark expressed in his blog post on Monday it was never our intention to confuse people or make them uneasy about sharing on Facebook company spokesman Barry Schnitt said in a blog post I also want to be very clear that Facebook does not nor have we ever claimed ownership over peoples content Your content belongs to you iReportcom Your thoughts on Facebooks aboutface Schnitt said the company is in the process of rewording its Terms of Use in simple language that defines Facebooks rights much more specifically 





   Well that worked pretty fast wrote member Al Reford of Vancouver British Columbia Numbers count when giving feedback  And Shahrzad Grami of St Paul Minnesota added  YAYYYYYYYYYYY nice job guys i wont be canceling my account after all

 Slightly over a year ago at the South by Southwest Interactive Festival Zuckerberg was asked about Facebooks plans in the philanthropic space His response was that the company wasnt yet at that point I think at this point because were not incredibly profitable were not at that stage of the companyhopefully we get therethats not really something that we can do a lot of he said to CNET News last March But Id like to think that just what the company is trying to do in general just helping people communicate is actually making the world better A year later Facebooks revenues are up but not as much as some critics say they ought to be This kind of growth isnt cheapand with  million users Facebook still has a lot of work to do on the business side not just in the feelgood changetheworld department

  CNN  Part of the power of social networking is the ability to form communities with likeminded individuals 
Attorney Brian Cuban is trying to get Facebook to remove pages for Holocaust denial groups such as this one 
 But what happens when those communities are offensive to others  That issue is at the heart of attempts by a Dallas Texas attorney to have socialnetworking site Facebook remove pages for Holocaust deniers The Holocaust Denial movement seeks to deny or minimize the Holocaust in which Nazis killed about six million European Jews during World War II  Attorney Brian Cuban brother of Dallas Mavericks team owner Mark Cuban has been trying since last year to have the pages of groups with such names as Holocaust A Series of Lies and Holocaust is a Holohoax removed from Facebook  He pointed out that Facebook has removed groups based on complaints before and said the site is setting the subjective standard on what they remove and what they dont

 There is no First Amendment right to free speech in the private realm Cuban said This isnt a freedomofspeech issue Facebook is free to set the standard that they wish    Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt said his company is in agreement with Cuban that the Holocaustdenial pages are offensive and objectionable  Where the two sides part Schnitt said is whether people have the right to discuss such ideas on Facebook  Its a difficult decision to make We have a lot of internal debate and we bring in experts to talk about it Schnitt said Just being offensive or objectionable doesnt get it taken off Facebook We want it the site to be a place where people can discuss all kinds of ideas including controversial ones  Schnitt said Facebook has drawn the line with pages or groups that attack an individual or incite or threaten violence Schnitt pointed to the recent removal of the Isle of Man KKK page created by residents of the island off the coast of England  Facebook interpreted the pages advocacy of cleansing the island of foreigners as threatening and inciting violence he said   Facebook receives lots of reports about such pages and actively polices the site Schnitt said Last year Facebook removed several pages posted by Italian neoNazis after complaints that they encouraged violence against gypsies    Brian Cuban who is of Russian Jewish descent has written about his fight to have the Holocaustdenial pages removed on his site The Cuban Revolution  He said he contacted Facebook after a conversation with a friend who runs the Jewish Internet Defense Force a group that monitors and tries to eradicate antiSemitic online content    The Jewish Internet Defense Force which was successful in removing a Facebook page for the group Israel Is Not A Country Delist It From Facebook As A Country is outspoken in its own right and sometimes guilty of sweeping generalizations of its own In an article on Brian Cubans site published during the  presidential campaign a representative from the Jewish Internet Defense Force was quoted as saying that  percent of Muslims hate us  The article went on to quote JIDF spokesman on the last Presidential campaign We hope to continue to highlight the issues surrounding thencandidate Barack Obamas terrorist connections as well as his racist and antiSemitic church which has supported Hamas and the Rev Louis Farrakhan  A Jewish Internet Defense Force spokesperson named David who requested his last name be withheld because his group has received death threats said Thursday he would rather people not focus on those specific quotes for several reasons including the fact that it was an informal interview and Cuban would not let us correct any of our statements after we quickly answered him to help him meet his deadline  But on the matter of Facebook and Holocaust deniers the Jewish Internet Defense Force has a clear stance  Facebook should not provide a platform for hatred especially as it is against their TOS terms of service David said Holocaust denial is illegal in  countries and represents a form of Jew hatred and hate speech in general Deborah Lipstadt is the Dorot Professor of Modern Jewish and Holocaust Studies at Emory University and an expert on Holocaust denial She said socialnetworking sites like Facebook are attractive to deniers  It allows people to find one another both for good and for bad she said People who are drawn to Holocaust denial tend to be fringe kind of people who might not otherwise be able to find a group but this way they can find other likeminded people    Deborah Lauter director of Civil Rights for the AntiDefamation League said the issue of antiSemitism and hate speech online is a growing one partly because of the anonymity the Web offers Lauter pointed out that Facebooks Statement of Rights and Responsibilities says that users will not post content that is hateful threatening pornographic or that contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence  She said the AntiDefamation League has worked with sites such as YouTube and MySpace to encourage them to be socially responsible corporate citizens  Even though in the States this kind of hate is protected speech Web sites dont have to provide the forum to help spread it said Lauter whose organization is the US representative for the International Network Against CyberHate Our position is that if you are going to be providing it then you have to step up and put in the mechanism for policing it

  WIRED  The US Marine Corps has banned Twitter Facebook MySpace and other social media sites from its networks effective immediately 
The Marine Corps fears that social media sites such as Facebook could pose a security risk 
 These internet sites in general are a proven haven for malicious actors and content and are particularly high risk due to information exposure user generated content and targeting by adversaries reads a Marine Corps order issued Monday  The very nature of SNS social network sites creates a larger attack and exploitation window exposes unnecessary information to adversaries and provides an easy conduit for information leakage that puts OPSEC operational security COMSEC communications security and personnel at an elevated risk of compromise The Marines ban will last a year It was drawn up in response to a late July warning from US Strategic Command which told the rest of the military it was considering a Defense Departmentwide ban on the Web  sites due to network security concerns  Scams worms and Trojans often spread unchecked throughout social media sites passed along from one online friend to the next

 CNN  Hundreds of Facebook groups have been hijacked in recent days by users pointing out what they say is a weakness in how the socialnetworking site handles the administration of its groups By Tuesday morning  groups had apparently been renamed Control Your Info and had a new message posted to their walls Hello we hereby announce that we have officially hijacked your Facebook group the message reads This means we control a certain part of the information about you on Facebook If we wanted we could make you appear in a bad way which could damage your image severly sic  According to Control Your Info when Facebook group administrators step down anyone else can take over their duties  giving them access to members personal information the ability to send messages to all members of the group and the authority to make changes to that group For example we could rename your group and call it something very inappropriate and nasty like I Support Pedophiles Rights  the message continued But have no fear We wont Among the groups renamed Control Your Info on Tuesday were a Twilight fan group supporters of a high school football team and patrons of a Virginia winery In a statement Facebook said no confidential information has been placed at risk  The groups in question have been abandoned by their previous owners which means any group member has the option to make themselves an administrator in order to continue communication to the group Group administrators have no access to confidential information and group members can leave a group at any time said a Facebook spokesperson For small groups administrators can simply edit a group name or info moderate discussion and message group members The names of large groups cannot be changed nor can anyone message all members  In the rare instances when we find that a group has been changed inappropriately we will disable the group the spokesperson said  The names of two Facebook users who have posted Control Your Info messages after group takeovers  Janis Roukkos and Bella Roregit  did not appear to have active Facebook accounts by midmorning Tuesday A message on Control Your Infos Web site blamed Facebook for shutting down the groups fan page Members of the group could not be reached for comment Tuesday  The group which offered only a YouTube account as contact information disagreed with calling what it had done hacking This isnt some kind of scare tactics nor is it a hack its a feature that can be used and is being used in bad ways the post reads Remember control your info Also this project is strictly not for profit and done for a good cause The groups site contains pages of tips on protecting socialnetwork users private information Not all members of the groups that were hijacked were taking the stunt in the spirit it was apparently intended Its pretty inappropriate and expletive you hijacked a facebook group for Palestinian rights to selfishly promote your little conspiracy theory page one user wrote I reported this to facebook and others should too

  Facebooks Mark Zuckerberg opens upStory Highlights Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg talks about the evolution of his company  You should be able to connect to business like you do a person Zuckerberg says  Zuckerberg Its easy to have philosophy but moving people there is harder  Value of site is that it opens up communication channels and builds relationshipsNext Article in Technology    By   Fred Vogelstein 



 


 

  WIRED  Back in April I interviewed Mark Zuckerberg as part of my research for Wireds Great Wall of Facebook piece 
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks at the Digital Life Design conference in Munich Germany 
 Here is an edited transcript in which the Facebook founder and CEO talks about the limitations of walled gardens the evolution of privacy online and why Home Depot should humanize itself Wiredcom What is your vision for Facebook Mark Zuckerberg When I started Facebook from my dorm room in  the idea that my roommates and I talked about all the time was a world that was more open  We believed that people being able to share the information they wanted and having access to the information they wanted is just a better world People can connect better with the people around them understand more of whats going on with the people around them and understand more in general  Also openness fundamentally affects a lot of the core institutions in society  the media the economy how people relate to the government and just their leadership We thought that stuff was really interesting to pursue I think it turns out that the best way to do that is to build a company and an organization Weve learned a lot along the way about how to do that  One of the things we learned was that there were two ways to get to this place of more information access There was the topdown way right  you can kind of characterize that by the Google or search approach  where you have a bunch of machines and algorithms going out and crawling the web and bringing information into them

 But we figured that over time that wouldnt actually be the best approach We figured it wouldnt get the most information It would only get stuff that was publicly available to everyone and it wouldnt give people the control that they needed to be really be comfortable No one wants to live in a surveillance society which if you take that to its extreme could be where thats going And theres Facebook  a kind of a groundup approach  where people choose to share all this information themselves  Its a slower approach right because what it means is that people need to move through this process of realizing that sharing information is good and slowly sharing more and more information over time  But by doing that you get a lot richer information you get information that people dont want to share with everyone but they just want to share with some people around them You get personal information like photos from my vacation or a trip that I want to share with people And it just ends up being a richer web and its more democratically controlled by the people who are sharing stuff as opposed to by some central entity thats going out and indexing all this information right And thats the path weve been on and its really interesting just watching the rate of information production change  I think at this point there are probably more people who are sharing stuff either privately or semiprivately on social networks than just letting it be crawled by search engines When I use that word I mean sharing with  or  or  people Its not email that youre sending to one or two people but its also not something that youre making available to everyone I think theres a lot of information that people are sharing like that now and thats probably growing a lot quicker than the volume of blogs or other completely open sites on the web    Theres something like a billion new photos a month on Facebook and thats just one type of media on the site Facebook where there is over a billion new pieces of information shared each week Wiredcom Lets be a little bit more specific You just gave us a foot view Maybe we should do it now from  or  feet Zuckerberg So I think there are two big themes One is just the trend that Facebook is taking for the next couple years and then theres more structural stuff thats underlying that in terms of the platform that were building First think about how the Facebook platform has evolved We started off as this platform inside Facebook and we were pretty clear from the beginning that that wasnt where it was going to end up  A lot of people saw it and asked Why is Facebook trying to get all these applications inside Facebook when the web is clearly the platform And we actually agreed with that Its just that we were just getting started And now as time goes on were shifting away from Platform inside Facebook and shifting more towards Connect outside of Facebook And Connect has just a lot of advantages that I think developers will gravitate towards So the ability for developers to have their own website with all the same functionality in it that they couldve built inside Facebook allows them to build their own brand allows them to have their own users more than just getting Facebook users inside the site So I just think it ends up being a stronger system than the first Facebook platform we had The structural change comes from this point of openness We talk about this concept of openness and transparency as the high level ideal that were moving towards at Facebook  The way that we get there is by empowering people to share and connect The combination of those two things leads the world to become more open And so as time has gone on weve actually shifted a bit more of a focus not just on directly making it so people can use Facebook and share and be open on Facebook but instead on making it so that the systems themselves have open properties So one analogy that we think about is a government or a nation If you want to be free or you want to preserve freedom for people you both need to have laws that make it so people have freedom of speech and all the freedoms that they need You also need to have an open governance system where people can vote and people have representation And we think that over the longterm the way that we actually create the most openness and transparency in the world at Facebook is both by creating the most powerful applications ourselves and creating a platform that is fundamentally moving more in the direction of being an open platform itself right So were aiming for openness on two levels One on the fact that theres more sharing and another on the fact that by having these open standards youre constantly moving towards a place in the industry where there will be more and more sharing right So people can bring their information anywhere they want Anyone can use the platform Wiredcom Does that mean every Facebook user will have control over how public hisher information is and be able to decide whether or not it can be crawled by search engines Zuckerberg Weve already started moving in that direction Just a couple of weeks ago we announced this open privacy setting where prior to that it was impossible for someone to take their profile and say that they wanted it to be open  Now they can do that They can say its open to everyone And what I would just expect is that as time goes on were just going to keep on moving more and more in that direction We launched stuff like Platform and we get a lot of praise for that We also get a lot of people saying But this isnt as open as it needs to be And in a lot of ways I think theyre right but this stuff takes time  Were moving a community of  million people along this spectrum trying to tell people to share information and be comfortable with that Just from the launches that weve had its pretty clear that we havent mastered the art of moving people along in terms of change making these changes but I think were getting better at it And theres a long way to go but I think thats kind of the direction that were moving in Wiredcom Why not pursue this strategy from the beginning Why did you wait until now to do all the things that were talking about Zuckerberg So this is a really important point Its really easy to have a nice philosophy about openness but moving the world in that direction is a different thing It requires both understanding where you want to go and being pragmatic about getting there  In politics you get this all the time Its easy for people to have a point of view on how things should be yet the people who are actually in the Senate or Congress or White House need to balance on a daily basis where they want to go with how they actually get stuff done Wiredcom So would you agree with the statement then that you cant succeed on the internet by putting up walls Zuckerberg I think its not quite that black and white What I think is true is that over time things trend towards becoming more open right I think early on they tend to start closed And thats important right Its an important phase  One analogy and example that I look at is personal computers and how they evolved You started off with people who just built the whole thing themselves Then as time went on the platforms either for hardware or software became more open and that has produced a much better outcome in terms of the types of machines that people can use  But it had to start somewhere right It couldnt start off as this open platform Someone had to put the idea of a computer out there first So I think you generally want to move towards more openness I dont think anything ever gets completely open Is there an open format for keyboards I guess so There are multiple different keyboard layouts But basically everyone uses one right Wiredcom Except many believe that the rules that drove the PC industry dont apply to the rules that are evolving around business on the internet They say that you actually need to start open and continue to be open Zuckerberg So I think one thing thats really important is that the rules are constantly changing I think a lot of the issues that some of these other companies have had is they define themselves too narrowly as a company in a specific medium  Like email could have easily moved into being what social networks are today I think a lot of email companies now are actually trying to move in that direction But I feel like because they defined themselves as just email companies they didnt adapt quickly enough We define ourselves more broadly as a company thats trying to bring innovative things to people that help them share more and make the world more open And I think that that mindset allows us to change very rapidly  Sometimes its so rapid that our community isnt ready for it or isnt happy about it when it initially happens But I feel like our approach of just being focused on understanding this trend of openness and sharing and moving very quickly along it has been a stronger approach than anyone whos tried to build a medium for where the world is in any given point in time Wiredcom How do you envision what youre doing today enabling other companies and Facebook to make money Zuckerberg Openness and transparency affects how people and businesses relate to each other So it used to be the case where only really big companies could do advertising on the web and then Google came along And they made it so anyone can do basic direct response advertising Now they have millions of advertisers Wiredcom Right Zuckerberg I think that there could be even a more dramatic change with Facebook If you look at the space of the people who do brand advertising which is basically advertising thats more for the longterm  not to sell something today but instead to build a relationship  I think that thats going to be something thats not only accessible to the largest brands but accessible to everyone  If you take that idea a step further you might conclude that not only will it be something thats accessible to everyone but something that everyone feels they have to participate in Think about what people are doing on Facebook today Theyre keeping up with their friends and family but theyre also building an image and identity for themselves which in a sense is their brand Theyre connecting with the audience that they want to connect to Its almost a disadvantage if youre not on it now If you carry that thinking over from people to things like stores and brands you realize that everyones trying to do the same thing which is communicate build a reputation build relationships with people and just have more information out there Wiredcom So give me an example A year or two from now what might you be able to do on Facebook that would be an example of what youre talking about  if youre a small business Or a large business for that matter Zuckerberg You should be able to connect to a business in the same way that you connect to a friend or a person on the site and then that business should be able to publish things in the same way that that happens for people you care about So that was a big part of this whole streams release on the homepage that we just did Now its not completely there yet right People are still bidirectional confirmed relationships while Facebook Pages those for businesses and celebrities have to be these onedirectional relationships People can send messages to each other Facebook Pages can only send these updates to all their fans Over time were going to see that those things are just going to converge completely right So a business or celebrity Page will be able to send a message to all their fans At the same time theyll be able to send messages to individuals that theyre connected to So no matter who you are  a person on the site or a store or a big brand  youll be able to have the same options for how you connect to people You could make it bidirectional so you have to confirm each one or you could make it so people can just connect you Wiredcom The part that makes sense to me is the small business part because I can understand wanting to have a relationship with my local butcher or dry cleaner  Its harder for me to envision how that works with say The Gap or any other big brand out there because almost by definition people perceive those interactions as not being about relationships but being about just pure commerce You can make the case that your local butcher really cares about you and your relationship but you cant really say that anymore about your local Home Depot or your bank Zuckerberg Actually I think this is one of the most profound changes that more openness and transparency brings It puts more weight and importance on building better social relationships and being more trustworthy So I actually do think youre seeing this trend towards organizations just caring more about their brand and engaging And so I think Home Depot will want to humanize itself I think thats a lot of why companies are starting blogs are just giving more insight into whats going on with them  I think its actually a big reason why a lot of companies are embracing the green movement for example Its really easy to portray people running companies as only caring about money but they care about real things too And I think part of this trend is that there will be more visibility into that right  So the Home Depot will have a brand that is about what they sell  different tools and things But it will also have a brand that is based on their staff and how they relate to customers And I think that that ends up being really important Look at the way celebrities and politicians are using Facebook already When Ashton Kutcher posts a video he gets hundreds of pieces of feedback Maybe he doesnt have time to read them all or respond to them all but hes getting good feedback and getting a good sense of how people are thinking about that and maybe can respond to some of it right And thats still really valuable And I would expect a similar dynamic to evolve with businesses Wiredcom People have been trying for years to make money selling ads on IMs selling ads on email selling ads in all forms on communication mediums But the reality is that when youre in communication mode youre not particularly receptive to advertising Why is that not an issue for Facebook Zuckerberg Yeah I agree with that And I think the difference is that this isnt a pure communication medium People use it to share information but sharing is a bit different than communicating right Sharing is putting something out there and then people are going and getting it asynchronously right  So a lot more of what we do is trying to surface the right information to the right people which gives us leverage and opportunities to surface other information like interesting advertisements that they might want to see as well But yeah I agree that like when people are IMing on Facebook which is one of the behaviors it wouldnt make sense for us to have an ad in the IM right But when people go to their homepage in the morning to see whats going on one of the things thats going on could be a sponsored thing  I think a lot of the value that Facebook creates is that it opens up communication channels and builds relationships I think that thats just a really valuable thing and it has probably been undervalued to this point Wiredcom Facebooks focus on realtime streams reminds me a little bit of TV before Tivo If youre a business and you want people to see your brand and have a relationship with your brand in peoples stream you have to be looking at the stream at specific times Doesnt that mean you have to start selling ads like networks do  based on the size and type of audience at different times of the day Zuckerberg There are different modalities One is a real time element Theres also the highlights and news feeds components And then you have search or behaviors where the persons actively seeking out some information  We want to make that available to them very very clearly So if I type in tools then I think that theres a good opportunity to show you things that your friends are connected to Wiredcom And youre going to build the search stuff yourself I would suspect Zuckerberg Yes or at least well try

  Clerics We dont want to ban Facebook we use itStory Highlights Indonesian Islamic clerics say they have not called for a ban on Facebook  Clerics say they are against its use for things like pornography and drug dealing  They are avid Facebook users saying it can be a positive toolNext Article in World    By  Kathy Quiano CNN 



 


 

  JAKARTA Indonesia CNN  Indonesian Islamic clerics say they have not called for a ban on popular social networking sites like Facebook and that they are avid users themselves 
A group of Indonesian clerics says they do not want Facebook banned 
 According to media reports the clerics in East Java had banned the faithful from gossiping and flirting on social networking Web sites such as Facebook and Friendster They also demanded an end to lewd and pornographic content the reports said However Muchammad Nabil Haroen a spokesman for the Liboryo Islamic Boarding School told CNN Monday that they were not after a ban and that he and several other clerics had Facebook accounts   Haroen said that a meeting of about  clerics at the boarding school last week had issued guidelines on the use of online networks and mobile phones saying Web sites like Facebook should only be used for positive purposes like networking and seeking old friends  If Facebook is used for negative purposes like drug dealing or prostitution then its forbidden he clarified If it was used for such offences the clerics could push for a  fatwa or edict he said

 He stressed that the clerics statement was only a recommendation for the Indonesian Council of Religious Scholars and the Nahdlatul Ulama one of the countrys largest Muslim organizations to consider Choli Nafis deputy head of Nahdlatul Ulamas Fatwa Commission confirmed the organization had received the recommendation but said Facebook is just a tool like a car or a television If people use it in a good way theres no need to ban it Nafis too uses Facebook The  most recent fatwas include bans on smoking in public and the practice of yoga that incorporates religious rituals like chanting and meditation These have largely been ignored by Indonesian Muslims A survey cited by alexacom which tracks Internet traffic and that appeared in The Jakarta Post found that Facebook was the top ranked site in Indonesia  Nearly four percent of all Facebook users come from Indonesia making it the largest source of visitors after the United States United Kingdom France and Italy alexacom found

Editors note Ethan Zuckerman is a senior researcher at Harvard Universitys Berkman Center for Internet and Society and cofounder of the international blogging network Global Voices Zuckerman spoke at the TED Global conference in July TED a nonprofit organization devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading hosts talks on many subjects and makes them available through its website  CNN  Last month Facebook announced it had signed up its  millionth member Many news outlets began stories on this milestone by declaring that if Facebook were a nation it would be the thirdmost populous on the planet Immigrants to this nation include tens of millions from Mexico Turkey France Italy India and the Philippines The  million Americans whove joined the service represent only a quarter of the citizens And with support for  languages Facebook would be one of the worlds most polyglot lands far surpassing Indias  official languages Facebook of course is not a nation Its a service that allows users to share photos updates news and play games with other users of the service And while  million people from all over the globe use the service for most of us Facebook feels less like an transnational melting pot and more like the neighborhood bar where everyone knows your name While more than  percent of Facebook users are Indonesian its unlikely that youre friends with any of them unless you have Indonesian friends in the offline world Thats because Facebook is designed to connect you with people you already know not introduce you to new people When you sign up for Facebook the service first searches for any mentions of your name and suggests you befriend anyone who has mentioned you in their posts It then asks to access your email account so you can connect with anyone with whom you regularly correspond Finally it encourages you to add information about your high school college and employer to your profile It uses this information to find friends within your classmates and coworkers You have ample opportunity to connect with people you already know before you have a chance to discover anyone new Read more about Ethan Zuckerman on TEDcom Once youve found your friends on Facebook they share their news gossip and discoveries with you This can be a source of serendipitous discovery as friends find stories and inspirations you would have missed Or it can serve as an echo chamber slowly persuading you that everyone views the world the way you do because the people you know on Facebook share your prejudices and views I study the ways new media shapes peoples perceptions of the world Its my fond hope that social networks such as Facebook will help users broaden their perspectives by listening to a different set of people than they encounter in their daily life But I fear services such as Facebook may be turning us into imaginary cosmopolitans We hear that  million people from around the world are using Facebook and forget that we hear mostly from our  on average friends many of whom weve known since we went to high school together On the internet information from Indiana and India is equally cheap and easy to access But of the  most popular news and information sites in the United States only  are hosted outside the country And  percent of those page views are to US sites This pattern holds true in all  countries with the largest numbers of internet users Despite ample opportunity to use the internet to seek information from beyond our national borders most of our internet usage is local Like the Internet itself Facebook is one of the most powerful technologies ever built to increase connection between people separated by borders of nation language religion and culture Armenian journalist Onnik Krikorian reports that Facebook has created a space where young Armenians and Azeri  separated in physical space by a decadesold border dispute  can explore friendships that would never otherwise develop But Facebook can also spawn spaces that make crosscultural dialog more difficult The Everybody Draw Mohammed Day Facebook campaign began as a humorous protest in support of freedom of expression inspired by a cartoon drawn by Molly Norris As the group attracted  members on Facebook the drawings of the Muslim prophet submitted to the group became increasingly offensive and violent Norris and others initially involved with the protest distanced themselves as the group became a campaign against Islam rather than a campaign for free speech Before Facebook removed the campaign from its site a Pakistani court ordered a nationwide ban on the social networking service in reaction to the offensive content Is Facebook a space for crosscultural interaction For fomenting reactionary hatred Or is it primarily a space for online interaction with our local offline friends Peace on Facebook is a page where Facebook tries to quantify connections made on the service across lines of religion and nationality Some of the news is encouraging  connections between Indian and Pakistani users made in the past  hours Some is dispiriting  only  MuslimJewish connections in the previous day With half a billion users and an estimated  billion friendships such numbers are small To me they suggest we have work to do if we want a network such as Facebook to do its part in making the world a wider and betterconnected place The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ethan Zuckerman

Users can more easily access Facebook applications and games as well as a list of friends who are currently online The search function on the site became more prominent And Facebooks news feed is now divided into categories for top news and most recent posts from Facebook friends a slight change from the previous arrangement which also allowed users to sort posts by whats newest and whats most relevant to them Video Facebooks year history The site also tries to make it easier for users to find friend requests and new messages creating a potential allinone hub for online communication For example when you receive a Facebook notification about someone writing on your Wall or tagging you in a photo youll see a red bubble appear in the lefthand corner near the search bar Facebook engineer Jing Chen wrote in a blog post on the site When you click on the icon youll see a dropdown menu with your most recent notifications Facebook says its going for a simplified design So far the online community has not reacted with the same vitriol it has to other Facebook changes  When the site first introduced the news feed which pulls in new information from friends pages users blasted the site for eliminating the privacy of their pages And changes to Facebooks privacy settings typically are met with heated discourse on blogs and on the site Video Facebooks privacy issues In this case more than  people have said they like Zuckerbergs recent post and many users are wishing the site a happy birthday as if it were a friend of theirs What a great venue to reconnect with old friends or make new ones Thank you Facebook Happy sixth birthday one user wrote in response to Zuckerbergs post Some bloggers said the site looks and feels similar to before with a slightly greater emphasis on gaming and applications Many changes are subtle and the look and feel of the site remains the same Jessica E Vascellaro wrote on the Wall Street Journals Digits blog VentureBeats KimMai Cutler says the updated and moreprominent search function on Facebook is perhaps the most significant part of the update When you type in names it autocompletes for people who are the closest to you by social promixity sic  eg the people you share the most mutual friends with she writes on the sites DigitalBeat blog Facebook says the changes will be rolled out worldwide As of Friday at  am ET it appeared that not all pages had been updated

 CNN  Google plunged into the world of social networking on Tuesday melding pieces of Facebook and Twitter into a new feature Google Buzz Buzz which will work through the popular Gmail service will allow users to post status updates photos and links to members of their network  as well as pull in their activity on other sites like Twitter Flickr and Picasa Google spokesman Bradley Horowitz said the service which was rolling out to some Gmail users Tuesday afternoon and should be available to all in the next couple of days aims to weed out what he called the clutter of other networking sites With networking sites theres obviously value there he said Its a phenomenon thats real but its increasingly becoming harder and harder to make sense and find the signal in the noise By letting users post photos links and updates openly the tool would mimic Twitters microblogging format But users also will be able to make their content available to friends only more closely following the Facebook model At an event at the companys Mountain View California headquarters Google also seemed poised to take a poke at the AOL Instant Messenger service saying Buzz will be offered to companies as a tool for interoffice communication It will change the way businesses communicate around the world Horowitz said Despite the inevitable comparisons Google spokesmen said they didnt set out to tread on anyone elses turf We try not to pay too much attention to competitors Gmail product manager Todd Jackson said We try to listen to users Horowitz said Google Buzz will automatically make friends out of the people a user emails or chats with the most on Gmail See CNNmoneys report on reaction from some Google competitors Comments on posts will appear in real time And comments by other users will be weighted similar to how Googles search engine weighs results to collapse bad buzz and recommend the good buzz Jackson said The handsdown leader in the search engine world Google has been branching out on projects that include its Nexus One smartphone the companys first foray into hardware marketing Late last month Google announced that people could tweak their accounts to make results related to friends coworkers and other members of their social networks appear above all other results  The Social Search feature was introduced to a limited number of Google users last year and was made available to everyone in beta status on January  The change came with a hint of more things to come This is just a first step in our ongoing effort to ensure that Google Web search is always as social as the Web itself the company said in an instructional video posted to its official blog  Google Buzz probably wont be able to bring in status updates and other materials from Facebook for the same reason that Social Search doesnt  Because most Facebook users set their information to be viewed only by friends Googles search engine cant collect that information in the same way it can from Twitter and obviously Googleowned sites like YouTube Buzz also will have a mobile component operating on most major wireless operating systems with features that include voicerecognition posting and a GPSenabled ability to attach the users location to posts The Webbased mobile application which can be used by iPhones despite not going through Apples online store can also be set to pick up posts to Buzz being made near the users location Changes to the tool could be coming quickly too Google officials say theyre already studying possible expansions They include allowing Buzz updates by phone letting users post to their Twitter account through the tool and linking Buzz with the stillemerging Google Wave system Were just getting started Horowitz said Were not launching this today because we think were done We dont think thats how a product like this is built

 CNN  Before the explosion of social media Ken Altshuler a divorce lawyer in Maine dug up dirt on his clients spouses the oldfashioned way with private investigators and subpoenas Now the first place his team checks for evidence is Facebook Consider a recent story of a female client in her s who came to Altshuler seeking a divorce from husband She claimed her husband an alcoholic was drinking again The husband denied it It was her word against his word Altshuler says until a mutual friend of the couple stumbled across Facebook photos of the husband drinking beer at a party a few weeks earlier It was the kind of gotcha moment Altshuler knew would undermine the husbands credibility in court His firm presented the photos to the judge and the wife won the case in April he said Facebook is a great source of evidence Altshuler said Its absolutely solid evidence because hes the author of it How do you deny that you put that on Social media stalking skills have become invaluable to the legal world for divorce cases in particular Online photo albums profile pages wall comments status updates and tweets have become gold mines for evidence and leads Today divorce and family law firms routinely cull information posted on social media sites  the flirty exchanges with a paramour unsavory selfrevelations and compromising photographs  to buttress their case Posting hugging and kissing photos online can show a happily married relationship or it can expose a secretive affair At least  percent of attorneys surveyed by the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers cited a growth in the number of cases that used social media over the last five years The study was released earlier this year Divorce attorneys say social media sites have opened windows for infidelity because its become easier to rekindle romance with an old flame or flirt with a stranger And the posted shared and tagged evidence of infidelity is precisely the type of evidence attorneys look for online  You need to familiarize yourself with privacy settings to ensure there is no way personal information can be accessed said Adam Ostrow editor in chief of Mashablecom a social media guide  Facebook  where attorneys find most of the evidence and leads  has gradually relaxed privacy settings over the last year Attorneys say that enabled some members  personal details to be leaked without the user realizing it attorneys say On May th Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged the problem and in a blog announced new tools making it easier for users to tighten privacy settings and block outside parties from seeing personal information Its becoming all but impossible to protect your information unless you spend hours and hours figuring it out said Lee Rosen a divorce attorney in North Carolina who added he reaped the benefits of the tricky privacy controls in a recent case  Rosen was investigating a North Carolina husband in his s accused of cheating on his wife The husband failed to set privacy controls on his Facebook wall an area where users can post information Rosen noticed a suspicious message from the husbands younger female coworker The post was the hunch he needed to steer him in right direction Rosen reports about a quarter of his divorce cases use information found on social media sites 
Its becoming all but impossible to protect your information unless you spend hours and hours figuring it outLee Rosen North Carolina divorce attorney

Finding the Facebook profiles is so simple that Rosen says anyone could do it He goes to a site called Flowtowncom a site intended for marketers but is useful for attorneys too Type an email address and the site generates various social media profiles If that fails Rosen hires a private investigator At National Digital Forensics Inc a North Carolina company that mines digital sites for information requests for social media searches from divorce lawyers have surged says president and senior digital investigator Giovanni Masucci The social media detective work requires different snooping skills he says For example someone may be cheating but they are married Masucci explained If their status on the web page says single thats a major red flag Masucci estimated about half the social media cases they investigate expose some kind of cheating The happy reality for divorce attorneys is that most clients are bound to be on Facebook or another social media site Facebook is more popular than ever drawing in  million users the company reports on its website Each user creates an average of  pieces of content monthly and has an average of  friends  The most common way to gather information on Facebook relies on the battling couples mutual online friends who still have access to the spouses profile Many times the spouse will defriend a partner but forget about their shared friends who can play detective and access information on their profile  Another way of exposing damaging information is searching the profiles of the suspected other man or other woman says says Marlene Eskind Moses a divorce attorney in Tennessee Its amazing how people tell their life stories said Moses who represented a Tennessee woman who believed her husband was cheating on her After the wife found herself blocked from her husbands Facebook page she found the profile page of the other woman whom she suspected in the affair On that womans profile page a public album of photos taken on a romantic getaway appeared Scenic shots of South Carolinas mountains Her husband and another woman embracing in front of an art gallery Portraits of the couple with their faces nuzzled close together Elizabeth K Englander professor of psychology at Bridgewater State College in Massachusetts says people divulge information on social media because they believe no one will ever see the information they post The sense online is sort of like the mob effect Englander said You feel like youre one in a million and so who will ever notice you But when someone does notice thats when some divorce attorneys pounce Information copied from social media sites can sway the outcome of alimony payment disputes and custody fights attorneys say Some parents have even lost a child because of the behavior they exhibited online the lawyers say The ultimate goal after all is to catch a spouse in a lie Sometimes its a wife claiming she cant afford child support payments but subsequently purchased expensive jewelry and posted photos of the items on Facebook Or if a husband who claims he doesnt have anger problems while his social media profile is loaded with expletives Once there is evidence of a person caught in an obvious lie attorneys say it undermines the rest of their credibility with the judge Attorneys advise users of Facebook and other social media who are headed toward a divorce or custody battle to edit their profiles be cautious about updating statuses and double check to see who is really a friend Or to make things easier  at least until the trial is over or a settlement is reached  just get off Facebook completely

Editors note Nicholas Carlson is editor of the blog Silicon Alley Insider which covers business and technology in Silicon Valley California  CNN   Millions of Facebook addicts worldwide worry that someday soon theyll have to pay to use the site If you go to Facebookcom and search for the terms Facebook free or Facebook charge youll find hundreds of groups with names like If  Million People Join Before th July  Facebook Will Stay Free or If Facebook Charges A Fee We Will Discontinue Using It Some of these groups have dozens of users others have thousands During a recent press conference Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said while Facebook users do care about privacy the question of whether or not Facebook will eventually charge for its service is actually a much bigger concern among the sites  million users But are these fears justified No Facebook will never charge you to be a member and use the site Dont take it from me Heres Facebook spokesman Larry Yu on the issue We have absolutely no plans to charge for the basic service of using Facebook He continues Last year we saw a similar rumor circulating that Facebook was going to begin charging  to use the site but this year were hearing that fee increased to  with the spread of this rumor We look forward to hearing what Facebook might be rumored to cost for use next year If you press Facebook employees on this they will tell you the reason they will never charge for access is that putting up a paywall runs counter to the companys mission to make the world more open and connected But even if you dont buy that idealistic hoopla you should understand Facebook has a deep profit motive to never charge you for access Why Because Facebook makes its money bringing together as big of an audience as possible and then selling that audiences attention to advertisers Its a business that works Facebook should bring in as much as  billion in revenue this year Thats more than twice as much as Facebook brought in last year If Facebook started charging users its membership would start shrinking fast  and so would its revenues So while Facebook may charge you for certain bonus features such as gifts for your friends or credits to play games like Farmville it will never charge for basic access to the site Why then do people worry Facebook might start charging soon Probably because Facebook users feel like theyre getting something valuable for free and everybody knows theres no such thing as a free lunch Just remember The fact that you keep coming back to Facebook makes it easier for Facebook to sell more ads  and make more money  Your lunch isnt free its sponsoredCopyright   Business Insider

 Facebooks paternalistic attitudes arent empoweringBy danah boyd Special to CNN  Filed under Social Media   Facebooks new privacy model is a start but the site needs to listen not condescend to its users STORY HIGHLIGHTS Facebooks data says what people do but little about why they do it  When people share info with Facebook they become vulnerable to Facebook   Do people really know who is included in their FriendsofFriends

Internet Privacy

Editors Note danah boyd is a social media researcher at Microsoft Research New England and a fellow at Harvard Universitys Berkman Center for Internet and Society She recently completed her PhD on social media youth practices and other intersections between technology and society   CNN   Facebooks privacy problems have been in the news  again  Although complaints may have started deep in the blogosphere even Time Magazine has made them its cover story  In response Facebook announced a new privacy model to address complaints that its too darn hard to actually navigate privacy settings on Facebook Well duh Its not yet clear whether Facebooks changes will satiate the Facebook citizenry let alone the rabid critics but the conversations about privacy settings tend to emphasize only a fraction of the core concerns  Facebook rightfully believes that its important to give users control over their settings to empower them to make decisions about whats accessible But Facebook can also be condescending suggesting that they know whats best for their users because they have so much data about them which they do  Unfortunately Facebooks data tells them a lot about what people do but little about why they do it They know that people arent quitting Facebook but that doesnt mean that users arent frustrated or concerned or would be if they understood what was happening Dont get me wrong  the privacy settings are confounding even for the most experienced digerati and Im very glad that theyre addressing this fundamental issue  But in doing so I hope that they realize that the main reason for so much public outrage goes beyond privacy settings The issue is fundamentally about trust and informed consent When people share information with Facebook they become vulnerable to Facebook They trust Facebook to respect their interests Facebook has the power to expose people in ways that make their lives really miserable  Because of that power its crucial that they stop telling users whats best for them and start engaging in a more meaningful dialogue  Changing things and then forcing users to opt out is manipulative Instead they should be seeking informed consent  actively working with users to help make sure that they understand whats at stake in their choices  It is unacceptable for a company like Facebook to trick people into consenting to make their data more visible than they might think that it is  People should be able to understand Facebooks changes and have choices available that allow them to make appropriate decisions When Facebook changed its privacy settings in December far too many people clicked on through without realizing that a few mouse clicks meant that they were exposing their status updates to the world Many people may know exactly how notprivate their Facebook profile or updates are But do they I recommend using ReclaimPrivacy to scan your privacy settings  Keep in mind that Everybody is more than the people searching for you on Facebook  this includes every company or individual who wants to use your information for any purpose  In many ways its more accessible than simply posting something on a public website and waiting for Google to find it And keep in mind that FriendsofFriends means more than the people that youd invite to a birthday party I talked with a young woman who vowed that shed never friend her mother she didnt realize that if she friended her aunt and her aunt friended her mother than FriendsofFriends included her mother Do people really know who is included in their FriendsofFriends Facebook doesnt just need to fix its privacy settings It needs to fix its attitude and repair its relationship with its users Facebook isnt just a space for users to share it is built on the backs of people and profits off of the data people entrust to them An abusive relationship is simply unacceptable  Facebook must go beyond paternalism and start empowering users to help guide the future of the service It starts with committing to an optin approach to changes and developing features that allow users to have complete transparency as to how their data is exposed to and used by third parties  It then requires innovating ways to actively engage participants Facebook built a platform for mass sharing but if it wants to change the world it must also develop mechanisms for informed participation  With great power comes great responsibility

 CNN  Facebook ads are guessing whether users are gay and targeting a broad range of products to them based on the answer according to a research study making the rounds on the internet Thursday The research by the Microsoft Institute and the Max Planck Institute in Germany has some critics saying that by pushing ads toward those users and then registering whether they respond the system could inadvertently be outing some users on the site Facebook meanwhile questions the research and says any ad that makes assumptions about a users sexual orientation is violating the sites rules For the study researchers set up six fake Facebook accounts Two were for males who had listed that they are interested in females two were for females interested in males and one each was created for a man and women interested in the same sex Otherwise the profile information was identical All were listed as  years old and all listed Washington DC as their home The report says that there was a measurable difference in the sorts of ads that appeared on the home pages of the accounts About half of the ads targeted specifically to the gay male account were for gay nightclubs and other offers specifically referencing gender orientation But significantly they say half were not As an example they cite an ad for a nursing program at a Florida college that appeared for the gay male account but none of the others The supposed lesbian account also had targeted ads that didnt appear for the straight female accounts but not as many The danger with such ads unlike the gay bar ad where the target demographic is blatantly obvious is that the user reading the ad text would have no idea that by clicking it he would reveal to the advertiser both his sexual preference and a unique identifier cookie IP address or email address if he signs up on the advertisers site the researchers wrote That possibility had online commentators speculating that Facebooks algorithm could in effect out users to advertisers Coming on the heels of revelations that Facebook leaked user information to advertisers through thirdparty apps this latest snafu underscores how nearly impossible it is for Facebook to both profit from your personal information and to guarantee it will never be shared without your permission blogger Adrian Chen wrote on Gawkers Valleywag tech blog The collection of such information especially when tied to something as sensitive as sexual preference could spell disaster for a user who thinks hes being fastidious when keeping his profile private wrote Jacqui Cheng on tech blog Ars Technica a CNNcom content partner But Facebook said any advertiser that charts how a user responds to ads for future advertising use is breaking the rules We explicitly prohibit them from associating that targeting detail with the data collected from the user in forms they fill out applications they make or other interactions on their site Facebook spokesman Andrew Noyes said He also said that Facebook requires targeted ads to be directly related to the information they relied upon for targeting so theoretically the ads for gay bars would be allowed while the nursingschool ad would not We take the privacy of our users very seriously and take action when violations of these policies come to our attention Noyes said Its worth noting that the study reported Wednesday by privacy and security blogger Christopher Soghoian is hypothetical and based on the very small sample size of six accounts  Also illegal under Facebook rules Creating fake accounts

insanity in which we fire off missives into the internet ether we wish we could reverse Lets play telephone roulette Lets start with the most oldschool of communication devices  the phone  and a simple exercise  Take out your phone  Close your eyes  Scroll through your contacts  Open your eyes  Dial If youre now thinking to yourself Oh no Dont call THAT PERSON its time to clean out your phone

who fired you two years ago after you cussed her out and threw her impressive collection of desk toys against the wall in a fit of rage gets a surprise ringaling Hit undo on an email gone awry Youve just shared a bottle of wine  or four  with a couple of friends over which you discussed everyones various and sundry romantic woes Stumbling a bit you pour yourself and about a gallon of pinot into a cab where the cabbie  who is an aspiring novelist in the style of the evervenerable Bukowski  tells you that youll never fall in love in this city  Its a dark time and the hearts of young folks are even darker Feeling a bit more black and blue than usual you go to your computer thoughts of your notquiteplatonic best friend tumbling through your mind You open an email from said friend containing a link to a hilarious video featuring a bomb squad discovering a box of kittens ha and shoot off a reply I love you No Seriously Suddenly you sober up  what with all the expletives that are spewing from your mouth and the sweating  and stare at the computer in horror Well luckily for you Google  in typical Big Brother fashion  knew that you would do that and has a quick fix The Undo Button In the past the lesserknown Gmail feature only gave you  seconds to unemail but a few months ago the service extended that limit to  seconds To unlock this ability merely click the little green icon on the top right of your inbox which will take you to Google Labs  Find Enable Undo Send do so and choose the second option Now your BFF will never know unless of course youre slow on the draw  or you pass out before reversing the damage Remember After enabling it you still have to go up to settings to change the duration Still dont trust yourself Scroll down to the Mail Goggles app in Google Lab  during windows of time you assign say  to  am it asks you to complete a few simple math problems before you proceed with the emailing Its like a more helpful version of How many fingers am I holding up Take the social media sobriety test Its  am and you are a pathetic loser Youre tweeting incessantly about how your parents think youre a disappointment how you think youre in love with your intern and how that weird rash on your Oh and did we mention theres a halfempty bottle of vodka and a fully empty container of Mexican takeout in bed with you Yeah Times are tough Luckily for you you can actually prevent such sadsack behavior with a simple download Just last week web security company Webroot came out with a social media sobriety test Its basically a Firefox plugin that once installed will require you to pass a test like typing the alphabet backwards in order to access services like Twitter Facebook and MySpace between certain inebriated hours Now if only you could install said plugin on your fridge Did you really need to consume an entire block of cheese Take it back Ever decide to friend someone on Facebook because well it would be kind of funny You know your high school math teacher who always smelled vaguely of feet that fake Justin Bieber account your mom Well Facebook actually has a littleknown feature that allows you to take those friend requests back  you know after the hilarity dies down and you realize that since you didnt want to be friends with that kid who chewed incessantly on his jacket collar in middle school in middle school you certainly dont want to befriend the grownup version now Merely go to said weirdos profile and click on the little x next to Awaiting friend confirmation to take it back Of course Weird Wally will still get the requisite email alert that initially requested his friendship so the damage is not fully mitigated But well hes weird hes probably used to rejection right

 Mashable   Facebook Photos one of the social networks most popular features is getting a big and potentially controversial upgrade with a new feature that automatically suggests who users should tag in photos based on facial recognition technology The new feature Tag Suggestions will begin rolling out to US users next week according to Facebook Vice President of Product Chris Cox  He told us that the product utilizes technology that was built inhouse as well as some technology that came from partners Cox did not disclose the partners Facebook worked with for Tag Suggestions although we have our suspicions Tag Suggestions is fairly straightforward Whenever youre offered the chance to tag groups of your friends in an album Facebook will utilize its facial recognition technology to group similar faces together and automatically suggest the friend you should tag them with  Facebook fills in the Who is this box with its suggestion  all you have to do is click the Save Tags button to accept Cox says that suggestions will only appear when its algorithms have high confidence of whos being suggested Unlike Facecom Facebook doesnt reveal its certainty level and wouldnt reveal what percentage actually correlates to high confidence The social giant is also preemptively addressing the potential privacy issues that will be brought up from automatic algorithmic tagging Users can opt out of Tag Suggestions by going to their privacy settings and disabling the Suggest photos of me to friends feature This release is part of a bigger effort to upgrade Photos Earlier this year Facebook launched a slew of upgrades including bigger thumbnails group tagging and draganddrop photos This may be the biggest upgrade for Photos yet though Photo tagging is considered a chore by many users yet it is the companys most popular product  Photos are by far the most engaging content Facebook has ever had Cox told us earlier today  By vastly simplifying the tagging process Facebook expects that its millions of users will tag more photos which will create millions of new engagement points and social connections making it that much more addicting  MASHABLEcom All rights reserved

 CNN  Spamming email is so last year Malicious coders and allout cybercrooks will target newer and hipper forms of digital communication in  according to a report released Wednesday by McAfee the computer security company Noting a significant decrease in the total volume of spam messages sent to email the companys annual Threat Predictions report says attacks on instant messaging services Facebook Foursquare URL shorteners smartphones like the iPhone and even longprotected Apple operating systems will increase in the coming year The changes are driven by how people use tech the report says As email starts to die so do emailtargeted scams This year ended with some of the lowest global email spam levels in years as more and more users transition from slower legacy communications such as email in favor of more immediate methods such as instant messaging and Twitter the report says This shift will completely alter the threat landscape in  McAfees report is based on data collected in  and is simply a list of fearless predictions for whats to come in the realm of cyberattacks Its also worth noting that the company sells antivirus software so it has an incentive to make the digital world sound frightening  With those caveats in mind heres a quick look at some of the types of threats it highlights Location services Foursquare Gowalla and Facebook Places  which let mobile phone users alert their friends to their current whereabouts  pose an increasing security threat the report says Locationtagged Twitter posts are also a worry Use Bings mapping functionality for example and plot all the GPSenabled tweets in an area It is easy to correlate these by topic or area of interest In just a few clicks cyber criminals can see in real time who is tweeting and where what they are saying what their interests are and the operating systems and applications they are using McAfee says It then becomes childs play to craft a targeted attack based upon what the bad guys have just learned from these services Social media This is kind of a nobrainer If criminals know lots of stuff about you from social media posts and profiles they can use that information to try to trick you into trusting potential scammers Security geeks call this spear phishing Social media connections will eventually replace email as the primary vector for distributing malicious code and links the report says URL shorteners These sites  like bitly isgd and tinyurlcom  take long internet addresses and shorten them so that they are easier to send via email text or Twitter But with convenience comes risk the report says The trouble  and abuse  follows because users do not know where these shortened links actually lead until they click them This is a huge opportunity for abuse McAfee says Smartphones There havent been many cases of cyberattacks on smartphones But McAfee says thats about to change McAfee Labs predicts that  will be a turning point for threats to mobile devices the report says adding The widespread adoption of mobile devices into business environments combined with these and other attacks is likely to bring about the explosion weve long anticipated Apple operating systems If you know an Applehead youve probably heard him or her say something to this effect My Mac NEVER gets bugs or viruses Ahem That may change soon says McAfee The popularity of iPads and iPhones in business environments and the easy portability of malicious code between them could put many users and businesses at risk next year and beyond the report says The lack of user understanding regarding exposure on these platforms and the lack of deployed security solutions make a fertile landscape for cyber criminals McAfee Labs expects to see botnets and Trojans types of cyber attacks and viruses move from a rare encounter to a more common occurrence on Apple platforms in  Hacktivism Hacktivists are internet activists who shut down websites and cause other digital trouble to make a political point The most recent highprofile example of this was the WikiLeaks saga when hacktivists shut down creditcard websites as a show of support for that documentleaking website Hacktivism is at least a decade old But it will continue to be prevalent in  McAfee says partly because of the attention WikiLeaks has drawn to the activity

CNNUpdated  AM ET Tue September   Chat with us in Facebook Messenger Find out whats happening in the world as it unfoldsProviding free music to more than  million people seems like a nobrainer Story highlightsFacebook is partnering with top music services Spotify MOG and RdioFree music services have been among the fastestgrowing on the webBiggest roadblock to Facebook Music wont be users itll be record companiesFacebook will launch a music service later this month according to recent news coverage  Details on the new platform are scarce but Ben Parr at Mashable reports that Facebook is partnering with top music services Spotify MOG and Rdio to let users stream music on FacebookcomFor the uninitiated Spotify is a service that lets you listen to virtually any song for free on your desktop with an occasional but infrequent ad  Users can pay a small fee to remove the ads or use the service on their phonesThats right  Facebook may be about to unleash unlimited free music to all its users  Music is enjoyed almost universally and free music services have been among the fastestgrowing on the web  Napster to name but one  Providing free music to more than  million people assuming Facebook Music launches globally  seems like a nobrainer Why wouldnt everyone in the world want to listen to and share free music with friends  This is the web equivalent of giving away free ice creamAnd yetIve been wrong on Facebook so many times beforeSimply putting a product in front of millions of people is no guarantee of success Pete Cashmore says I was wrong on Facebook Places the social networks challenger to locationbased startups  Its inevitable that Facebook will surpass Foursquare in the checkins race I declared more than a year ago  While I cant verify that Facebook Places didnt surpass Foursquare in terms of the checkins it provided Facebook no longer feels that its viable as a standalone product These location features are being merged into status updates and brand pages the company announced recently I was wrong too about Facebook Deals  In my predictions for  I saw the service as a potential rival to market leader Groupon  After all how could you provide

CNNUpdated  AM ET Tue September   Chat with us in Facebook Messenger Find out whats happening in the world as it unfoldsProviding free music to more than  million people seems like a nobrainer Story highlightsFacebook is partnering with top music services Spotify MOG and RdioFree music services have been among the fastestgrowing on the webBiggest roadblock to Facebook Music wont be users itll be record companiesFacebook will launch a music service later this month according to recent news coverage  Details on the new platform are scarce but Ben Parr at Mashable reports that Facebook is partnering with top music services Spotify MOG and Rdio to let users stream music on FacebookcomFor the uninitiated Spotify is a service that lets you listen to virtually any song for free on your desktop with an occasional but infrequent ad  Users can pay a small fee to remove the ads or use the service on their phonesThats right  Facebook may be about to unleash unlimited free music to all its users  Music is enjoyed almost universally and free music services have been among the fastestgrowing on the web  Napster to name but one  Providing free music to more than  million people assuming Facebook Music launches globally  seems like a nobrainer Why wouldnt everyone in the world want to listen to and share free music with friends  This is the web equivalent of giving away free ice creamAnd yetIve been wrong on Facebook so many times beforeSimply putting a product in front of millions of people is no guarantee of success Pete Cashmore says I was wrong on Facebook Places the social networks challenger to locationbased startups  Its inevitable that Facebook will surpass Foursquare in the checkins race I declared more than a year ago  While I cant verify that Facebook Places didnt surpass Foursquare in terms of the checkins it provided Facebook no longer feels that its viable as a standalone product These location features are being merged into status updates and brand pages the company announced recently I was wrong too about Facebook Deals  In my predictions for  I saw the service as a potential rival to market leader Groupon  After all how could you provide a  off coupon for a local business and not have a small percentage of Facebooks massive user base accept Wrong Facebook Deals is set to shut down in the coming weeks with a few limited offers

memories hide the inconsequential ones and lingering awhile on the most bittersweet of moments  And youll realize as I did that Facebook knows you better than you know yourselfThrough this process youll realize that Facebook Timeline is much more than a way to post the minutiae of your existence While a typical social networking profile might highlight what you ate this morning or what time you

CNNUpdated  AM ET Tue September   Chat with us in Facebook Messenger Find out whats happening in the world as it unfoldsMark Zuckerberg unveils a new version of the Facebook profile page called TimelineStory highlightsFacebook is about to completely change the way its profile pages look Cashmore I thrive on new things but this change was radical even for meYour profile will become a scrapbook documenting your entire life all the way back to birthFacebook users mark my words Youll revolt when the site rolls out its new features in the coming weeks  Facebook is about to completely change the way its profile pages look as part of the websites biggest redesign so far and only a fraction of the websites  million users seem to have the slightest clueIm not talking about the new realtime Ticker at the top right of your Facebook profile Im not even talking about the Top Stories that now appear at the top of your Facebook news feed  those are tiny insignificant changes compared to whats just around the cornerBut boy did some people react badly to even those minuscule improvements Among my Facebook friends more than half said they disliked the changes and some threatened to quit Of course they did no such thing How will they react when Facebook throws away the old profiles and replaces them with something completely newIf you use Facebook chances are youre unaware of the major changes that are slated to begin rolling out by the end of this month full disclosure Mashable is one of several news organizations partnering with Facebook on a social news app Only geeks like me are obsessed enough to have watched Facebooks minute announcement of the new profile pages last week Users will eventually realize that Facebook has unleashed something remarkable Pete Cashmore saysAnd an even smaller percentage of Facebook users have discovered like I did that you can enable the new Facebook Timeline profile page right now so youre prepared for the launchSo whats the big change Facebook will be switching profile pages perhaps optionally at first to a new format called Facebook Timeline  I switched my profile over last week and boy was it a shock  I immediately wanted to switch it back to the old format Im someone who thrives on trying new things but this change was radical even for me Yet I could find no way to switch my profile back so I stuck with it for a few days  Im so glad I did Facebook Timeline is the best change Facebook has ever made  JUST WATCHEDFacebook unveils Timeline featureReplayMore Videos MUST WATCHFacebook unveils Timeline feature Heres whatll happen once the Timeline profiles are launched Your Facebook profile will go from having one central column to two with boxes of text photos videos and even maps of your favorite locations Rather than just displaying your most recent activities your profile will become a scrapbook documenting your entire life all the way back to your birth Facebook will become a record of your existence All  your memories your victories and your defeats your loves your losses and everything in betweenJUST WATCHEDFacebook apps go beyond like featureReplayMore Videos MUST WATCHFacebook apps go beyond like feature Youll be shocked as I was when this change is made Suddenly your life is laid out before you the highs and lows somehow pinpointed by Facebooks algorithms Youll wonder why the status update box is so tiny now and where all your most recent updates went  Youll add a big new Cover photo to your page and waste a few hours preening your Timeline choosing to feature your happiest memories hide the inconsequential ones and lingering awhile on the most bittersweet of moments  And youll realize as I did that Facebook knows you better than you know yourselfThrough this process youll realize that Facebook Timeline is much more than a way to post the minutiae of your existence While a typical social networking profile might highlight what you ate this morning or what time you left for work or where you had lunch Facebook Timeline takes these thousands of seemingly inconsequential events discards the irrelevant ones finds the most emotive the most visual the most striking and emotionally touching moments and pulls them into sharp focus  Much like our memories Facebook Timeline understands that some moments have resonance that lasts through the years Its a marvel of computer programming An algorithm that comes eerily close to emulating human memory perhaps the first algorithm to spark such a deep emotional responseSo yes you will hate the new Facebook profile when it launches in the coming weeks Then like me youll realize that Facebook has unleashed something so remarkable that you didnt even recognize it at first A meaningful social network And like any other groundbreaking technology  the PC the smartphone the iPad  youll wonder why life wasnt always this way and how you got by without itPowered by LivefyreUSCrime  JusticeEnergy  EnvironmentExtreme

CNNUpdated  AM ET Tue September   Chat with us in Facebook Messenger Find out whats happening in the world as it unfoldsMark Zuckerberg unveils a new version of the Facebook profile page called TimelineStory highlightsFacebook is about to completely change the way its profile pages look Cashmore I thrive on new things but this change was radical even for meYour profile will become a scrapbook documenting your entire life all the way back to birthFacebook users mark my words Youll revolt when the site rolls out its new features in the coming weeks  Facebook is about to completely change the way its profile pages look as part of the websites biggest redesign so far and only a fraction of the websites  million users seem to have the slightest clueIm not talking about the new realtime Ticker at the top right of your Facebook profile Im not even talking about the Top Stories that now appear at the top of your Facebook news feed  those are tiny insignificant changes compared to whats just around the cornerBut boy did some people react badly to even those minuscule improvements Among my Facebook friends more than half said they disliked the changes and some threatened to quit Of course they did no such thing How will they react when Facebook throws away the old profiles and replaces them with something completely newIf you use Facebook chances are youre unaware of the major changes that are slated to begin rolling out by the end of this month full disclosure Mashable is one of several news organizations partnering with Facebook on a social news app Only geeks like me are obsessed enough to have watched Facebooks minute announcement of the new profile pages last week Users will eventually realize that Facebook has unleashed something remarkable Pete Cashmore saysAnd an even smaller percentage of Facebook users have discovered like I did that you can enable the new Facebook Timeline profile page right now so youre prepared for the launchSo whats the big change Facebook will be switching profile pages perhaps optionally at first to a new format called Facebook Timeline  I switched my profile over last week and boy was it a shock  I immediately wanted to switch it back to the old format Im someone who thrives on trying new things but this change was radical even for me Yet I could find no way to switch my profile back so I stuck with it for a few days  Im so glad I did Facebook Timeline is the best change Facebook has ever made  JUST WATCHEDFacebook unveils Timeline featureReplayMore Videos MUST WATCHFacebook unveils Timeline feature Heres whatll happen once the Timeline profiles are launched Your Facebook profile will go from having one central column to two with boxes of text photos videos and even maps of your favorite locations Rather than just displaying your most recent activities your profile will become a scrapbook documenting your entire life all the way back to your birth Facebook will become a record of your existence All  your memories your victories and your defeats your loves your losses and everything in betweenJUST WATCHEDFacebook apps go beyond like featureReplayMore Videos MUST WATCHFacebook apps go beyond like feature Youll be shocked as I was when this change is made Suddenly your life is laid out before you the highs and lows somehow pinpointed by Facebooks algorithms Youll wonder why the status update box is so tiny now and where all your most recent updates went  Youll add a big new Cover photo to your page and waste a few hours preening your Timeline choosing to feature your happiest memories hide the inconsequential ones and lingering awhile on the most bittersweet of moments  And youll realize as I did that Facebook knows you better than you know yourselfThrough this process youll realize that Facebook Timeline is much more than a way to post the minutiae of your existence While a typical social networking profile might highlight what you ate this morning or what time you left for work or where you had lunch Facebook Timeline takes these thousands of seemingly inconsequential events discards the irrelevant ones finds the most emotive the most visual the most striking and emotionally touching moments and pulls them into sharp focus  Much like our memories Facebook Timeline understands that some moments have resonance that lasts through the years Its a marvel of computer programming An algorithm that comes eerily close to emulating human memory perhaps the first algorithm to spark such a deep emotional responseSo yes you will hate the new Facebook profile when it launches in the coming weeks Then like me youll realize that Facebook has unleashed something so remarkable that you didnt even recognize it at first A meaningful social network And like any other groundbreaking technology  the PC the smartphone the iPad  youll wonder why life wasnt always this way and how you got by without itPowered by LivefyreUSCrime  JusticeEnergy  EnvironmentExtreme

online security fearsStory highlightsTake This Lollipop mines Facebook fears to make a short horror videoIn the viral clip a creepy crazed guy peers at your Facebook profileCreator Jason Zada says it shows how online privacy is deadAs Halloween nears more than  million people have shared the videoA sweaty wildeyed man in a stained undershirt hunches over his computer in a shadowy basement Hes broken into your Facebook account and is reading your posts as his dirty cracked fingernails paw at the keyboardRage jealousy hate builds as he flips through your photos and scrolls through your list of friends He rocks back and forth growing more agitated as the pages flash past Then he consults a map of your city and heads to his car So why  oh why  did you include so much personal information  and your address  in your profileIf that all sounds like the stuff of a digitalera horror movie youre not far offTake This Lollipop is an interactive short video thats been making its way around the Web as Halloween approaches Visitors to the site are first presented with an image of a lollipop with a razor blade in it  dont take candy from strangers kids  and asked to grant access to their Facebook account Dont worry The application claims it uses your data only once then deletes it But the creepy results just might make you think twice about who else gets access to your online informationThe video uses the developer tool Facebook Connect and features actor Bill Oberst Jr whose credits range from The Secret Life of Bees to the inexplicably Oscarless Nude Nuns With Big Guns as the aforementioned grungy nutjobAs he stares at his computer its actual photos and other information from your page that hes scrolling through Note to parents If youre tagged in pictures of your kids be ready for those to pop up too It ups the ante on creepiness exponentiallyIn the weeks since the video went live viewers have begun sharing it with friends and asking them to videorecord

behind the viral Elf Yourself online campaign for OfficeMax told Porter Gale of Ad Age that hed been kicking around Halloween ideas and wanted to do something that messed with peopleHe said the clip is definitely meant to spur thought about how much information we share onlineOur privacy was dead a while back and will never be the same he said Life as a whole has changed If you look at the video the scariest part is that your information is in the video The piece is scary because a person is violating your privacy not because its bloody or theres anything jumping out As of Thursday morning

Thu November   Chat with us in Facebook Messenger Find out whats happening in the world as it unfoldsFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks in September The sites large user base makes it a hacker targetStory highlightsFacebook porn spam casts light on site as a target for hackersSecurity analyst says the site could do more to prevent attacksFacebook calls security a top concern has rolled out multiple prevention initiativesThe site also has sued spammers leading to millions in court penaltiesThe wave of pornographic and violent images that flooded Facebook over the past few days has drawn attention to a side of the social networking megasite most of its users dont think aboutFacebook is a coveted prize for hackersIts hard to put it into perspective as to how good a job theyre doing at preventing spam because they have a giant target on their back said Chester Wisniewski a senior analyst with security firm Sophos They have a giant target on their back with the user base they have Every spammers got a dream of catching themIn this weeks attack a hack that exploited security flaws in some Web browsers sent images of porn Photoshopped pictures of celebrities in compromising positions and images of intense violence to millions of users according to Facebook Users apparently were duped into copying malicious code into their browser windows helping the images spreadMany Facebook users were outraged by the fact that porn made its way onto the social network On one hand the offensive images call into question Facebooks ability to rein in spam as it becomes more popular On the other its a counterintuitive testament to Facebooks spamfighting abilities that users were surprised to see these nasty images showing up on the social networkIf this happened on email after all no one would blinkJUST WATCHEDFacebook apps go beyond like featureReplayMore Videos MUST WATCHFacebook apps go beyond like feature Less than  of the content shared on the Facebook is spam Facebook says Compare that with email where a whopping  of content is spam as CNN partner site Mashable reportsLess than  of the sites members experience spam on any given day Facebook said in October Meanwhile only  of its  billion logins per day are compromised the site says Of course thats still  so someone could shade that number to make it sound miniscule or huge depending on intentTo Wisnieswski the way Facebook responds to spam and other hacks is a mixed bag Generally he says theyre quick to jump on the big problems but slower on the daytoday stuffIf its malwarerelated  scams and spam and things like that  theyre pretty good about it he said Theyre very conscious about the fact that they dont want their users to be infectedBut with the survey scams and things they dont seem to be that effectiveFacebook of course is far more likely to agree with the former point than the latterSpokesman Andrew Noyes says that on a site under virtually constant attack the Facebook team is constantly working to protect its usersWe believe the security fight requires a multipronged approach he said In addition to our dedicated legal team Facebook also has security experts and engineers focused on the integrity of the site Were continuing to build systems to prevent and respond to spam attacks Our User Operations team also works around the clock to identify problems and assist those affectedNoyes said Facebooks security team has identified the hackers behind this weeks attack and are working with our legal team to ensure appropriate consequences followIn recent months the site has launched several public tools and initiatives trying to stay ahead of the inevitable attacksLast month Facebook announced two tools its testing Trusted Friends and App Passwords  Trusted Friends would help users get back into their account if their password is changed without their knowledge App Passwords would add a layer of security when users approve thirdparty appsThis summer Facebook launched a Bug Bounty program that pays people for reporting security problems and a suite of security tools rolled out in May includes clickjacking protection and remote logins In January users got the ability to surf Facebook with a secure browser settingWe work regularly with analysts engineers fraud experts and security investigators to prevent abuse defeat criminals and help maintain Facebook as a trusted environment Noyes said in an emailIn fact there are some builtin advantages to the way Facebook works that help keep the level of spam lower than with email a relative Wild West for spammers and scammersAs he pondered upcoming changes to Facebook messaging last year Craigslist founder Craig Newmark noted in a blog post that the sites requirements for creating an account helpThe deal is that a Facebook identity profile pretty much ensures that theres a real person behind it Newmark wrote Its possible to fake a Facebook identity but its a fair amount of work way more expensive than getting a new Gmail or Hotmail accountWhile acknowledging those efforts Wisnewski says there are still some holes in Facebooks security gameA major one he says is the Facebook app development process Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has publicly celebrated the millions of thirdparty app developers registered with the site But that means there are millions of people who get expanded access to Facebook data just for paying a nominal fee Because Facebook doesnt verify anything about you or have any human review process at all  we see these guys create hundreds of developer accounts for the same scam he saidWisnewski also wishes Facebook would add additional layers of security every time users start up an app If they really want to get a grip on this there are a few things they could do  but the things they could do by Zuckerbergs worldview would slow down innovationAll that said Facebook has a track record of aggressively going after scammers and spammers once theyre caughtIn August selfproclaimed Spam King Sanford Wallace was indicted in a California court Two years ago Facebook sued him and a federal court ordered him to pay  million Previously Facebook won a  million judgment against spammer Philip Porembski and in  was awarded the largest award ever under federal antispam laws   million  after suing Adam Guerbuez and Atlantis Blue Capital for sending
