Total revenue from print and digital books in the trade category, which excludes textbooks and journals, declined 2% to $14.6 billion. The figures are based on how much publishers collected, not how much retailers charged and consumers paid, but they still give a snapshot into trends in the business.If growth has stalled at just 21% of total dollar sales for ebooks, where Amazon has the strongest position, the online retailer may have less leverage in negotiations with publishers than most in the industry once expected -- or feared. Another beneficiary could be Barnes & Noble (BKS), which announced plans this week to spin-off its Nook ebook unit.U.S. publishers collected $3 billion in revenue from ebook sales growth last year.MoreThe slowdown, after years of exponential growth, could help explain why major publisher Hachette, owned by French media company Lagardere, has been holding out against Amazon, according to Robert Picard, director of research at the University of Oxford's Reuters Institute and an expert on media economics."The conflict is a result of the maturation of online book sales distribution and publishers’ starting to find effective ways to directly distribute themselves or in cooperation with other publishers," he says. "Some, like Hachette, are now willing to challenge Amazon."But before publishers get too giddy, they should consider another way to look at last year's sales. In 2013, for the first time, publishers’ revenue from online sales of all kinds, at $7.5 billion, exceeded sales from physical locations, which totaled $7.1 billion, Bookstats reported. Splitting the market that way, Amazon is far in the lead and still gaining.Which, in turn, may help explain why Amazon is adopting the tough tactics against Hachette that are used more commonly by physical retailers. Amazon has reduced its inventory of the publisher's books, creating shipping delays for customers, and has cut discounts and yanked pre-orders for upcoming titles.The end result of the talks will likely spill over into future negotiations with Penguin Random House, owned by German media giant Bertelsmann, CBS’s (CBS) Simon & Schuster unit, News Corp’s (NWSA) HarperCollins, and Macmillan, which is owned by German publisher Georg von Holtzbrinck.Anomalies in the dataThere also may be anomalies in the data showing the supposed ebook slowdown. The industry reports have never made much headway in tracking sales of self-published works but two additional factors appear to have skewed ebook revenue last year. One was the court-ordered price cuts that followed publishers' settling price fixing charges in the fall of 2012. The other was the lack of a so-called “Young Adult” super blockbuster like "The Hunger Games" or an ebook phenom, such as the “I don’t want you to know I’m reading this” "Fifty Shares of Grey" trilogy.While total ebook revenue was unchanged, the number of ebooks sold rose 10% to 513 million. That represented 22.1% of all trade books sold last year, up from 19.7% in 2012. With higher volume and flat revenue, the average amount publishers received per ebook declined to $5.93 from $6.57 last year (again, that’s not how much consumers paid but how much publishers collected from retailers). So ebooks are still growing and taking a greater share of the total marketplace. But, thanks to antitrust regulators busting artificially high ebook prices, revenue was down.Story continuesThe changing composition of best sellers also may have hurt ebook sales last year. The final volume of Suzanne Collins’ "Hunger Games" trilogy came out in 2012, prompting sales of some 28 million books in the series that year. Many consumers older than young adult bought the books, and they tend to prefer the ebook format for the YA genre, helping push ebooks to almost 50% of unit sales for "Hunger Games."And the "Fifty Shades" trilogy sold 30 million copies in the United States in 2012, also with a much higher than typical proportion of those sales in the ebook format. Half of the publisher’s revenue from the trilogy came on ebooks versus 20% for most titles. Adjust both trilogies' 2012 ebook sales to a more typical ratio and 2013’s ebook sales suddenly look a whole lot better, with unit sales increasing about 15%. Revenue growth would also improve, although that is more difficult to estimate.And looking beyond the publishers' association data, other surveys show interest in ebooks continuing to mount. A January survey from the Pew Research Internet Project found that 28% of U.S. adults read an ebook in the past year, up from 23% in the 2012 survey and 17% in 2011. And 32% of adults said they owned a dedicated e-reader, up from 24% last year and 19% in 2012. As negotiations between Amazon and Hachette drag on, the battle may turn on which side's data proves the strongest.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextMueller Report Book Editions Shoot to Top of Best-Seller Lists at Amazon, Barnes & NobleVarietyThreats, Bullying and Misinformation: Inside Spotify's Battle With SongwritersRolling StoneZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance1 Big Reason Why Disney Stock Is Just Getting StartedMotley FoolAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceWhy it's so hard for some Americans to get high-speed internetYahoo FinanceJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNWhy MedMen Could Be the Best Pot Stock in the U.S… or the WorstMotley FoolWhat's next for Trump following the Mueller Report?Yahoo Finance VideoSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBC57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatchWarren Buffett shares his keys to successYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceThis 1 Assumption Could Totally Destroy Your RetirementMotley Fool

The country's second-largest bookstore abandoned last-ditch attempts to save the business this week after few bidders stepped up.The nearly 400 Borders stores still open could start liquidating and selling off assets as soon as Friday. The plan is for all to be shutdown for good by September, leaving nearly 10,000 employees without jobs.There were many missteps that caused this business to fail from holding too much debt, opening too many stores as well as jumping into the e-reader business to late. But above all, there was one "disastrous move" that put the final nail in Borders' coffin, says retail expert Howard Davidowitz of Davidowitz & Associates."I think the biggest thing Borders did wrong is when they turned over their online business to Amazon," Davidowitz tells The Daily Ticker's Aaron Task and Breakout's Jeff Macke in the accompanying interview. "That move finished them off because they gave away the future."Speaking of future: Where does this leave the future of the U.S. bookstore and Barnes & Noble?With a $1 billion market cap, Barnes & Noble (BKS) faces an uphill battle against Amazon's (AMZN) massive $100 billion valuation. But Davidowitz is not willing to put the last big-box book chain down for the count just yet."I don't believe in inevitable things because I have seen a lot of great changes done in the retail business," he says, pointing to his favorite retailer Wal-Mart (WMT). Not only did Sam Walton change his business from a small variety store model to a discount retail chain, he grew his single Arkansas store into America's largest retailer and employer.Davidowitz is not giving up on the U.S. bookstore either."The retail business is a business of change," but there is still a room for the bookstore in the hearts and lives of many Americans who use them as a place for meetings, gatherings and to just hang out with friends. Davidowitz says the bookstore is going nowhere soon, but we can expect to see a lot fewer of them.As for the 10 million square feet of empty retail space, Davidowitz predicts the big multi-level stores will likely lay vacant for some time, which will put pressure on small developers and community banks in those areas.

Most of the smaller Borders' stores will be gobbled up by retailers that are currently thriving, like Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY), he says.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextHyundai hires former Ghosn ally Munoz as global COO, Americas headReutersHere's how long you'll live — and how much of that will be healthy yearsMarketWatchNatural Gas Price Prediction – Prices Tumble as Supplies IncreaseFX EmpireThe 5 Best Places to Retire in North CarolinaInvestopediaState defends South Dakota pipeline protest legislationAssociated PressZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceWhy it's so hard for some Americans to get high-speed internetYahoo FinanceJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNWhat's next for Trump following the Mueller Report?Yahoo Finance VideoSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBC57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphWarren Buffett shares his keys to successYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

REUTERS/Amazon.com/Handout via ReutersMoreIf you saw "Skyfall" — the latest James Bond installment — you likely marveled at the breathtaking opening scene in which 007 chases a bandit across the rooftops of Istanbul on a motorcycle. Filming it all was a remote-controlled helicopter resembling a weed-wacker with an overhead projector attached — the latest in aerial filming technology.But for now, such unmanned aerial-filming contraptions are effectively banned in the United States — the birthplace of the motion-picture industry — along with virtually all other commercial uses of unmanned aircraft, or drones. That’s because the U.S. government has stalled in its efforts to regulate and manage the use of drones, a breakthrough technology fostered largely by the U.S. military. As a result, nations including Europe and China are gaining an edge over the U.S. in yet another industry.Online retailing giant Amazon (AMZN) drew fresh attention to the commercial potential of drones recently, when CEO Jeff Bezos unveiled an unmanned “octocopter” that, theoretically, could deliver small packages to customers’ doorsteps — a service he dubbed PrimeAir. Amazon-watchers considered the move something of a publicity stunt meant to burnish Amazon’s reputation for customer service, and Bezos himself said it could be four or five years before such drones are actually flying.A behind-the-scenes glimpseBut a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the Federal Aviation Administration’s efforts to regulate drones suggests Amazon’s octocopters may never take off. “Nothing they’re contemplating right now fits with that vision,” says a source familiar with the FAA’s policy efforts. “I don’t see it happening.”The fortunes of Flying-Cam, the aerial filming company that worked on "Skyfall" and worked on movies including the "Harry Potter" and "Mission Impossible" franchises, illustrate the difficulty of fostering a commercial drone industry in the U.S. Flying-Cam, which has offices in Los Angeles, Brussels and Hong Kong, began using small remote-controlled aircraft outfitted with cameras in the 1980s. Such innovations earned company founder Emanuel Previnaire an Academy Award for technical achievement in 1995. But in 2011 Flying-Cam’s U.S. business was effectively grounded when the FAA notified the film industry that flying unmanned aerial systems (UAS) for commercial use was illegal until regulations were finalized.In 2007 the FAA had quietly clarified its position on what constitutes an aircraft, as non-military UAS were morphing from recreational playthings into genuine aircraft able to fly hundreds of miles, reach elevations above 10,000 feet and carry a sizable payload. This was a de facto ban on the commercial use of drones until the FAA came up with formal rules governing their use. Since many companies were unaware of the change, the FAA began to tell industry officials that the use of drones was not yet legal as it became aware they were using them.Virtually overnight, Flying-Cam and other companies in the same business were grounded in the U.S. “Everything has been shut down until they regulate it,” says Haik Gazarian, director of operations for Flying-Cam. “The most tragic part is, an industry that was shining in many ways has been reduced. We’re not able to do these sequences in the U.S. We have to take the whole thing outside.”Story continuesFlying-Cam laid off more than 30 workers and other companies doing the same type of work have gone bust. Flying-Cam is picking up more overseas business, meanwhile, largely because regulators in countries such as England, France and China have developed new rules that allow and even encourage the commercial use of drones. Flying-Cam recently shot aerial scenes for the forthcoming films "Transformers: Age of Extinction" in Hong Kong and "Smurfs II" in Paris, for instance. And the production for a Sony PlayStation advertisement was recently moved from L.A. to Budapest so the director could include such aerial shots.Directors are still free to commission manned helicopters for aerial filming, but unmanned systems have several advantages. Since they tend to be much smaller, they can penetrate tight spaces and fly far lower than big choppers that would disrupt a set with rotor wash and noise. Lower flying also allows drones to get more-intimate aerial shots with the background in sharper focus.A safer droneDrones are probably safer than manned helicopters, too, which is an unhappy irony of the de facto ban. They can take off, fly and land completely within the boundaries of a movie set, with no need for helipads or use of public airspace to transit to or from a shoot. Most smaller drones run on batteries, so there’s no flammable fuel on board if there’s a crash. And movie sets tend to have strict safety rules, including tight security governing who can enter.To be fair to the FAA, the proliferation of UAS does represent a bona fide safety issue and even a potential new avenue for terrorists hoping to attack U.S. targets. The rapid transformation of UAS is comparable to other manifestations of the digital revolution. GPS guidance systems have become cheap and ubiquitous, while advanced avionics are common enough to incorporate into affordable off-the-shelf UAS. Without new rules, virtually anybody could fly a drone wherever they wanted, for any reason. The FAA, in fact, believes there are still plenty of businesses using UAS beneath the radar, as it were, despite the ban.Following the 2007 policy clarification, the FAA said it would publish a draft regulation for small UAS — those weighing less than 55 pounds, such as the Flying-Cam machine — by late 2011. That would spell out the rules and make it legal to use them for those who complied. But FAA insiders say the draft was so restrictive — requiring small drones to have the same sort of airworthiness certification as large passenger-carrying planes, for instance, and UAS operators to have licenses and other credentials similar to those of commercial pilots — that the FAA never finalized the regulation.In 2012, Congress passed a law requiring the FAA to publish final regulations allowing certain commercial UAS use by Sept. 30, 2015. The agency says it will release draft rules next year, and it recently published its first annual "road map" laying out necessary steps. Congress also ordered the FAA to selectively approve certain UAS for use by energy firms off the Alaska coast, which the agency did this summer. Both types of UAS the FAA certified had already been approved for military use, an advantage Flying-Cam and most other companies hoping to use UAS — including Amazon — doesn't have. Law-enforcement organizations and other public agencies also receive permission from the FAA to fly UAS in the national airspace for surveillance and other purposes.The FAA has also drawn several important distinctions between different types of UAS. “Model” remote-controlled aircraft can be flown for recreational use pretty much without limits, although “guidance” from the FAA, dating to 1981, recommends they remain below 400 feet, stay clear of populated areas and full-scale aircraft, and aren’t used for business purposes. The FAA, however, is concerned some businesses will try to operate UAS by claiming they’re abiding by  guidance aimed at modelers.The agency anticipates many commercial uses once the regulatory framework is in place, including cargo delivery (as Amazon contemplates), private security, communication, news coverage, disaster response, and monitoring of power plants and other types of infrastructure, as well as aerial photography.There are a few other key distinctions the FAA must grapple with. The easiest UAS to regulate will be those flying within the line-of-sight of the operator on the ground, as most model aircraft do. Next are those flying beyond line-of-sight but still controlled in real time by a human. After that, the FAA will have to figure out what to do about fully autonomous UAS that are programmed to fly a specific route on their own, with the capability to identify and avoid problems.Flying-Cam’s aircraft are line-of-sight UAS that fly limited distances over the perimeter of a movie set or shooting locale. Amazon’s would have to be more advanced, since it would make no sense to launch an aircraft to deliver a package to a doorstep so close to the launch site. That would raise challenges the FAA hasn’t even begun to grapple with: UAS could crash near schools, malls or other populated areas, collide with other aircraft (including other UAS), run into powerlines or even bump into houses.There’s also the problem of “link loss,” which occurs when an interference disrupts the flow of data needed for a UAS to fly properly, essentially leaving the aircraft uncontrolled. When that happens, some UAS continue on the last heading they were directed to take, while others spin in circles or return to their starting point — usually without any eyes or ears allowing them to detect obstacles on their own. In August 2010, a U.S. Navy drone lost contact with its controllers while flying over southern Maryland, and nearly penetrated restricted airspace near the U.S. Capitol before the link was reestablished and the plane turned around.Gazarian and many other businesspeople have met with the FAA and pressed their case for the limited use of commercial UAS. So far, nothing. “We can’t even handle the simpler cases,” says a frustrated FAA official. “This is taking ridiculously long. We’re hurting a lot of industries.” Bezos may think he can make the federal bureaucracy move faster, just as he has revolutionized package delivery at Amazon. If he pulls that off, he may edge James Bond aside in the pantheon of heroes.Rick Newman’s latest book is  Rebounders: How Winners Pivot From Setback To Success. Email him at Newmanomics@yahoo.com.

Bezos explained the growth narrative tied to Amazon’s e-commerce channels, AWS, future expansion into new areas through an iterative approach, and efforts to make smart bets to remain innovative, but also the willingness to lose money if in the event an experiment doesn’t work.The founder of Amazon has managed to keep an innovative culture going while they continue to disrupt e-commerce. Bezos anticipates that Amazon can continue to grow its e-commerce footprint in various markets outside the United States where there has been minimal market penetration of e-commerce in general.Amazon stock is hovering just under $1T and remains stuck in a tight range. Earnings could catalyze the stock near-term, but what remains important is the visionary stature of the company when compared to various other technology peers.While, there have been a number of publicity failures tied to Amazon’s HQ search this past year, Bezos made no mention of the HQ search in his annual letter, but instead directed much of the focus on their ability to grow their e-commerce business, AWS and the minimum wage increase to $15.Jeff Bezos mentions in his shareholder letter the importance of 3rd-party sellers and how it has contributed to its total e-commerce revenue and volumes when compared to eBay:> Something strange and remarkable has happened over the last 20 years. Take a look at these numbers: Third-party sales have grown from 3% of the total to 58%. To put it bluntly: Third-party sellers are kicking our first party butt. Badly. And it’s a high bar too because our first-party business has grown dramatically over that period, from $1.6 billion in 1999 to $117 billion this past year. The compound annual growth rate for our first-party business in that time period is 25%. But in that same time, third-party sales have grown from $0.1 billion to $160 billion – a compound annual growth rate of 52%. To provide an external benchmark, eBay’s gross merchandise sales in that period have grown at a compound rate of 20%, from $2.8 billion to $95 billion.Not to point daggers at anybody, but Bezos basically stated that their third-party retail sales (which is very similar to eBay’s listing marketplace) grew at annual growth rate of 52% versus eBay at 20%, and it’s representative of 58% of Amazon’s total retail sales. These are the key metrics that define Amazon’s e-commerce growth narrative, and it’s likely where Amazon will continue to invest resources, so they can attract more third-party retail sales at the detriment of eBay.It’s likely that Amazon’s 3rd-party retail will continue to dominate in comparison to eBay (where historically that wasn’t always the case) but has now become an established reality given Amazon’s 3rd-party retail represents $160 billion in sales on the platform versus eBay at $98 billion in total platform sales.The divergence in narrative between Amazon and eBay will continue, as eBay as a stand-alone website property hasn’t gone much further into enhancing features for eBay sellers. What has helped Amazon at beating eBay? Well, Bezos explains in his letter:> We helped independent sellers compete against our first-party business by investing in and offering them the very best-selling tools we could imagine and build. There are many such tools, including tools that help sellers manage inventory, process payments, track shipments, create reports, and sell across borders – and we’re inventing more every year.This paints a somewhat gloomy narrative both by the numbers but also the internal efforts to supply core competencies tied to Amazon’s distribution and ecosystem that eBay cannot provide. While its been a well-established fact that Amazon can continue to execute, there was one more hint or clue in the annual shareholder letter that points to Amazon’s future.Bezos believe that further expansion into global retail will require a combination of e-commerce and brick-and-mortar initiatives:> Amazon today remains a small player in global retail. We represent a low single-digit percentage of the retail market, and there are much larger retailers in every country where we operate. And that’s largely because nearly 90% of retail remains offline, in brick and mortar stores. With Amazon Go, we had a clear vision. Get rid of the worst thing about physical retail: checkout lines. No one likes to wait in line. Instead, we imagined a store where you could walk in, pick up what you wanted, and leave.What’s interesting about Bezos is the fact that he believes that Amazon is “small player in global retail.” What this points to though, isn’t the fact that he thinks Amazon can service every customers with online-only sales, but how he transitions the idea to Amazon Go, where he believes that a technology-driven approach to checkout lines, and a seamless buying/selling experience could be globally disruptive and it’s where Amazon could continue to deploy resources (where they only have 10 stores in the United States in Seattle, Chicago and San Francisco).The brick-and-mortar transition for Amazon has been slow, and more iterative in nature. But it could play into Amazon’s global ambitions of being a relevant retailer both online and offline (which can also) be integrated into its online-based business. The execution on the AWS front has been strong, but efforts by Bezos to outline expectations tied to retail shouldn’t be ignored either, because this is Amazon’s bread-and-butter business.If Amazon were to surprise shareholders with more efforts tied to retail, it would double-down on its incumbency advantage. Based on the dialogue from Bezos within the shareholder letter, it’s safe to presume that on-going efforts to disrupt retail whether online or offline remains one of Amazon’s biggest priorities.

During this time, some stocks have thrived while others have struggled.GOBankingRates researched historical prices to see what $1,000 invested in your favorite companies in 2008 would be worth 10 years later, as well as what the compound annual growth rate is to give you a sense of what the yearly return for each has been over time.Keep reading to learn about the fastest growing stocks since 2000, and see which companies have produced impressive growth rates during the past decade.SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY): $1,923.47Share Price May 1, 2008: $138.39 Share Price May 1, 2018: $266.24 Compound annual growth rate: 6.76 percentPerhaps the easiest route to investing in stocks is to simply invest in ETFs that track major indices. If you can’t beat the market, and almost everyone can’t, why not join it?In this case, the S&P 500 ETF from SPDR is among the most popular options for ETFs that track the S&P 500, which is generally considered the benchmark by which the performance of most stocks are judged.So, the roughly $2,000 that your $1,000 investment 10 years ago would be worth now is one of the best ways to gauge just how well some of these companies have performed.Apple (AAPL): $7,407.06Share price May 1, 2008: $24.99 Share price May 1, 2018: $185.16 Compound annual growth rate: 22.17 percentApple is one of the most iconic and well-known brands in the world, thanks in part to a few key reinventions and rebranding strategies. A decade ago, Apple was a tech firm less than one year into its release of the iPhone. Today, it’s a consumer goods giant that has ridden the smartphone revolution to its status as the most valuable company in the world, closing in on a valuation of $1 trillion.Netflix (NFLX): $74,394.38Share price May 1, 2008: $4.52 Share price May 1, 2018: $326.26 Compound annual growth rate: 53.87 percentNetflix shares have been prone to large gains and losses as it has grown into a dominant media company. But like Apple, Netflix wasn’t exactly the company it is today 10 years ago. In May of 2008, Netflix was primarily a mail-order DVD rental company that had just rolled out a streaming service that was capped at 10 hours of free viewing a month for the base membership.If you predicted that streaming was the wave of the future — like CEO Reed Hastings did — every $1,000 you invested in Netflix would be worth almost $75,000 today.Alphabet (GOOGL): $3,626.72Share price May 1, 2008: $292.13 Share price May 1, 2018: $1,059.46 Compound annual growth rate: 13.75 percentAlphabet is the holding company for technology giant Google. Over the years, the company has expanded into many different businesses. These range from office productivity products to phones, virtual assistants and entertainment services.Walt Disney Co. (DIS): $3,158.94Share price May 1, 2008: $32.45 Share price May 1, 2018: $102.48 Compound annual growth rate: 12.19 percentWith its TV shows, networks, movies and theme parks, Disney has evolved into a massive media conglomerate. Its share price stagnated in 2016 and 2017, in part due to poor subscriber numbers at subsidiary ESPN. However, plans to launch its own streaming service might help Disney stock recapture its mojo.Coca-Cola Company (KO): $1,438.09Share price May 1, 2008: $29.31 Share price May 1, 2018: $42.14 Compound annual growth rate: 3.70 percentCoke is an iconic brand and one of Warren Buffett’s favorite investments. However, the declining popularity of sugary soda drinks might be eating into the company’s profitability in the long run.Walmart (WMT): $1,468.90Share price May 1, 2008: $58.20 Share price May 1, 2018: $85.47 Compound annual growth rate: 3.92 percentWalmart is the world’s biggest retailer but it suffered a scare from competitors like Amazon in 2015, which, along with internal factors, correlated with a decline in stock value. That put a real damper on its returns for this time period, making this the first stock listed here that underperformed the S&P 500 over the last decade. So, one of the things to avoid at Walmart might actually be its stock.Story continuesTransocean Ltd. (RIG): $83.36Share Price May 1, 2008: $146.95 Share Price May 1, 2018: $12.25 Compound annual growth rate: -22.00 percentIt turns out being associated with one of the most catastrophic oil spills in history can have a negative effect on your shares. Transocean stock was riding high through the first half of 2008, but it went into a free fall when markets crashed later that year. The hits kept coming when, in 2010, the Deepwater Horizon accident occurred. If you failed to pull your $1,000 out of Transocean stock at any point in the last decade, you would be left with less than $100 today.Trex Company, Inc. (TREX): $23,582.58Share Price May 1, 2008: $4.50 Share Price May 1, 2018: $106.14 Compound annual growth rate: 37.17 percentTrex Company makes wood/plastic composites used in making outdoor decks — which, apparently, is a pretty great business to be in as the company has been growing at over 35 percent a year in the last decade. Although growth has been mostly consistent, 2017 was the biggest year for Trex stock: It gained roughly 70 percent last year.Microsoft (MSFT): $3,376.59Share price May 1, 2008: $28.50 Share price May 1, 2018: $96.22 Compound annual growth rate: 12.94 percentMicrosoft’s stock has performed well over the past few years, but it pales in contrast to its performance during the 1990s, when it helped create a number of “Microsoft millionaires.” These days, it’s still considered one of the safest stocks to invest in — especially for first-time investors.Nike (NKE): $4,152.34Share price May 1, 2008: $16.70 Share price May 1, 2018: $69.34 Compound annual growth rate: 15.30 percentNike continues to be an innovator and leader in the sports apparel and equipment industry. By sponsoring a number of high-profile athletes and teams, the Nike symbol is one of the most recognizable around. However, in 2016 the stock hit some headwinds and took a hard tumble that it didn’t fully recover from until the end of 2017.General Electric (GE): $428.76Share price May 1, 2008: $32.80 Share price May 1, 2018: $14.07 Compound annual growth rate: -8.12 percentLike much of the overall market, General Electric’s stock plummeted during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. For GE, the culprit was mainly its financial division, GE Capital. The stock recovered nicely coming out of that period, but major missteps in 2014 and 2017 have turned it into a long-term underperformer. In fact, General Electric stock was even more efficient at losing you money over the last ten years than the S&P 500 was at making it.Don’t Miss: The Classic Brands You Love Are in TroubleAmazon (AMZN): $20,406.42Share price May 1, 2008: $78.40 Share price May 1, 2018: $1,600.14 Compound annual growth rate: 35.20 percentA $1,000 investment in Amazon would have provided a substantial return for the long-term investor. A leader in e-commerce, Amazon consistently adds new products and services for consumer and business customers. This might be the reason many experts say this is one stock you’ll want to hold onto for a very long time.Pfizer (PFE): $1,732.59Share price May 1, 2008: $20.17 Share price May 1, 2018: $34.93 Compound annual growth rate: 5.65 percentThinking about investing in the healthcare sector? Pfizer is a good stock for beginners to try. The company is a major biopharmaceutical company whose stock provides consistent growth. On the downside, it has lagged the performance of both its industry group and the S&P 500 index over multi-year periods.McDonald’s (MCD): $2,771.11Share price May 1, 2008: $59.54 Share price May 1, 2018: $165.00 Compound annual growth rate: 10.73 percentMcDonald’s is in an industry where it must regularly reinvent itself. Faced with changing consumer trends and an onslaught of competitors, the company has responded by retooling its menu, adding all-day breakfast and changing to fresh beef in some of its burgers. Investors are probably hoping it works; McDonald’s stock has beaten the S&P 500 consistently since 2005.Starbucks (SBUX): $7,197.57Share price May 1, 2008: $7.98 Share price May 1, 2018: $57.45 Compound annual growth rate: 21.82 percentStarbucks has taken the way we drink coffee and turned it into a lifestyle, both domestically and internationally. After being hit hard during the financial crisis, the stock rebounded nicely the following years. Starbucks ran into trouble recently, though, after two African-American men were arrested at a Philadelphia location, prompting a wave of negative publicity.Find Out: How to Cut Your Annual Starbucks Bill Without Giving Up Your CoffeeChesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK): $62.70Share Price May 1, 2008: $49.22 Share Price May 1, 2018: $3.13 Compound annual growth rate: -24.19 percentBetween the financial crisis and then the massive drop in oil prices in late 2014, it really hasn’t been a good decade for investors in Oklahoma City-based oil and gas producer Chesapeake Energy Corporation. Chesapeake Energy stock used to trade for nearly $50 a share. Today, you can get a single share for just over $3, leaving you with a paltry $62.70 from a $1,000 investment in May of 2008.FedEx (FDX): $2,542.33Share price May 1, 2008: $95.59 Share price May 1, 2018: $243.12 Compound annual growth rate: 9.78 percentFedEx and other shipping competitors have benefited from the boom in e-commerce retailers such as Amazon, but the company has been hot since well before the rise of Amazon and others. FedEx stock has outperformed the S&P 500 since the start of 2001.Learn: How to Know When to Sell StocksOracle (ORCL): $2,193.15Share Price May 1, 2008: $21.01 Share Price May 1, 2018: $46.07 Compound annual growth rate: 8.17 percentOracle’s returns aren’t terribly impressive when weighed against the S&P 500, but they are still ahead of the index. What’s more, it hit a major milestone in late June of last year when it finally surpassed its all-time high from 2000 prior to a steep sell-off in the midst of the tech bubble bursting, having traded below that level for over 15 years.The Boeing Company (BA): $4,010.52Share Price May 1, 2008: $84.86 Share Price May 1, 2018: $340.43 Compound annual growth rate: 14.90 percentBoeing stock has been one of the stronger performers in the Dow Jones for some time, but much of those gains have been since the start of 2017. The stock has almost doubled since the start of last year.The Mosaic Company (MOS): $228.61Share Price May 1, 2008: $120.56 Share Price May 1, 2018: $27.56 Compound annual growth rate: -13.72 percentThe Mosaic Company is a basic materials company that produces concentrated phosphate and potash fertilizers. Of course, in the last decade, Mosaic Company stock has just been producing a lot of disappointed investors as it dropped to under a fifth of its May 2008 value. Maybe they could take pictures of everyone who lost money and piece them together into one big collage of sorts.Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI): $5,194.05Share Price May 1, 2008: $13.55 Share Price May 1, 2018: $70.37 Compound annual growth rate: 17.91 percentFrom the start of 2010 to the start of 2013, Activision Blizzard stock held painfully steady. The stock opened 2010 at $11.23 a pop and ended 2013 at $18.29 a share. That makes the massive gain over the 10-year period all the more impressive, considering it essentially broke even on the first half of that period. Since the start of 2013, the stock is up a whopping 530 percent.Use These: 6 Best Long-Term InvestmentsEstee Lauder Companies, Inc. (EL): $5,864.41Share Price May 1, 2008: $22.81 Share Price May 1, 2018: $133.79 Compound annual growth rate: 19.35 percentThere’s no need to slap makeup on results like these, Estee Lauder’s nearly 20 percent annual return over the last decade might have investors blushing at how well they’ve done. The company grew at a rapid rate after the 2008 crash, had one hiccup in 2016, only to roar back in 2017, nearly doubling its value from the start of 2017 to March 2018.Salesforce.com, Inc.

But, with a recurring $8 here and $10 there, the cost of living “over-the-top” can quickly catch up to the average cable bill, which comes out to $103 per month.Last week, streaming music platform Spotify and online TV service Hulu announced a $13 monthly package, which includes Spotify Premium and Hulu’s cheapest option (which includes limited commercials). In light of this partnership, Yahoo Finance decided to ask readers what their dream bundle would look like. Respondents were asked to select two services/apps out of 24 different choices. The options included Amazon Prime (AMZN), Apple Music (AAPL), Blue Apron (APRN), Bonobos, Bumble, ClassPass, FreshDirect, GlamSquad, HelloFresh, Hotel Tonight, Hulu, Lyft, MealPal, MoviePass, OpenTable (BKNG), Netflix (NFLX), Rent The Runway, Seamless (GRUB), SoulCycle, Spotify (SPOT), StitchFix (SFIX), The New York Times (NYT), Tinder (MTCH) and Uber. The dynamic duoOf the 383 people who participated in the survey, 93 individuals, or 24.3% of all respondents, voted for a discounted bundle that combines Amazon Prime and Netflix.Readers all repeated variations of the same sentiment — “they are by far the best,” “super entertainment bundle,” “it would be perfect and you would have everything you need,” “They are the two services I use the most and derive the greatest value from!”Both Netflix and Amazon Prime hit major milestones this week. Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos finally disclosed how many people pay for Prime membership — a whopping 100 million. Netflix announced it added 2 million U.S. subscribers in the first quarter of 2018. The streaming behemoth now has 125 million subscribers around the world. Though investors and analysts wonder just how much more Netflix can grow in an already saturated market.It’s undeniable that Amazon Prime and Netflix dominate household media consumption and Prime’s added e-commerce bonus tempts families who are still holding out.One respondent noted, “They both have shows I would watch but I wouldn’t pay for them separately. I would also take advantage of Prime Shipping.”Netflix dominatesIn total, respondents created 68 different combinations from the choices. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Netflix dominated respondents’ picks, with the streaming service appearing in the four most popular combinations. A Netflix and Spotify Premium bundle came in a distant second to  Amazon Prime/Netflix, with 16.7% of all respondents wanting that bundle.  When asked why they chose the two, one person said, “Because I listen to Spotify all day long, and I watch Netflix all night long.” Other comments included, “I already pay for Spotify, it would be nice if I got some sort of discount when having Netflix as well. I typically just subscribe when a show comes out I want to watch” and “I use both Netflix and Spotify daily and if I could get around paying $25 a month for both that would be amazing.” A Netflix and Hulu marriage was the third most popular bundle, with 10.7% choosing the direct competitors as their ideal pairing.Comments included, “Hulu could do the TV part and Netflix could deal more with the movie side. Netflix could offer their shows on Hulu,” “I want to expand my movie and TV access, as I only have internet, and no cable. What you can’t see on one you can see on the other. It’s TV without a cable subscription.”Other comments echoed the fact that the two services actually complement each other. “They’re in the same category, but the content is different enough that we pay for both. Plus, Hulu comes with the option to add premium channels. I’m always flipping back and forth between shows on Hulu and Netflix”, one person commented. “Netflix and Hulu w/Live would be all the TV I ever need,” another added.Story continuesHulu, which is jointly owned by Time Warner, 21st Century Fox, Comcast, and Disney, has 17 million paying subscribers in the U.S. across its video-on-demand and new live TV services.Seven percent of respondents chose a Netflix and Apple Music bundle, most citing that they are current Netflix subscribers but are also part of the Apple ecosystem and would be interested if there was a discount. Apple Music costs $10 per month, or $15 for a family subscription which covers up to six people.MoviePassFive percent of respondents chose Amazon Prime and Spotify. A Netflix and MoviePass deal came in sixth place, with 3.9% choosing the movie lover’s package — “home entertainment and a night out at the movies… the best of both worlds,” as one reader put it. MoviePass and Amazon Prime was another popular combination. MoviePass, dubbed the “Netflix of cinema” has been constantly rejiggering its business model, slashing subscription fees to as low as $8 a month for unlimited movie-viewing in select theaters (3D and IMAX are not included). The latest option is $10 for four movies per month. What consumers wantWhile none of these combinations are necessarily down the pipeline, Spotify has been an industry leader when it comes to partnering with services that share a similar target demographic. Last fall, Spotify and Hulu offered students a $4.99 monthly bundle to access Spotify Premium and Hulu’s entry-level subscription. “The idea of being able to bring your favorite music together and an over-the-top channel that allows you to see most of what you want to see anyway, that’s fantastic. It’s very smart,” said Susan Lyne, president of BBG Ventures, and a former executive at ABC Entertainment and Martha Stewart Omnimedia.Last winter, the New York Times partnered with Spotify, offering its All Access digital subscribers a free membership to Spotify Premium. That offer is no longer being offered to new customers.“Our offer with Spotify was always marketed as a special, limited-time offer — it was available for a full year (Feb. 2017 – Feb. 2018).  Customers who subscribed to this option, and have not canceled, continue to receive Spotify Premium with their Times subscription,” a New York Times spokesperson told Yahoo Finance.Even if not at a discount, one easy startup idea would be a service to actually streamline payments for all of these monthly subscription services. As Morgan Housel, partner at venture capital firm Collaborative Fund, opined, wouldn’t it be nice to have a one-stop shop to pay for all of these services? I’d like to manage all of my subscriptions in one product. Pay once price a month for Netflix, Spotify, Prime, Adobe, newspapers, etc. One credit card charge, one password. Someone do this. — Morgan Housel (@morganhousel) April 19, 2018 While we are trying to extricate ourselves from cable TV, it’s clear that consumers are seeking ways to bundle their ever-increasing subscription fees.—Melody Hahm is a senior writer at Yahoo Finance, covering entrepreneurship, technology and real estate.

Fortunately, most of the time, investors are content to sit back and let time do the heavy lifting.Every now and then, however, an uninterrupted market-wide rally (such as the one we saw in 2017) followed by a couple of major corrections (such as the ones we've seen in 2018) inspires a more active approach. Buying every dip last year was a bulletproof strategy; steering clear of this year's big dips would've left most investors far better off.But broadly speaking, investors shouldn't embrace that short-term mindset. Buy-and-hold is a time-tested strategy that helps investors avoid trying to time the market (which even experts can't reliably do) and making poor emotional decisions.With that as a backdrop, here are a dozen stocks to never sell. Many buy-and-holders are looking to reset their portfolios as the new year begins. If you hold any of the stocks, don't stop ... and if you're looking to buy, be ready to commit. Each company has plenty to success that their history of success should continue for years to come. And each operates in an industry that won't go away anytime soon.SEE ALSO: 101 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2019 and Beyond3MGetty ImagesMarket value: $116.8 billionDividend yield: 2.7%3M (MMM, $198.32) shareholders aren't strangers to prolonged periods of tepid performance. The stock made no net progress whatsoever from late 2003 to late 2012.But it still was a worthwhile holding during that time. How? 3M's quarterly dividend grew from 33 cents per share at the beginning of that timeframe to 59 cents by the end, and it was never suspended or cut. Better yet, 3M earned more than it dished out during that period; it could afford its payments.3M is an income-driving machine, even when it's not a growth name.The company's strength is its highly diversified product lineup, which gives 3M plenty to sell in any economic environment. From Post-Its to sandpaper to circuit breakers to dentistry supplies, 3M never lacks for opportunity; much of its product base includes goods that its customers don't think twice about buying regardless of the economy's condition.The next several years should be above-average ones, if the company's forecasters are on target and its leaders are on their game. 3M expects per-share profit growth of between 8% and 11% for the next five years on organic local-currency sales growth of between 3% and 5%. That's huge for an income-oriented company of this size and age.SEE ALSO: The 27 Best Mutual Funds in 401(k) Retirement PlansAltriaStory continuesGetty ImagesMarket value: $101.9 billionDividend yield: 6.0%"When building a portfolio of forever stocks, you are usually facing a decision of buying a stock for income or for growth potential," says Joseph Conroy, financial planner with at Maryland-based Synergy Financial Group. But he also notes that cigarette company Altria (MO, $53.36) "appears it might be able to offer both."The outlook doesn't exactly jibe with an increasingly effective smoking-cessation movement. But Altria is finding a way to survive. Revenues have mostly held steady since 2010. Income, while erratic, is trending upward, fueling the stock's steadily rising dividend.Nevertheless, the cigarette industry's glory days of growth are behind it, and the future still looks fuzzy for e-cigarettes. What might Altria have in mind for its next era?Conroy says, "There is one untapped market place that will be a huge growth factor for (Altria)," Conroy says. "The inevitable legalization of marijuana will create an amazing amount of market share opportunity for the company. The infrastructure is in place ... Philip Morris (USA) can practically flip a switch and be in production of numerous cannabis products.""While waiting for that eventual day to come," he says, "you are getting paid a healthy 5% dividend yield and an attractive P/E ratio of around 11."Investors won't have to wait. A couple days after Conroy's remarks, Altria announced it bought a 45% stake in Canadian cannabis company Cronos Group for $1.8 billion, with an option to up its stake to 55%.SEE ALSO: 19 Best Stocks to Buy for 2019Amazon.comGetty ImagesMarket value: $814.0 billionDividend yield: N/AAmazon.com (AMZN, $1,641.03) is a bird of a different feather to be sure, as it's not valued based on any of the classic rules of stock-picking. But the e-commerce giant has a history of making up its own valuation rules so effectively that even the most traditional of investors can comfortably hitch onto this name.Amazon's staying power is anchored in its diversity, its reach and the mountain of consumer information it collects and leverages. From grocery stores to bookstores to its own brand of consumer goods to its own apparel brand names - and more - a huge swath of the world does at least some business with Amazon on a regular basis. Not everything it does is wildly (or at all) profitable. But once someone is brought into the ecosystem, Amazon presents all sorts of other alternative monetization paths.It's not a cheap business model. Amazon.com was barely profitable for years, and losses were never unusual or surprising. The company never has been more profitable than it is right now, and even so, newcomers will be paying more than 90 times the company's trailing income and 60 times analysts' estimates for next year's profits.But sales growth is unstoppable, and AMZN stock has been a similarly unstoppable investment. It's not immune to the occasional short-term setback (see: now), but its longer-term trend has mostly reflected the past decade-plus of uninterrupted quarterly sales growth.SEE ALSO: The 5 Best Investments You Can Make in 2019American States Water CompanyGetty ImagesMarket value: $2.5 billionDividend yield: 1.7%American States Water Company (AWR, $66.58) isn't exactly a high-flying growth stock that inspires splashy headlines. In fact, it's the diametrical opposite of that. It's a utility name that boasts slow growth. It's not even cheap, at 40 times its trailing-12 month earnings. And its yield has been dialed down to a modest 1.7%.But just try to go one day without using any water. The value of a reliable supply of potable water becomes crystal clear.There are cheaper companies with better growth rates, even if that growth is uneven. No other industry, however, can say they operate what is effectively a legal monopoly with (literally) no alternative. Consumers can install solar panels as an alternative to relying on piping in power from a utility company. Many consumers are dropping landlines altogether and making their mobile phone their one and only phone. Short of drilling a well in their backyards, though, and hoping for the best, consumers will buy water from their one local provider.American States Water's top and bottom lines are well positioned for long-term growth, too. Rate increases ultimately have to be approved by a localized utility board, but requests from utility providers rarely are denied in the end, even if most are initially fought.The rate increase trend is particularly reliable for water supplies. Circle of Blue, an industry information resource, reports eight consecutive years of nationwide water rate increases.SEE ALSO: 10 Top Utility Stocks to Buy for Safety and DividendsAmgenGetty ImagesMarket value: $125.3 billionDividend yield: 3.0%A biotech stock you can buy and forget? Really?Yes, but only because Amgen (AMGN, $194.09) is anything but your typical biotech company. It has a great deal of built-in diversity that rounds out the wild revenue swings that single-product and other more focused biopharma stocks tend to dish out. No single drug makes up more than one-fourth of its revenue, and only two drugs generate more than a tenth of its sales. All told it makes and markets 15 different therapies, addressing multiple markets.Those are just the drugs that are approved. Amgen has eight Phase III trials underway, seeking to expand its existing portfolio, and another five Phase II trials. Throw in the five biosimilar drugs in the works that don't have to follow the full developmental path the FDA requires of most new drugs, and the company has plenty of revenue lined up for the foreseeable future.Still, isn't biotech an inherently risky investment? It certainly can be, but given Amgen's sheer size and $30 billion worth of liquidity, Amgen is equipped to muscle out the competition and outright acquire some competitors it can't keep contained.SEE ALSO: The 7 Best Biotech Stocks for Investors Who Hate RiskAppleGetty ImagesMarket value: $804.7 billionDividend yield: 1.7%Even for all its recent troubles, Apple (AAPL, $169.60) really is one of the market's most proven names, and it would be even if it wasn't a behemoth. Jason Escamilla, Chief Investment Officer with San Francisco based ImpactAdvisor, says, "With Apple, you a well-run growth company with extraordinary profit margins at a reasonable valuation."Those haven't been the prevailing talking points of late. The company recently announced it would stop reporting unit sales of its flagship iPhone. Some analysts are interpreting the decision as a sign that Apple knows it's finally starting to run out of new customers to sell the smartphone to. Moreover, Apple has gotten caught up in America's trade war with China.These headwinds are being offset by higher iPhone prices, however, and perhaps more important, by major revenue growth from its Services arm. Sales of apps and digital content shot 27% higher to a record $10 billion in the company's quarter ended Sept. 29. That's roughly 16% of Apple's total sales, and the organization has yet to reach its full stride on that front.Apple always seems to find something to sell, and it excels in most markets it chooses to address.There's a certain philosophical advantage in owning Apple over other investment opportunities too. Escamilla adds, "As a long-term investment, it is further de-risked when you consider the company's demonstrated preference for buying back shares over pursuing low-margin and higher-risk growth." Apple has repurchased nearly $73 billion of its own stock over the past four quarters.SEE ALSO: 10 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying (And 6 He's Selling)Johnson & JohnsonGetty ImagesMarket value: $392.9 billionDividend yield: 2.5%Admittedly, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ, $145.26) is tough to like right now. Recent reporting suggests the company had known for years that its talcum powder contained the known carcinogen asbestos, underscoring what many have suspected for quite some time now. JNJ shares tumbled nearly 10% on the day Reuters made the allegation, but if the development turns into a full-blown legal liability, it could put even more pressure on J&J shares.Yet, as difficult as it may be, one has to look at the bigger picture. This is the same company that's been making baby shampoo for decades. It's also the name behind Band-Aid brand bandages, Tylenol, Listerine and more - all consumer products that hold up against cyclical headwinds.Investors should also recognize J&J is waist-deep into the pharmaceutical business. Last year it sold $36.3 billion worth of prescription drugs, led by arthritis and colitis treatment Remicade. It sold $6.3 billion worth of that prescription medicine, followed closely by $4 billion worth of Stelara. Even fewer investors recognize that Johnson & Johnson also operates a medical devices arm, which added $26.6 billion to last year's top line. From laparoscopic surgery equipment to wound closure to glucose monitors, Johnson & Johnson has solutions.It's a rare mix of diversity that keeps JNJ in good position to keep the top line growing regardless of the regulatory or economic environment. Whatever litigation may arise from the asbestos allegation still won't change the fact that the company is well-diversified.EDITOR'S NOTE: This frame has been updated to include new information about Johnson & Johnson's talc scandal.SEE ALSO: 7 Health Care Stocks to Buy for Robust ReturnsJPMorgan ChaseGetty ImagesMarket value: $342.0 billionDividend yield: 3.2%"Being a value investor, I like the financial sector and especially JPMorgan Chase (JPM, $101.36)," says Glen Smith, managing partner of Glen D. Smith & Associates and advisor with Raymond James.JPMorgan is the nation's biggest bank when measured by total assets, sporting nearly $2.2 trillion worth as of the Federal Reserve's latest look. It's also much more than just a run-of-the-mill banking operation. JPMorgan offers wealth management, brokerage services, merchant services, underwriting and more. This breadth gives JPMorgan plenty of opportunity to grow.And it largely has. While the bank finally struggled to fully shake off the echoes of 2008's subprime meltdown and revenue continued to lose ground through 2016, JPM finally found its form. JPMorgan has broken records on the top and bottom lines in each of the past three quarters. Smith expects more of the same, too, saying, "We expect interest rates to climb, and as rates go up financials should profit more as the spread between what the banks generate on short-term notes and what they pay out to the customer continues to widen."JPMorgan's appeal goes well beyond the foreseeable future. While it has become a head-turner of late, it's also on firmer footing than many of its peers.SEE ALSO: The 7 Best Bank ETFs for American BullsRealty IncomeGetty ImagesMarket value: $19.6 billionDividend yield: 4.0%Real estate is no less cyclical than stocks, though the ebb and flow of real estate values aren't necessarily synchronized with the stock market. So investors aiming for a little more stability might want to blend real estate investment trusts (REITs) into their portfolios.Chris Kuiper, equity analyst with CFRA Research, thinks Realty Income (O, $65.66) is a top all-weather way of adding real estate exposure to a portfolio. The company owns, develops and manages almost exclusively free-standing buildings that are leased to high-quality tenants such as convenience stores, dollar stores and drug stores - such as top customer Walgreens (WBA).7-Eleven and FedEx (FDX) are a close second and third in terms of rent revenue, making up a tenant base that Kuiper says is "very insulated from the rise of e-commerce as well as recessions.""The company pays out a monthly dividend and has done so consecutively for the past 579 months at a 4.6% compound average annual dividend growth rate since it listed in 1994," says Kuiper, who also likes Realty Income for dividend investors. "The total stock return has delivered a 15.9% compound annual return, far outpacing the S&P 500."SEE ALSO: 12 Alternative Strategies for High Yield and StabilityUnileverGetty ImagesMarket value: $149.0 billionDividend yield: 3.3%Unilever (UN, $55.27) does double duty for North American investors.

On the other hand, it brings some much-needed international exposure to a portfolio. Unilever is a dual-headquartered company based in the U.K. and Netherlands.

Unilever had and has a firm grasp of what was working, and what would work, in terms of product mix and product development. In 2009, for instance, the company tweaked its marketing message for its Bertolli frozen dinners, appealing to consumers who'd stopped eating out in the wake of a rough recession.

Fortunately, most of the time, investors are content to sit back and let time do the heavy lifting.Every now and then, however, an uninterrupted market-wide rally (such as the one we saw in 2017) followed by a couple of major corrections (such as the ones we've seen in 2018) inspires a more active approach. Buying every dip last year was a bulletproof strategy; steering clear of this year's big dips would've left most investors far better off.But broadly speaking, investors shouldn't embrace that short-term mindset. Buy-and-hold is a time-tested strategy that helps investors avoid trying to time the market (which even experts can't reliably do) and making poor emotional decisions.With that as a backdrop, here are a dozen stocks to never sell. Many buy-and-holders are looking to reset their portfolios as the new year begins. If you hold any of the stocks, don't stop ... and if you're looking to buy, be ready to commit. Each company has plenty to success that their history of success should continue for years to come. And each operates in an industry that won't go away anytime soon.SEE ALSO: 101 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2019 and Beyond3MGetty ImagesMarket value: $116.8 billionDividend yield: 2.7%3M (MMM, $198.32) shareholders aren't strangers to prolonged periods of tepid performance. The stock made no net progress whatsoever from late 2003 to late 2012.But it still was a worthwhile holding during that time. How? 3M's quarterly dividend grew from 33 cents per share at the beginning of that timeframe to 59 cents by the end, and it was never suspended or cut. Better yet, 3M earned more than it dished out during that period; it could afford its payments.3M is an income-driving machine, even when it's not a growth name.The company's strength is its highly diversified product lineup, which gives 3M plenty to sell in any economic environment. From Post-Its to sandpaper to circuit breakers to dentistry supplies, 3M never lacks for opportunity; much of its product base includes goods that its customers don't think twice about buying regardless of the economy's condition.The next several years should be above-average ones, if the company's forecasters are on target and its leaders are on their game. 3M expects per-share profit growth of between 8% and 11% for the next five years on organic local-currency sales growth of between 3% and 5%. That's huge for an income-oriented company of this size and age.SEE ALSO: The 27 Best Mutual Funds in 401(k) Retirement PlansAltriaStory continuesGetty ImagesMarket value: $101.9 billionDividend yield: 6.0%"When building a portfolio of forever stocks, you are usually facing a decision of buying a stock for income or for growth potential," says Joseph Conroy, financial planner with at Maryland-based Synergy Financial Group. But he also notes that cigarette company Altria (MO, $53.36) "appears it might be able to offer both."The outlook doesn't exactly jibe with an increasingly effective smoking-cessation movement. But Altria is finding a way to survive. Revenues have mostly held steady since 2010. Income, while erratic, is trending upward, fueling the stock's steadily rising dividend.Nevertheless, the cigarette industry's glory days of growth are behind it, and the future still looks fuzzy for e-cigarettes. What might Altria have in mind for its next era?Conroy says, "There is one untapped market place that will be a huge growth factor for (Altria)," Conroy says. "The inevitable legalization of marijuana will create an amazing amount of market share opportunity for the company. The infrastructure is in place ... Philip Morris (USA) can practically flip a switch and be in production of numerous cannabis products.""While waiting for that eventual day to come," he says, "you are getting paid a healthy 5% dividend yield and an attractive P/E ratio of around 11."Investors won't have to wait. A couple days after Conroy's remarks, Altria announced it bought a 45% stake in Canadian cannabis company Cronos Group for $1.8 billion, with an option to up its stake to 55%.SEE ALSO: 19 Best Stocks to Buy for 2019Amazon.comGetty ImagesMarket value: $814.0 billionDividend yield: N/AAmazon.com (AMZN, $1,641.03) is a bird of a different feather to be sure, as it's not valued based on any of the classic rules of stock-picking. But the e-commerce giant has a history of making up its own valuation rules so effectively that even the most traditional of investors can comfortably hitch onto this name.Amazon's staying power is anchored in its diversity, its reach and the mountain of consumer information it collects and leverages. From grocery stores to bookstores to its own brand of consumer goods to its own apparel brand names - and more - a huge swath of the world does at least some business with Amazon on a regular basis. Not everything it does is wildly (or at all) profitable. But once someone is brought into the ecosystem, Amazon presents all sorts of other alternative monetization paths.It's not a cheap business model. Amazon.com was barely profitable for years, and losses were never unusual or surprising. The company never has been more profitable than it is right now, and even so, newcomers will be paying more than 90 times the company's trailing income and 60 times analysts' estimates for next year's profits.But sales growth is unstoppable, and AMZN stock has been a similarly unstoppable investment. It's not immune to the occasional short-term setback (see: now), but its longer-term trend has mostly reflected the past decade-plus of uninterrupted quarterly sales growth.SEE ALSO: The 5 Best Investments You Can Make in 2019American States Water CompanyGetty ImagesMarket value: $2.5 billionDividend yield: 1.7%American States Water Company (AWR, $66.58) isn't exactly a high-flying growth stock that inspires splashy headlines. In fact, it's the diametrical opposite of that. It's a utility name that boasts slow growth. It's not even cheap, at 40 times its trailing-12 month earnings. And its yield has been dialed down to a modest 1.7%.But just try to go one day without using any water. The value of a reliable supply of potable water becomes crystal clear.There are cheaper companies with better growth rates, even if that growth is uneven. No other industry, however, can say they operate what is effectively a legal monopoly with (literally) no alternative. Consumers can install solar panels as an alternative to relying on piping in power from a utility company. Many consumers are dropping landlines altogether and making their mobile phone their one and only phone. Short of drilling a well in their backyards, though, and hoping for the best, consumers will buy water from their one local provider.American States Water's top and bottom lines are well positioned for long-term growth, too. Rate increases ultimately have to be approved by a localized utility board, but requests from utility providers rarely are denied in the end, even if most are initially fought.The rate increase trend is particularly reliable for water supplies. Circle of Blue, an industry information resource, reports eight consecutive years of nationwide water rate increases.SEE ALSO: 10 Top Utility Stocks to Buy for Safety and DividendsAmgenGetty ImagesMarket value: $125.3 billionDividend yield: 3.0%A biotech stock you can buy and forget? Really?Yes, but only because Amgen (AMGN, $194.09) is anything but your typical biotech company. It has a great deal of built-in diversity that rounds out the wild revenue swings that single-product and other more focused biopharma stocks tend to dish out. No single drug makes up more than one-fourth of its revenue, and only two drugs generate more than a tenth of its sales. All told it makes and markets 15 different therapies, addressing multiple markets.Those are just the drugs that are approved. Amgen has eight Phase III trials underway, seeking to expand its existing portfolio, and another five Phase II trials. Throw in the five biosimilar drugs in the works that don't have to follow the full developmental path the FDA requires of most new drugs, and the company has plenty of revenue lined up for the foreseeable future.Still, isn't biotech an inherently risky investment? It certainly can be, but given Amgen's sheer size and $30 billion worth of liquidity, Amgen is equipped to muscle out the competition and outright acquire some competitors it can't keep contained.SEE ALSO: The 7 Best Biotech Stocks for Investors Who Hate RiskAppleGetty ImagesMarket value: $804.7 billionDividend yield: 1.7%Even for all its recent troubles, Apple (AAPL, $169.60) really is one of the market's most proven names, and it would be even if it wasn't a behemoth. Jason Escamilla, Chief Investment Officer with San Francisco based ImpactAdvisor, says, "With Apple, you a well-run growth company with extraordinary profit margins at a reasonable valuation."Those haven't been the prevailing talking points of late. The company recently announced it would stop reporting unit sales of its flagship iPhone. Some analysts are interpreting the decision as a sign that Apple knows it's finally starting to run out of new customers to sell the smartphone to. Moreover, Apple has gotten caught up in America's trade war with China.These headwinds are being offset by higher iPhone prices, however, and perhaps more important, by major revenue growth from its Services arm. Sales of apps and digital content shot 27% higher to a record $10 billion in the company's quarter ended Sept. 29. That's roughly 16% of Apple's total sales, and the organization has yet to reach its full stride on that front.Apple always seems to find something to sell, and it excels in most markets it chooses to address.There's a certain philosophical advantage in owning Apple over other investment opportunities too. Escamilla adds, "As a long-term investment, it is further de-risked when you consider the company's demonstrated preference for buying back shares over pursuing low-margin and higher-risk growth." Apple has repurchased nearly $73 billion of its own stock over the past four quarters.SEE ALSO: 10 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying (And 6 He's Selling)Johnson & JohnsonGetty ImagesMarket value: $392.9 billionDividend yield: 2.5%Admittedly, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ, $145.26) is tough to like right now. Recent reporting suggests the company had known for years that its talcum powder contained the known carcinogen asbestos, underscoring what many have suspected for quite some time now. JNJ shares tumbled nearly 10% on the day Reuters made the allegation, but if the development turns into a full-blown legal liability, it could put even more pressure on J&J shares.Yet, as difficult as it may be, one has to look at the bigger picture. This is the same company that's been making baby shampoo for decades. It's also the name behind Band-Aid brand bandages, Tylenol, Listerine and more - all consumer products that hold up against cyclical headwinds.Investors should also recognize J&J is waist-deep into the pharmaceutical business. Last year it sold $36.3 billion worth of prescription drugs, led by arthritis and colitis treatment Remicade. It sold $6.3 billion worth of that prescription medicine, followed closely by $4 billion worth of Stelara. Even fewer investors recognize that Johnson & Johnson also operates a medical devices arm, which added $26.6 billion to last year's top line. From laparoscopic surgery equipment to wound closure to glucose monitors, Johnson & Johnson has solutions.It's a rare mix of diversity that keeps JNJ in good position to keep the top line growing regardless of the regulatory or economic environment. Whatever litigation may arise from the asbestos allegation still won't change the fact that the company is well-diversified.EDITOR'S NOTE: This frame has been updated to include new information about Johnson & Johnson's talc scandal.SEE ALSO: 7 Health Care Stocks to Buy for Robust ReturnsJPMorgan ChaseGetty ImagesMarket value: $342.0 billionDividend yield: 3.2%"Being a value investor, I like the financial sector and especially JPMorgan Chase (JPM, $101.36)," says Glen Smith, managing partner of Glen D. Smith & Associates and advisor with Raymond James.JPMorgan is the nation's biggest bank when measured by total assets, sporting nearly $2.2 trillion worth as of the Federal Reserve's latest look. It's also much more than just a run-of-the-mill banking operation. JPMorgan offers wealth management, brokerage services, merchant services, underwriting and more. This breadth gives JPMorgan plenty of opportunity to grow.And it largely has. While the bank finally struggled to fully shake off the echoes of 2008's subprime meltdown and revenue continued to lose ground through 2016, JPM finally found its form. JPMorgan has broken records on the top and bottom lines in each of the past three quarters. Smith expects more of the same, too, saying, "We expect interest rates to climb, and as rates go up financials should profit more as the spread between what the banks generate on short-term notes and what they pay out to the customer continues to widen."JPMorgan's appeal goes well beyond the foreseeable future. While it has become a head-turner of late, it's also on firmer footing than many of its peers.SEE ALSO: The 7 Best Bank ETFs for American BullsRealty IncomeGetty ImagesMarket value: $19.6 billionDividend yield: 4.0%Real estate is no less cyclical than stocks, though the ebb and flow of real estate values aren't necessarily synchronized with the stock market. So investors aiming for a little more stability might want to blend real estate investment trusts (REITs) into their portfolios.Chris Kuiper, equity analyst with CFRA Research, thinks Realty Income (O, $65.66) is a top all-weather way of adding real estate exposure to a portfolio. The company owns, develops and manages almost exclusively free-standing buildings that are leased to high-quality tenants such as convenience stores, dollar stores and drug stores - such as top customer Walgreens (WBA).7-Eleven and FedEx (FDX) are a close second and third in terms of rent revenue, making up a tenant base that Kuiper says is "very insulated from the rise of e-commerce as well as recessions.""The company pays out a monthly dividend and has done so consecutively for the past 579 months at a 4.6% compound average annual dividend growth rate since it listed in 1994," says Kuiper, who also likes Realty Income for dividend investors. "The total stock return has delivered a 15.9% compound annual return, far outpacing the S&P 500."SEE ALSO: 12 Alternative Strategies for High Yield and StabilityUnileverGetty ImagesMarket value: $149.0 billionDividend yield: 3.3%Unilever (UN, $55.27) does double duty for North American investors.

As of 3 p.m. sharp, the virtual doors have been opened for Amazon Prime members, allowing them to shop more than 100,000 discounted products. (Seriously! That's a very real number.) With all of those deals at your disposal and so little time in the day, we sifted through them so you don't have to. With our beauty expert eyes, we've pulled together several beauty essentials that you should definitely stock up on. Your beauty routine deserves it. And for any other tips you may need for shopping Amazon Prime Day, click here.1. Clarisonic Mia 2 Cleansing Brush (Was $169, Now $110)Whether you consider yourself a Clarisonic aficionado or a total novice to the whole electronic beauty tools thing, we have a good feeling you'll be impressed by just how hard the Mia 2 brush goes to work. Meant to deeply cleanse and exfoliate the skin, the travel-friendly brush has two-speed options, a timer, and a protective case that's perfect for packing.2. Solimo 5-Blade Razor (Was $8, Now $6)If you're a shaver — all or the time or some of the time — this no-frills 5-blade razor is a great, low-budget option to stock up on. They're hypoallergenic and come with two razor refills, made with comfort-coated blades and rounded razor cartridges for the closest shave possible. According to reviewers, these make for a smoother, cheaper replacement for the typical drugstore buys.3. Crest 3D White Professional Effects Whitestrips Kit (Was $44, Now $28)As a multi-year Best of Beauty and Reader's Choice winner, you don't just have to take our word for these teeth-whitening strips. If you can commit to wearing them for 30 minutes a day for 20 days, the strips are designed to get rid of stains and leave you with a smile as shiny as professional bleaching could achieve for a fraction of the cost. They're easy to apply and leave behind zero mess, so what are you waiting for?Story continues4. 100% Pure Coffee Bean Caffeine Eye Cream (Was $26, Now $24.70)This natural beauty pick has some major de-puffing powers — the caffeine in its formula shrinks puffy morning eyes in a matter of a minute (Allure editors can attest to this). As if that's not reason enough, the ingredients list is filled with aloe extract, rose hydrofoil, and green tea extract which all make for a super hydrating and nourishing eye cream.5. Braun FaceSpa KitNeed a total bathroom overhaul? Look no further. This system includes an electric facial cleansing brush with four different brush head options — including a normal brush, extra sensitive brush, exfoliation brush, and a beauty sponge — to tackle your complete skin care regimen. You'll also find a facial epilator that not only removes facial hair by the root, but cleanses the skin pore-deep at the same time.6.

(Photo by Dan MacMedan/WireImage) MoreIt’s Oscar season and once again, it looks like your best bet to watch an Oscar nominated movie at home is going to be on DVD or Blu-ray.Streaming movies online has countless advantages over getting a polycarbonate platter in the mail, but selection is often not among them. That’s especially so at Netflix (NFLX), which must wait its turn before subscribers can watch the award season’s top films on its flat-rate plans.That’s because the movie industry still makes more money through purchases and rentals than streaming films.But even if you limit yourself to rentals and purchases at Amazon (AMZN) and others, where the selection should be about even between physical and digital, DVDs and Blu-ray discs retain some advantages.This year’s nominees, sort-of playing on AmazonWatching many of the Academy Award nominees that debuted only recently still requires going to a theater. Home viewing — well, legal home viewing — is only an option for a handful of contenders in the big five categories of best picture, best director, best actor, best actress and best (original and adapted) screenplay.Good luck watching ‘Hidden Figures’ at home any time soon.MoreFor example, among the nine best picture nominees, only the crime drama “Hell or High Water” is available as a digital download (for rent or purchase) or as a disc at Amazon.Two other dramas, “Hacksaw Ridge” and “Manchester by the Sea,” will land on Amazon as downloadable purchases on Feb. 7 and in disc form on Feb. 21. The sci-fi hit “Arrival” arrives in physical form Feb. 14, but Amazon doesn’t show a digital due date.Home viewing of best picture nominees “Fences,” “Hidden Figures,” “La La Land,” “Lion” and “Moonlight,” meanwhile, requires an indefinite wait.I found one best original screenplay possibility, “20th Century Women,” listed only on Amazon as a free Appstore app whose sales pitch included the line “Now you this request cold Android all 4K-Ultra-HD-3DMovies.” It vanished after a query to Amazon PR.Not so much luck on NetflixNetflix subscribers will have to wait even longer to watch this year’s Oscar contenders, especially folks without a DVD subscription. Best actress nominee “Florence Foster Jenkins” (Meryl Streep), best actor nominee “Captain Fantastic” (Viggo Mortensen) and best original screenplay nominee “The Lobster” are only available via DVD through Netflix, but you can digitally rent or purchase them on disc at Amazon. ‘La La Land’ is up for a host of awards, but watching it at home before the Oscar’s is going to be tough.MoreThat pattern prevails for last year’s nominees, as well. Of eight 2016 best-picture contenders, only two are on Netflix’s streaming menu: “Spotlight” (which won my own Oscar for “best depiction of newsroom slovenliness”) and “The Big Short.” The other six — “Bridge of Spies,” “Brooklyn,” “Mad Max: Fury Road,” “The Martian,” “The Revenant” and “Room” — are DVD-only at Netflix. You can buy downloads or discs of all of them at Amazon, and all but “Bridge of Spies” and “Brooklyn” are available as digital rentals there. “Room” is also free to stream for Prime subscribers.Given the choice between buying a digital file tied to “digital rights management” software and a disc that you can loan or resell, physical media should warrant paying a little more. Especially if the disc itself comes with digital versions to watch on a computer or tablet.Story continuesHow this worksThe explanation for this is not any Hollywood hostility toward Netflix, but the intersection of copyright law and the movie industry’s “release window” strategy of selling movies in one channel at a time to maximize profits.“The windows were never set up for the benefit of the consumer,” said Michael Goodman, director of research for Strategy Analytics. “In a perfect world, everything would be released day and date” — simultaneous digital and theatrical debuts.‘Manchester by the Sea’ will soon be available as a DVD, but there’s no word on when it’ll land on streaming services. (Photo: Roadside Attractions) MoreOnce physical sales do start, however, Netflix can rent discs without permission, just as used bookstores don’t need a publisher’s say-so to operate.That’s courtesy of a legal principle called the “first sale doctrine,” holding that a copyright holder’s control over a creative work’s distribution doesn’t extend to a particular purchased physical copy. That doctrine doesn’t cover digital files “sold” subject to a terms-of-use license. So Netflix must negotiate with studios to stream their films — and studios still make more money from rentals and purchases than streaming via a subscription. “The consumer price-per-view of a movie streamed 18 months after release is measured in cents, whereas the same film purchased as a recent release, on whatever format, is measured in dollars,” wrote Richard Cooper, an analyst with IHS Markit. Neither analyst expects this to change, even as studios have begun experimenting with selling digital downloads a few weeks before DVD and Blu-ray sales start. The result, for streaming viewers, can be a frustrating Venn diagram in which convenient, legal and comprehensive barely overlap.“It’s kind of balkanized,” Goodman said. “I do this professionally, and I have to see who the studio is and cross-reference to see who they have an distribution agreement with.” More from Rob:President Trump’s tech policy is a mysteryHow carriers will keep D.C. online during the inaugurationWhat you should really know about every major hacking storyOutgoing FCC chair: Don’t go backward on net neutralitySelfie drones and more fly into CES 2017Faraday Future’s FF91: Electric speed at a vaporous priceEmail Rob at rob@robpegoraro.com; follow him on Twitter at @robpegoraro. ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextGM Stock Could Take Off if It Takes a Hint From Disney+Motley FoolDon't Miss Out on the Netflix of 5G StocksInvestorPlaceWhere Will Netflix Be in 5 Years?Motley FoolNetflix Says New Competition Isn't Material: Is It Right?Motley FoolNetflix might have more Beyoncé specials planned after 'Homecoming'EngadgetZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley Fool1 Big Reason Why Disney Stock Is Just Getting StartedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraph內地熱門城市樓價回升星島日報Illinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatchAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin Rivet3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolBeyoncè's Netflix deal reportedly worth $60 million: VarietyMarketWatchWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceThe Boeing 737 MAX Is 1 Step Closer to Flying Again -- but Don't Expect to See It SoonMotley FoolThis 1 Assumption Could Totally Destroy Your RetirementMotley FoolWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo Finance

The data shows there's still room for improvement, though.23% of U.S. Amazon Prime subscribers said they would definitely cancel their membership if Prime Video wasn't included in their subscription, according to a recent survey from Loop Capital Markets. Seen another way, 23% of members signed up for Prime principally to stream video.Those survey results are in line with leaked data about Amazon originals that indicates they contributed about 5 million new Prime members between 2014 and 2017 -- roughly one-quarter of all new members during that period, according to estimates.With Amazon spending billions on new originals and licensed content every year, it has the potential to attract a lot more Prime members to the service with a few big hits.Amazon Prime Video on a tablet, smartphone, and Fire TV,MoreImage source: Amazon.Amazon is no NetflixNetflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) had nearly 55 million U.S. subscribers as of the end of last year. By comparison, Amazon Prime had some 90 million members in the U.S.Nonetheless, Netflix remains significantly more popular than Prime Video in the United States. eMarketer estimates Netflix draws 50% more viewers than Prime Video. Loop Capital found the most-watched Prime Video original had fewer viewers than the fifth most popular Netflix original.Netflix has some of the best originals on television (streaming or linear), and it's paying quite a bit to make them. The company expects to spend up to $8 billion on content this year on a profit-and-loss basis, and even more in terms of its total cash outlays. Amazon's budget was just $4.5 billion last year, according to estimates.But Amazon could improve viewership by focusing on quality over quantity. More respondents said they'd watch more Prime Video if it had better content than said they want more content.That's what Netflix has been doing. Despite its ballooning budget, it's focused more on producing and licensing high-quality content versus simply licensing more content. CEO Reed Hastings noted, "When you spend on the big items they go much, much further than a whole lot of substitutable content," during the company's first-quarter earnings call in 2016.Can Amazon create more must-have content?Amazon has had a few hits in its first few years of developing content -- The Man in the High Castle and The Grand Tour -- but very few of its series are considered on the same level as Netflix or HBO originals.Amazon is taking steps to change that. It paid $250 million for the rights to produce a Lord of the Rings series. It's also committed to keep investing in video this year (although it's not clear how much of that investment will go to content targeted toward an international audience).Amazon has found Prime members that watch video renew their subscriptions at a higher rate and spend more on average. Additionally, developing a few tentpole series could help Amazon attract a whole new group of subscribers to its $99 per year loyalty program. Ultimately, that ought to provide a boost in sales since Prime members spend more on average than non-members, a pattern that's held true even as Prime membership has grown.To be sure, Amazon's 90 million Prime households represent the upper end of Netflix's 60 million to 90 million long-term goal for U.S. subscribers. But since Prime offers so much more value than Netflix, it has the potential to reach many more customers. While Amazon continues to grow quickly and take share of the online retail market, it still has room to improve.

The Fed chairman added that he doesn’t think a U.S. recession is in the cards this year and that the economy is on “solid” footing.Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 all finished at the highs of the session amid Powell’s comments. Boeing and Caterpillar were the standout Dow performers on the session, rising 2.6% and 2%, respectively.Boeing was boosted by a bullish Morgan Stanley upgrade calling for a 30% pop in the stock. Considering the aerospace giant is fresh off revealing a 20% dividend hike and a new $20 billion buyback program — among having a strong $417 billion worth of commercial plane backlog — the price target hike makes sense.  Highlight: Boeing shares have been upgraded by Morgan Stanley. "Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg was very bullish on the upgrade cycle 4 or 5 months ago," says @briansozzi.https://t.co/ObzMOMFjVy pic.twitter.com/5NKE8cNb9z— Yahoo Finance (@YahooFinance) January 10, 2019 All in all, the market’s overall resilience on Thursday is notable as several prominent retailers reported mixed holiday sales results.Here is what you missed in the world of finance on Thursday.Retail bloodbath.After a blistering start to the holiday shopping season on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, retailers such as Macy’s and Kohl’s hinted strongly Thursday that sales weakened in mid-December and trailed off after Christmas. Sales appear tepid into January, too, despite the stock market’s rebound from the now infamous “Christmas Eve Massacre.”Shares of Macy’s and Kohl’s dropped 17.6% and 4.8%, respectively, on the day.The clear holiday winners were Target and Costco. Target’s holiday sales rose 5.6%, the retailer said on Thursday. Costco said same-store sales gained 6.1%. Costco shares rose slightly on the session. Target’s stock fell 3%.The million dollar question after seeing these results: Has the U.S. consumer pulled back as a result of the stock market’s steep drop in December?Amazon spying zombie Sears and Kmart stores?Yahoo Finance’s Krystal Hu reports that Amazon is looking to open Whole Foods stores in former Sears and Kmart locations. Doing so could get Whole Foods into more rural locations on the cheap.The idea shouldn’t come as a complete shock.

3 growth stocks that could put amazon's returns to shame

And even if you had bought shares of the e-commerce juggernaut a mere five years ago, you still would have seen the value of your investment climb more than 600%.Of course, the reasons for Amazon's astronomical rise are clear in hindsight. But are there any other stocks on the market today that could put Amazon's returns to shame?We asked three top Motley Fool contributors to weigh in to that end. Read on to learn why they like JD.com (NASDAQ: JD), OrganiGram (NASDAQOTH: OGRMF), and Denison Mines (NYSEMKT: DNN).Two line charts indicating stock market gainsMoreIMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Consider this "Amazon of China"Steve Symington (JD.com): Chinese e-commerce leader JD.com, the so-called "Amazon of China," is a $46 billion business as measured by market capitalization, as of this writing. But it's dwarfed by the $942 billion juggernaut Amazon has become.So how can JD.com potentially rival the size -- and, most importantly, the shareholder value-creating ability -- of its American counterpart? While its biggest rival, Alibaba,  serves as more of an online marketplace like eBay, JD.com delivers products purchased through its JD Mall platform directly to Chinese consumers. And JD is forsaking bottom-line profits in favor of investing heavily in its logistics, warehousing, and delivery infrastructure to build a sustainable Amazon-esque advantage in the Middle Kingdom. Better yet, shares of JD have fallen nearly 40% from their 52-week high set in January, most recently pulling back amid economic tensions and trade war concerns between the U.S. and China. JD's long-term story remains firmly intact, however, and I think the stock could easily trounce Amazon's returns for patient investors who buy now.This "budding" small-cap has a real shot to outpace Amazon Sean Williams (OrganiGram Holdings): Trying to top Amazon is a very difficult task, considering just how much cash flow the king of e-commerce can generate. But if any industry has a shot, it's marijuana. The company that I believe could wow investors in the years to come is Atlantic-based grower OrganiGram Holdings.Back in July, I had the pleasure of conducting an email interview with the CEO of OrganiGram Holdings, Greg Engel. And while I was already a fan of what the company was doing, relative to its cannabis peers, I felt even more positive about its future following some of his explanations and answers.In particular, I don't believe there's a marijuana grower that's using its growing capacity more efficiently than OrganiGram. The company has a three-tiered growing system that it estimates will yield 113,000 kilograms of cannabis-equivalent product despite only 490,000 square feet of growing space at its Moncton, New Brunswick, facility. Meanwhile, I can think of other grow sites that have in excess of 1 million square feet of growing capacity and are up to 30,000 kilograms lighter in expected annual yield than OrganiGram.That leads to the next point: location. The company has chosen to expand its capacity entirely at Moncton. Though OrganiGram is sort of forgotten, given its Atlantic-based roots -- most growers are located in British Columbia and Ontario -- its single site helps the company centralize and lower its costs. That should give it a genuine shot at some of the lowest per-gram grow costs in the entire industry.Story continuesInvestors will also appreciate OrganiGram's focus on alternative cannabis products, such as cannabis oil. Though most folks are paying attention to dried cannabis production, its higher-margin oils, which Engel expects will comprise half of all medical marijuana sales, could be crucial in jump-starting the company's operating margins.Even though OrganiGram won't be up to peak production until the second half of 2020, I expect this company to turn heads and surprise a lot of people.High risk, high reward and little downsideReuben Gregg Brewer (Denison Mines): Compared with Amazon, Denison Mines, with its $270 million market cap, is an afterthought of a company. Its main asset, the Wheeler River uranium project, is a mine that isn't even built yet. In fact, it's only just entering the pre-feasibility stage, meaning it's still largely on the drawing board and awaiting more approvals.   But it could be a very big mine when it's ready, ranking in the top five globally. And while uranium prices are low today, that's a good thing for Denison and its investors, since the stock can be bought for around $0.50 a share. That limits the downside to, literally, 50 pennies. And the upside could be huge. That's because today's oversupplied uranium market looks set to flip to being undersupplied in just a few years, as the 57 nuclear power projects under development today get completed. Supporting this outlook are production curtailments at some of the largest uranium miners in the world, in an effort to balance current supply with current demand, Cameco included.     DNN ChartMoreDNN data by YChartsSo Denison could end up with a mine opening right when prices are heading higher. The last time uranium prices were peaking, meanwhile, Denison's stock was up over $12 a share. If the miner's stock price follows that path again, the upside here could be huge. And with no debt on the balance sheet, it seems well positioned to make it through the costly construction process. For more aggressive investors, Denison is a low-cost option on higher uranium prices.The bottom lineIt might seem Amazon has set the bar impossibly high, and nobody can know for sure whether these three stocks will go on to jump over it. But between JD.com's Amazon-esque position in China, OrganiGram's efficiency and focus on alternative cannabis products, and the potential for Denison Mines to benefit as uranium prices rise, we think chances are high that they could do just that.

Read on to learn why they like JD.com (NASDAQ: JD), OrganiGram (NASDAQOTH: OGRMF), and Denison Mines (NYSEMKT: DNN).Two line charts indicating stock market gainsMoreIMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.Consider this "Amazon of China"Steve Symington (JD.com): Chinese e-commerce leader JD.com, the so-called "Amazon of China," is a $46 billion business as measured by market capitalization, as of this writing. But it's dwarfed by the $942 billion juggernaut Amazon has become.So how can JD.com potentially rival the size -- and, most importantly, the shareholder value-creating ability -- of its American counterpart? While its biggest rival, Alibaba,  serves as more of an online marketplace like eBay, JD.com delivers products purchased through its JD Mall platform directly to Chinese consumers. And JD is forsaking bottom-line profits in favor of investing heavily in its logistics, warehousing, and delivery infrastructure to build a sustainable Amazon-esque advantage in the Middle Kingdom. Better yet, shares of JD have fallen nearly 40% from their 52-week high set in January, most recently pulling back amid economic tensions and trade war concerns between the U.S. and China. JD's long-term story remains firmly intact, however, and I think the stock could easily trounce Amazon's returns for patient investors who buy now.This "budding" small-cap has a real shot to outpace Amazon Sean Williams (OrganiGram Holdings): Trying to top Amazon is a very difficult task, considering just how much cash flow the king of e-commerce can generate. But if any industry has a shot, it's marijuana. The company that I believe could wow investors in the years to come is Atlantic-based grower OrganiGram Holdings.Back in July, I had the pleasure of conducting an email interview with the CEO of OrganiGram Holdings, Greg Engel. And while I was already a fan of what the company was doing, relative to its cannabis peers, I felt even more positive about its future following some of his explanations and answers.In particular, I don't believe there's a marijuana grower that's using its growing capacity more efficiently than OrganiGram. The company has a three-tiered growing system that it estimates will yield 113,000 kilograms of cannabis-equivalent product despite only 490,000 square feet of growing space at its Moncton, New Brunswick, facility. Meanwhile, I can think of other grow sites that have in excess of 1 million square feet of growing capacity and are up to 30,000 kilograms lighter in expected annual yield than OrganiGram.That leads to the next point: location. The company has chosen to expand its capacity entirely at Moncton. Though OrganiGram is sort of forgotten, given its Atlantic-based roots -- most growers are located in British Columbia and Ontario -- its single site helps the company centralize and lower its costs. That should give it a genuine shot at some of the lowest per-gram grow costs in the entire industry.Story continuesInvestors will also appreciate OrganiGram's focus on alternative cannabis products, such as cannabis oil. Though most folks are paying attention to dried cannabis production, its higher-margin oils, which Engel expects will comprise half of all medical marijuana sales, could be crucial in jump-starting the company's operating margins.Even though OrganiGram won't be up to peak production until the second half of 2020, I expect this company to turn heads and surprise a lot of people.High risk, high reward and little downsideReuben Gregg Brewer (Denison Mines): Compared with Amazon, Denison Mines, with its $270 million market cap, is an afterthought of a company. Its main asset, the Wheeler River uranium project, is a mine that isn't even built yet. In fact, it's only just entering the pre-feasibility stage, meaning it's still largely on the drawing board and awaiting more approvals.   But it could be a very big mine when it's ready, ranking in the top five globally. And while uranium prices are low today, that's a good thing for Denison and its investors, since the stock can be bought for around $0.50 a share. That limits the downside to, literally, 50 pennies. And the upside could be huge. That's because today's oversupplied uranium market looks set to flip to being undersupplied in just a few years, as the 57 nuclear power projects under development today get completed. Supporting this outlook are production curtailments at some of the largest uranium miners in the world, in an effort to balance current supply with current demand, Cameco included.     DNN ChartMoreDNN data by YChartsSo Denison could end up with a mine opening right when prices are heading higher. The last time uranium prices were peaking, meanwhile, Denison's stock was up over $12 a share. If the miner's stock price follows that path again, the upside here could be huge. And with no debt on the balance sheet, it seems well positioned to make it through the costly construction process. For more aggressive investors, Denison is a low-cost option on higher uranium prices.The bottom lineIt might seem Amazon has set the bar impossibly high, and nobody can know for sure whether these three stocks will go on to jump over it. But between JD.com's Amazon-esque position in China, OrganiGram's efficiency and focus on alternative cannabis products, and the potential for Denison Mines to benefit as uranium prices rise, we think chances are high that they could do just that.

3 stocks that could put amazon's returns to shame
3 Stocks That Could Put Amazon's Returns to ShameYahooSearchNo matching results for ''Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsGive feedback on the new search experienceCancelSign inMailFinanceWatchlistsMy PortfolioScreenersMarketsIndustriesVideosNewsPersonal FinanceTechU.S. Markets closedS&P 5002,905.03+4.58(+0.16%)Dow 3026,559.54+110.00(+0.42%)Nasdaq7,998.06+1.98(+0.02%)Russell 20001,565.75-1.85(-0.12%)Crude Oil64.000.00(0.00%)Gold1,277.90+1.90(+0.15%)Silver14.97+0.01(+0.07%)EUR/USD1.12470.0000(-0.0000%)3 Stocks That Could Put Amazon's Returns to ShameAnders Bylund, Chuck Saletta, and Leo Sun, The Motley FoolMotley FoolJanuary 20, 2018ReblogShareTweetShareOnline retailer and cloud-computing pioneer Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) has delivered fabulous returns for long-term shareholders. Investors in the 1997 initial public offering have scored a heart-stopping 75,000% return so far -- including a 380% gain in the last five years alone. This juggernaut is not slowing down.So what would it take to outperform Amazon in today's stock market? We took that question to a handful of your fellow investors here at The Motley Fool, and they were quick to shoot back a few intriguing ideas.Read on to see why they think Chinese e-tailer JD.com (NASDAQ: JD), retail giant Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE: WMT), and fiber-optic components maker NeoPhotonics (NYSE: NPTN) can do better than Amazon for new investors today.A young man, tablet in hand, celebrates good news with a fist pumpMoreThis could be you, checking out your returns on these investments. Image source: Getty Images.Don't overlook this Chinese e-tailerLeo Sun (JD.com): Most investors see Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) as the undisputed king of the Chinese e-commerce market. However, its biggest rival JD.com -- which is often compared to Amazon -- might have more room to run.Alibaba's Tmall controlled 51.3% of the Chinese e-commerce market in the second quarter of 2017, according to Analysys International Enfodesk. JD.com came in second with a 32.9% share. But back in 2014, Tmall controlled 54.6% of the market, while JD.com controlled just 17.7%.JD.com's growth is attributed to two major tailwinds. First, JD.com gained ground as smaller B2C (business to consumer) marketplaces flopped. Second, Chinese consumers retreated from dodgy C2C (consumer to consumer) marketplaces like Alibaba's Taobao and prioritized quality and authenticity over low prices. JD.com capitalized on that shift and touted its reputation as a quality-oriented B2C marketplace that cracks down on counterfeit goods, while publicly chastising Alibaba's quality-control issues.The company also partnered with Wal-Mart, Tencent, flash-sale site Vipshop, and other companies in data-sharing or order-streamlining deals to widen its moat against Alibaba. It also launched a drone delivery service for rural areas last year.JD.com's revenue rose 44% last year, but it posted a net loss. However, it squeezed out profits over the past four quarters, and analysts expect it to post its first annual profit this year as its revenues grow another 39%. Therefore, this stock still looks primed for some big gains over the next few years.Future returns are what matter to investorsChuck Saletta (Wal-Mart): Amazon's past investment returns have been impressive, but what matters to investors is how well their shares will perform in the future. On that front, Amazon's retail archrival Wal-Mart looks like it might be a much stronger investment today than Amazon.The table below shows a handful of key measures for both companies. Wal-Mart wallops Amazon from the perspectives of revenue, earnings, and balance-sheet strength, yet Amazon has more than twice the market capitalization of Wal-Mart. That gap is likely not sustainable, and thus Wal-Mart may actually be positioned for stronger future returns than Amazon.   Company   Market Cap   Trailing Revenue   Trailing Earnings   Debt-to-Equity Ratio       Wal-Mart   $309 billion   $495 billion   $11.4 billion   0.64     Amazon   $623 billion   $161 billion   $1.9 billion   1.75   Data source: Yahoo! Finance.While Amazon's tremendous growth rate justifies something of a premium valuation, it's hard to accept that every dollar of Amazon's revenue should be worth six times Wal-Mart's (twice the market cap for one-third the revenue). That's especially true given that Wal-Mart's profit margin rate and absolute dollars of profit are well ahead of Amazon's. Thus, while bulls on Amazon point to its ability to reinvest cash into growing its business, the reality is that Wal-Mart is also willing to invest in fighting back to growth.Story continuesIndeed, Wal-Mart's recent investments in its e-commerce platform and its buy-online, pick-up-in-store program are generally acknowledged as key drivers of its recent growth. As consumers get used to combining the convenience of online ordering with the speed of in-store pickup at Wal-Mart, Amazon may find itself in the unusual spot of needing to invest merely to catch up.Temporary trouble in big ChinaAnders Bylund (NeoPhotonics): If you want to reach for huge returns, you have to accept a little risk. NeoPhotonics makes optoelectronic components for use in high-speed optical networking equipment, and it's deep in the doldrums right now. The future doesn't even have to be all that great in order to give NeoPhotonics investors a fantastic return on their investment -- a simple return to normal market conditions would be plenty.The company was firing on all cylinders at the end of 2016. Fourth-quarter sales came in 23% above the year-ago period's, clients were clamoring for NeoPhotonics' latest and fastest modules that could handle 100 gigabits of data per second, and share prices reached multiyear highs.Then an important part of NeoPhotonics' distribution network in China filed for bankruptcy, throwing a large spanner into the works. On top of that, sector peers have reported generally slow business in China and North America, as telecoms and their equipment providers hammer out plans for the next wave of infrastructure upgrades.So revenues plunged 35% lower in the next quarterly report, and the company has delivered a string of negative operating profits ever since. Share prices came crashing down, falling as much as 75% below those late-2016 highs before stabilizing.Today, NeoPhotonics has mended its Chinese infrastructure and introduced even faster networking modules. Management expects to a quick return to predictable revenue growth, including positive earnings by the middle of 2018.There's a substantial helping of downside risk here. NeoPhotonics burned $32 million of free cash in the third quarter of 2017. The company raised $30 million of new long-term debt in that quarter, and the cash balance is running low at just $71 million. But if management's rosy forecast works out as expected, that should be enough to see NeoPhotonics through these lean quarters to a fresh stretch of explosive growth.The optical networking industry will remain important and valuable for the long run, notwithstanding the slowness of 2017. Newer, faster, and better networks are coming soon, and all of them will need fiber-optic components to connect everything to the internet at large.Let's just hope that NeoPhotonics sticks around until the big bounce starts -- or gets picked up by a more fortunate rival along the way. Either way, this unprofitable stock offers a tempting risk-reward balance today.

3 Top Stocks to Buy for 2018 and BeyondYahooSearchNo matching results for ''Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsGive feedback on the new search experienceCancelSign inMailFinanceWatchlistsMy PortfolioScreenersMarketsIndustriesVideosNewsPersonal FinanceTechU.S. Markets closedS&P 5002,905.03+4.58(+0.16%)Dow 3026,559.54+110.00(+0.42%)Nasdaq7,998.06+1.98(+0.02%)Russell 20001,565.75-1.85(-0.12%)Crude Oil64.000.00(0.00%)Gold1,277.90+1.90(+0.15%)Silver14.97+0.01(+0.07%)EUR/USD1.12470.0000(-0.0000%)3 Top Stocks to Buy for 2018 and BeyondDaniel Sparks, The Motley FoolMotley FoolDecember 14, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareThe new year represents a great time to invest in stocks. Not only is it when many people are setting New Year's resolutions, but it's also a good reminder of the limited-time investors have to make qualifying IRA contributions. Of course, the challenge for those who are considering investing in stocks as the New Year comes and goes is deciding which stocks to invest in.For patient investors willing to invest for the long haul, a great place to start their search is with established and profitable market leaders. Three good examples of quality companies who have carved out strong leadership positions in their markets are Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Walt Disney (NYSE: DIS), and Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN).Here's why these stocks represent compelling long-term investments -- and why you should consider buying them today.A business person drawing a five-star ratingMoreImage source: Getty Images.AppleAs the world's most valuable publicly traded company, some investors might assume there's little upside left for the tech giant. But this couldn't be further from the truth.Not only is Apple still growing, with management guiding for all-time record quarterly revenue in its first quarter of fiscal 2018 of $84 to $87 billion (up 7% to 11% compared to the year-ago period), but earnings per share are rising even more sharply -- a trend that looks poised to continue thanks to the company's hefty free cash flow that enables it to spend billions repurchasing its shares. Apple's earnings per share in the trailing 12 months has risen 11% year over year, and EPS in Apple's most recent quarter jumped 17% year over year.Best of all, investors can buy Apple at a conservative valuation. The stock currently has a price-to-earnings ratio of just under 19. This compares to an average P/E of 25 for stocks in the S&P 500.Walt DisneyUnlike Apple, Disney has struggled to grow revenue and EPS recently.  Revenue and EPS in the trailing 12 months are both down about 1% year over year. However, year-to-year volatility of the company's studio entertainment business is one of the main reasons for this decline -- and a 10,000-foot view of the segment suggests the pullback in segment operating income is only temporary. Last year, Disney benefited from the blockbuster success of the Star Wars franchise, making comparisons in fiscal 2017 difficult. But thanks to Disney's large portfolio of powerful movie franchises and an ever-growing pipeline of new releases, the company has proven time and time again it can set new records.Chris Hemsworth as Thor in Thor: RagnarokMoreStory continuesChris Hemsworth as Thor in Thor: Ragnarok. Image source: Walt Disney.Looking ahead, Disney is positioning itself to better monetize its content while simultaneously removing some of the volatility of its studio business. By launching its own streaming services -- an ESPN service early next year and a Disney-branded service in the second half of 2019 -- Disney can bring its content directly to consumers, offer a better experience, and raise prices over time as it builds out its content libraries.Of course, investors who buy Disney are taking on some risk by betting management can turn around declining operating income at ESPN. Disney CEO Bob Iger suggests this won't be a problem as the company capitalizes on the opportunities provided by an evolving media landscape. But it's possible that headwinds at ESPN prove to be more permanent than management anticipates.Helping account for some of the risk of reinvigorating its ESPN business, Disney also trades conservatively, with price-to-earnings ratio just under 19.Amazon.comAmazon's growth has surprisingly reaccelerated recently, proving the company's aggressive investment strategy is paying off. Revenue in its third quarter climbed 34% year over year, or 29% year over year when excluding sales from Amazon's recently closed acquisition of Whole Foods. Revenue in Amazon's second and first quarter of 2017 and its fourth quarter of 2016 increased 25%, 23%, and 22% year over year, respectively, driving home how nicely growth has reaccelerated. And looking to Amazon's fourth quarter, the company has guided for revenue to rise a wild 28% to 38% year over year.Amazon boxes in Amazon fulfillment centerMoreImage source: Amazon.com.This acceleration in revenue growth comes as Amazon has been investing aggressively in its international expansion, new fulfillment centers, digital content, and its highly profitable Amazon Web Services business. With growth reaccelerating, investors should be encouraged by management's ongoing commitment to making ambitious investments in its growth areas -- something management remains committed to.Investors will have to pay a significant premium to buy into Amazon's growth story. The stock has a price-to-sales ratio of 3.5, compared with an average price-to-sales ratio of 2.8 in the specialty retail industry -- an industry that includes peers like eBay, Best Buy, and Alibaba.Of course, investors who buy Amazon are betting the e-commerce giant can boost its profit margin over time and significantly increase its earnings. This expectation is particularly evidenced by the stock's price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 300. Fortunately, Amazon has already demonstrated its adeptness at multiplying profits over time; its trailing-12-month net income of $1.9 billion dwarfs its net income of $600 million in 2015 and its loss of $241 million in 2014.Durable investmentsMost importantly, all three of these companies possess significant competitive advantages. Apple boasts industry-leading pricing power and profitability thanks to its powerful brand. Disney commands pricing power and customer loyalty by wielding its globally renowned intangible assets and its reputation for quality entertainment. And Amazon's economies of scale in both e-commerce and commercial cloud services is unmatched.Combining their strong competitive advantages with expectations for further growth at all three companies, these are the sort of stocks that have a good shot at beating the market over the long haul.

But the company continues to choose new opportunities. Amazon is willing to try its hand at almost any sort of business, does well at the bulk of them - and threatens to destroy dozens of other companies with its success.The latest foray into unfamiliar territory? The June acquisition of PillPack turns Amazon into a mail-order pharmacy, with a twist. PillPack packs all pills it dispenses into individual bags, each with a unique time and date to be consumed by the customer.That's not Amazon's first venture outside its space. Amazon's also a grocer, a fashion venue, a peddler of handmade crafts and even a video game developer, just to name a few.As a result, Amazon has become at best a headache, at worst a survival threat, for any rival organization in its past. Indeed, in November, we tallied up 32 companies that looked like potential victims of Amazon's never-ending expansion. Today, we're looking at 49 companies Amazon could kill - a few updates of the original list, but also an alarming number of new outfits that have fallen into Amazon's crosshairs - as well as one confirmed kill.SEE ALSO: Millionaires in America: All 50 States RankedAdvance Auto Parts, AutoZone, O'Reilly AutomotiveGetty ImagesThe unchecked growth of Amazon didn't faze auto parts suppliers like O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), AutoZone (AZO) and Advance Auto Parts (AAP) for a long time. Car parts are too heavy, bulky and specialized to be handled like a consumer-centric commodity. And besides, when mechanics (DIYers or the real thing) need a part to use in a repair, they usually want it quickly. The big three names in the auto parts retailing game haven't needed to worry.But times have changed, helped along by inventory-management technology and delivery networks that are willing and able to handle goods they simply couldn't before. That's why Amazon was willing to enter the fray in January 2017.It didn't take long for brick-and-mortar operators to notice. AutoZone shares fell 27% during the first half of 2017, reflecting a first-quarter revenue and earnings miss. O'Reilly hit a similar headwind in Q2 2017 as well, as did Advance Auto Parts.All three stocks have since recovered, as the market realizes Amazon hasn't yet unleashed the same havoc realizing Amazon hasn't unleashed the same kind of havoc on the auto parts retailing industry that it has on other consumer-facing markets. Give it time though. The fact that a little more than half of this trio's business, on average, comes from consumers rather than mechanics, it's a perfect opportunity for Amazon to become a disruptor.SEE ALSO: The Best and Worst Presidents (According to the Stock Market)Albertsons, Kroger, Walmart GroceryStory continuesGetty ImagesAmazon's purchase of Whole Foods Market sent shockwaves through the organic-grocery business, but just as vulnerable (albeit in a different way) are more conventional grocers such as Kroger (KR), privately owned Albertsons and the grocery arm of Walmart (WMT).Yes, Whole Foods and Kroger somewhat overlap, particularly since Kroger has stepped up its organic and whole foods offering. But it's not the brick-and-mortar alternative that should worry Kroger shareholders the most. More concerning is that consumers are increasingly comfortable with the idea of ordering their potato chips, laundry detergent and ground coffee from Amazon.com, just like they order office supplies or books.Recent numbers from industry research outfit One Click Retail tell the story. Since the end of last year, Amazon has sold 18% of all groceries purchased online in the United States, making it the biggest online grocer despite more recognizable names in the business also offering online ordering. The firm estimates the company sold $650 million worth of groceries in the second quarter of this year, up 40% on a year-over-year basis. Beverages, of all things, are likely to be Amazon.com's best-selling grocery category.As time rolls on, more people raised in the internet era are becoming comfortable with the idea of not shopping in an actual grocery store. This shift plays right into Amazon's hand.SEE ALSO: 25 Stocks Every Retiree Should OwnAudiobooks.com, PlaysterGetty ImagesMusic isn't the only audio Amazon.com can digitally deliver. It's also the owner of Audible, which boasts the largest audiobook library in the world. It's a direct threat to (among others) Audiobooks.com and Playster.Don't dismiss this market's importance. Although audio books only generated $2.5 billion worth of revenue in the United States last year, the size of the market is not only growing, it's accelerating. In the first quarter, the industry's revenue was up 32% year-over-year, extending a longstanding hot streak.What was largely missing from the audiobook landscape for a long time was a central name, playing the role Netflix (NFLX) played within the streaming video arena in mainstreaming the audio books.Amazon largely has become that player.Audible controls about 41% of the audio book market, as of the most recent look. And, like Netflix, being the first to become the dominant, defining force in a particular market leaves little room for a second or third player ... which is all Playster and Audiobooks.com are in a position to enjoy from here. But playing second fiddle to Amazon in any business is a problem, especially when Audible can be sold as part of an Amazon Prime package.SEE ALSO: 45 Smart Financial Moves You Can Make in an Hour or LessBarnes & Noble, Joseph-Beth BooksellersGetty ImagesBookstore chain Barnes & Noble (BKS) and Joseph-Beth Booksellers were the first major victims of the rise of Amazon. Remember: Initially, Amazon.com was an online bookstore, and the advent of e-readers - then tablets - made e-books commonplace, further displacing physical bookstores.One end result for B&N is 11 consecutive years of declining sales, and the 12th appears to be underway. Another end result: nine straight years of net store closures.The matter may get worse, too. CEO Demos Parneros was terminated after only 14 months on the job during which he presumably couldn't drive any measurable change. A statement from the company only said Demos had violated corporate policies, and further made a point of saying it wasn't a matter of fraud or misreporting of results.Such a disruption here only exacerbates the underlying problem.Global Data Retail analyst Neil Saunders explains the challenge bluntly and succinctly, saying, "People may drop in for a browse but they won't make a dedicated trip to a bookstore. They don't have the need and they don't have the time. The way people shop changed, and that's been detrimental for Barnes & Noble." Ditto for tiny Joseph-Beth, which has four stores left in the U.S.SEE ALSO: 25 Dividend Stocks That Analysts Love MostBeam, Dailymotion, Hitbox, Mixer, YouTube Gaming and MoreGetty ImagesThere are a number of specific gaming companies that, with the exception of YouTube Gaming, won't ring any bells with investors. But within video gaming circles, Hitbox, Mixer, Dailymotion, Beam and a whole slew of other non-descript names are plenty familiar. All of these organizations have developed platform that let gaming fans pay to watch other people play video games.Yes, it's a real thing. Last year nearly 700 million people watched someone else play a game, though some suggest the figure is actually closer to 1 billion, depending on how it's measured.What does that have to do with Amazon?Amazon.com is the owner and operator of Twitch, which is the world's most popular destination to watch other individuals play video games. Not unlike YouTube, the maker of the video and Amazon split any subscription revenue created by a particular gamer's channel, so that player has an incentive to do well and grow his or her audience.It's possible there's room for more than one player in the game-streaming space. It's unlikely there's room for more than one dominant player. For the same reason Facebook (FB) became the place where the world can gather online, the biggest crowd attracts the best game players, and the best game players attract an increasingly bigger crowd.SEE ALSO: 53 Best Dividend Stocks for 2018 and BeyondBest BuyGetty ImagesThere's no denying that electronics retailer Best Buy (BBY) pulled off a miracle.The deeper Amazon.com waded into the consumer electronics market, the more trouble Best Buy found itself in. By 2012, chatter about Best Buy's impending doom was common. Many presumed the company would follow in Circuit City's footsteps to bankruptcy, as Amazon was simply too competitive.A funny thing happened on the road to oblivion. Turnaround artist Hubert Joly took the helm that year and began working on a turnaround plan to save Best Buy. It worked, at least according to Joly. He flatly said earlier this year, "We have turned around the business, it's about where we go from here. We have not only survived but thrived and I don't believe this is a winner-takes-all market."Last quarter's numbers suggest there's some truth to the matter. Company-wide revenue was up 6.8%, and same-store sales grew 7.1%.Hold off on the victory lap. Best Buy wasn't facing the most difficult of comps last quarter, and it remains to be seen whether there's a growth trajectory in place or if Best Buy is simply lifting the revenue plateau to a slightly higher level. It will take a few more quarters to know for sure. In the meantime, Amazon is undoubtedly going to push back, reminding Best Buy that it's tough to fight a sustained war against a bigger army.SEE ALSO: 15 Consumer Stocks That Deliver Dividend Growth Like ClockworkBlender, Godot, HeroEngine, Unity and MoreGetty ImagesMajor video game publishing outfits such as Activision-Blizzard (ATVI) and Electronic Arts (EA) will be forced to face off with Amazon at some point in the future. Both those companies are big enough and well-grounded enough to hold their own, however.The same can't be said for all the smaller, "indie" game developers and game-engine providers such as HeroEngine, Unity, Blender, Godot and more, which eventually could feel the pressure from Amazon.Confused? You're not alone. Though most investors - and even most gamers - don't know it, Amazon has a hand in the video game development arena. It owns a game engine called Lumberyard, allowing developers and designers free access to this solid technology licensed from a company called Crytek. Games such as Crucible and Star Citizen are some of the early AAA games the Amazon platform has produced.You've heard little about this because the whole effort still is in its infancy. It's possible not even Amazon really knows where it's going. So it's not entirely clear who should be worried about Amazon's potential push.Given Amazon's sheer size and strength, though, any of the smaller players in the highly fragmented game development industry should fear what Amazon may try to do once it feels Lumberyard is ready to promote in a big way.SEE ALSO: RBC Capital's 10 Best Tech Stocks to Buy for 2025Blue Apron, Hello Fresh, PlatedGetty ImagesNo one disputes Amazon.com has mastered the art of delivering anything and everything that isn't perishable, but what about pre-packaged meals? Yep, the e-commerce company can do that too. It got into the business in the middle of last year, and it has since stepped up its game. Its entry into the race is a direct threat to the likes of rival meal kit outfits Blue Apron (APRN), Hello Fresh and Plated.The marketability and viability of the so-called "pure plays" in the business were never all that strong. They're all subject to the changing - usually rising - price of food, and it takes massive scale to make meal kits cost-effective enough to turn into a sustainable business. Blue Apron, for instance, is one of the biggest names in the business yet still is nowhere near profitability.Another unsavory reality of the meal kit biz: Roughly three-fourths of Blue Apron's and HelloFresh's customers stop buying them (on a regular basis anyway) within about six months. The idea is creative, but not necessarily one with longevity.To the extent there is a viable meal kit market, though, Amazon.com has an edge. Two edges, actually. One of them is the fact that Amazon regularly serves more than 300 million customers, enough of whom will test drive a meal kit. The other edge is that Amazon doesn't have to turn a profit selling pre-packaged meals. It can extract a profit from those customers by selling them other products and services.SEE ALSO: Why Blue Apron Was a Bust in My MarriageDuracell, Energizer HoldingsGetty ImagesEnergizer Holdings (ENR), which of course is the name behind Energizer batteries, clearly is one of the most recognizable names in the business, as is Duracell, which is held by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B).Batteries currently sold under Amazon's "Basics" label don't exactly inspire deep brand loyalty.Don't dismiss the potential of Amazon's entry into the seemingly boring business. In the United States alone, the battery business (including the automotive component of the market) is worth roughly $17 billion per year, and Amazon already outsells all other battery brands in the U.S. As of last year, Amazon.com sold a little more than 30% of all consumer-electronics-sized batteries for use in the United States, versus Energizer's market share of around 12%. Duracell is holding up a little better, sporting roughly 21% of last year's non-rechargeable battery business in the U.S.It's unlikely either brand will ever be wiped out completely. But Amazon doesn't even really promote its Basics battery other than as an add-on purchase at its website, and yet it already has proven disruptive to the two biggest brands in the business.SEE ALSO: The 25 Best Low-Fee Mutual Funds You Can BuyEducents, Teachers Pay TeachersGetty ImagesTeachers Pay Teachers is an unconventional, though brilliant, business idea. Rather than proverbially re-create the wheel, teachers can create structured classroom handouts and materials, then sell them to other (often overworked) teachers who may not have the time to do so for themselves.It's not exactly clear how big the market is. Owler provides an estimate of $5.8 million in annual revenues for Teachers pay Teachers, but the ecosystem of the money its 80,000 contributors earn is much larger. Last year, they collectively banked more than $100 million. For perspective, the textbook market in the United States alone is worth roughly $11 billion per year.Amazon's increasingly disruptive role in the middle of that melee is its relatively new Amazon Inspire site, which is "an open collaboration service that helps teachers to easily discover, gather, and share quality educational content with their community."The problem for Teachers Pay Teachers, Educents and all their peers? Amazon Inspire is free to use.That may or may not always be the case, but as long as it's free, it's a threat to for-profit sites in the same arena. Conversely, should Amazon eventually opt to make it a profit center, it's apt to turn up the heat on promoting Amazon Inspire. That could prove highly disruptive to the other venues that have commercialized DIY classroom materials.EtsyGetty ImagesEtsy (ETSY) was, and is, a brilliant idea.Some things are just not meant to be made or sold in bulk. Handmade one-of-a-kinds still have a place in consumers' hearts, but makers of these goods are facing an increasingly tough time in just being able to show their wares to an increasingly distracted market. By bringing a huge number of artisans under one roof and then promoting the entire collection, Etsy has successfully melded an old-school idea with the new.But Amazon noticed, and responded. In 2015, the e-commerce giant launched Amazon Handmade, taking a stab at Etsy.Amazon's disruption of Etsy has been hit and miss. Etsy's revenue grew 30% year-over-year last quarter, and the company upped its full-year revenue guidance, too. Clearly Etsy is doing something right under the relatively new leadership of former eBay (EBAY) executive Josh Silverman.Still, Amazon may slowly but surely taking a toll - or at least forcing Etsy to take a toll on itself. In July, Etsy upped the transaction fee it charges merchants from 3.5% to 5.0%, inciting enough grumbling among some of its sellers that it's a legitimate fear many of them will look elsewhere ... such as Amazon. Amazon Handmade charges considerably more, but also boasts considerably more marketing firepower.Amazon appears to be playing the proverbial long game, planning to win the war by attrition.SEE ALSO: 20 Small Towns With Big Millionaire PopulationsFedEx, United Parcel ServiceGetty ImagesRide-hailing services Uber and Lyft were long thought to be potential victims of Amazon. Whispers that Lyft was aiming at parcel delivery were circulating, and Uber was waist-deep into the package-shipping business. Amazon was using contractors to deliver packages as well, though, and the foray into people transportation would have been an easy one.Amazon's focus is elsewhere, however. Rather than expands its network of delivery drivers, earlier this year it doubled down on building its own delivery chain using contractors. Called Amazon Delivery Service Partners, the company is encouraging individuals with an entrepreneurial spirit to build their own business by delivering Amazon-ordered parcels. Such a venture takes aim at the likes of United Parcel Service (UPS) and FedEx (FDX).The Amazon Delivery Service Partners venture isn't a direct, immediate threat to the existence of FedEx and UPS. Indeed, some of these deliveries may well be ones that those bigger logistics outfits don't want to do.Amazon isn't a company that thinks small, however. With a fleet of 32 delivery jets in operation and a growing fleet of trucks on the road, the next natural step is bridging the two and completely cutting out middlemen like FedEx and United Parcel Service from many of its delivery chains.GameStopGetty ImagesGameStop (GME) historically has made its money by serving as the middleman, but the game publishing industry's move toward downloads and away from discs and cartridges is increasingly making the venue less of a destination for gamers.Jefferies analyst Stephanie Wissink explained the problem in July, noting "We've observed meaningful valuation expansion across retailers where margin rates base, pricing power returns (inventory & markdown clean-up), and sector participation/consumption is healthy." Wissink added, however, that "GME has not participated in this reversal ... due in part to leadership turnover, lack of an articulated vision & direction, and overriding fears around software profit dependence."Don't misunderstand. GameStop also sells game downloads via its own website. Amazon does too. Neither venue is completely out of the loop when it comes to this paradigm shift underway within the gaming business.But Amazon.com induced 2.8 billion unique visits just over the course of the first half of the year. It simply draws a bigger crowd, and the gamers among them know they can buy downloads via the site. GameStop's website simply doesn't attract nearly as many people.The premise is evident in the numbers. Revenue has been drifting lower since 2011, and more often than not since 2012, the organization has reported slight declines in per-share profits. Its first quarter revenue was off to the tune of 5.5%, cutting profits roughly in half year-over-year.SEE ALSO: 10 Roughed-Up Stocks to Buy for a Recovery RallyHachette Books, Penguin Random HouseGetty ImagesInitially, the rise of Amazon.com was not only not a threat to book publishers; it was a benefit, making it easy for consumers to purchase a book rather than require a visit to an actual bookstore.Technology never stops marching forward, though. The development of e-books and e-readers has quelled the need for printing and shipping while simultaneously positioning Amazon.com as an e-book hub. For the crowd that still prefers the feel of paper and the look of a volume on a bookshelf, Amazon's Create Space can arrange for a book to be printed on-demand - even just one at a time.With that option on the table, traditional book publishers like Penguin Random House and Hachette Books are struggling to justify their new role as a middleman that doesn't bring any real value to the table. Amazon can do the marketing job too, or at least offer a platform that will allow an author to promote a book as effectively as a publishing house often does.The paradigm shift toward self-publishing continues to get traction too, democratizing the space in a way that accelerates that shift. Jeff Bezos noted in his most recent letter to shareholders that that more than 1,000 independent authors earned more than $100,000 using Kindle Direct Publishing last year. For 2017, Amazon paid out more than $200 million to its authors.The numbers prompt one key question: Who needs an old-school publisher?InterActiveCorp, YelpGetty ImagesMost consumers have heard of online business directory and review repository Yelp (YELP). Ditto for Angie's List, which was owned by InterActiveCorp (IAC) but later spun off into ANGI Homeservices (ANGI). What most consumers don't yet realize, however, is that Amazon is quietly encroaching into that market.It's called Amazon Home Services, and it looks a lot like Angie's List. Homeowners looking for anything ranging from tech support to housecleaning services to yardwork can browse Amazon's curated list of service providers and read reviews regarding their previous work. Angie's List and Yelp offer similar information. And while Yelp also serves up information about a variety of other consumer-facing businesses such as restaurants or retail stores, there's no denying that Amazon Home Services is a viable alternative source of information on many fronts.Given that Amazon already connects consumers with restaurants near them, adding reviews to the mix wouldn't be a major technical hurdle.Nothing is wrong with Yelp yet, at least not given its most recent quarterly earnings report. Sales were up 12% year-over-year, and per-share profits grew from 9 cents to 12 cents. But the company hasn't yet faced Amazon in a full-on fight.SEE ALSO: The 10 Best Tech Stocks of All TimeJo-Ann FabricsGetty ImagesEven something as mundane and common, yet garment-specific, as fabric could be upended by Amazon.At first glance, it doesn't appear Amazon has given its fabric and material business any particular special attention. Many of the sewing and craft supplies the website offers are featured on the same basic page used to sell all sorts of other goods, and the featured seller, Fabric.com, appears to be the beneficiary of the usual handoff Amazon makes when a customer needs something that can't be sold en masse.But take a closer look at the website that Amazon.com redirects you to when you click on the sizeable at the top of the "Fabrics" page. You're buying fabric by the yard from Fabric.com, but Fabric.com is wholly owned by Amazon.It's a very un-Amazon-like business, though the company knows something most consumers and investors don't: The fabric and sewing supply retailing market is worth about $4 billion per year, and globally, the textile market is expected to be worth more than $1 trillion by 2025.That's more Amazon-like! Amazon's edge in the arena is that it has the much-needed scale that most textile outlets and retailers don't. That's a problem for Jo-Ann Fabrics.Lululemon Athletica, Under ArmourGetty ImagesIf you own any activewear sporting the Goodsport, Rebel Canyon or Peak Velocity labels, you're actually wearing one of Amazon's homegrown house brands. The company got into the business for itself late last year.The foray was a modest one - more of an experiment than something meant to make a splash. It largely was meant to fill gaps left unfilled by the athletic apparel names that weren't offering the entire breadth of their lineup at Amazon.com. Most everything Amazon does, though, starts small and eventually gets big enough to become disruptive.It's a shot at names such as Lululemon Athletica (LULU) and Under Armour (UAA), which are well-recognized brands but fiscally struggling companies. Under Armour has been saddled by debt, while Lululemon is finding that an increasingly competitive environment isn't driving profits any higher despite rising revenue.Nike (NKE) is vulnerable too, but being the biggest and most respected name in the business, it could just as easily benefit from the fact that Amazon has put other activewear manufacturers on the defensive.It certainly wouldn't be a significant stretch to wreak some significant havoc in the semi-specialized apparel arena. Morgan Stanley noted earlier this year that Amazon.com already generates more U.S. apparel revenue than any other retailer, garnering 8.6% of the market for itself in 2017. And last year, online apparel sales grew 7% to make up more than 20% of the market, while in-store purchases fell 3%. Amazon is well-positioned to leverage its own athletic apparel into the equation.SEE ALSO: 5 Companies That Are Defying AmazonOffice Depot, StaplesGetty ImagesReminder: Office Depot (ODP) and OfficeMax are now one and the same company, having merged back in 2013 as a means of defending itself from the slow disintegration of the office supply business.Amazon.com - and Amazon Business in particular - put that disintegration into motion.It still wasn't enough. That's why Office Depot and privately held Staples sought a merger of their own a couple of years later, explaining that unless the two retailers worked as one, neither would survive. The Department of Justice didn't buy into the argument, however; it feared that whittling down the number of large brick-and-mortar office supply outfits would harm consumers.Little has changed since then. Office Depot managed to top its second-quarter earnings estimates, catapulting ODP shares higher, but a closer look at the Q2 report reveals that not all of the tepid growth was even organic. It was driven by acquisitions and new initiatives. Perhaps worse, the lackluster year-over-year results appear to be the new normal.Staples doesn't have to disclose its quarterly results, but it's difficult to see how it could be faring much better than ODP. Neither can compete with Amazon's prices, and low prices are everything to business customers.Pandora, SpotifyGetty ImagesWhen consumers mull their digital music options, Amazon Prime generally isn't a name that comes to mind. The race for online-radio mindshare has largely been won by the likes of Spotify or Pandora (P) ... or increasingly, Apple (AAPL), which was recently cultivated its own subscription-based service to complement the a la carte nature of its iTunes store.However, a wide swath of consumers are grooving to Amazon's beat. As of Q1, Amazon Music boasted 12.7 million regular/monthly users. That pales in comparison to the "Big Three" of Apple, Pandora and Spotify. But considering how little effort Amazon.com puts into music, that user base could ramp up quickly if Amazon turns up the heat.Amazon's exposure to the digital music market may actually be much bigger than it seems on the surface, too. That's because you also could include the number of Amazon Prime subscribers that take advantage of the Prime Music offer available to Prime members. There's no firm figure on how many people listen to some sort of online audio via Amazon, but the company said the number is in the "tens of millions."One small tweak in its music platform, then, could make Amazon alarmingly disruptive.SEE ALSO: 10 Apple Products That Changed Everything (And 10 That Didn't)Rite AidGetty ImagesRite Aid (RAD) actually earned a spot on Amazon's list of likely victims a few months ago - back when rumors were merely swirling that the e-commerce outfit was toying with the idea becoming a drug dispenser. Little had come of the possibility at the time, but obviously much has changed.Aside from the threat that Amazon's acquisition of PillPack poses to the Rite Aid, the remaining piece of Rite Aid that wasn't sold to Walgreens (WBA) still needs help in reinvigorating sales and profitability. A partner/buyer appears to be a means to that end, but finding a suitable, willing suitor is proving tough to do. The latest would-be partner was grocery chain Albertson's, though such a pairing may not exactly have been of any benefit to investors. Proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services penned a report on the matter just a few weeks ago. It wrote, "The merger combines two low-margin, over leveraged companies, both of which are facing heightened competitive environments."Shareholders agreed, prompting management to kill the deal and leaving Rite Aid in need of a lifeline that doesn't appear to be on the horizon.Amazon is largely responsible for the "heightened competitive environments" both parties are facing. Amazon not only owns PillPack and Whole Foods Market, but it's also selling all sorts of consumable dry goods via its online platform.SearsGetty ImagesIn all fairness, Amazon has been making things tough for all brick and mortar retailers. Sears (SHLD) is the wounded and sickest member of the herd, though, and therefore the prey most vulnerable to Amazon.com.Revenue has been shrinking since 2006, and the company hasn't turned a full-year profit since 2011. In retrospect, hedge-fund-manager-turned-CEO Eddie Lampert should have fixed as many of its poorly performing stores as he could rather than simply shed them in an effort to raise much-needed cash. Or, maybe Sears (and Kmart) were and still are simply unfixable.The irony? Sears has actually partnered with Amazon on multiple occasions in an effort to drive sales. In October of last year, Kenmore - a Sears-owned brand of home appliances - unveiled a new line of smart refrigerators that work with Amazon's artificial intelligence assistant Alexa. In July of last year, Sears listed a slew of Kenmore branded goods at the Amazon.com website. In May of this year, Amazon began selling tires to consumers that ultimately would be installed at a Sears Tire Center.The struggling retailer may only be feeding the beast that will eventually eat it, however. Amazon also is selling tires that Monro will install, and Amazon.com sells Maytag and Frigidaire home appliances too, even if those other brands aren't featured as prominently.Sears, and Kmart, are just too deep into the Amazon quicksand now to fight their way out.SEE ALSO: 12 Retailers That May Soon Disappear ForeverSprouts Farmers Market, The Fresh Market and Trader Joe'sGetty ImagesIt's not exactly a secret that people across the U.S., and around the world for that matter, are increasingly concerned about what they're eating. Chemicals and pesticides are completely out of fashion, as is genetically modified produce. En vogue are organic goods, and where at all possible, locally sourced foods.It's a trend that initially sprang life for outfits like Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM) and Trader Joe's, which historically have been the go-to options for health-conscious consumers. Now that rival grocer Whole Foods Market is an Amazon holding, it can benefit from Amazon's strong marketing reach.That's not the only edge Amazon has on its organic-grocery rivals, however.Unlike Trader Joe's and Sprouts, Amazon isn't all that concerned about turning a profit in the grocery biz. Indeed, the company is almost annoyingly coy about how its grocery business is doing, offering no meaningful details of its performance. Being in the business is simply another means of connecting with consumers, pulling them further into the Amazon ecosystem, where they can be monetized in other ways.More than that, though, Amazon's ambition of dominance-at-all-costs has allowed it to become the low-price leader in the whole foods and organic grocery market. Unable to compete with the giant, The Fresh Market announced in July it was closing a total of 15 stores.TargetGetty ImagesAmazon.com has proven problematic for the likes of Walmart (WMT) and Costco (COST), and more recently, vice versa. All three companies are big enough and different enough from one another that they'll be able to at least defend their turf.Target (TGT) is in a tougher situation, however. It has neither the size of Walmart, the pricing power of Costco nor the sheer online presence of Amazon.com. It's trapped somewhere in the middle, which within the world of modern retailing is the last place any organization wants to be.You can see this idea at work in the company's most recent earnings report. Although fiscal Q1's same-store sales grew nicely, investments in Target's online presence and customer-attraction efforts - such as deliveries and price-cutting - crimped margins from 7.1% a year earlier to 6.2% this time around. Morningstar's analysts foresee more of the same heavy spending ahead, and Target isn't in a position to outspend its competition.There is one plausible, albeit low-percentage, ray of hope on the horizon. More than once, Amazon has been rumored to be interested in acquiring Target. Such a maneuver would instantly give the organization a retail footprint that could prove more problematic for Walmart than Target is on its own. But simply hoping for a buyout is never a good enough reason to buy or stick with a stock.SEE ALSO: The 15 Best ETFs for a Prosperous 2018W. W. GraingerGetty ImagesSupply outfit W. W. Grainger (GWW) has held up better than many investors presumed it would when Amazon announced it was tiptoeing onto its turf last year with a platform called Amazon Business. Indeed, GWW shares are up more than 120% from their August 2017 lows, largely driven by slow and steady revenue and earnings growth that analysts didn't think Grainger would achieve.How did GWW manage it, and against a bigger foe that cares little about profits? Macquarie analyst Hamzah Mazari explained earlier this year, "Close to $2.5 billion of their revenue, out of their total $10 billion, was uncompetitively priced, so they cut their price to be more in line with the market ... in the fourth quarter they showed volumes were up double digits."It has worked so far. But Grainger isn't well-equipped to fight a price war, and CEO D.G. Macpherson has already hinted that gross margins around 38% would be the new norm. That compares unfavorably to gross margins of 44% achieved in 2013. And Grainger will only hit that 38% number if Amazon does something very un-Amazon-like and doesn't start a price war within this business sliver.Toys R UsGetty ImagesLast but not least, a eulogy for Toys R Us.After a poor showing for 2017's busy holiday shopping season, the privately held toy company finally decided to call it quits in March 2018. It didn't even bother seeking a buyer that might be looking for a cheap way to scoop up a recognized name, or garner some cheap retailing square footage.Not every observer entirely blames Amazon.com for the demise of Toys R Us. In many regards (and like so many other brick-and-mortar retailers), Toys R Us became sloppy on its own - operationally and fiscally - and never fully realized it until it was too late. Greg Portell, lead partner at retail consultant A.T. Kearney, commented in June, "If you're going to have that breadth of inventory, you need someone in the store to help you find it, help you experience it. It's hard to sell toys in a cold, warehouse environment."If not Amazon, another player would have continued to chip away at the once-iconic toy store chain.Still, the fact that Amazon.com is rumored to be preparing the printing of a traditional holiday toy catalog this year sends a clear message. That message: Amazon isn't stopping now. With the biggest pure-play threat out of the way, it's going to be even easier for the company to go after other toy sellers such as Target and Walmart.SEE ALSO: Best Online Brokers, 2018EDITOR'S PICKSMillionaires in America: All 50 States Ranked53 Best Dividend Stocks for 2018 and BeyondBest Online Brokers, 2018Copyright 2018 The Kiplinger Washington EditorsReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read Next2 Stocks You Can Buy and Hold ForeverMotley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopedia2 Top Stocks You Can Buy on SaleMotley FoolWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolWalmart Wants to Take On Amazon in Digital AdvertisingMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolCould CarGurus Be the Next Top Auto Stock?Motley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceFiat Chrysler Recalls 320,000 VehiclesFortuneAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolKey Financial Ratios to Analyze the Auto IndustryInvestopediaWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCThe Boeing 737 MAX Is 1 Step Closer to Flying Again -- but Don't Expect to See It SoonMotley FoolTech, green features, power mix to boost luxury car salesAFP

However, as we move through a period of uncertainty and change where tariffs and trade wars could affect some of these very same companies, investors need any edge they can get to make money in the years ahead.Technology may be that edge. It's already playing a large role in the success and failure of many of this country's biggest consumer stocks, and tech looks to be an even greater determinant of who wins and loses five to 10 years from now.RBC Capital Markets recently took out its futurist cap, producing a study entitled "Imagine 2025," which highlights the six themes it feels will drive business growth over the next seven years - and the stocks that will benefit as a result.The themes mostly revolve around technology, but RBC also has addressed non-tech issues such as climate change, population growth, urbanization and others to develop a list of 69 companies it feels will lead the way through 2025.The following are five of the best consumer stocks to buy right now. What makes them stand out from the rest is that each utilizes one or more of RBC's "Imagine 2025" themes to deliver better-than-average shareholder returns.SEE ALSO: 20 Dividend Stocks to Fund 20 Years of RetirementStitch FixCourtesy Daniel G. Wells III via Wikimedia CommonsMarket value: $3.3 billionIf there's a consumer stock that has used artificial intelligence more appropriately than Stitch Fix (SFIX, $33.75), I'd love to know about it.Stitch Fix provides a subscription service for adults that customizes monthly delivery of clothing, meeting subscribers' styles and tastes as identified both in an initial questionnaire and through ongoing feedback from customers. And the longer a customer belongs to the service, the better Stitch Fix gets at delivering the right goods, thanks to its AI."In our over 15 years of covering consumer stocks, a common thread among our strongest companies is the ability to inspire and create desire," KeyBanc analyst Edward Yruma wrote in a recent note to clients. "In many regards, Stitch Fix serves as the modern archetype of the heyday department store -- helping consumers understand what is new and interesting, offering a wide selection, and offering a very personalized edit."A recent headline to pay attention to: In July, Stitch Fix launched a service for kids that will include eight to 12 items per delivery at $10 to $15 for any article of clothing the subscriber opts to keep. Shares jumped 9% on that particular bit of news - a warm reception.SEE ALSO: 7 Top Tech Stocks That Could Catch Fire SoonAmazonStory continuesGetty ImagesMarket value: $937.9 billionAmazon.com's (AMZN, $1,919.65) overarching goal of securing as much of our disposable income as possible now and in the future means the company's fingerprints are all over the six themes that RBC feels will drive business growth.Thanks to Amazon Web Services, the company's cloud business, continues to provide Amazon with the profits to reinvest in e-commerce - the less profitable side of Bezos' empire, but the one that ultimately should get it to a trillion dollars in market cap, and possibly even a second trillion dollars down the road.Leading the charge will be Amazon Prime, its monthly or annual membership that gives Amazon customers free two-day delivery, Prime video streaming, etc. In May, the company raised the annual fee from $99 to $119 in the U.S."The Prime membership price increase is a solid margin tailwind," wrote MKM Partners analyst Rob Sanderson. "Prime is thought to be at around 55 million households in the U.S., (which will result in) about $1 billion of incremental profit contribution (annual basis) beginning Q3."The combination of AWS and Prime is an unbeatable one.SEE ALSO: 10 Top Nasdaq Stocks to Buy NowAppleGetty ImagesMarket value: $1.0 trillionApple (AAPL, $209.75) sells a lot of iPhones -- estimates suggest it sold 42.1 million of them in the June quarter alone. But Apple's Services division, which includes the App Store and iTunes, is enjoying double-digit revenue growth each quarter, providing a strong one-two punch."Apple Services in total represent about 15 percent of total company sales and is the second largest contributor to margin dollars," Citigroup analyst Jim Suva wrote in early July. "We note Apple's internal goal to double Service revenues from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2020 seems reasonable."Apple's revenue diversification is impressive. Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst Wamsi Mohan sees augmented reality contributing as much as $8 billion annually to Apple's top line."We think AR apps will command a price premium," Mohan wrote in a July 10 note to clients. "We reiterate our Buy on strong capital returns, continued strong growth in Services revenues and AR providing yet another competitive advantage."Among consumer stocks, Apple and Amazon bring some of the most impressive weapons caches to the table.SEE ALSO: 10 Apple Products That Changed Everything (And 10 That Didn't)LululemonCourtesy Elvert Barnes via FlickrMarket value: $17.1 billionAthleisure mainstay Lululemon (LULU, $129.47) announced Calvin McDonald as its CEO in late July. By the time Sephora's North America leader takes over the top role Aug. 20, the top job will have been empty for six months.Chairman Glenn Murphy, formerly CEO of Gap (GPS), had to make sure the man or woman hired would be able to fix the toxic corporate culture former CEO Laurent Potdevin encouraged in the four years he was in charge. Analysts generally are happy with McDonald's hiring."On the qualitative front - today's high caliber hire at the helm accelerates the turning of the tide at LULU in our view with the management bench moving from a point of investor contention to among the Best-In-Class," wrote JPMorgan analyst Matt Ross July 23 in a client note. "A CEO from Sephora/LVMH, CFO from VF Corp, COO from J Crew, Sun Choe at CMO (hired 11/2016), three seasoned regional heads in place (Americas, Europe, Asia), and Chairman of the Board Glenn Murphy remaining a key advisor to the team."Corporate quality flows from the top. Given that, you ought to be very excited about the future if you're a LULU shareholder.SEE ALSO: The Best and Worst Presidents (According to the Stock Market)Macy'sGetty ImagesMarket value: $12.8 billionJeff Gennette's success in the top job at Macy's (M, $41.82) comes from the fact he's not a bean counter, but rather a merchant.As technology has crept into the retail shopping experience, retailers straddle a fine line between using tech to help customers find what they want more quickly and turning off the customer by over-automating the process. Give people what they want in an attractive shopping environment, and they'll come back."He has a feel, he has an eye, he's a merchant. The stores have a better look and feel," Jim Cramer said on Squawk on the Street in May. "It's not in the numbers. It's about good-looking merchandise."Also, don't forget consumer spending is growing amid a still-flourishing economy."Historically, this is a very cyclical business and investors looking to benefit from the improving consumer spending environment, and the strong fashion cycle, should consider Macy's more closely," Susquehanna analyst Bill Dreher wrote in a May note to clients.Macy's, left for dead after years of stock losses, is suddenly a consumer momentum play, up nearly 60% in 2018.

The apps, or “skills” in Amazon’s parlance, could do everything from tell knock-knock jokes to offer the latest price of Bitcoin.On Thursday, Amazon finally opened up the world of Alexa skills to ordinary customers, albeit in a limited manner. Now anyone with an Echo speaker or Spot clock can teach Alexa some new tricks using Amazon’s “blueprints,” or prewritten types of apps that can have customized content supplied by customers–no computer coding necessary. Many are oriented towards kids. Here are a few examples of how you can use the blueprints to create (mostly) useful skills for your Alexa-enabled devices.Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter.1. Help study with vocal “flashcards”Have kids studying for a biology quiz? Or maybe you’re getting ready to take the bar exam. The flashcards blueprint lets you create a list of questions and answers (and hints, if you want). Then Alexa can offer the quiz, either in “review mode,” revealing both questions and answers, or in “test mode,” asking the questions and confirming whether the answers are correct. Alexa even has encouraging messages to throw in, like, “Great job studying hard. You’re going to ace this test,” which can also be customized.2. Leave important information for the babysitterYou can certainly go the old-fashioned route, leaving a written list of important items and emergency contacts for the babysitter. But why not impress your millennial childminder with an Alexa-enabled babysitter helper app. The babysitter blueprint has places to add items like a child’s schedule, allergies, emergency contacts, and answers to basic questions like, “where are the diapers?” There’s also a blueprint for the petsitter.3. Cheer up family members with the compliments skillPretty straightforward: Fill in the blueprint with a list of compliments. Amazon offers a few canned phrases, such as, “You light up the room,” but you can do better. Then name the skill, which will trigger Alexa to offer one of the compliments. Not so into complimenting your little brother? There’s a similar blueprint to write a burns skill.4. Play a game of modern MadLibs with the story skillThe blueprints include a variety of genre stories, like a fairy tale about a magical princess or the story of an alien invasion, that require listeners to offer names and other bits (such as a favorite dessert) that Alexa incorporates. But the entire text of the stories can be customized, tweaked, or wholesale rewritten.5. Test party guests with a trivia quiz about the birthday boy or girlAnother one for the kids, the blueprints include a quiz skill to work at a birthday party by asking trivia questions about the guest of honor. In addition to reading the questions, the skill lets the birthday celebrant rate the answers and offer sound effects (crowd cheers, annoying buzzers and the like) based on the rating.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolWalmart Wants to Take On Amazon in Digital AdvertisingMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceNatural Gas Price Prediction – Prices Tumble as Supplies IncreaseFX EmpireWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolShould We Be Delighted With CVR Energy, Inc.'s (NYSE:CVI) ROE Of 22%?Simply Wall St.'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceCrude Oil Weekly Price Forecast – Crude oil running into resistanceFX EmpireAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCThe Boeing 737 MAX Is 1 Step Closer to Flying Again -- but Don't Expect to See It SoonMotley FoolRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

From Amazon's first annual report as a public company in 1998 to the letter he wrote in advance of the company's May 17 annual meeting this year, he's set a consistent tone: Build culture, take risk and focus on the long term.Chamath Palihapitiya, a venture capitalist and early Facebook employee, said at the Sohn Investment conference that  Amazon is on its way to becoming a $3 trillion company  in a decade.If true, it would be in large measure due to the business philosophy of Bezos. The "Amazon Way," as it has become known, has attracted some controversy, but it can be relevant to businesses of all sizes.In honor of his birthday today, here are five lessons to take away from his success. 1. Obsess over customers, not competitorsBezos makes the point that tech companies especially obsess over competitors: They wait and see what rivals introduce, then try to match and one-up it. By listening to customers instead, Amazon built its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business, which was designed to solve the problems with too-expensive in-house application hosting and open-source products that weren't robust enough to easily support fast-growing or already-large companies. AWS is now an over $10 billion business."Many companies describe themselves as customer-focused, but few walk the walk. Most big technology companies are competitor focused. They see what others are doing, and then work to fast follow," he wrote in a 2015-dated letter.The moral: To get ahead of the market, you have to think for yourself.2. Take risks for market leadershipIt took Amazon three tries to get its business as a selling and fulfillment platform off the ground. First it tried Amazon Auctions, a more-or-less direct aping of the model that put eBay on the map. That morphed into zShops, and finally into Amazon Marketplace, which accounts for nearly half the units sold on Amazon.com."Given a 10 percent chance of a 100-times payout, you should take that bet every time," Bezos wrote in his very first annual letter (1997). "Failure and invention are inseparable twins. To invent you have to experiment, and if you know in advance that it's going to work, it's not an experiment." Moral: Make bold, rather than timid, investment decisions. Even if they don't work out, you'll learn something for the next time. 3. Make employees think like ownersWhen Bezos wrote this in the first Amazon annual letter, Bezos had 614 employees, up from 158 a year earlier. It has 230,000 now and plans to hire 100,000 full-time employees over the next 18 months.One key component of the approach has been to use stock options in hiring.

From Amazon's first annual report as a public company in 1998 to the letter he wrote in advance of the company's May 17 annual meeting this year, he's set a consistent tone: Build culture, take risk and focus on the long term.Chamath Palihapitiya, a venture capitalist and early Facebook employee, said at the Sohn Investment conference that  Amazon is on its way to becoming a $3 trillion company  in a decade.If true, it would be in large measure due to the business philosophy of Bezos. The "Amazon Way," as it has become known, has attracted some controversy, but it can be relevant to businesses of all sizes.In honor of his birthday today, here are five lessons to take away from his success. 1. Obsess over customers, not competitorsBezos makes the point that tech companies especially obsess over competitors: They wait and see what rivals introduce, then try to match and one-up it. By listening to customers instead, Amazon built its Amazon Web Services (AWS) business, which was designed to solve the problems with too-expensive in-house application hosting and open-source products that weren't robust enough to easily support fast-growing or already-large companies. AWS is now an over $10 billion business."Many companies describe themselves as customer-focused, but few walk the walk. Most big technology companies are competitor focused. They see what others are doing, and then work to fast follow," he wrote in a 2015-dated letter.The moral: To get ahead of the market, you have to think for yourself.2. Take risks for market leadershipIt took Amazon three tries to get its business as a selling and fulfillment platform off the ground. First it tried Amazon Auctions, a more-or-less direct aping of the model that put eBay on the map. That morphed into zShops, and finally into Amazon Marketplace, which accounts for nearly half the units sold on Amazon.com."Given a 10 percent chance of a 100-times payout, you should take that bet every time," Bezos wrote in his very first annual letter (1997). "Failure and invention are inseparable twins. To invent you have to experiment, and if you know in advance that it's going to work, it's not an experiment." Moral: Make bold, rather than timid, investment decisions. Even if they don't work out, you'll learn something for the next time. 3. Make employees think like ownersWhen Bezos wrote this in the first Amazon annual letter, Bezos had 614 employees, up from 158 a year earlier. It has 230,000 now and plans to hire 100,000 full-time employees over the next 18 months.One key component of the approach has been to use stock options in hiring. "We will continue to focus on hiring and retaining versatile and talented employees, and continue to weight their compensation to stock options rather than cash," Bezos wrote in the 1997 letter. "We know our success will be largely affected by our ability to attract and retain a motivated employee base, each of whom must think like, and therefore must actually be, an owner.''Moral: Whether it's stock, bonuses or profit sharing, give workers a stake in the success of the company.4. Build a culture that's right for your companyAmazon's own culture is famously breakneck-paced, and notoriously cost-conscious, as befits a company that has run only a small profit, or a loss, under generally accepted accounting principles for most of its life as a public company."We never claim that our approach is the right one — just that it's ours," Bezos wrote in the 2015 letter.

Investors want to see which party will seize control of the House and Senate before making any significant buy/sell decisions. That doesn’t leave us short of top stock trades to choose from though.Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow #1: Advanced Micro Devicestop stock trades for AMD and AmazonMoreAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) jumped more than 8% at one point Tuesday after it was announced that the company will supply chips to Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) data center, possibly impacting Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe stock bounced off $16 support and held the 200-day relatively well despite a violent selloff. This is exactly what we’re looking for.  8 Cheap Stocks That Are Leading the Blue Chips  In any regard, shares are now back above $20 and at a key level. Can they hold above this mark and get back above channel support (blue line)? If it can, the 21-day near $23 and channel resistance near $24 are in the cards. If it can’t, $18 and the 200-day are back on the table.Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow #2: CVS Healthtop stock trades for CVS earningsMoreA top and bottom-line beat propelled shares of CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) higher by 5% on Tuesday. If it can make it to $78-ish, CVS will fill the gap from last month.Will it act as resistance?That much is unclear. The stock has been trading pretty well since its lows last week, a perfect touch of the 200-day moving average. Should CVS consolidate for a few days, look to see that it stays over its 50-day moving average. Below and its 200-day is back on the table.Should CVS clear $78, look for a retest of downtrend resistance (black line). Over it and a fresh breakout could occur.Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow #3: Toyota Motortop stock trades for ToyotaMoreContinuing the better-than-expected earnings theme in the auto industry, Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) gave a solid outlook, raising its full-year expectations.The $114 level held as support, but investors will want to be mindful of Toyota until it can close above the 50-day and downtrend resistance. I will keep this on my watchlist to see if it is able to. A break below $114 and more lows could follow.Top Stock Trades for Tomorrow #4: Mylantop stock trades for MYL earningsMoreShares of Mylan (NYSE:MYL) are surging more than 17% on Tuesday after the company beat on earnings and missed on revenue expectations.What a move.Unfortunately, if you missed today’s 17% gain, you might be out of luck for a while. Although MYL could push its way through downtrend resistance at $38, the 200-day moving average at $38.50 and resistance between $39.50 and $40, I have my doubts it will.While that represents about 10% of potential upside, there’s no telling which resistance point will kick MYL down. I’d rather give the stock a few days to see if it can consolidate above the 100-day moving average. If not, see if range support near $35 and the 50-day can hold and go long there for a better risk/reward.Story continuesTop Stock Trades for Tomorrow #5: Eli Lillytop stock trades for LLY earningsMoreMidterms are overshadowing a number of big earnings reports, the last of which on the list includes Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY). Despite beating on earnings and revenue expectations, shares are down 4%.The chart is simple. After such a big run, shares are set to make a decent move in one direction or the other. Above $108 and we should get a test of channel resistance near $112.50 (blue line). Above it and the $116 highs are on the table.  10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy Ahead of Black Friday  Below $105 and the 100-day is the next line in the sand. Below it and the 200-day is in the cards.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

That’s got investors wondering, are stocks consolidating before another rally or are we in the midst of a dead cat bounce?We’ll try to navigate this tricky landscape as best we can as we eye our top stock trades for Wednesday.Russell 2000 ETF (IWM)top stock trades for IWMMore Click to Enlarge One reason this market is tricky? Because a few weeks ago, market participants were under the belief that the Federal Reserve would continue hiking interest rates at a time where the yield curve was about to invert and the economy would eventually tumble into a recession.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAfter printing a monstrous jobs report on Friday and after the Fed came out with a more dovish tone on the same day, investors are rethinking their outlook for the U.S. After a big rally in stocks though, many names are coming into key levels as we’re only about a week and a half away from earnings. Then there’s President Trump’s speech on Tuesday night regarding “the wall.” Like I said, tough sledding.The Russell 2000 ETF (NYSEARCA:IWM) has been one of the leaders when it comes to market direction. Meaning its direction has been the early tell on what the overall market is doing. Lately, it’s been strong and that’s a good sign for bulls. However, it’s coming into a big-time prior support level now.$145 was a key level through 2018. Some may say that the February and April bounces were a result of the 200-day moving average. I would say that it was likely that both levels played a role.  The 7 Best Stocks in the Entrepreneur Index  In any regard, the IWM has rallied eight of the last nine sessions while rallying about 12.5% in that time. To see $145 and the 50-day moving average act as resistance would come as little surprise at this point. If it does, I would love to see the 21-day moving average act as support.Union Pacific (UNP)top stock trades for UNPMore Click to Enlarge Up over 8.5% on Tuesday, Union Pacific (NYSE:UNP) is making waves after announcing a new COO.After the stock’s massive gap-up, it leaves traders who weren’t in the trade in a tough spot. Do you chase up here or take a pass? I would love to see a $5 pullback into the mid-$140s. UNP has a chance to find support from the 50-day and 200-day moving averages down near this level.On the upside, it could run into the backside of a few prior uptrend support lines between $150 and $155. Ultimately though, I’m more interested in how UNP handles $157.50.Salesforce (CRM)top stock trades for CRMMore Click to Enlarge Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) has been bouncing back with a vengeance and bulls sure are happy to see it. While CRM has been extra volatile, it’s hard to ignore a best-in-breed cloud play.I’m not a big head-and-shoulders guy, but this one has similar makings of a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders setup. Although I would feel better about a healthy pullback down to the $135 to $138 area before recharging higher, the $147 level is proving it will be pivotal. A push through the “neckline” could spark a breakout rally.Story continuesConsidering the last few months though, I would be more inclined to take profits in CRM and wait for a pullback than bank on a breakout.Tilray (TLRY)top stock trades for TLRYMore Click to Enlarge Shares of Tilray (NASDAQ:TLRY) had been stuck in a big downtrend since September. All of its large rallies were met with sellers at downtrend resistance (black line), while buyers have buoyed the stock near downtrend support (blue line).Jumping 12.5% on Tuesday, the stock is popping over downtrend resistance for the first time in months. It’s also over the 21-day moving average. Bulls can use a stop-loss at ~$75 and target the $95 to $100 range.Amazon (AMZN)top stock trades for AMZNMore Click to Enlarge We flagged this one coming into the new year, along with the rest of FAANG. The chart for Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is practically identical from that article.After going from ~$1,300 to $1,650 in just a few trading sessions, I am not a buyer of AMZN stock up 27%. If downtrend resistance doesn’t slow AMZN, I expect the 200-day moving average to slow its roll.So where will it pullback to? That’s a tough question because it depends on what the overall market is doing. I would love to see $1,540 to $1,600 hold up as support, but that represents a decline of just 3% to 6%. In a market like this, we can see that in just a day.But where to buy Amazon isn’t my main concern, it’s not buying it at this point. Wait for a better setup before chasing Amazon $350 off the low and into resistance.Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

Like the full-size Echo, it responds to your commands and questions from across the room—but it’s a tiny, sawed-off one that costs $50. The only difference is that because you don’t have the big cylinder, the sound quality is tinny. It makes a fantastic second Echo—say, for the upstairs.Well, now here’s Google (GOOG, GOOGL) with its own version of the Dot, called the Google Home Mini. Also puck-shaped, also $50. (Google will also be releasing the Google Home Max, a beefier version with better sound.)The new Google Home Mini (right) has clearly been inspired by the Amazon Echo Dot (left).MoreThe Dot and the Mini are 90% identical. They both work great. Each has a Microphone Off switch, so you can be sure that it’s not listening for its trigger word. Both can now distinguish who is making the request, so that it can respond to commands like “Play my party playlist” and “What’s next on my calendar?” with the right person’s music or info. Both now let you make free speakerphone calls to actual phone numbers (although the Google’s call quality is awful).There are, however, a few differences to note.In this corner: The Google Home Mini.The sound is much better. Neither assistant pod will be mistaken for a concert hall. But there’s no question that Google’s built-in speaker is richer than Amazon’s.It talks to Chromecasts and Android TVs. If you spring $35 for a Chromecast (a little receiver stick that plugs into a modern TV’s USB jack), or if you have a TV that runs Android TV, you can perform a nifty trick. You can say, “Ok Google, show me a video about how to remove contact lenses” or “Show me funny cat videos” or “Show me the trailer for the new Avengers movie,” and it appears on your TV instantly. As you can see in the video above, it’s quite magical.It will someday have a tap-to-talk feature. The top of the Mini is supposed to be touch sensitive. As designed, you could tap it to issue a command (instead of saying “OK Google”), or tap it to pause music. But just as the Home Mini was shipping, a reviewer discovered a bug in which that button thought that it was being pressed all the time, transmitting everything anyone said in the room to Google’s servers. So Google responded by shutting off that top button’s features altogether.Google will presumably restore the tap-the-top feature once they get their act together.MoreAnd now, in this corner: The Amazon Echo Dot.Works with more home-automation products, like internet-controlled thermostats, lights, security cameras, and so on. It’s a huge list. Google’s improving on this front, but Amazon’s had a several-year head start.It has an audio output jack. Lots of people love plugging in their nice speakers or sound systems to an Echo Dot, thanks to the standard miniplug on the side (the Google offers nothing similar). That makes it easy to control your music by voice—one of the most luxurious features ever.It’s much easier and more reliable to adjust the Echo Dot’s volume (left) by turning its ring instead of tapping the sides.MoreYou can see feedback across the room. The Dot’s LED ring glows in different colors and patterns to communicate different things—for example, it glows when it’s transmitting sound back to Amazon. You can see it from the side, and therefore from across the room. The Google’s four LEDs are visible only when you’re looking down on the device, which isn’t nearly as useful.You can order stuff. Of course, this is exactly what Amazon hopes you’ll do, but it’s still cool. “Alexa—order more paper towels.”If you’re a Google Play subscriber, maybe the convenience of speaking your desires for music tips the balance for you toward the Google Home Mini. (The argument about “Buy a Google Home if you keep your calendar in Google Calendar” doesn’t really hold water, since the Echo can consult or add events to the calendar systems of Google or Apple (AAPL) or Microsoft (MSFT).Otherwise, though, the Echo Dot is still the better micro-assistant. (Especially when it’s on sale for $40—for example, on the typical Black Friday, which is in a couple of weeks.)There will be a lot of people unwrapping these little guys this holiday season.MoreBoth of these devices are delicious enhancements to almost anyone’s home. Over time, you’ll find more and more ways that they’re useful—and for only 50 bucks!Correction: The originally posted version of this story referred to the volume ring of the Echo Dot. That was a feature of the first-generation Dot; the current second-generation Dot has volume buttons on the top instead of the ring.More from David Pogue:The Fitbit Ionic doesn’t quite deserve the term ‘smartwatch’Augmented reality?

Here’s one way to tell: Go to your order history and count how many of the last 10 items you needed and how many you just wanted. Or check your credit card statements. When I did this, I was shocked at how frequently “Amazon.com” showed up on my bill. I couldn’t even recall what I could’ve possibly ordered and wondered if I was a victim of identity theft. But it turns out I was only stealing from myself.It’s not easy to resist the personalized convenience and instant gratification that this online retail giant has to offer. In fact, Amazon is responsible for more than half of all of 2016’s online sales growth, according to a study by Slice Intelligence. And with its recent announcement of its plan to acquire Whole Foods for $13.7 billion, Amazon is set on taking over the grocery industry.Before your spending spirals out of control, check out these 6 foolproof ways to conquer your Amazon addiction1. Begin by setting up what I like to call “the check yourself before you wreck yourself” payment plan. Under your account settings, turn off one-click ordering everywhere and you won’t have the ability to one-click shop on any of your devices.2. Delete all your payment methods. Each time you go to pay, you’ll have to put in your credit card information. Annoying? Yes, it makes shopping a lot more deliberate and bit more time-consuming. If you can wait a few a days, leave your items in your cart and revisit your decision to buy everything later. I do this all the time and end up removing half the things I originally placed in my cart3. Set a spending limit by giving yourself an Amazon Allowance. It’s essentially a pre-paid gift card that you can give to others, or email to yourself – either on a one-time or recurring basis. When you go to check-out, it’ll show up as the only saved payment method. It’s also a great way to keep your kids’ spending under control on a daily, weekly or monthly basis.4. Buyers beware of the dangerous “Dash” buttons. For those of you who don’t know what it is, it’s the one-click shopping button on steroids placed all over your house. Out of Gatorade? Running low on Huggies diapers? Hit the button and these wi-fi connected devices enable you to order more. Sure, it’s super convenient – and that’s the point. It’s also a neat trick to make it all-too-easy for you to shop non-stop. Not only does it keep you from looking at prices, but you’re not comparison shopping for better deals either. It’s a big nightmare for parents with young kids. If your Dash buttons aren’t hidden, you might get a surprise delivery of paper towels that your kids pushed for.5. Another gimmick to avoid: the lightning deals, or what Amazon likes to call their “Gold Box” deals. The original prices can be inflated on the day of these flash sales to make the discounts look more attractive.6. To ensure you’re getting the best deal, don’t check out until you’ve checked the price history on a third-party site like camelcamelcamel.com.What are some of your Amazon savings hacks?

Online shopping is growing significantly faster than brick-and-mortar stores.Online retailers brought in nearly half a trillion dollars in the U.S. over the past year with about 9% of total sales, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. And online sales are growing between 15% and 17% per year, compared to about 5% for the overall retail industry.Globally, the trend is even stronger. Some 1.66 billion online shoppers spent $2.3 trillion in 2017. By 2021, sales could more than double from today's levels.It's no surprise, then, that some of the world's largest internet companies are e-commerce companies. Meanwhile, many brick-and-mortar stores are moving aggressively into online retail to take advantage of the trend and protect their businesses.In this article, we'll explore the seven largest e-commerce companies in the world, many of which present interesting investment opportunities to take advantage of the megatrend in online shopping.A man holding a credit card while using a laptop computer.MoreImage source: Getty Images.What is e-commerce?E-commerce, by its broadest definition, is any transaction of goods and services done over the internet. More colloquially, it refers to buying an item or service online with an electronic payment method, such as a credit or debit card or a digital wallet service. The item could be physical (a vinyl record), digital (an mp3 download), or a service (a music streaming subscription).When talking about e-commerce companies, there's a broad range of businesses involved in making online stores work. Payment networks and digital wallet services ensure payment processing. Shipping and logistics companies make sure packages are delivered. And online stores connect buyers and sellers.For the purposes of this article, we're focusing primarily on online stores. But those stores may operate in any one of the several flavors of e-commerce:Business-to-Consumer (B2C): This is the kind of e-commerce that comes to mind when most people hear the word. B2C e-commerce is when a business sells a good or service to an individual consumer. Some examples of B2C e-commerce operations include Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Walmart's (NYSE: WMT) online stores, JD.com (NASDAQ: JD), and Alibaba's (NYSE: BABA) TMall.Business-to-Business (B2B): A business selling a good or service to another business. This can be done in the form of wholesalers like those found on Alibaba.com. It could also be businesses that offer software-as-a-service to other businesses to help manage their companies. Software-as-a-service is a term used to describe a software product offered to customers on a subscription basis and generally accessible through the internet.Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C): C2C e-commerce businesses create a marketplace to connect buyers and multiple sellers online. eBay (NASDAQ: EBAY) originally got its start as an auction clearinghouse for consumers to sell their unwanted items to other consumers, and it's a prime example of C2C e-commerce. Amazon also offers a marketplace for consumers to sell unwanted items, and Alibaba operates similar online marketplaces in China. In the context of this article, consumer-to-consumer e-commerce companies are businesses that merely facilitate e-commerce through their platform.Consumer-to-Business (C2B): A consumer-to-business transaction is when a consumer sells an item to a business. Instead of listing an item on a marketplace like eBay, C2B e-commerce companies buy items directly from consumers. They might then turn around and sell them on an online marketplace. An example would be companies that buy used smartphones, including eBay and Gazelle. Which e-commerce company is the biggest?There are several different ways one could measure the size of an e-commerce business. How many customers does it have? How much revenue do they generate? How much is the company itself worth?Perhaps the most universal way to compare online stores is with a metric called gross merchandise value, or GMV. (Gross merchandise value is also sometimes referred to as gross merchandise volume, or gross merchandise sales.) GMV is a measure of the total value of all items sold on an online store or marketplace.GMV is a lot different from revenue. eBay operates as a marketplace, and it doesn't sell items directly to consumers. As such, its revenue is a small percentage of its GMV. Shopify (NYSE: SHOP) makes it easy for other businesses to sell goods on their own websites, so it also generates a small amount of revenue compared to GMV on its platform.Amazon, meanwhile, splits its sales about 50/50 between its own retail operations and sales from third-party merchants on its marketplace. As a result, its revenue is a significantly higher share of its GMV. Online stores that exclusively sell their own inventory (think brand retailers) will produce practically the same amount of revenue as GMV.Here's a table of the world's largest e-commerce companies sorted by GMV:   Company   GMV (TTM)   Type(s) of E-commerce       Alibaba   >$768 billion   B2B, C2C     Amazon   $239 billion   B2C, C2C     JD.com   $215 billion   C2C, B2C     eBay   $93 billion   C2C, C2B     Shopify   $33 billion   C2C     Rakuten   >$31 billion   B2C     Walmart   >$19 billion   B2C, C2C   Data source: Alibaba, Amazon, JD.com, eBay, Shopify, Rakuten, Walmart.Story continuesAlibabaAlibaba first started its business online in 1999, launching Alibaba.com and 1688.com. Its flagship site operates as a global wholesale marketplace, while 1688.com handles similar transactions within China.Alibaba's core commerce business also consists of:Taobao: Alibaba's consumer-to-consumer marketplace serving mainland China, enabling small businesses and entrepreneurs to reach individual consumers. Founded in 2003, it's now the world's biggest e-commerce website. It generated $428 billion in gross merchandise volume in Alibaba's fiscal 2017.Tmall: A spinoff from Taobao dedicated to business-to-consumer e-commerce in China. It's the second-largest e-commerce website in the world after Taobao, generating $340 billion in GMV during fiscal 2017.AliExpress: Aimed at international shoppers, enabling small businesses in China to sell to customers all over the world, particularly the U.S., Russia, Brazil, and Spain. Alibaba doesn't report GMV on AliExpress.Even just looking at Alibaba's success with its Taobao brands, Taobao, and Tmall, Alibaba is an absolute giant compared to the rest of the competitors. Add in its wholesale marketplaces, which are the go-to source for finding manufacturers and suppliers in Asia to source white-label products, and Alibaba's share of all the commerce transacted on the internet is even bigger. With a growing international presence anchored by AliExpress and other investments in retail, Alibaba is by far the world's largest e-commerce company.A truck with Amazon's Prime logo on it.MoreImage source: Amazon.AmazonAmazon is the largest online retailer in the United States. Amazon started as an online bookstore, but it quickly expanded to all sorts of different verticals, including electronics, fashion, and home goods.Perhaps its most innovative and successful contribution to online retail is Amazon Prime. Amazon Prime is a subscription service that provides shoppers with unlimited 2-day shipping from Amazon. The company has continually added new benefits such as video and music streaming, exclusive access to certain items, early access to deals, free ebooks, unlimited cloud storage for photos, and more. As a result, Amazon now has over 100 million Prime members worldwide.Amazon has also hit a homerun with its Fulfilled by Amazon service. FBA allows third-party merchants to use Amazon's warehouses, fulfillment center network, and logistics capabilities to fulfill orders. Items sold through FBA are Prime-eligible, which is increasingly important to attracting customers on Amazon. Fulfilled by Amazon allowed the online store to grow Prime-eligible items from 20 million to 100 million over the last three years.Overall, Amazon's GMV totaled about $239 billion over the last 12 months. Consider that $116 billion of that is sold directly by Amazon, with the other $123 billion coming from third-party sellers on its marketplace. Amazon kept about $37 billion in fees for facilitating third-party sales. That's a much higher take rate than most marketplaces, but Amazon has much higher costs associated with its third-party sellers using services such as FBA.JD.comJD.com is very similar to Amazon, but operating in China. The company has built out an unparalleled logistics network with over 500 warehouses and 7,000 delivery stations. Unlike Amazon, though, JD.com operates the entire logistics operation itself, not handing off packages to third parties for last-mile delivery. That enables JD.com to ship 90% of orders to customers by the next day. Amazon is notably investing in its own delivery network.JD operates a first-party retail segment just like Amazon's, but it also partners with international brands, including Walmart, to help them reach Chinese consumers. JD operates more like an online mall in that way than a centralized retailer. Walmart is notably a 5% stakeholder in JD.com after the American company sold its Chinese online store, Yihaodian, to JD.com in 2016.JD launched JD Plus in 2016, its version of Amazon Prime. Plus members enjoy free shipping up to 60 times per year, free ebooks, special discounts, faster accrual of loyalty points, and iQiyi's premium service. iQiyi is China's largest online video platform. The company now claims over 10 million JD Plus members, and members renew at an 80% rate.JD's strong logistics network and growing list of domestic and international retail partners (170,000 and counting) is helping it grow GMV rapidly. GMV increased 30% in the second quarter of 2018, outpacing Amazon by about 11 percentage points. At that rate, JD.com could overtake Amazon by 2019.eBayeBay started as an online auction house in the 90s for people to sell collectibles and used goods to one another. Today, 80% of items sold on the platform are new, and 89% of items are sold at a fixed price.eBay is taking steps to make its platform look and operate more like Amazon. It's encouraging sellers to offer free guaranteed 3-day shipping. It's combining product listings from sellers with the same item, enabling consumers to find the best price more easily. It also launched a Best Price Guarantee, offering customers a 110% rebate on the difference between an item they bought on eBay and an identical listing on a competitors' website. eBay is operating more and more like a business-to-consumer retailer instead of a marketplace for other businesses.The moves are starting to pay off. GMV growth (on a currency-neutral basis) started accelerating in 2018, growing 7% in the first half of the year. Still, that growth is considerably slower than other companies on this list, and slower than the overall growth of the e-commerce industry.While eBay turns around its GMV growth, it's also working to increase its profit margin. It moved to intermediate payments itself by starting to cut ties with former subsidiary PayPal. The company will handle all of its payments in-house by 2021, which the company expects to provide significant value to sellers on the platform. That could result in both higher profits and better GMV growth.eBay offices in BerlinMoreImage source: eBay.ShopifyShopify is very different than the other companies mentioned in this article. Instead of operating its own centralized marketplace, Shopify provides a platform for small merchants to sell items on their own websites and on other third-party marketplaces including Amazon and eBay. At the core of its business, Shopify provides an easy way to manage a retail business from one central location, tracking sales and inventory, helping fulfill orders, and helping customers create their own websites.Shopify charges a subscription fee to use its service, offering several different tiers suitable for businesses of all sizes. Its 600,000 merchants range from one-person entrepreneurs with a single product all the way up to multibillion-dollar brands with hundreds of products.However, more and more of its revenue is coming from what it calls merchant solutions. Shopify offers payment processing, shipping services, and cash advances to merchants. In the second quarter of 2018, merchant solutions accounted for 55% of total revenue for Shopify, and the segment is growing faster than its subscription business. While these services have much lower profit margin than its subscription offerings, they support subscriptions by locking merchants into Shopify's ecosystem.Merchants are increasingly looking for an alternative to Amazon, as the marketplace becomes more and more crowded. Shopify is one of the top alternatives for businesses looking to establish a brand and take more control of their inventory and sales with their own websites. The growth of merchant solutions outpacing subscription revenue is a sign that there's strong demand for an alternative to Amazon, but entrepreneurs still want a bit of hand-holding. Shopify is in one of the best positions to offer that service.Rakuten Rakuten is very similar to JD.com and Amazon. The Japanese e-commerce company operates an online mall for big brands in Japan, but it also owns several e-commerce operations in other countries, including the U.S., France, Brazil, and the U.K., which are more unbranded marketplaces like Tmall, eBay, or Walmart's marketplace.Rakuten has put a major focus on its delivery network, launching its One Delivery initiative last year. Rakuten hopes to improve delivery speed at a lower cost by relying on its own network as well as third parties in a similar manner as Amazon in the U.S. Amazon itself has made good progress in the Japanese market thanks to the growth of Prime and its shipping benefits. Amazon is the largest online retailer in Japan, according to some estimates.In order to combat the growth of Amazon, Rakuten is also investing outside of retail and logistics. It operates Japan's largest internet bank and its third-largest credit-card company. It recently started building a wireless network to improve the profitability of its MVNO business. It also owns a travel agency, insurance company, matchmaking service, and golf-reservation system, among 60 or so other businesses. It's also a major investor in Lyft and Pinterest, and it owns 100% of Viber. The goal is to create an ecosystem of services that can provide everything customers need in order to promote its brand.Rakuten's profits have been hurt by its heavy investments recently, and GMV growth isn't nearly as strong as others on this list. Domestic GMV grew just 11.1% year over year in the second quarter of 2018. What's more, the profitability of its core retail operations is declining as it invests in logistics and other efforts to stave off Amazon. Operating income from domestic e-commerce is declining despite modest improvements in revenue.Rakuten's global transaction volume, which includes its international operations as well as credit-card payments, digital transactions, and other retail operations increased slightly faster, at 16.4%. Still, Rakuten's growth is relatively slow.WalmartWalmart is the world's largest brick-and-mortar retailer, generating revenue of nearly half a trillion dollars per year. But just a small portion of that revenue comes from online sales.The company has been investing heavily in e-commerce over the past few years. It acquired Jet.com in 2016 along with a string of small U.S.-based e-commerce companies. It's also rapidly expanding its online grocery operations following Amazon's big push into groceries in 2017. As a result, Walmart has seen strong online sales growth over the past couple of years. It generated $11.5 billion in sales in the U.S. in 2017, and it expects to hit 40% online sales growth this year.Walmart's most recent e-commerce investment is its acquisition of a 77% stake in Flipkart, one of the leading e-commerce companies in India. The move puts Walmart neck-and-neck with Amazon in India, another market where Amazon has grown to overtake native competition. India holds massive growth potential for online shopping, and Walmart's Flipkart stake gives it tremendous exposure to the market. Walmart says Flipkart's GMV in 2017 was about $7.5 billion.Not all of Walmart's e-commerce investments have paid off. In 2017, the company made the decision to wind down its first-party e-commerce operations in Brazil. It also ended up selling an 80% stake in its brick-and-mortar business in the country as operations struggled during the Brazilian recession.Walmart has largely grown its e-commerce sales through acquisitions and the expansion of grocery pickup and delivery. It's unclear how long the momentum can last as it finishes its grocery rollout and laps its acquisitions. The Flipkart acquisition will provide significant growth in one of the fastest-growing e-commerce markets in the world, but it doesn't protect Walmart's brick-and-mortar operations from ceding sales to online competitors in the 26 other countries in which it operates.Investing in e-commerceThese seven companies each offer various opportunities to invest in e-commerce. Amazon offers global scale. Alibaba and JD.com offer access to the rapidly growing Chinese market. Shopify offers access to a growing number of small retail entrepreneurs. Walmart offers exposure to India with its Flipkart acquisition, but provides stability with its massive brick-and-mortar operations. eBay and Rakuten are growing more slowly than the competition, but eBay is finding ways to improve the profitability of its core business, while Rakuten is investing in other areas outside of retail to drive profit growth. For investors interested in e-commerce, these seven companies provide a great start.

Individuals and families want a simple, affordable and high-quality experience that helps them stay well,” Bertolini said in an emailed statement to Yahoo Finance. Bertolini says Aetna’s merger with CVS Health will achieve a similar mission. “Our combination with CVS Health will help address those needs at the local level, and I am encouraged to see other companies working toward the same goal,” he said.Yahoo Finance’s Julia La Roche interviews Aetna chairman and CEO Mark Bertolini. (Cindy Ord/Getty Images)MoreShares of insurance companies and pharmaceutical companies have been trading lower following the announcement from the trio of industry titans.Meeting the needs of consumersBack in December, CVS Health (CVS) said that it was buying Aetna in a $69 billion deal that could reshape American health care.“Today, increasing numbers of consumers are taking on more and more responsibility for paying for their health care as the burden of costs is being shifted to them,” the companies said in a statement. “Together, CVS Health and Aetna will be a trusted community partner who will help consumers better manage the cost of the health care they need.”Prior to the deal announcement, Bertolini and CVS’s CEO Larry Merlo have both separately spoken publicly about problems in U.S. health care, and they both advanced solutions they’ve had in mind.Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett has also spoken out about the rising health care costs impeding the U.S. economy.“The ballooning costs of health care act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,” Buffett said in Tuesday’s announcement. “Our group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable. Rather, we share the belief that putting our collective resources behind the country’s best talent can, in time, check the rise in health costs while concurrently enhancing patient satisfaction and outcomes.”— Julia La Roche is a finance reporter at Yahoo Finance. Follow her on Twitter.BERTOLINI: CEOs who manage a bottom line are making a ‘big mistake’Aetna CEO: Obamacare can’t be repealed, but it can be fixedAetna CEO: 2 reasons why health care costs are so highHow 2 life-threatening events changed the way Aetna’s CEO views health carePODCAST: Aetna’s CEO Mark Bertolini on the future of health careReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextThe Best Places to Retire to AbroadInvestopedia5 Top Healthcare Stocks to Buy in 2019Motley FoolYou can capture a dividend above 5% and still enjoy stock-market growthMarketWatchWere Hedge Funds Right About Souring On Omega Healthcare Investors Inc (OHI)?Insider MonkeyWhy the health-care stock selloff may actually be a good thingMarketWatchZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolA Look At The Fair Value Of Westlake Chemical Corporation (NYSE:WLK)Simply Wall St.Wedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Walmart WMT, Amazon AMZN and Kroger KR.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:                                               Akamai Technologiesis one of those companies that’s not necessarily a household name, but that virtually everyone interacts with on a daily basis without even being aware of it.Akamai’s “Intelligent Platform” is a distributed cloud computing network of over 240,000 servers worldwide which gathers real-time data on net traffic and congestion and uses complex proprietary algorithms to ensure the most efficient content delivery possible.   An estimated 15-30% of all web traffic is routed through Akamai’s network.Akamai’s customers take advantage of this vast network to have content delivered from server locations that are geographically closet to the end user, ensuring the best performance and user experience possible.  Akamai also provides advanced cloud security services.Akamai has been steadily growing revenue and earnings and has beat the Zacks Consensus Earnings Estimate in each of the past 4 quarters, including a strong Q1 one report in which management raised guidance for 2018.  Q1 revenues were $669M, with $353M coming from the Web Division and $316M from the Media and Carrier division, increases of 16% and 6% respectively, over the year-ago period.  Net earnings were $0.79/share beating estimates of $0.70 by 13%.The real bonus for investors was that the company raised guidance for both Q2 and FY2018.  CEO Dr. Tom Leighton stated “We are pleased with the results of our first quarter performance, which featured continued outstanding growth in our security business, substantial improvement I our media business, marginal expansion and accelerated revenue growth overall.”Akamai is clearly firing on all cylinders. Revenues next quarter are expected to be in the range of $658M - $670M and earning between $0.79/share and $0.83/share.  Full year earnings guidance is now $3.15/share to $3.25/share, up from previous guidance of $2.90 - $3.01/share.Akamai shares are up 17% in 2018, handily beating the Internet Services industry as a whole, which has declined 5%.Bear of the Day:After nearly collapsing during the financial crisis in 2008, American International Group was once of the most high-profile beneficiaries of U.S. government intervention in the Troubled Asset Relief Program, commonly referred to as TARP.Having decided that the failure of AIG, with its large and diverse basket of assets and liabilities would cause catastrophic damage to the U.S. financial system and economy, the U.S. became AIG’s largest shareholder, at one point owning 61% of the company’s shares.  The program mandated significant changes to AIG’s structure, including a new corporate governance structure, and a reduction in exposure to risky derivative securities.By 2012, the U.S. Treasury and federal Reserve had not only recouped all of the $182 billion they had staked to the bailout, but after selling all of its remaining shares, actually posted a profit of nearly $23 billion on the transaction.Thanks to the austerity measures levied on the company while under government ownership, AIG has never returned to the high-flying status it enjoyed before the crisis. The size of the company was cut by nearly 50% in terms of assets and its exposure to derivatives was lowered by over 90%.Although a much safer and more stable company, the huge insurer is a mere shadow if its former self in terms of profits.  Even in an environment of low interest rates, a rising stock market and softening regulations that should benefit financial companies, AIG has underperformed, with shares up just 34% in the past 5 years versus an average of better than 50% for the insurance industry. 2018 has been even worse, with the stock down 7% YTD.Story continues3 Retail Stocks to Buy Ahead of Quarterly EarningsIs Walmart (WMT) Still Cheap Right Now?Shares of Walmart opened higher on Monday just a few trading days after the company reported solid first-quarter earnings results. With that said, Walmart’s stock price had sunk over the last few months, which means now might be a great time to consider buying the retail giant at a relatively cheap price.Walmart’s overall revenues climbed roughly 4.4% from the year-ago period to hit $122.7 billion in the first quarter, with comp sales up 2.1%. Meanwhile, the company’s adjusted earnings surged by 14% to reach $1.14 per share, which also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.12 per share.Investors should also have been pleased to see that Walmart’s U.S. e-commerce sales popped by 33%, despite increased competition from Amazon and other online sellers. Now, let’s take a look at Walmart’s price movement before we dive into why the company’s current valuation looks rather enticing.Recent Price MovementWalmart stock was up roughly 8% over the last year before Monday’s gains. However, shares of Walmart had sunk 9.8% during the last 12 weeks and 4.8% over the last four weeks as investors reacted negatively to the company’s slower fourth-quarter e-commerce growth.   Furthermore, shares of Walmart sat at their 52-week high of $109 per share in late January. Walmart stock opened Monday at $84.14 per share, which means shares of Walmart are much cheaper than they were to start the year just based on price alone.Still, investors need to know a little more before they can say that Walmart stock is currently offering a ton of value.ValuationComing into Monday, Walmart stock was trading at 16.9X forward 12-months earnings estimates. Walmart stock has traded as high as 23.8X over the past year, with its median resting at 17.9X. The company is also currently trading just slightly above its year-long low of 16.4X, which it rested at briefly in early July of last year.Walmart stock is also trading directly in line with the S&P 500’s average of 16.9X. Furthermore, the company compares favorably to the “Retail – Supermarkets” industry’s current average forward P/E ratio of 16.3. This industry includes the likes of Kroger other large U.S. grocery chains.Based on the last year alone, investors should be able to say with some conviction that Walmart stock is rather attractive at its current valuation, and pretty cheap compared to where it has traded recently.Growth OutlookLastly, it is worth considering Walmart’s current growth prospects. The company is projected to see its second-quarter earnings climb by 12.9% to touch $1.22 per share, based on our current Zacks Consensus Estimates. For the full-year, Walmart is expected to hit $4.86 per share, which would mark a nearly 10% surge from a year ago.Meanwhile, Walmart’s revenues are only projected to pop by 1.8% in Q2, while full-year revenues are projected to climb by 2.08% to reach $510.74 billion. Investors might be a bit less pleased to see these top-line projections, but it is worth considering just how hard it is to post massive top-line growth when the company is expected to pull in over $510 billion.Our 2% full-year growth estimate would mean Walmart expanded its top line by $10 billion.Looking for Stocks with Skyrocketing Upside?Zacks has just released a Special Report on the booming investment opportunities of legal marijuana.Ignited by new referendums and legislation, this industry is expected to blast from an already robust $6.7 billion to $20.2 billion in 2021.

REUTERS/Shannon StapletonMoreBy Siddharth Cavale(Reuters) - U.S. grocer Albertsons Cos Inc said it would buy drug store chain Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) to create a company with $83 billion in annual revenue, giving it more clout to compete with bigger chains in an industry fearing the entry of Amazon.Com (AMZN.O).The deal is the latest in a wave of consolidation in the drug retailing sector, which is looking to cut costs amid weak reimbursement rates and lower generic drug prices. At the same time, Amazon's foray is widely expected to disrupt the industry, prompting drug chains to beef up their businesses.Backed by private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, Albertsons hopes the deal will help it become a formidable competitor to CVS Corp (CVS.N) and Walgreens (WBA.O), and give its private equity owners a way to exit their decade-long investment in the grocer.Cerberus first took a stake in Albertsons in 2006 and scaled it through acquisitions including that of Safeway in 2014. It planned to sell its stake through an IPO in 2017, but dropped the plans after Amazon bought grocer Whole Foods Market in May."The new company will have an expanded footprint and be ranked first or second in 66 percent of the top metropolitan areas in the United States and will be ranked first or second in 70 percent of pharmacy locations," Albertsons and Rite Aid said in a joint statement on Tuesday.Albertsons owns about 2,300 supermarket stores mainly on the east and west coasts of the United States and also operates about 1,800 pharmacies. Rite Aid owns about 2,569 drug stores, after it sold 1,932 pharmacies to Walgreens for $4.38 billion.Albertsons said it would convert its existing pharmacies to Rite Aid stores and let existing Rite Aid outlets operate as stand alone pharmacies.Together, the combined company will operate about 4,350 pharmacy counters and 320 clinics across 38 states and Washington.Within three years the combined company is expected to deliver annual run-rate cost savings of $375 million, with more than 60 percent within the first two years, the companies said.The combined company is expected to generate pre-tax earnings of about $3.7 billion within three years, they said.Rite Aid's shares, which initially surged by as much as 25 percent premarket on Tuesday, were trading up 2.3 percent at $2.18 in afternoon trading.TOUGH MARKETThe deal follows Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) move to team up with Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) to form a not-for-profit company to provide health care for their employees, challenging the existing U.S. healthcare system.The threat of Amazon making further inroads has jolted U.S. drug store chains into action after several years of declines in traffic and sales at front-end stores.Larger rival CVS Health Corp (CVS.N) reached a $69 billion deal to buy insurer Aetna Inc (AET.N) last month, while Walgreens is also reported to have made a takeover approach for drug distributor AmerisourceBergen Corp (ABC.N)."Drug retailing has had its own challenges with reimbursement pressure and weak front-end sales as evidenced in Rite-Aid's weak profits over the last couple of years," said Mickey Chadha, a vice president with credit ratings agency Moody's."Competing with much larger and more diversified drug retailers like CVS and Walgreens will be a formidable challenge," he said.Based on the enterprise value of both Albertsons and Rite Aid, the combined company is valued at $24 billion, an Albertsons Companies' spokeswoman told Reuters.Rite Aid shareholders can elect to get either one Albertsons common share plus about $1.83 in cash, or 1.079 Albertsons common shares for every 10 shares they hold.Shareholders of Rite Aid, which had a market cap of $2.33 billion at midday Tuesday, will own between 28 percent and 29.6 percent of the combined company, while Albertsons' shareholders will own the rest based on the elections, the companies said.Depending on whether Rite Aid shareholders choose to be paid in cash and Albertsons stock or only stock, the deal values Rite Aid at between $1.30 and $2.65 per share, Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken said.(Additional reporting by Shalini Nagarajan and Vibhuti Sharma in Bengaluru;

On Wednesday, eHarmony launches on Amazon Echo, making it the first dating app to integrate with a major artificial intelligence system, the company boasts in a press release.The integration means that eHarmony users can ask Alexa to read them their matches and messages, on an Amazon Echo or Echo Dot — or Alexa can show them their matches, visually, on the new Amazon Show device, which has a seven-inch touchscreen.Amazon Echos and Echo Dots on a table. (Reuters)MoreAlexa will provide a “human element to eHarmony,” says eHarmony CEO Grant Langston. The term for apps on Alexa is “skills,” and Langston adds that, “The eHarmony skill for Alexa surfaces pertinent information, like location and occupation, that some people might gloss over if they are just quickly swiping at attractive pictures.”Amazon is singing the same tune: “We think voice can provide a more natural and friendly interface for engaging with apps like eHarmony’s” says an Amazon spokesperson.Grant Langston, who has been eHarmony CEO for just over a year, told Yahoo Finance in a July interview that he expects further consolidation in the online dating industry. “There are a lot of apps that are very small, VC-run properties that, in some cases, have a good idea but they don’t know how to monetize it,” he said. “I think there is some sense that a rollup, consolidation—pick your word—is coming. It’s hard to know exactly how that happens.”To set up the eHarmony integration, Echo owners must enable the eHarmony “skill,” then link their eHarmony account in the Alexa app. When using the skill, eHarmony says, Alexa will also offer up verbal witticisms like, “Oh my, you have a lot of new matches.”Unless you don’t have a lot of new matches.—Daniel Roberts is a writer at Yahoo Finance, covering tech and media.Read more:Amazon could face antitrust scrutiny as it gobbles up more companiesAmazon’s NYC bookstore is not really for selling booksWhy Amazon will have success selling workout clothesAmazon Prime Day is a raw deal for e-book buyersAmazon crushes earning expectations on the strength of Web ServicesReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextThe best lawnmowers to buy right nowThe TelegraphAmazon Music Is Available for Free NowRolling StoneGoogle Allows YouTube App on Amazon's Fire TV Once AgainIndiewireWhat to Watch this weekend: The season premiere of Bosch and Tonya Harding on Worst Cooks in AmericaEntertainment WeeklyGet this $20 Alexa smart speaker instead of a $50 Echo DotBGR NewsZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

This has led to an increased rivalry in these regions, as both Alibaba stock and Amazon compete against each other in Southeast Asia and South Asia.If Alibaba gains a significant market share in these regions, it would provide the company with a much bigger growth runway than Amazon. This will also increase the bullish sentiment toward the stock.Alibaba and Amazon need to establish their presence in international markets to diversify their revenue base and have better growth potential.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsOn the one hand, Alibaba has tried to partner with startups who have already scaled up their operations. On the other hand, Amazon has mostly tried to build its business from the ground up.The jury is still out over which business model will be successful in the long term. However, Alibaba and the companies it has partnered with are already showing strong signs of a successful market penetration.Make or Break Moment for Both GiantsAlibaba and Amazon are investing huge piles of cash to ramp up their operations in South Asia and Southeast Asia. Together, these two regions are home to one-third of the total world population and have a nominal GDP of close to $6 trillion. The average GDP growth in this part has been 6%-8% in the past few years, which has allowed rapid growth of the middle class. There is also a significant increase in internet users due to cheaper smartphones and better networks.  10 Super Safe Growth Stocks to Buy for Long-Lasting Dividends  Alibaba was a latecomer in investing in these regions compared to Amazon. Amazon started its Indian operations in 2013. It has committed to invest $5 billion to build up its operations. Recently Amazon is reported to increase this investment by another $2 billion after Walmart’s acquisition of Flipkart, which is Amazon’s main rival. Alibaba has mostly focused on Southeast Asia by getting majority control of Lazada and Tokopedia.In India, Alibaba has relied on local startups to scale up their operations and directly compete with Amazon and Walmart. Alibaba has a significant stake in Paytm, which is a leading digital wallet and financial services company in India.Paytm recently notched a big win when it was reported that Buffett has built a stake in the company for $300 million. This values the company at a whopping $10 billion. Alibaba has also invested close to half a billion dollars in the leading online grocer, BigBasket. One of the latest investment has been in Zomato, which is a food delivery and restaurant search app. Alibaba is planning to enter the e-commerce segment of India through Paytm Mall in which it has invested over $600 million along with Softbank.Alibaba has recently bought Pakistan’s main e-commerce company, Daraz, for an undisclosed sum. It has purchased a 20% stake in Bangladesh’s bKash, which is the leading mobile financial services company. This investment pattern across South Asia and Southeast Asia shows that Alibaba is relying heavily on local startups to build its presence in these regions.Besides e-commerce, it is also looking to replicate the success of Ant Financial in payments ecosystem of these regions. The banking presence in these regions is still relatively low which should help mobile payment services to expand their presence.The level of investments will only increase in the near term as both Alibaba and Amazon try to increase their market share and expand their presence in e-commerce, payments, media, logistics and other services. If Alibaba or Amazon is able to gain a decisive market share across a broad spectrum of services in South Asia and Southeast Asia, it will show the long-term potential of their business model.Why Alibaba Has a Significant Lead?Although Alibaba was a latecomer to these regions, it has built up its presence by good investments and partnerships. By focusing on local startups Alibaba has been able to prevent any regulatory obstacles and also leverage local talent. Amazon’s strategy of building operations from scratch is not only more time consuming but could eventually cost more. Even after five years of operations, Amazon is yet to trounce the market leader Flipkart in India. Now that Flipkart has been bought by Walmart, it would be even more difficult for Amazon to increase its market share.Story continuesOn the other hand, Alibaba’s investments in Paytm have paid off as the company is already in a dominant position in the payments ecosystem within India. Alibaba is now using Paytm Mall as a springboard to enter e-commerce segment in India. The investment in Big Basket has also been very successful as it now holds a significant share in online grocery business.Besides the success of individual investments, Alibaba has a huge support due to Softbank’s investment in South Asia and Southeast Asia. In many segments, the investments of Alibaba and Softbank are complementary. The size of Softbank’s investment portfolio is also important. For example, Softbank has invested close to $8 billion in Indian startups in the past few years. This gives Alibaba an option to make an entry in various segments at a later stage.Future TrajectoryIf Alibaba gains a significant lead in South Asia and Southeast Asia over Amazon, it will have an oversized impact on the stock of both the companies. Both these regions have a lower GDP compared to Europe, North America and China. But they are growing at a faster rate and have a rapidly growing middle class.Also, this is more of a neutral ground where the two giants have fought away from their home base. Amazon will always have an upper hand in U.S. and Alibaba will have an edge in China. However, it is also important to see how these two companies perform in regions where neither has a home team advantage.Both the giants are planting the seeds for a future expansion in Europe. This would be another neutral ground. The winner in South Asia and Southeast Asia should get a significant confidence boost to invest aggressively in Europe to replicate its success.Investor TakeawayEventually, it will come down to the business model and execution. Amazon’s bottom-up approach of building its operations has taken a long time and can face regulatory hurdles due to lack of partnerships with local players.Currently, Amazon has a minor lead in India and Alibaba has a lead in Southeast Asia.In another 18-24 months, we should see one of these two giants cementing their position in South Asia and Southeast Asia.There is a very high probability that Alibaba will come out on top, which can also boost the bullish sentiment for its stock. I have a “strong buy” rating for Alibaba.More From InvestorPlace  8 Semiconductor Stocks Powering Down    7 Trucking Stocks to Buy as Retail Markets Shift Into Higher Gear    7 Dividend Stocks to Buy Amid This Tough Market Environment    5 Stocks That Could Be the Next Amazon   Compare Brokers The post Alibaba Is Quietly Undermining Amazon’s Influence appeared first on InvestorPlace.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

Gangemi buys books and watches TV series on Amazon, but it bothers her when she needs to pay extra for certain programs, not to mention Amazon delivery service isn’t great in the rural area where she lives. Amazon Prime’s price hike comes after blockbuster first-quarter earnings results, which sent the stock (AMZN) soaring to record highs. The increase will take effect for new users in May and apply to existing members in June. For the lucky subscribers whose membership expires in May, they can still enjoy the old $99 price for one final year. While Wall Street sees the move as a positive, the $20 increase has become a deal breaker for many current Prime members who are now rethinking renewals. According to a recent Yahoo Finance survey, among almost 7,000 current Prime members, 45% said they will discontinue their membership once the price goes up to $119 a year. Twenty percent were unsure. For those who are willing to pay more, the vast majority cite “fast and free delivery” as the top reason for staying. A recent poll from DealNews, a comparison shopping website, revealed similar results: Almost half of Prime users surveyed said they won’t pay the new price. Respondents to the Yahoo Finance survey said they just don’t shop enough on Amazon or they don’t use perks like Prime video often enough to justify the higher upfront cost. Some even said they would turn to other retailers like Walmart (WMT)  to find competitive prices and services after dropping Prime.  Easier said than done45% of Amazon Prime users surveyed say they will discontinue the service when the price goes up. (Yahoo Finance Survey)MoreBut the actual membership dropout rate could be much lower than the initial survey results show, according to Lindsay Sakraida, director of content marketing at DealNews. She said emotions and psychology come into play in people’s responses. Amazon’s Prime membership price increase came one week after the e-commerce giant announced they have 100 million Prime members globally. The company’s first quarter 2018 earnings also beat analysts’ expectations, sending Amazon stock soaring to nearly $1,600 per share. “Some feel it’s greedy for Amazon to increase the price. There is a perception that they’re doing very well and they don’t need to do that to take advantage of people,” said Sakraida. Crossing the $100 threshold also pushes people to re-evaluate their expenses. For some people, they may adjust and opt for a monthly Prime membership, which was also increased to $12.99 from $10.99 earlier this year. Sakraida said people may take a closer look at the monthly option especially during major shopping holidays like Black Friday and Prime Day. “If they quit, they can always subscribe again for a shorter period of time if they need it,” she said.Wall Street isn’t worriedAmazon announces the first price increase for Amazon Prime on a wildly successful earnings call. (TechCrunch)MoreAnalysts are bullish on the Amazon Prime price jump. In a note last week, Goldman Sachs said the price increase could add $1.5 billion of incremental gross profit in 2019 and help Amazon offset potential higher shipping costs from USPS. “The strength and stickiness of these businesses (high consumer value proposition) enable Amazon to continue investing to deepen its competitive moat and expanding its addressable market,” analysts wrote in the note.Story continuesWhile Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData, expects some people to drop Prime, he believes it’s unlikely that Amazon’s overall Prime subscriber base will decline. “The increase in fees will boost Amazon’s overall revenue from Prime subscriptions. This will be immediately beneficial to both the top and bottom lines,” he told Yahoo Finance. It’s common for subscription service providers to use a lower price to get customers to sign up and then gradually raise the cost. Even at $119, Saunders said the higher price doesn’t cover all the benefits consumers get from a Prime membership. “There is definitely future scope for further membership-fee increases,” he said.Krystal Hu covers technology and economy for Yahoo Finance.

Alphabet earnings: What to expect [Video]YahooSearchNo matching results for ''Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsGive feedback on the new search experienceCancelSign inMailFinanceWatchlistsMy PortfolioScreenersMarketsIndustriesVideosNewsPersonal FinanceTechU.S. Markets closedS&P 5002,905.03+4.58(+0.16%)Dow 3026,559.54+110.00(+0.42%)Nasdaq7,998.06+1.98(+0.02%)Russell 20001,565.75-1.85(-0.12%)Crude Oil64.000.00(0.00%)Gold1,277.90+1.90(+0.15%)Silver14.97+0.01(+0.07%)EUR/USD1.12470.0000(-0.0000%)ReblogShareTweetShareAlphabet earnings: What to expectJP MangalindanChief Tech CorrespondentYahoo FinanceJuly 22, 2018All eyes on Wall Street will be looking to Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) on Monday when the Mountain View, California-based tech giant reports second-quarter earnings after the markets close. Heather Bellini, a Goldman Sachs analyst, estimates earnings per share of $2.23 from Alphabet on revenues of $32.1 billion. Bellini’s is one of the few updated estimates that factors in the record-setting $5.1 billion fine from EU antitrust regulators, who ruled on Wednesday that Google had abused its dominance by forcing device makers to install its search engine and Chrome browser on Android devices. Google, for its part, has said it plans to appeal the ruling.A drop in the bucket for AlphabetIf the penalty ultimately stands, it’s a relatively small amount for Alphabet, which had $102.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities stashed away as of March.  UBS analyst Eric Sheridan does not expect the ruling, which imposes several restrictions on pre-installed Google apps, to significantly slow or deter the download and usage of many Google apps. Alphabet is set to announce second-quarter earnings on Monday after the markets close. Source: Getty ImagesMore“In the Apple App Store, Google has 9 of the top 50 apps, despite no relationship with the underlying OS,” Sheridan pointed in a report out on Wednesday. With that in mind, analysts will be looking closely at how Google executives address the penalty on its second-quarter earnings call, given CEO Sundar Pichai’s recent blog post cautioning the decision will “upset the careful balance” Google has struck with its popular Android OS. Pichai’s broad language sparked conversations among tech pundits and analysts that changes could be coming for device makers, third-party app makers and even possibly consumers.Watch out for AmazonAlso worth a look: Google’s stance on the competitive front. In a note published on Friday, Piper Jaffray Senior Research Analyst Michael Olson wrote that he foresees strong, continued growth with Google’s so-called bread and butter — ads via search — but also pointed out Amazon as a growing competitor to watch. Story continuesIn more recent years, Amazon (AMZN) has become more aggressive in building out its ads business, which generated nearly $2 billion in ad revenues during the first quarter — up 139% year-over-year. That remains a small amount versus Google’s own advertising-generated revenues, which amounted to $26.6 billion during the company’s own first quarter. But Amazon’s ad business is currently growing at a faster clip, fueled by aggressive sales efforts and the company’s vast troves of retail data. “From a competitive standpoint, all eyes should be on Amazon as its product search impacts the use case of Google search due to advances in Amazon’s ad business, and as Alexa becomes a gateway to information, but there is room for Google search revenue to continue to grow, especially for intangible products/services that do not lend themselves as readily to ‘Amazonification’ (e.g. insurance),” Olson wrote.

In the last several years, Amazon has expanded its efforts so employees with artistic streaks have more creative outlets to let loose, including the Amazon Symphony and the a cappella group Vocally Self-Critical — a riff off of Amazon’s now retired 10th principle of the same name. “About this time last year, one of our oboists looked through our employee directory and looked through people’s interests, particularly in classical musical instruments, and he just sent out this massive email, asking ‘Hey, who wants to start an orchestra?’” recalls Beau Curran, a technical account manager on Amazon’s digital music operations team and an oboist in the Amazon Symphony. “The first day of rehearsal, we were really wondering whether we’d just end up with a saxophonist and a keyboardist, and that would be our orchestra.” The 80-person Amazon Symphony performed a winter concert at the Seattle tech giant’s headquarters in early December. Source: Yahoo FinanceMoreTo Curran and Amazon Symphony conductor Fred Clarke’s surprise, about 200 employees expressed interest in the group, with 80 instrumentalists now rehearsing weekly on-campus and performing at least twice a year. The company, for its part, contributes a budget sponsored by Amazon business teams, as well as rehearsal and performance space. It also opened up its large employee meeting center on-campus for the groups to perform their winter concert. The joint performance drew over 500 people and raised more than $18,000 in donations and ticket sales for Mary’s Place, a nonprofit that operates a shelter for homeless families in a building at Amazon’s Seattle headquarters. Alexander Simms, an Amazon software engineer, joined the company in 2016 after his three-month internship at the company ended, in part because the company had an a cappella group. (Yes, really.) “At the end of that internship, I actually heard that Amazon had an a cappella group called Vocally Self-Critical, which is a great pun that nobody gets anymore,” explains Simms, referring to the now defunct Amazon principle, which was folded into another leadership principle, Earn Trust. “It definitely influenced my coming back.”“Amazon’s culture allows you to be creative in and outside of your job role, and that’s something I really enjoy,” says Alex Rogers, a marketing program manager at Amazon. Source: Yahoo FinanceMoreAlexandra Rogers, head of global customer insights and strategy for Amazon Prime Now and a member of Vocally Self-Critical, expressed a similar sentiment.“It’s amazing to be involved in Vocally Self-Critical and get to spend the day working on data and creatively putting it together and synthesizing insights and then get to come sing,” Rogers says. “Amazon’s culture allows you to be creative in and outside of your job role, and that’s something I really enjoy.” The Amazon Symphony and Vocally Self-Critical follow other efforts by Amazon over the years, including the Expressions program. The five-year-old program is focused on employee programming and team-building projects that let Amazonians express themselves in different ways, from crochet night to a snow globe-making classes. Two years ago, Amazon opened the Expressions Lab — a facility dedicated to those classes and projects — now peppered with workshop tables, paint canvases, computers and 3-D printers. It also rolled out (literally) an Expressions cart, which gets wheeled around Amazon’s Seattle headquarters at least three times a week so employees anywhere around campus can briefly take part in activities.Story continuesTwo years ago, Amazon opened the Expressions Lab — a facility dedicated to those classes and projects — now peppered with workshop tables, paint canvases, computers and 3-D printers. Source: Yahoo FinanceMoreFor those hard-working Amazonians, such opportunities may prove short but welcome diversions. As recently as 2015, the company was criticized for some tough working conditions at its corporate headquarters and fulfillment centers. Since then, the company has offered more employee programs and more flexible work arrangements, like 30-hour salaried work weeks for some teams.Which is not to say working at Amazon still isn’t tough, but now there are more options and outlets for employees to take advantage of to make working at Amazon work for them.Click here to read more about why Yahoo Finance chose Amazon as its company of the year and here to learn more about Amazon’s plans for Alexa.

Although PillPack expects sales to exceed only about $100 million this year, Amazon's huge customer base and existing shipping infrastructure could allow the company to scale up quickly.Amazon could also negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies, giving them the ability to offer cheap generic drugs even to customers without health insurance, according to industry experts. But it will face deeply entrenched competition dominated by pharmacies run by CVS Health, Walgreen Boots Alliance and Walmart Inc, and pharmacy benefits provided by CVS, Express Scripts UnitedHealth Group."Amazon's acquisition of PillPack is a warning shot in what is about to become a major battle within the pharmacy space," said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail.The value of the deal was not disclosed. Bloomberg reported it to be $1 billion, citing a person familiar with the matter.Pharmacy chains and drug wholesalers lost about $14 billion in market value on Thursday, while Amazon gained about $5.5 billion.Shares of CVS closed down 6.1 percent, while Walgreen fell 10 percent. Shares of drug wholesalers McKesson Corp, Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen all fell.JOINT VENTUREThe news comes just a week after a joint venture of Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co named a CEO who will be tasked with significantly cutting healthcare costs for its estimated 1 million employees and dependents.Although brick-and-mortar stores might feel the effects of Amazon's competition, the biggest battles will likely be fought by mail-order pharmacies, which generally serve patients with chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease that may require drugs to control blood pressure, cholesterol and other problems.PillPack said it has tens of thousands of customers across the country. But its expectation of over $100 million in 2018 revenue pales compared with larger rivals. CVS last year had about $45.7 billion in revenue from its mail order pharmacy business, accounting for about 15 percent of its pharmacy claims.Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) negotiate prescription drug pricing for employers and health plans and run large mail-order pharmacies, offering incentives to patients to fill prescriptions with them.Doctors and PBMs have long said patients not properly taking their medicines is one of the main causes of increased healthcare costs, leading to hospitalizations and more severe health issues. Companies like PillPack and Express Scripts that offer care management services to improve patient compliance are seen as increasingly important in helping control rising costs.With Amazon's announcement Mizuho analyst Ann Hynes, in a note, said pending health insurer/PBM mergers of Aetna Inc with CVS and Cigna Corp with Express Scripts "are even more critical now."NOT WORRIEDWalgreen CEO Stefano Pessina, on a conference call after reporting quarterly results, said he was "not particularly worried" about the PillPack deal."The pharmacy world is much more complex than just delivering certain pills or certain packages," Pessina said.That said, Pessina added, "We know that we have to change the level of our services to the customers, and we are working quite hard on that direction."Some analysts played down the immediate threat."I believe they bought this to learn about the market and to determine if they are able to make larger investments," said Morningstar analyst Vishnu Lekraj.Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Steven Halper noted that PBMs typically require health plan members to use their own mail order pharmacies.Story continuesHe said PillPack could be kicked out of current PBM networks, "especially if Amazon has designs of significantly ramping its prescription volume."Express Scripts dropped PillPack from its network in April 2016, alleging that it had misrepresented itself as a retail pharmacy. The two reached an agreement a month later.PillPack holds pharmacy licenses in all 50 states. It is an in-network pharmacy for some PBMs and for major Medicare Part D plans, a federal drug benefit to help Medicare beneficiaries pay for self-administered prescription medicines.PillPack had attracted interest from Walmart Inc, which was looking to buy it for less than $1 billion, CNBC reported in April.

One way it plans to do that is by introducing the ability for Alexa to translate languages in a more sophisticated manner, beyond the basic words and short phrases it can already translate in different languages including Spanish, German, French and Italian. Amazon wants to turn Alexa into a multilingual assistant who can help in almost any situation. Amazon did not comment immediately.For instance,  if a person from the U.S., who only speaks English, attends a wedding in Tokyo and doesn’t speak Japanese, Alexa would be able to help that person hold a conversation in Japanese. Alexa would have an understanding of the Japanese culture, which is generally more formal and conservative than American culture and would incorporate its knowledge into translations. For example, asking the virtual assistant, “Alexa, what do I say to the father of the bride at a wedding in Japan?” would solicit a different response and tone from Alexa than if you asked the assistant ”What do I say to the master of ceremonies at a wedding in Japan?” The understanding being that remarks you make to the father of the bride would be more formal and reverential than to the wedding’s master of ceremony.In another scenario, Alexa could help a traveler entering a restaurant for the first time in India with the question, “Alexa, I just entered a restaurant in New Delhi. Who should I talk to and what do I say to get a table?” “The cross-culture, cross-language piece is going to be big for Amazon and Alexa, and it has a lot of potential,” one source familiar with the matter told Yahoo Finance.Big ambitions for AlexaSources also told Yahoo Finance that Amazon would like to get Alexa to a point where it’s translating languages for users through any device on-the-fly. In other words, Alexa could one day translate what the father of the bride at that wedding in Japan says into your native language as he’s speaking in real-time. Alexa would also one day be able to translate conversations with multiple people speaking in different languages at one setting. Such a move makes sense for Alexa, which Amazon has long said would evolve into a versatile “Star Trek”-like super computer that accomplishes virtually anything you throw at it with a simple voice command. (It should be noted that one of the “Star Trek” super computer’s most compelling features across the numerous TV series included the ability to translate virtually any language in real-time.)“To truly realize that vision, you’ll want a number of things: you’ll want to have it everywhere, be able to talk to it from anywhere, be able for it to do all of the things you would want an intelligent assistant do for you, and ultimately do it in a very conversational way,” Amazon Vice President of Alexa Al Lindsay told Yahoo Finance during an onstage interview last November.Amazon is already well on its way to making that vision a reality. Tens of millions of Alexa-enabled devices have been sold since the first Echo speaker went on sale in 2014, and according to eMarketer, Amazon Echo will account for 67.9% of the voice-enabled speaker market in 2018.Race to translate languagesIf and when Amazon eventually rolls out such language-translation features, Alexa will enter an area that companies like Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Samsung have tackled with mixed results. In October, Google initially made waves when it claimed its Google Pixel Buds, with the help of Google Assistant, could translate up to 40 languages spoken in real-time, but the actual execution proved lacking. Samsung’s Bixby assistant, fares somewhat better: it uses augmented reality to translate text from more than 100 languages in real-time, but it doesn’t translate actual conversations yet.

The point of having access to multiple Alexa voices is so developers can build skills (apps) in which users interact with a variety of voices instead of just one.For instance, if coders were to create interactive audio stories for Alexa, they could use the new voices to represent different characters, Amazon said.The new Alexa voices are part of the company's Polly service, which developers use to build skills (apps) for Alexa that can recognize text and convert it to a voice that can beam out of an Alexa-powered device like the Amazon Echo smart speaker.Amazon said that developers who are accepted to test the voices will be able to use them for free, but that will likely change when the voices are available to the general public to be used outside of a preview.It should be noted that developers can already add multiple voices to their skills, but it's a more complex process that involves recording a voice as an audio file.Amazon currently has a number of different voices with different dialects and accents developers can currently bundle into their skills, according to the company's website.Some of the voices include: Ivy, a female voice that speaks in mannerisms akin to U.S. English speakers; Hans, a male voice that speaks in German; and Naja, a female voice that speaks Danish. It’s unclear when developers will be able to embed eight non-U.S. English speaking voices into their skills.Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter.Last week, unveiled at its annual developer conference six new voices for the company's competing Google Assistant, including a forthcoming voice that's based on audio recordings from musician John Legend. See original article on Fortune.comMore from Fortune.comApple CEO Tim Cook Says Apple Music Has Over 50 Million UsersAmazon Is Getting Closer to Picking a Site for HQ2Amazon Echo Dot Kids Edition Review: Fun for the Whole FamilyAmazon Prime Members Are Getting New Discounts at Whole FoodsAmazon and Fidelity Labs Collaborated on a Virtual Reality Financial AgentReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceNatural Gas Price Prediction – Prices Tumble as Supplies IncreaseFX EmpireSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolCrude Oil Weekly Price Forecast – Crude oil running into resistanceFX Empire'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloomberg5 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy in 2019Motley Fool

Amazon is accused of illegally poaching sellers to its marketplace through eBay's internal messaging system, according to the Wall Street Journal. Amazon and eBay are head to head competitors when it comes to both sellers and consumers. Amazon focuses more on its buyers and invites them to check the website and make purchases based on their own needs. Whereas, eBay relies on its sellers to make a profit through their sales on eBay’s marketplace.With its quarterly report coming out soon, will this incident make any difference to how investors view Amazon?Let’s list out the different accusations eBay set out in the lawsuit against Amazon and see if they will have any impact on the company.1.       EBay accused Amazon of having perpetrated a scheme over the years to infiltrate and get all of the information on eBay's internal member email system.2.       The scheme is so widespread that it: involves Amazon representatives spanning over many different countries, all targeting eBay employees.3.       The accounts that were used to send messages came from devices linked to Amazon IP addresses, as the scheme was coordinated through Amazon's headquarters.4.        Amazon intentionally interfered with contractual and economic relations. They also committed fraud and violation of the California penal and business professions codes.These are only some of the main points and it seems as though eBay had a lot more to say in relation to their competitor. Currently, Amazon has not said anything in response to this situation, but note that it is investigating the claim. Both companies’ shares were down through afternoon trading Thursday. However, does all of this really make any difference to Amazon in the long run?  We are aware that Amazon dominates the e-commerce space day by day. According to the Wall Street Journal, roughly 50% of U.S. online sales come from Amazon. It is certain that no matter what there will be rivalry and competition between companies within the same industry. EBay has made efforts throughout the years to catch up to Amazon with an easier to navigate website and selling 80% new products.Plus, Amazon has faced many lawsuits in different areas over the years, so it is no surprise the company has not said anything yet as they are aware of how to handle these situations. Yes, it is deteriorating to a company to face a lawsuit and all of these accusations which may or may not be true in the short-run. However, if we look at this from a long-term perspective, the most Amazon will have to do is settle for monetary relief and, as stated in the lawsuit, permanently stop misusing eBay’s messaging system. Wall Street’s Next Amazon Zacks EVP Kevin Matras believes this familiar stock has only just begun its climb to become one of the greatest investments of all time.

It's a far sunnier report than one quarter ago, when the company missed on revenue. Amazon (AMZN) stock surged more than 11% in after-hours trading thanks to the earnings, and was still surging at the time of writing. This was Amazon's fourth-straight profitable quarter.Revenue came in at $29.1 billion, up 28% from last year and beating expectations of $27.99 billion; earnings per share (EPS) came in at $1.07, way above expectations of 58 cents. And revenue for Amazon Web Services (AWS) came to $2.57 billion, edging out estimates of $2.53 billion.It is the latter figure that's most compelling. Amazon is crushing it in cloud-computing. AWS provides storage services to General Electric (GE), Netflix (NFLX), Instagram (FB) and Spotify, to name just a few of the major players that pay to use it. AWS revenue is up 64% from the first quarter of last year, and its operating income is up 170%. That is staggering.AWS is also a profit machine: It accounted for 56% of the company's profit this quarter and is the most profitable business at Amazon. As analyst Jan Dawson pointed out on Twitter, AWS generated more operating income in the quarter than Amazon's entire U.S. e-commerce business, with less than one eighth the revenue.In a story last year, The Atlantic called AWS "the piece of infrastructure that has enabled the current tech boom." It looked like hyperbole, but less so now. It has a murderer's row of clients, and those clients are willing to pay up to use it.There were other highlights in Amazon's earnings: International sales hit $9.57 billion for the quarter, a rise of 23% from $7.75 billion one year ago, showing huge growth outside the U.S. (That being said, its international division is still not profitable.) And the company had some bragging to do about its own devices: On its earnings call, Amazon said its own devices are the best-selling hardware items on Amazon. It sold twice as many Kindle Fire tablets as it did in the first quarter of last year, and CEO Jeff Bezos pointed to Fire sales as a big contributor to overall sales growth, though Amazon does not break out earnings for its hardware.In its shareholder letter, Amazon mentions that Amazon Studios, "acquired the rights to several high-profile films" and names the seven films, which include one directed by Woody Allen. After each movie finishes its run in theatres, each "will become available exclusively to Prime members through Prime Video." This simple statement of fact is a reminder that Amazon is eager to compete with Netflix, HBO and Hulu in the original-content streaming game.Finally, on a personal wealth note, the earnings were especially nice for Bezos, whose net worth jumped by more than $6 billion.--Daniel Roberts is a writer at Yahoo Finance, covering sports business and technology.Read more:Facebook flies after pulverizing earnings expectationsTwitter's earnings can't stop disappointing investorsFor Netflix earnings, better-than-expected isn't good enoughReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchEasy Come, Easy Go: How Carrizo Oil & Gas (NASDAQ:CRZO) Shareholders Got Unlucky And Saw 78% Of Their Cash EvaporateSimply Wall St.Investors Who Bought Toro (NYSE:TTC) Shares Five Years Ago Are Now Up 133%Simply Wall St.Do You Like The Travelers Companies, Inc.

Bezos, however, gave no hints about HQ2's location on Thursday.For the city that ends up as Amazon's home away from home, its housing market is likely to be transformed by the tech giant's presence, and not necessarily for the better. Seattle, Amazon's current base of operations, has seen a rapid increase in average prices of rentals and homes driven in part by an influx of workers, and critics say it has contributed to gentrification there.Amazon also opposed a so-called head tax, which was initially approved by Seattle's city council earlier this year and would have introduced an annual corporate tax of roughly $275 for each full-time employee. The tax was intended to raise funds to help fight homelessness in the city, where Amazon is one of the biggest employers. But city officials blocked the tax in June, and many viewed Amazon as having got its way after signaling that it could take its business elsewhere.NOW WATCH: An environmental group is testing giant floating pipes to clean up oceansSee Also:Jeff Bezos is the richest man in modern history — here's how he spends on philanthropyJeff Bezos is launching a $2 billion fund to support homeless families and education using Amazon's methodsAmazon HQ2 might be headed to Washington, DC, so we asked local startups what they thought about the move — here's what they saidSEE ALSO: Insiders are buzzing that northern Virginia could soon be awarded Amazon's HQ2 as Jeff Bezos makes a high-profile visit to Washington, DCReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextMueller, National Enquirer, Venmo Credit Cards: CEO Daily for April 19, 2019FortuneZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolState defends South Dakota pipeline protest legislationAssociated PressSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphIn Ukrainian candidate's hometown, a cry for changeAssociated Press'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergButina Shouldn't Serve Any More Time in Prison, Her Lawyers SayBloombergAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo Finance3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceInvesting in General Electric Is All About These 3 Key ThingsMotley FoolMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceCardinal Timothy Dolan on the Catholic ChurchWSJRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

Amazon’s new Hub offers apartment tenants a locker for packages. (Amazon)MoreAn urban living situation without lobby personnel presents a significant problem for people who are not home during the day to accept packages. For Amazon, a one-stop dropoff for packages also represents potential cost savings.While this is the first time Amazon has ever commented on the Hub, over 500,000 residents across the country already use these systems, according to the company.Amazon is marketing this to landlords as a modern amenity, addressing the frustrating problems of packages blocking lobbies and hours of building personnel dealing with the sorting and storage of packages. For tenants, it also adding a layer of convenience.Residents of a building with a Hub get a notification when a package has arrived, with a code to open the locker the package is in. (Amazon)More“Building on Amazon’s expertise in locker solutions, the Hub addresses frustrations from property owners, carriers and residents concerning package delivery,” Patrick Supanc, director, Amazon Worldwide Lockers and Pickup, said in a press release. “It offers a single, convenient location for package drop-off and gives property managers time and resources back to focus on other priorities.”According to Amazon, property companies AvalonBay, Fairfield Residential, Pinnacle, J.P. Morgan Asset Management, WinnResidential, and Equity Residential have all participated in the program thus far.The company also told Yahoo Finance that more and more hubs are installed each month.A 2017 Wall Street Journal article, reporting on the early stages, noted that the system does not solve the problem for oversized packages that cannot fit in the lockers. The article also noted that the Hub costs between $10,000 and $20,000 to install with no monthly fee. Amazon declined to comment on cost.Amazon has long experimented with various solutions to the urban last mile, from special lockers where a person can collect a package, up-to-the-block package tracking, a special front-door lock system, and providing customers with photographs of packages discreetly left by carriers.—Ethan Wolff-Mann is a writer at Yahoo Finance.

It's now clear why.Amazon is reportedly testing its own ad product that will show display ads on other publishers' websites to draw consumers back to Amazon. The e-commerce giant previously purchased product listing ads from the Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary on behalf of its advertising customers. Now, it'll sell these new ads directly to advertisers instead of acting as an intermediary with Google.That's a major step for Amazon's ad business, which management described as "a multi-billion-dollar program and growing very quickly," on the company's recent earnings call.During that discussion, one analyst called into question Amazon's ability to increase its ad load, or the number of ads shoppers see, without hurting the customer experience. Amazon's solution? Expand beyond Amazon.com.Closeup of hands typing on a laptop computer.MoreImage source: Getty Images.A massive opportunityLast year, Google generated $17.6 billion in gross ad revenue from its network members. That revenue come from sites or apps using Google's AdSense or AdMob products, with which Google shares its ad revenue. Google paid out a whopping $12.6 billion, but still kept nearly $5 billion in net revenue for itself. For reference, that's bigger than Amazon's entire ad business last year.And that revenue from network members is extremely high-margin. Google simply provides the tools for publishers to display AdSense ads on their sites or AdMob ads on their mobile apps, but it doesn't have to maintain the sites or apps like it does with its owned and operated properties.Amazon could quickly start taking share of the digital display ad market with its new ad product. The company's ads will show web browsers items in which they've previously expressed interest, but didn't purchase, which can produce high conversion rates.Additionally, Amazon has developed a technology for website publishers called a header bidding wrapper to help them maximize the value of their ad inventory by collecting bids from multiple suppliers. It's allowed smaller supply-side platforms to compete with Google in recent years. As such, Google has seen the growth in network members revenue slow while its revenue share increased.Winning twiceAmazon may be able to offer better incentives to both advertisers and web publishers for using its ad products because it has the opportunity to win twice with these ads. The first is just the same as Google: When someone clicks on the ad, Amazon gets paid.But that ad will take web browsers to Amazon's marketplace, where they can purchase the advertised item as well as pretty much anything else you can think of. Whenever someone purchases an item on Amazon, Amazon wins again -- even for third-party merchants.Amazon collects certain fees from its third-party merchants for services like Fulfillment by Amazon or just a simple product-listing fee. Last quarter, third-party seller services revenue increased 39% year over year on a constant currency basis. Third-party sales are an increasingly significant part of Amazon's total revenue.Google has far fewer opportunities to win twice like Amazon can with its advertisements. That puts it at a potential disadvantage when it comes to how much revenue it can share with network members or what kind of pricing it can offer publishers. Amazon, on the other hand, has lots of levers it can pull to take share of the third-party display ad market quickly and keep ramping up its ad business by stepping outside of Amazon.com.

Founded in 2000, the company aims to take private consumers to space.MoreBlue Origin is a privately funded aerospace manufacturer and spaceflight service company based in Kent, Washington, and is the brainchild of Amazon AMZN CEO Jeff Bezos. Founded in 2000, the company aims to take private consumers to space.Blue Origin made headlines earlier this week when it performed a successful high-altitude emergency abort test. The company launched its “New Shepard” rocket and capsule to a record-high altitude, and then simulated a catastrophic failure in the escape pod’s motor. The motor is located at the bottom of the crew capsule and is meant to quickly lift it away from the rocket in the event of an emergency. Even after igniting the engine at record altitudes, both the capsule and rocket were able to land and be recovered safely.Out of this World Bezos, who was named Time magazine’s “Person of the Year” in 1999, turned his attention to space the following year when he quietly founded Blue Origin.Blue Origin came under fire in 2011 when it reported a failure in its suborbital rocket, which went out of control and had to be destroyed. Still, Bezos and his team continued to work hard, and each of the nearly dozen tests that have taken place since then have been successful.Until Blue Origin relaunched New Shepard, no space rocket had ever been used twice. It marked what could historically be remembered as a key turning point in space exploration. For Bezos, it was the ultimate sign that his dream of lowering the cost of access to space is on the right track. Today, it remains an expensive endeavor, which Bezos reportedly funds by annually liquidating $1 billion in Amazon assets.A growing amount of people believe in Bezos’ dream as well. NASA first gave the company $3.9 million in funding in 2009 and then $22 million in 2011. Since then, NASA has continued to provide it with support. The company is also currently in the running to receive military funding from the U.S. Air Force for support of new orbital-class rockets. Its proposal puts it up against Orbital ATK, United Launch Alliance, and Tesla TSLA founder Elon Musk’s SpaceX. The contract is expected to be announced in late 2019.   A 21st Century Space Race?Space exploration was initially a government-only venture. But the turn of the 21st century has given rise to multiple public and privately-owned firms which seek to bring regular citizens to the great beyond.On the public side, large firms such as Boeing BA and Lockheed Martin LMT already have exposure to space-related ventures and are investing to expand their offerings. Boeing collaborated to help create the International Space Station, which saw its first component launched into orbit 20 years ago — ISS is expected to operate for another decade. These firms also invest in GPS technology, satellites, and other space-related technology. Meanwhile, European power Airbus EADSY is developing the Gaia scope, a billion-pixel camera that the company hopes will allow it to create a detailed 3-D map of the Milky Way.Other players in the burgeoning industry include Virgin Galactic, Rocket Lab, Made in Space, and Orbex. In Britain, Orbex raised $40 million in funding and plans to develop a launch vehicle using a government-backed spaceport that will be built in Northern Scotland with the help of Lockheed Martin. Virgin also plans to launch from the UK, and like Blue Origin, hopes to take customers into space.It would be incorrect to assume that space-related activity is only taking place in America and Europe. Ten private rocket companies have formed in just the last three years, according to the China Global Television Network. Russia’s space program has fallen on hard times due to budget restrictions, meaning that it will not be as active as it was during the first space race. Regardless, the 21st century iteration of the race appears to have already begun.Looking Forward“The first trillionaire there will be is the person who exploits the natural resources on asteroids,” astrophysicist Neil DeGrasse Tyson said three years ago on NBC. He went on to say that “there’s this vast universe of limitless energy and limitless resources.”There is no timeline yet for any of these seemingly sci-fi endeavors. But in the meantime, investors can take a look at the companies currently helping advance the field.Story continuesWill You Make a Fortune on the Shift to Electric Cars?Here's another stock idea to consider.

The launch shows how eager the biggest enterprise players are to get ahead in the blockchain game even if their customers are still trying to pinpoint exactly what blockchain can do for them (and some investors are starting to temper their initial excitement).In a blog post about how to use Blockchain Templates, AWS vice president and chief evangelist Jeff Barr acknowledged the lack of clarity by referencing a 1970s “Saturday Night Live” sketch about (http://snltranscripts.jt.org/75/75ishimmer.phtml)Shimmer Floor Wax, a floor polish that is also a non-dairy dessert topping.“Some of the people that I talk to see blockchains as the foundation of a new monetary system and a way to faciliate international payments. Others see blockchains as a distributed ledger and immutable data source that can be applied to logistics, supply chain, land registration, crowdfunding and other use cases,” he wrote. “Either way, it’s clear that there are a lot of intriguing possibilities and we are working to help our customers use this technology more effectively.AWS Blockchain Templates give AWS users working on blockchain apps a faster way to set up Ethereum or Hyperledger Fabric networks. Its launch comes six months after Oracle unveiled a new cloud service built on the open-source Hyperledger Fabric project during Oracle OpenWorld and about a year after IBM announced its own Hyperledger-based blockchain-as-a-service offering.Another new competitor in the BaaS market is Huawei, which announced its Blockchain Service, also built on Hyperledger, last week during its analyst conference in Shenzhen.

Despite explosive top-line growth, Amazon has consistently shown little-to-no GAAP profits in its core e-commerce business.One of the biggest drivers of sales growth has been Prime, Amazon's $99 per year (or $12.99 per month) subscription service. Started back in 2005, Prime offers a suite of intriguing benefits, most notably free two-day shipping for an unlimited number of items.Today, it seems increasingly clear that this was a farsighted and ingenious invention. As Prime has grown, Amazon has added benefits, spurring increased membership in a virtuous cycle. Now Prime is so large, it's causing problems even at Amazon's largest (and well-run) competitors: Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and Latin American e-commerce platform MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI). Amazon is competing hard against Walmart in the United States, but recent rumors suggest it's eyeing Latin America, specifically Brazil, potentially threatening MercadoLibre's leading position there. How are both companies trying to fend off the Amazon machine? With free two-day shipping, of course.a roll of hundred dollar bills at the end of a mousetrap.MoreImage source: Getty Images.Prime's progressThe bet on Prime may have seemed crazy at the time it was launched in 2005. Analysts often cited the fact that Amazon lost significant amounts of money on every Prime member due to shipping costs. But since then, Prime's annual price has increased from $79 to $99, and the service is now estimated to have between 65 million and 80 million members (Amazon does not disclose these figures). Those members contributed $3.2 billion in subscription revenue for Amazon, or just under 10% of sales, in the recent quarter. Consumer Research Intelligence Partners estimates that Prime members spend roughly $1,300 per year with Amazon, versus $700 for non-Prime members. That has, in turn, bolstered Amazon's third-party fulfillment business, which has higher margins.   Amazon's stock has rocketed in recent years as Prime has grown, winning over legions of loyal customers. It is only now, more than a decade after Prime launched, that competitors are biting the bullet to invest in free shipping.MercadoLibre claws aheadMercadoLibre rolled out free shipping in Mexico in 2016, then added it in Brazil in August 2017. Perhaps not coincidentally, that change came not long before rumors that Amazon was looking hard at the Brazilian market.The introduction of free shipping has been a huge positive for MercadoLibre's sales and gross market value (GMV), which grew a huge 70.5% and 66.5%, respectively, over the past year.But the company's margins tell a different story. Gross margins shrank from 63.5% to 46.5%, and operating margins plummeted from 25.2% to 4.8% (stripping out the effect of Venezuela, which the company de-consolidated in December). The largest cost difference? Free shipping, of course. MercadoLibre still applies volume conditions on free shipping, which vary by country, so its offering is not yet unlimited. Larger volumes should also generate more revenue from its fulfillment and payment businesses, Mercado Envios and MercadoPago, which have made encouraging progress to the point that optimism around these businesses offset concerns about MercadoLibre's lower margins. Story continuesStill, the free-shipping initiative combined with investments in fulfillment centers caused management to suspend its dividend going forward.WalmartUnlike MercadoLibre, which is trying to stay one step ahead of Amazon, Walmart is actually playing catch-up in the mature U.S. market. Walmart began pivoting in earnest to becoming more of an e-commerce company in recent years, buying Jet.com in 2016, and even changing its official company name from Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. to Walmart, Inc. in December, highlighting the company's renewed focus on e-commerce.Walmart's transition incorporated -- you guessed it -- free two-day shipping. Initially, Walmart tried to build its own Prime-like subscription service called ShippingPass, for which it charged $49, but obviously, the endeavor wasn't working as the company scrapped the subscription service in January 2017 in favor of free two-day shipping on eligible items included in orders over $35. Trying to play catch-up while fending off a giantAmazon has built quite a powerhouse in its Prime service, and the company's long-term orientation and willingness to lose money for years has put the e-commerce giant in prime position (pun very much intended), even against its largest-scale rivals.

Amazon's new feature, which it launched last year, is now finally available to most (if not all) customers in the US, according to Android Police. It's not like any other tracking feature, which only gives you a vague idea of where your package is: this one actually allows you to monitor your driver.Business Insidersays you'll get access to live tracking when your driver only has fewer than 10 stops left before reaching your location. It shows you their estimated time of arrival and how many deliveries they have left before they arrive. Since you can see the driver's every movement, it raises concerns about security and privacy -- someone could order an item just to see which houses near them have gotten packages they could steal off porches. It sounds like a useful tool, however, if you're out of the house and want to make sure you're there to receive your package or that the driver truly made a stop at your place. Well played, @amazon Putting a live update of where my packages are so that I can obsessively check my deliveries and open your app more.

The theater chain would be a natural place to showcase Amazon's growing slate of original films and could present yet another opportunity to add benefits for Prime members.A group of people watching a movie at a theater.MoreImage source: Getty Images.How Amazon could shake up movie theatersPhysical theaters present a number of opportunities for Amazon.First and foremost, they give the company a place to screen its original films. Unlike Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX), Amazon has given theaters a first-run window for its original films before they appear on its Prime streaming service. Still, many theaters prefer to show big studio blockbusters than the smaller films Amazon produces. Landmark is the perfect setting for its films, ensuring they reach as wide an audience as possible. As more people become aware of Prime's offerings, that opens the door for more people to become Prime members.For a similar reason, Netflix is also considering a bid for Landmark. Netflix still wants to release its films to theaters on the same day that it releases them on its streaming service, but Landmark could give Netflix the ability to make more of its films Oscar eligible. Films must appear in theaters for a certain amount of time to be eligible for Academy Awards, and an Oscar could increase awareness of Netflix's originals.Beyond having a place to showcase original films, Amazon could inject Prime membership perks into the movie theater experience. For example, Amazon could introduce Prime benefits for ticket pricing, an area that's already facing disruption.Subscription ticketing services have forced AMC (NYSE: AMC) to introduce Stubs A-List, a $20 per month subscription that allows customers to see up to three movies per week at any AMC theater. The service has been a hit, attracting more than 180,000 subscribers in just over a month. Amazon could introduce free or heavily discounted tickets for Prime members to compete with AMC or create a subscription package of its own.Amazon could also give steep discounts on concessions for Prime members. Concession sales are a huge moneymaker for theater chains. AMC sold $446 million in food and beverages last quarter at a cost of only $72 million. Amazon could cut those prices in half and still produce gross margins well above what investors are used to.Landmark already offers higher-end concessions at some of its theaters -- an area where AMC is also investing. Amazon could expand on Landmark's existing offerings with products from Whole Foods, creating a differentiated experience at theaters.Driving Prime subscribersThe company's push into the brick-and-mortar world has been largely focused on increasing Prime subscribers. It's made several moves with Whole Foods to encourage shoppers to sign up for Prime, like discounts, free delivery, and free grocery pickup at select locations. Landmark presents a similar opportunity to drive Prime membership.Prime is one of the pillars of Amazon's business. Its members are more loyal when it comes to online shopping, and the program allows Amazon to post industry-leading conversion rates from product search to checkout.Story continuesAmazon increased the price of Prime recently, and purchasing a movie theater might present an opportunity to justify the price hike by expanding member benefits. If AMC can attract 180,000 customers in just over a month with a $20 monthly movie subscription, Amazon should be able to drive quite a few new Prime members with movie theater perks.There are still several hurdles to overcome for Amazon to capture Landmark. Amazon is not the only bidder and there are long-standing regulations that could prevent the company, as a movie studio, from owning a theater. Still, the acquisition could be the next step toward an even bigger Amazon Prime empire.

Despite serious glitches at its start, Amazon announced this morning that Prime Day 2018 grew to become the biggest shopping event in its history, beating out Cyber Monday, Black Friday, and the previous Prime Day 2017. Of course, this year's Prime Day was longer - a full 36-hours, in fact. And while Amazon did make its comparisons to other sales holidays over the same period of time, it's not quite the same thing to compare a shorter sale to a longer one. (Last year's Prime Day was 30 hours, for example.)Still, it's a remarkable showing on Amazon's part. So much so that Amazon has taken the unusual step of actually providing some numbers around how much people bought. Though it still declines to talk sales dollars, as per usual, it did say that Prime members worldwide purchased over 100 million products, with small and medium-sized businesses on Amazon "far exceeding" $1 billion in sales this year.It was unclear, however, if Amazon was counting sales at Whole Foods - which did participate in Prime Day for the first time - when calculating this 100 million products sold figure, or its "best day ever" statements. We asked the company to clarify this, and confirmed that Whole Foods sales were not being included in those calculations.That said, Amazon says that Prime members "saved millions" at Whole Foods during Prime Day, where the top buy was organic strawberries.Prime Day 2018 was also the biggest event ever for Amazon devices, the retailer noted.This can be, in part, chalked up to the fact that Amazon put its device on sale 12 hours before Prime Day even began, which allowed people more time to buy them at the reduced prices.Its best-sellers worldwide included the Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote and the Echo Dot. The Dot was a top seller in 2017, too. It's the most affordable of the Alexa-powered speakers, and was this year marked down $20 to $29.99, making it a good deal. Fire TV devices, Kindle e-readers had their best day ever on Amazon globally on day one of Prime Day, July 16, 2018. Prime Day was also the biggest sales event for Echo Show and Echo Spot.Amazon didn't provide numbers for any of these sales, but said "millions" of Fire TV devices were sold worldwide.In the U.S., July 17 was the biggest day for smart home devices in history, with over a million devices sold, and Ring had its best day ever on July 16, with the Ring Video Doorbell Pro selling out. The Amazon Cloud Cam also became the best-selling security camera in Amazon history.Outside of Amazon devices, other U.S. top sellers included the Instant Pot and LifeStraw water filters. Members purchased more than 300,000 Instant Pot 6 Qt 7-in-1 Multi Use and 150,000 LifeStraw Personal Water Filters, the retailer said. Back-to-school items also did well, with millions of pencils and pens sold.Different countries had their own best-sellers, which tended to include smart home items, electronics, gaming systems, tools, and other items for the home.Among Amazon's own brands, top sellers included the Stone & Beam Ceramic Geometric Table Lamp; Presto! Ultra Soft Toilet Paper; Daily Ritual Women's Jersey Short-Sleeve V-Neck T-Shirt Dress and AmazonBasics Pre-Seasoned Cast Iron Skillet.The company said that a record number of Prime members shopped Prime Day in 2018, but this, too can be explained partly by expanded access to the sale - Prime Day went live in Australia, Singapore, the Netherlands and Luxembourg for the first time this year. In total, 17 countries had access to Prime Day sales.More importantly to Amazon's bottom line was the increase in Prime membership sign-ups. In the end, the actual sales are just icing on the cake - Prime Day's larger goal is increasing the number of subscribers for its now $119 per year Prime membership program. Turning online consumers into paying subscribers not only increases Amazon's subscription revenues, it boosts overall sales as those consumers begin to shop Amazon more often to take advantage of its free, 2-day shipping and other premium services - like Amazon Channels, audiobook subscriptions, on-demand music, and more.The retailer in April announced Prime had exceeded 100 million subscribers, and Amazon didn't update that number today.Story continuesIt's notable that Amazon Prime Day went well, given how badly it began - glitches caused shoppers to lose the ability to even see the deals or complete checkout at the beginning of the sale, potentially resulting in millions of lost sales.“Prime Day offers us a unique opportunity to thank Prime members with our best deals,” said Jeff Wilke, CEO Worldwide Consumer, Amazon, in a statement. “Extending Prime Day to a day and a half this year allowed us to further reward members with unbeatable deals, access to exclusive new products and unforgettable experiences that highlight the many benefits of a Prime membership. All of this was made possible because of our many valued associates – the global team that continues to make Prime Day bigger and better.” This article originally appeared on TechCrunch.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley Fool3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceInvesting in General Electric Is All About These 3 Key ThingsMotley FoolCardinal Timothy Dolan on the Catholic ChurchWSJ

In the U.S. alone, more than 1 billion items were shipped for free using Prime, Amazon said in a statement Wednesday.The U.S. was already headed into a blow-out Christmas shopping spree, as Americans are benefiting from higher employment and wages, fueling higher household cash flow. Consumers seemed to be merry despite a S&P 500 Index that has tumbled, a government shutdown that’s entering its fifth day and ongoing trade tensions with China.Amazon wasn’t the only one benefiting from an insatiable consumer appetite. Mastercard Inc. and Visa Inc. rebounded after four days of declines. Mastercard said holiday sales increased 5.1 percent to more than $850 billion this year, the strongest growth in the last six years. Online shopping saw gains of 19 percent compared with 2017, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse. Brick-and-mortar retailers also gained. Nike Inc., Macy’s Inc., Kohl’s Corp. and PVH Corp. were all higher mid-morning in New York.People bought “millions more” of Amazon’s own devices compared with last year, including the new Echo Dot speaker and the Fire TV Stick, the Seattle-based company said. At the same time, Amazon said more than 50 percent of items sold in its stores came from small and medium-sized businesses.Among the most popular items under the Christmas tree were the L.O.L. Surprise! Glam Glitter Series doll, Bose Corp. wireless headphones and clothes from Carhartt Inc. Other popular brands bought through Amazon’s Prime Wardrobe service, which allows consumers to fill a box with selected items and return anything that they don’t want, included PVH Corp.’s Calvin Klein, and Hanesbrands Inc.’s Champion.Amazon started the shopping frenzy out strong, with November’s Cyber Monday already pegged as the company’s biggest shopping day in history. Along with the Christmas sales report, the picture seems much brighter than Amazon had initially projected in its latest earnings results. In October, Amazon’s revenue and profit forecast for the holiday quarter fell short of analysts’ estimates, as investors worried about Amazon’s increased pace of spending.While Amazon has expanded into almost every area of retail, from pharmaceuticals to groceries, its more profitable units are cloud computing and advertising. Still, Amazon, which dominates e-commerce in the U.S., has relied on the growth of its Prime members, who pay $119 a year for the service. Recent estimates put subscribers at just under 100 million in the U.S. Amazon didn’t give any new numbers for Prime subscribers in its statement Wednesday, but said millions of unique items in the U.S. shipped with Prime.That kind of volume presents a challenge for logistics services like FedEx Corp. and United Parcel Service Inc. In 2013, a larger than expected surge in last-minute online shopping caught UPS off guard and forced it and Amazon and other retailers to offer refunds to customers who didn’t receive their orders on time for Christmas.This year, UPS said it expects to deliver an average of more than 31 million parcels a day during the holidays and anticipates a peak-season total of about 800 million packages to rise 5 percent compared with last year’s tally. To deal with the rush of deliveries, the company invested in automation and new facilities to add sorting capacity of 350,000 packages an hour to its U.S. system.“We’re so far pleased with the operational aspect of it,” said Glenn Zaccara, a spokesman for UPS. “The investments that UPS made in the network, technology, people and planning across the season with our customers obviously paid off.”The couriers are bracing for a second wave of business as people begin returning gifts in January. UPS expects return packages to hit 1.3 million on Jan. 3. The company said it had 1.5 million returns, its highest for the season, on Dec. 19.Story continuesWith the S&P teetering on a bear market after a volatile fourth quarter and the worst December in more than a decade, Baird analyst Colin Sebastian lists Amazon as one of the three best picks for investors in the event of a market rebound. Amazon shares were up 1.9 percent to $1,369.12 at 10:57 a.m. in New York Wednesday. They have gained about 17 percent this year, compared with an 12 percent decline on the S&P 500.If Amazon’s Echo speaker was one of its best sellers, it appears to also have been a victim of its own success. Powered by Alexa, the voice-activated software, the smart devices appeared overwhelmed by an onslaught of new users on Christmas, according to reports from the U.K. Owners asking Alexa to play music, turn on the tree lights or recite turkey recipes were often met with the highly unsatisfactory response of: “Sorry, I’m having trouble understanding you right now,” The Guardian reported.A week before Christmas, several of Amazon’s online stores in North America and Europe sold out of various models of Alexa-powered devices, hinting at the surge in demand.(Updates with spending trends from Mastercard in fourth paragraph.)--With assistance from Thomas Black.To contact the reporter on this story: Molly Schuetz in New York at mschuetz9@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Jonathan Roeder, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2018 Bloomberg L.P.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolTesla earnings: The big question is how big is the quarterly lossMarketWatch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo Finance5 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy in 2019Motley FoolAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceHere's What Hedge Funds Think About NIO Inc.

REUTERS/Mike Segar/File PhotoMoreBy David Shepardson and Susan HeaveyWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Six major Web companies and internet-service providers, including AT&T Inc, Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google, will detail their consumer data privacy practices to a U.S. Senate panel on Sept. 26, according to a congressional statement on Wednesday.The Senate hearing will give the six technology-related companies, which also include Amazon.com Inc, Apple Inc and Charter Communications Inc, "an opportunity to explain their approaches to privacy," said U.S. Senator John Thune, the Republican chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee.They will also testify on "how they plan to address new requirements from the European Union and California, and what Congress can do to promote clear privacy expectations without hurting innovation," Thune said.Data privacy has become an increasingly important issue, fueled by massive breaches that have compromised the personal information of millions of U.S. internet and social media users, as well as breaches involving large retailers and credit reporting agency Equifax Inc.Separately, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said in a tweet late on Tuesday that Google "claims to be fair, but gave a 'silent donation' to a left-wing group to stop Trump" and "works w/ China/Russia to censor the internet, but canceled a contract with our military."He noted Google declined to take part in a Senate Intelligence hearing last week that featured Twitter and Facebook. "It’s time for @Google to answer some ?’s An invite will be on its way," McCarthy wrote.Google said in a statement on Wednesday that the "suggestion that Google's products or actions are politically biased is simply wrong." The company said it "will continue to ensure that our products and election efforts remain strictly non-partisan in nature."The Internet Association, which represents more than 40 major internet and technology companies, said on Tuesday it backed modernizing U.S. data privacy rules but wants a national approach that would pre-empt new regulations in California that take effect in 2020.The witnesses at the Sept. 26 Senate hearing include Google's chief privacy officer, Twitter's global data protection officer and Apple's vice president for software technology.The White House said in July it was working to develop consumer data privacy policies and officials have held more than 50 meetings with major firms and other groups as the Trump administration seeks to help the policies become enshrined in legislation eventually.California Governor Jerry Brown signed data privacy legislation in June aimed at giving consumers more control over how companies collect and manage their personal information, although it was not as stringent as new rules in Europe.Under the law, large companies would be required starting in 2020 to let consumers view the data they have collected on them, request deletion of data, and opt out of having the data sold to third parties.The European Union General Data Protection Regulation took effect in May, replacing the bloc's patchwork of rules dating back to 1995. Breaking privacy laws can result in fines of up to 4 percent of global revenue or 20 million euros ($23.2 million), whichever is higher, as opposed to a few hundred thousand euros.(Reporting by Susan Heavey and David Shepardson in Washington; Editing by Susan Thomas and Matthew Lewis)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextFoxconn says it remains committed to Wisconsin investment projectReutersAt $1 Trillion, Apple is Bigger Than These ThingsInvestopediaWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhat to Expect When Alphabet Reports Later This MonthMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceTesla's board is about to get a lot smallerTechCrunchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceQualcomm's joint venture with Chinese province to shut down: The InformationReutersAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceEquity Shot: Pinterest zooms into the public markets (and yet another tech company files for an IPO)TechCrunchWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergCaterina Fake is known for her trend-spotting; here's some of what she's chasing nowTechCrunch

Shares in U.S. healthcare companies fell across the board.The new, not-for-profit venture will initially focus on technology for "simplified, high-quality and transparent healthcare" for their more than 500,000 U.S. employees. They did not elaborate on their strategy, but said they are searching for a chief executive officer.Healthcare industry experts say the new entity could eventually negotiate directly with drugmakers, doctors and hospitals and use their vast databases to get a better handle on the costs of those services.That could undercut the industry's "middlemen," from health insurers to pharmacies and benefits managers."The ballooning costs of healthcare act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy," said Berkshire Hathaway Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Warren Buffett. "Our group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable."ISI Evercore analyst Michael Newshal said the selloff in healthcare stocks reflected the fear of disruption in a sector helped by rising prices year after year, but is under growing scrutiny from U.S. consumers, regulators and politicians."There are a lot of companies, or arguably almost all companies, in healthcare that benefit from cost inflation running as high as it has been for many years. And if there is pressure to lower that, that can flow throughout the entire system," Newshal said.MAJOR DISRUPTOR?U.S. healthcare spending has been increasing annually faster than inflation, and in 2017 accounted for 18 percent of the U.S. economy. Corporations sponsor health benefits for more than 160 million Americans.Major healthcare players have tried to reduce costs without losing their profit margins. Most recently, pharmacy network CVS Health Corp reached a $69 billion deal to buy insurer Aetna Inc, arguing their combination could save money for the nation's employers.Investors in the sector see Amazon becoming a major disruptor of healthcare, just as it has done in the retail industry, fuelled by media reports in recent months that the company was considering entering the pharmacy business.Teaming up with JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank, and Berkshire, the third largest public company in the world, offers new opportunities to shake up the industry, analysts said.For example, JPMorgan could help shape new payment models for consumers and providers, and provide cost data. CEO Dimon has for years expressed concerns about rising healthcare costs.In 2015 he wrote in his annual letter that the company spent $1.1 billion on medical benefits for U.S. employees, 2 percent of company-wide expenses.Berkshire CEO Buffett has long complained that high healthcare costs were hurting American businesses, and publicly began using the term "tapeworm" to describe their effects as early as 2010.The partnership will be spearheaded by Berkshire investment officer Todd Combs, JPMorgan managing director Marvelle Berchtold and Amazon senior vice president Beth Galetti.Combs, 47, has been an investment deputy to Buffett since 2010, and joined JPMorgan's board in 2016.INSURERS FALLHealth insurers that provide benefit management or health plans to Amazon, JPMorgan and Berkshire could be among the hardest hit.JPMorgan uses UnitedHealth Group Inc and Cigna Corp for health benefits for its global workforce, according to ISI Evercore analyst Ross Muken. Neither company was available for comment.Amazon uses Premera Blue Cross, part of the Blue Cross Blue Shield network, according to Muken. Express Scripts, the pharmacy benefits manager, has disclosed it manages pharmacy benefits for Amazon.Shares in UnitedHealth, Cigna Corp and health insurer Anthem Inc fell 3 percent to 7 percent. Drugstore operators CVS and Walgreen Boots Alliance as well Express Scripts all dropped between 4 percent to 5 percent. Drug distributors Cardinal Health, AmerisourceBergen and McKesson were off 1 percent to 3 percent. Amazon added 0.7 percent.(Additional reporting by Ankur Banerjee and Aparajita Saxena in Bengaluru and David Henry and Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Savio D'Souza and Jeffrey Benkoe)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextAnthem expanding into second Tech Square tower, adding hundreds of jobsAmerican City Business JournalsWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley Fool2 Stocks You Can Buy and Hold ForeverMotley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool'World's smallest baby boy' set to go home in JapanAFP'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

Most important among those will be genuine, intense customer obsession. The child will be the customer.”Along with running Amazon the tech mogul owns space exploration company Blue Origin and the Washington Post newspaper.However, he has recently said he is looking to use his wealth for philanthropy, following in the footsteps of Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg. He has put aside an initial $2bn to fund the Day 1 initiative, which will also assist homeless families.Mr Bezos said his fund will launch “Montessori-inspired” nurseries in low income areas as well as supporting homeles families.Mr Bezos singled out a homeless charity in Seattle, where Amazon is headquartered, that has the policy that “no child sleeps on the street”. More families in the United States are homelessness than any other developed nation, figures suggest. pic.twitter.com/2GlgjztK1u — Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) September 13, 2018 Recent studies indicate that one one night in January 2017, over half a million people were living without a roof over their heads. Mr Bezos' tweet announcing the donation received mixed reaction on social media, with many pointing out that Amazon pays a light tax bill in the countries it operates and alleging that workers were underpaid.The recently completed Amazon Spheres building in Seattle, where the company is headquartered Credit: Reuters MoreSeveral reports have critiqued Amazon’s low wages for workers in its global distribution plants, where items are packaged and shipped for delivery. Employees in Amazon’s British and American “fulfillment centres” have complained of long hours without breaks.The company halved its corporation tax bill to $4.5bn in the UK despite tripling profits. Amazon said that it had paid all that was “required”. Its UK operations manager insisted that it would be creating 2,500 jobs in the UK going forward. Amazon has already made inroads into the education sector in the UK, inking a five-year £600m deal to sell office supplies and medical equipment to schools, emergency services and local government across Yorkshire in August. ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadgetAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolTesla's board is about to get a lot smallerTechCrunchWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunch

But alas, price is an issue, and Apple charges way more for iPads than rival companies do for their Android tablets… except for today.Amazon is blowing out refurbished iPad Air 2 tablets for one day only, and the prices are nuts. You can get an iPad Air 2 today for as little as $299! This is a featured deal of the day today from Amazon, but these are refurbs so there’s a very good chance that some or all models will sell out. At the time of this writing though, there were four different iPad Air 2 models available in the sale, and you can find them all below.

Here's what has changedKrystal HuReporterYahoo FinanceAugust 20, 2018ReblogShareTweetShare(David Foster/Yahoo Finance)MoreIt’s been a year since Amazon (AMZN) closed its $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods Market. The bombshell news once sent many other grocery stocks tumbling amid investor concerns. Some expected the e-commerce giant, which has changed the way people buy books, to disrupt how people shop for kale and cereals. So here we are. One year after Amazon took over Whole Foods, the natural grocery chain has become a virtual mystery to analysts as Amazon’s earnings reports shed little light on key measures of its performance.  Whole Foods CEO John Mackey once gushed that the Amazon deal was “love at first sight.” He later admitted at a conference in February “if you want to stay in the marriage, you change.” How has Amazon changed Whole Foods? And what’s ahead for Whole Foods? Through interviews, surveys and third-party data provided by Second Measure, Yahoo Finance can provide some insights.Whole Foods sales remain flat(David Foster/Yahoo Finance)MoreAmazon’s heavily-promoted price cuts have attracted attention, but they didn’t necessarily bring a big boost to Whole Foods. Whole Foods sales since the acquisition have largely remained stable, with only low single-digit growth, according to data from Second Measure, a company that tracks consumer spending. The premium grocery store’s growth has been stagnant since 2015. New shoppers only account for 3% of its customers base.Neil Saunders, the managing director of retail at GlobalData, sees no further decline in sales as a sign of progress. “If Whole Foods hasn’t been acquired by Amazon, we could probably see sales reverse much more sharply,” he said. The steep pricing strategy and limited investment in stores have kept the sales growth stagnant since 2015. (David Foster/Yahoo Finance)MoreAmazon’s self-created shopping holiday Prime Day did bring a bump. This year, Whole Foods celebrated its first Amazon Prime Day by offering $10 Amazon credit to Prime members who spend $10 or more at Whole Foods from July 11-17. Whole Foods’ average daily sales during the promotion week were 5% higher than the average summer day.The “Amazon Effect” on Whole Foods is really tied to the e-commerce giant’s Prime Membership. Amazon’s core subscription program now touts over 100 million users around the world. Those members accounted for more than half of Whole Foods sales in the U.S. In June 2018, 41% of Whole Foods new consumers were already Prime members, compared to 34% one year ago. However, the increase doesn’t necessarily mean the Prime sales and promotions are luring more shoppers. During that same time period, the percentage of Amazon Prime members among the U.S. population also increased to 32% from 27%.(David Foster/Yahoo Finance)MoreStory continuesCustomers see some product changesYahoo Finance surveyed more than 2,000 Whole Food shoppers about their experience in the past year. Forty percent believe the price of products in stores aren’t really lower. Nearly half of those surveyed say Amazon has brought positive changes to Whole Foods. The most popular feature in the integration is the discounts for Prime members at Whole Foods stores. Amazon has been gradually rolling out the perk since May. Now Prime members can enjoy an additional 10% off sale items in stores nationwide, plus exclusive weekly discounts on select items.Meanwhile, Whole Foods has been reorganizing its shelves by removing and adding products. Instead of giving regional teams the autonomy to source local products, the company’s management team at its Austin headquarter now makes centralized buying decisions, in an effort to standardize the supply chain and reduce cost. From Nature Valley granola bars, Tropicana Orange Juice to Starbucks cold brew coffee, Whole Foods has opened its arms to common brand names found at other grocery chains like Walmart. With consumer-packaged goods (CPG), Whole Foods now offers more options for shoppers. Travis Christensen, a Whole Foods shopper in Arizona, said the chain has emerged as his primary grocery store since Amazon’s acquisition. “I like Amazon bringing value proposition rather than just premium and organic. I use Prime discounts and appreciate the sprinkling of mainstream products,” Christensen wrote in the survey.But introducing more CPG, a different approach from Whole Foods’ long-standing reputation for sourcing natural and organic products locally, has disappointed some loyal customers. “Local brand items are disappearing from the shelves. This was something that made me loyal to Whole Foods in the past, but is making me rethink if I want to continue shopping there versus other grocery stores in the future,” John Dixon from Louisville, Kentucky told Yahoo Finance.Some longtime employees have also raised eyebrows at the push. Brittain Ladd, a retail consultant who had worked for Amazon, believes phasing out some locally sourced products is a necessary pain for Whole Foods.“The way Amazon could reduce cost is standardizing the assortments across all stores and relying on a nationwide distribution model versus the locally sourced model,” said Ladd.What’s next for Whole Foods(David Foster/Yahoo Finance)MoreAnalysts believe Amazon has delivered on its plan for Whole Foods in the first year of the transition, by focusing on reorganization and integrating Prime membership into the shopping experience.The streamline and standardization process is ongoing. Whole Foods has been working on consolidating its 13 regions across the country, Yahoo Finance has learned.Customers can expect more changes on the aisles, too. Amazon is expected to introduce more consumer packaged and private label products, a move that analysts believe would open the premium store to a larger customer base. “Amazon is performing a lot of analysis to identify what products to put on their shelves to bring the most customers, not to retain current customers,” said Ladd.With all the online and offline shopping behavior data Amazon could collect, Saunders thinks it will take a more personalized approach to making promotions and discounts more relevant to shoppers.More moves could also be expected on delivery. In February, Yahoo Finance first reported Amazon’s move to consolidate Amazon Fresh and Prime Now to work with Whole Foods. In the past year, both the delivery startup Instacart and Amazon have been sending Whole Foods goods to people’s doorway.“Amazon has a bucket list of things it would like to do, but it’s not gonna do them all at once. It has to learn how to cope with the existing business,” said Saunders. “They’re a bit slower than they usually are, a year is not a long time frame for astounding changes, so there is definitely more to come.”Do you work for Amazon/Whole Foods?

TV anchor-helicopter pilotMike SniderUSA TODAYJanuary 10, 2019ReblogShareTweetShareThe divorce between Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos and wife, MacKenzie, may be more complicated than originally expected.The couple, who have been married 25 years, announced their divorce Wednesday over Twitter. They had been separated but were now making it official, their statement said."As our family and close friends know, after a long period of loving exploration and trial separation, we have decided to divorce and continue our shared lives as friends," they said.Subsequent news reports suggest the timing of their announcement may have been forced. The National Enquirer is publishing in its latest edition, out Thursday, what it calls a four-month investigation tracking Bezos's time spent with former Fox L.A. TV anchor Lauren Sanchez, the wife of Hollywood talent agent Patrick Whitesell.More: Target, Costco report strong holiday season sales to round out yearMore: January specials: Your monthly guide to freebies and meal dealsMore: 10 Amazon products under $30 that people are obsessing overSanchez and Whitesell are also divorcing, according to several outlets including People.com. The couple owned a home in Seattle and have socialized with the Bezoses in the past, the New York Post reported.Sanchez, 49, also a helicopter pilot with her own aerial production firm, was hired to shoot aerial shots for Blue Origin, a private space company Bezos founded in 2000, the Post reported. She served as the initial host on Fox's "So You Think You Can Dance," and has been a contributor to TV shows including "The View," "Larry King Live," "Showbiz Tonight," and "The Joy Behar Show."Lauren Sanchez arrives for the 67th Golden Globe Awards on Jan. 6, 2019. She is reportedly dating Amazon CEO and founder Jeff Bezos.MoreSanchez and Whitesell married in 2005 and have two children, but have not filed for divorce as of now, Fox News reported. She has a teenage son from her first marriage to former NFL player Tony Gonzalez.She and Bezos were seen together in Los Angeles on Sunday, the day of the Golden Globes and at Amazon's after-party, the Post reported. Bezos made the announcement about the divorce Wednesday because he knew photos of the two would become public, the Post reported.However, Bezos' wife, MacKenzie, knew the two were dating, the Post quotes an unnamed person close to Bezos as saying. "The news today was not a surprise to her. Lauren was with Jeff at the Golden Globes because they are dating," the person said.TMZ reported Thursday that the Bezoses did not have a prenuptial agreement and plan to file for divorce in Washington. While Washington state divorce law considers all that the couple builds and accrues during their marriage as community property, that doesn't necessarily mean a 50-50 split of assets — including six homes, according to Business Insider — but the court attempts to split assets (and debts), fair and equitably.The couple could have devised a postnuptial agreement to do so on their own and likely have a deal meant to not rock Amazon. "It's unlikely there’s any risk to the company," said Stuart Slotnick, chairman of the matrimonial department of law firm Buchanan Ingersoll & Rooney in New York City. "When you are talking over $100 billion there is enough to go around."Story continuesEven if MacKenzie Bezos should eventually depart with half of Bezos' wealth, valued at $137 billion atop Bloomberg's Billionaires Index, the Amazon founder would remain among the top four most wealthy.And, should Amazon's shares continue to rise, Fortune noted, he could again overtake Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates as the world's richest man.More: How much could Mackenzie Bezos get in divorce with Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos?More: Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and wife MacKenzie to divorce after 25 years of marriageFollow USA TODAY reporter Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Amazon CEO Bezos reportedly didn't have a prenup, dating L.A.

Although he doesn't typically answer those emails himself, he does read them."I see most of those emails. I see them and I forward them to the executives in charge of the area with a question mark. It's shorthand [for] can you look into this? Why is this happening?," Bezos said.Getting such an email is a pretty common thing at Amazon, and it's also big deal. The executive, in turn, will often foward it along to the manager in charge of the area who will view the email with a sinking heart, one of them recently told us.That's because the manager is then on the hook to drop everything, investigate and get back with an answer. Sometimes that means a lot of research over nights and weekends, the Amazon manager recently told us. But Bezos views that email address, jeff@amazon.com, as a way to stay close to customers, which can otherwise be hard to do as an executive, who is far removed from day-to-day customer service and sees the company mostly through data and reports."We have tons of metrics," Bezos explained on stage. "When you are shipping billions of packages a year, you need good data and metrics: are you delivering on time? Delivering on time to every city? To apartment complexes? ... Whether the packages have too much air in them, wasteful packaging."So those customer complaints gives him front-line insights. If all of his data say one thing and a few customers say something else, he believes the customers."The thing I have noticed is when the anecdotes and the data disagree, the anecdotes are usually right. There's something wrong with the way you are measuring it," he explained.This is one of the ways Bezos expresses what he calls one of Amazon's most important values: customer obsession. "We talk about it, customer obsession, as opposed to competitor obsession," he said. Often companies say they are focused on customers but they really spend most of their energy reacting to and talking about competitors."If your whole culture is competitor-obsessed, it's hard to stay motivated if you are out in front. Whereas customers are also unsatisfied, always discontent, always want more. So no matter how far in front you get in front of competitors, you are still behind your customers. They are always pulling you along," he said.Video: Bezos Reveals How Many Customers Subscribe to Amazon PrimeFor more news videos visit Yahoo View.  NOW WATCH: The top 10 games coming in 2018See Also:Amazon executives sat through a brutally uncomfortable 4.5-minute phone call that showed them just how much Jeff Bezos cares about customersAmazon has more than doubled its lobbying dollars since 2014Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos just put your weekend to shame — and it includes a shoutout from The RockSEE ALSO: Jeff Bezos admits that Amazon has 'the weirdest meeting culture you will ever encounter'SEE ALSO: These ex-Facebook and Google engineers are helping companies kick abusive people off popular internet sitesReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceState defends South Dakota pipeline protest legislationAssociated PressSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolIn Ukrainian candidate's hometown, a cry for changeAssociated Press'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceButina Shouldn't Serve Any More Time in Prison, Her Lawyers SayBloombergAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin Rivet

The divorce should have no material impact on the company and its shares, said Tom Forte, an analyst at DA Davidson & Co.According to Refinitiv Eikon data, MacKenzie does not hold any Amazon shares directly, while Bezos has a 16.1 percent stake worth about $130 billion. Forbes magazine now estimates his overall net worth at $137.1 billion.Liat Sadler, a San Francisco matrimonial lawyer, noted that spouses owe a fiduciary duty to one another.“They have duties not to waste or devalue marital resources, and to keep the value of marital property as high as possible,” she said. “I don't think there is an issue of concern for shareholders as to what will happen to Amazon because of the divorce."Sadler said the main options facing the couple regarding Amazon stock were for Jeff Bezos to buy out his wife, or for MacKenzie Bezos to retain shares."If she trusts that he would manage Amazon well, either he should pay her for her share of the stock, or they could enter a more complicated agreement where she keeps stock and he keeps voting rights,” she said.It is unlikely that many details of the divorce will become public, according to New York lawyer Bernard Clair, who represents Judith Giuliani in her divorce from Rudolph Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and current lawyer for U.S. President Donald Trump."These two have been separated for a not insignificant time, and I would assume ... they would have used the time to reach a private, confidential agreement,” Clair said, referring to Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos.Reuters was unable to determine any further financial details of the planned divorce."Jeff remains focused on and engaged in all aspects of Amazon," said Drew Herdener, vice president of communications for the company. He declined to comment on how the divorce might affect the ownership stake.MacKenzie Bezos met her husband when interviewing for a job at a New York hedge fund, according to a 2013 profile in Vogue.The two were engaged after three months of dating and married three months after that, according to the magazine. They have four children.Speaking at an event in Berlin last April, Jeff Bezos said his wife's support was instrumental when he founded Amazon."When you have loving and supportive people in your life, like MacKenzie, my parents, my grandfather, my grandmother, you end up being able to take risks," he said.Jeff Bezos in September committed $2 billion through the Bezos Day One Fund to helping homeless families and starting pre-schools for low-income communities. He had solicited ideas on Twitter in 2017 for ways to donate some of his wealth.Last January, the couple donated $33 million to fund college scholarships for U.S. high schoolers with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status, an Obama-era program protecting young immigrants brought to the United States illegally by their parents.In 2012, they donated $2.5 million to a Washington state campaign to legalize same-sex nuptials there.From modest beginnings, Amazon branched out into almost every product category, taking on established retailers such as Walmart Inc (WMT.N).In November, Amazon picked America's financial and political capitals for massive new offices, branching out from its home base in Seattle with plans to create more than 25,000 jobs in New York City and a Virginia suburb of Washington, D.C.Jeff Bezos also founded space company Blue Origin in 2000, and is funneling more than $1 billion a year of his own fortune into pulling it out of start-up mode and into production.He also owns the Washington Post, which has been a frequent target of criticism from Trump.(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel and Jeffrey Dastin, additional reporting by Subrat Patnaik in Bengaluru; Writing by Meredith Mazzilli; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Susan Thomas)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

She moved to New York City and interviewed at the investment management firm D.E. Shaw where Jeff was the first person who interviewed her.The two were engaged within three months after their first date, and married within six, according to Vogue.Shortly after they married, the two quit their jobs and moved to Seattle to found Amazon, and lived in a one-bedroom rental there before the business took off.Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie BezosMoreJeff and MacKenzie announced the news in a statement on the billionaire’s Twitter account on Wednesday, writing that they had decided to continue their “shared lives as friends.”“We feel incredibly lucky to have found each other and deeply grateful for every one of the years we have been married to each other. If we had known we would separate after 25 years, we would do it all again,” they added in the statement.The pair have four children together — three sons and a daughter. pic.twitter.com/Gb10BDb0x0 — Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos)  January 9, 2019 Shortly after news of his divorce was made public, multiple sources confirmed to PEOPLE that Bezos is currently seeing news anchor Lauren Sanchez.PEOPLE confirmed Sanchez, 49, is also divorcing her husband Patrick Whitesell after 13 years of marriage.

Other cities may get major sites from the company, the newspaper said.Associated Press reported similar details Tuesday, also citing an unnamed individual.Bloomberg News reported last week that the company is close to agreements that would split the new headquarters between the Crystal City area of Arlington, in Northern Virginia and Long Island City, in the New York borough of Queens.A decision would end a yearlong search by the e-commerce giant for supplementary headquarters to its existing base in Seattle. Cities across the U.S. have spent months jockeying for a $5 billion investment that promises 50,000 high-paying jobs.Since Amazon pared the list to 20 cities in January, speculation has been rampant, with lists handicapping supposed front-runners. Amazon had a broad list of criteria, including a population of 1 million, proximity to a major airport and a strong university system, without clearly identifying which factors were most important.(Updates with AP detail in 3rd paragraph.)To contact the reporter on this story: Spencer Soper in Seattle at ssoper@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Robert Fenner at rfenner@bloomberg.net, Peter ElstromFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2018 Bloomberg L.P.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextButina Shouldn't Serve Any More Time in Prison, Her Lawyers SayBloombergWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolAfter just one day of trading, Zoom Video is the most highly valued tech stock by this metricMarketWatchLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

And now the e-commerce giant has become my personal in-home sentry thanks to its $119 Cloud Cam.A web-connected security camera, Cloud Cam has some stiff competition in Google parent company Alphabet’s (GOOG, GOOGL) own $199 Nest Cam Indoor. But with a significant price advantage and a solid set of features, the Cloud Cam makes a compelling case to hire Amazon as your own watchdog.The setupSetting up the Cloud Cam is incredibly easy. Simply position the camera facing an area you want to monitor, likely near a door or windows, and plug it in. Amazon includes mounting screws and drywall anchors if you prefer to screw the camera into your wall. Once the camera is set up, download the Cloud Cam app for your iPhone or Android device, log in with your Amazon account and you’re set. The app will ask you to select the Wi-Fi network you’d like to connect the camera to and what you’d like to name it to differentiate multiple cameras from each other.And that’s essentially it. I was genuinely surprised with how smooth the entire setup process went.Spying … on my catsThe minute I setup the Cloud Cam, I knew I was going to use it to see what my cats do all day when I’m not home. Spoiler alert: They sleep. A lot. The Cloud Cam’s interface is incredibly straightforward. You’ve got one large box that shows you a live feed from your camera. In the bottom right corner of that box is a microphone that lets you speak with whomever, or whatever, is in your home. The Cloud Cam is an easy way to spy on your pets from the office.MoreBelow the video box is a list of the various clips the Cam’s motion detector has recorded. See, unlike the Nest Cam Indoor, which captures images when motion is detected, Amazon’s Cloud Cam captures short video clips.You can replay up to 24 hours worth of those clips with Amazon’s free Cloud Cam account. If you want to save more, you’ll have to sign up for a subscription.Beyond that, Amazon lets you adjust a number of settings in the app including whether the camera is on or off, its name and how often you want to receive motion notification updates.You can enable location tracking in the Cloud Cam app to automatically determine when your phone and the camera are at the same location and switch the camera off.Sign up for one of Amazon’s monthly plans and you’ll also be able to get notifications for whether movement is from a person or your pet and set up zones that you want to exclude from the motion detector’s sensors for things like ceiling fans. As with other such cameras, the Cloud Cam has night vision capabilities, so you can see what’s happening in your home even if it’s dark.That person is not a personNone of this is unique to Amazon’s offering. The Nest Cam Indoor has the same features with a slightly wider field of view and sound detection, so if the camera hears a loud noise you’ll receive an alert. Amazon’s Cloud Cam can’t do that.What it can do, however, is learn over time using Amazon’s own Amazon Web Services. And that’s good, because while the Cloud Cam detected movement in my apartment, it couldn’t seem to differentiate between when my cats were wandering around and if someone was actually in my home.The Cloud Cam can determine if movement in your home is caused by a person or pet.MoreStory continuesOver the course of a day, I received a handful of notifications that said a person was detected when it was just my cat walking across my coffee table. The vast majority of the time the Cam knew the movement wasn’t a person, but those false positives were still there.Amazon, however, says that as the Cam is used, the software will become better at understanding the difference between pets and people.The Cloud Cam also works with your Fire TV and Echo Show, so if you tell Alexa to show you the living room camera, you’ll instantly get a live feed of what’s happening.The plansOf course, to get the most out of your Cloud Cam, you’ll need to sign up for a subscription. Free subscriptions give you the ability to save up to the last 24 hours worth of clips, connect 3 cameras and get general motion notifications. For $6.99 per month or $69.99 a year, you can save up to the last 7 days of clips, get notifications, get person detection, set up exclusion zones and download and share an unlimited number of clips.Jump up to the Extended plan and you can save 14 days of clips and connect up to 5 cameras for $9.99 a month or $99.99 a year. The top-tier Pro plan costs $19.99 a month or $199 a year and lets you save the last 30 days of clips and connect 10 cameras.You’ll need to sign up for a Cloud Cam account to get the most out of the device.MoreNest’s subscription service, Nest Aware, also lets you get alerts based on whether motion detected is from a person or pet, as well as set up specific Activity Zones that will activate specific motion alerts for more important areas like your child’s crib.Nest Aware also lets you save as much as 30 days of video and clip out specific events that seem important.A basic plan, though, costs $10 per month or $100 a year to get 10-days of video history, while an Extended plan gets you 30-days of video history or $30 a month or $300 a year.Amazon’s way into your homeAs with anything Amazon does, though, the Cloud Cam’s raison d’etre comes back to getting you to shop more. See, you can upgrade your Cloud Cam to also work with Amazon’s Key program. Amazon Key lets you give a delivery person access to your door lock using a one-time code so they can drop your packages inside and then close the door behind them.When you sign up for Amazon Key, the company provides you with a lock and a Cloud Cam Key Edition. But if you already own a Cloud Cam, you can purchase a cable that connects to the Key smartlock and begin using the service. The Cloud Cam is an integral part of Amazon Key, as it allows homeowners to see that the delivery person dropping off their package isn’t also making off with the fine china. Should you get it?Amazon’s Cloud Cam is a simple, easy to set up and use security camera that opens your home up to the company’s future plans. Its motion detection is excellent, and the ability to save individual clips and share them is fantastic. But it’s the Cam’s $119 price tag and subscription plans that make it worth the investment.If you’re looking for a security cam and already love Amazon, the Cloud Cam is a no-brainer.More from Dan:Microsoft Xbox One X review: A beast of a console at a steep price‘Super Mario Odyssey’ review: Nintendo tips its cap to the pastSamsung North America CEO believes we’ll soon talk to all of our appliancesAmazon’s all-new Echo is a more attractive smart assistantWhy Microsoft is playing nice with iPhones and AndroidEmail Daniel at dhowley@yahoo-inc.com; follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextLockheed Martin joins the discussion about cloud computing services in spaceGeekWireZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolTesla's board is about to get a lot smallerTechCrunchBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo Finance3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceInvesting in General Electric Is All About These 3 Key ThingsMotley FoolNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceCardinal Timothy Dolan on the Catholic ChurchWSJ

The vast majority of the time the Cam knew the movement wasn’t a person, but those false positives were still there.Amazon, however, says that as the Cam is used, the software will become better at understanding the difference between pets and people.The Cloud Cam also works with your Fire TV and Echo Show, so if you tell Alexa to show you the living room camera, you’ll instantly get a live feed of what’s happening.The plansOf course, to get the most out of your Cloud Cam, you’ll need to sign up for a subscription. Free subscriptions give you the ability to save up to the last 24 hours worth of clips, connect 3 cameras and get general motion notifications. For $6.99 per month or $69.99 a year, you can save up to the last 7 days of clips, get notifications, get person detection, set up exclusion zones and download and share an unlimited number of clips.Jump up to the Extended plan and you can save 14 days of clips and connect up to 5 cameras for $9.99 a month or $99.99 a year. The top-tier Pro plan costs $19.99 a month or $199 a year and lets you save the last 30 days of clips and connect 10 cameras.You’ll need to sign up for a Cloud Cam account to get the most out of the device.MoreNest’s subscription service, Nest Aware, also lets you get alerts based on whether motion detected is from a person or pet, as well as set up specific Activity Zones that will activate specific motion alerts for more important areas like your child’s crib.Nest Aware also lets you save as much as 30 days of video and clip out specific events that seem important.A basic plan, though, costs $10 per month or $100 a year to get 10-days of video history, while an Extended plan gets you 30-days of video history or $30 a month or $300 a year.Amazon’s way into your homeAs with anything Amazon does, though, the Cloud Cam’s raison d’etre comes back to getting you to shop more. See, you can upgrade your Cloud Cam to also work with Amazon’s Key program. Amazon Key lets you give a delivery person access to your door lock using a one-time code so they can drop your packages inside and then close the door behind them.When you sign up for Amazon Key, the company provides you with a lock and a Cloud Cam Key Edition. But if you already own a Cloud Cam, you can purchase a cable that connects to the Key smartlock and begin using the service. The Cloud Cam is an integral part of Amazon Key, as it allows homeowners to see that the delivery person dropping off their package isn’t also making off with the fine china. Should you get it?Amazon’s Cloud Cam is a simple, easy to set up and use security camera that opens your home up to the company’s future plans. Its motion detection is excellent, and the ability to save individual clips and share them is fantastic. But it’s the Cam’s $119 price tag and subscription plans that make it worth the investment.If you’re looking for a security cam and already love Amazon, the Cloud Cam is a no-brainer.More from Dan:Microsoft Xbox One X review: A beast of a console at a steep price‘Super Mario Odyssey’ review: Nintendo tips its cap to the pastSamsung North America CEO believes we’ll soon talk to all of our appliancesAmazon’s all-new Echo is a more attractive smart assistantWhy Microsoft is playing nice with iPhones and AndroidEmail Daniel at dhowley@yahoo-inc.com; follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextLockheed Martin joins the discussion about cloud computing services in spaceGeekWireZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolTesla's board is about to get a lot smallerTechCrunchBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo Finance3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceInvesting in General Electric Is All About These 3 Key ThingsMotley FoolNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceCardinal Timothy Dolan on the Catholic ChurchWSJ

Is Relying on This Vulnerable SegmentJames BrumleyInvestorPlaceJanuary 11, 2018ReblogShareTweetShareEarlier this week, Piper Jaffrey once again touted Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) as a top pick, explaining it’s only scratched the surface of the amount of money it could extract from consumers. Analyst Michael Olson even went as far as to raise his price target on Amazon stock from $1,200 to $1,400. That’s 11% above the stock’s present price.It’s an exciting, even familiar, refrain to shareholders of a company that can seemingly do no wrong. And truth be told, Amazon has largely earned its stature among investors with its top-line growth, even if bottom-line growth hasn’t matched it.At some point, though, the analyst community is going to have to start accepting and discussing the reality that the bigger Amazon’s e-commerce business gets, the less profitable it is. Indeed, were it not for Amazon Web Services — the Amazon’s cloud-computing arm — the company would be alarmingly in the red. And even that may not be enough in the near future.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  7 ETFs That Will Beat the Market in 2018  Piper Jaffrey’s Olson upped his target on Amazon stock mostly in response to the firm’s review of data regarding consumer spending during the all-important holiday-shopping spending period late last year. In short, as big as Amazon has become, it still only captured about 4% of the money spent on gift-giving late last year. Olson opines the company is “still in the early innings of its share-gain potential,” which could be taken from rivals like Wal-Mart Stores Inc (NYSE:WMT) or Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT).It all sounds very compelling — and believable — on the surface. Amazon.com has become a juggernaut few competitors dare stand up to. And it’s still growing the top line at a double-digit pace.The funny thing is, the bigger Amazon’s e-commerce machine gets, the less profitable it becomes. More of the same top-line growth is likely to mean more of the same shrinking bottom line, putting all the pressure of cash flow on Amazon Web Services.Dynamics of Amazon StockThe graphic below tells the tale, strikingly. The company’s North American e-commerce arm is barely profitable, and decreasingly so. Its international e-commerce effort has been and continues to bleed money. The only meaningful profits being produced right now are coming from Amazon Web Services. Click to EnlargeHere’s the same data, presented as margins, or as a percentage of revenue. Click to EnlargeIt’s not the end of the world in and of itself. Lots of companies manage different divisions of various profitability levels. If it works for owners of Amazon stock, then it works.It’s a dynamic that should be questioned though, as it may not be able to work forever.There are two overarching liabilities packed into Amazon’s profit mix. One of them is the one Tom Taulli explored last year, pointing out that competition from names like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) is heating up now that Amazon has proven cloud computing and cloud storage is a viable market. The more players who are in the race, the thinner margins become as a price war ensues.The other vulnerability of such a lopsided mix of earnings? It’s not even clear how profitable AWS actually is.Amazon’s Cash Flow Isn’t ReallyIt’s a bit complicated, but here’s the simple explanation: Amazon’s touted cash flow isn’t actually its cash flow. The company expenses short-lived hardware used by Amazon Web Services as a capital lease obligation. As such, the cost of that equipment isn’t deducted from cash flow, though given the short lifespan of a server, it arguably should be treated like a traditional, recurring expense. Amazon isn’t bucking GAAP rules, to be clear, but the approach does obscure the true, effective cost of keeping AWS up and running.Story continuesEither way, the heavy cost of running AWS in an increasingly commoditized environment is creating some major liabilities. A closer look at last quarter’s SEC filing shows $116 billion worth of debt and capitalized lease obligations. That’s up from just a little less than $40 billion in debt and capitalized lease obligations Amazon was sitting on a year earlier.Those are bills that are going to have to be paid sometime by a company that could be limping along more than it seems on the surface.Bottom Line for Amazon StockA pronouncement of death for Amazon stock? Hardly. If nothing else, CEO Jeff Bezos has proven he’s always got another trick up his sleeve to drive growth.  4 Bitcoin Alternatives That You Need for 2018  Still, these are the basis of questions that die-hard shareholders of AMZN should be asking. The company is making a massive, expensive bet on a cloud market that’s not guaranteed to be dominated by Amazon. If it’s not actually as profitable as it seems like it is, there’s no real backup plan or scenario that gets the company anywhere near its projected profit expectations.As of this writing, James Brumley did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Rather, it might take as long as 7.5 years to get there, which would still result in an annualized return of 33% for Jeff Bezos and company.“In my estimation, if it took 7.5 years to get to $1,000 from $100, I see AMZN stock getting to $10,000 somewhere between January 2023 and January 2025.“InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn September, the markets went into full-on bear mode, knocking the S&P 500 for a 14% loss, making it the worst quarter for the index since 2008, and in the process, putting it into negative territory (-7%) in 2018. Talk about a reversal of fortune.How did AMZN stock fare in the fourth quarter? It lost 25% to close well down from its 52-week high of $2,050.50. No matter. Early in 2019, Amazon’s managed to regain some of those losses — it’s up 7.8% year-to-date through the Jan. 9 close.  10 F-Rated Stocks That Could Break Your Portfolio  Like a young child taking learning to walk, step by step, Amazon will get back on the path to $10,000. In fact, it needs only a couple of its big initiatives to be successful to reach the lofty goal sooner rather than later.Here are two of them:Amazon’s Push Into AdvertisingWhen investors name-drop companies in online advertising, two names come to mind: Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google, part of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG).Facebook and Google account for 58% of the U.S. online advertising market. Together, the two firms generated approximately $61 billion in ad revenue in 2018. Way down in third place with 7% market share of U.S. digital ad spending is Amazon — but it’s coming on like a house on fire. Forecasts suggest that Amazon ad revenues could hit $38 billion annually by 2023.While Amazon has little chance of catching the duopoly that is Facebook and Google, it stands a good chance of becoming a strong third wheel.“My understanding from speaking with people in the industry is that Amazon’s retail, subscription-based and advertising revenues are fairly fluid,” said Pivotal Research senior analyst Brian Wieser. “Amazon will optimize revenue streams and profitability based on what it sees from consumers.”So while Facebook and Google are heavily dependent on advertising, Amazon has stuff like Amazon Web Services (AWS) — $5.1 billion in operating income in the first nine months of its latest fiscal year — that are highly profitable to lean on while building some of its other businesses such as advertising.Jeff Bezos has become a master allocator of capital, stoking the fires that need stoking, and in the process, making Amazon extremely nimble and able to act on its best ideas.Amazon GoThe cashier-less convenience store concept Amazon began rolling out in 2018 is going to revolutionize the industry. Amazon, which expects to open 3,000 stores by the end of 2021, could generate as much as $4.5 billion in annual sales from these stores in three years’ time. According to RBC Capital Markets, the average Amazon Go store does $1.5 million in annual sales.Not bad for a store concept that doesn’t need any front-of-store personnel.“Amazon Go stores could be a game changer for physical retail experience. Its in-store technology enables shoppers to have a very efficient and pleasant shopping experience,” RBC analyst Mark Mahaney wrote in a note to clients. “While not a significant financial contributor yet, we believe the overall opportunity is huge.”Darn straight.The convenience store industry hasn’t changed in 25 years. Those aren’t my words — they’re Alimentation Couche-Tard (OTCMKTS:ANCUF) CEO Brian Hannasch’s.“The experience of buying fuel and of buying items in our stores has largely been unchanged since card readers were introduced 25 years ago,” Hannasch said in a November story in ConvenienceStore News. The convenience store business might not be as sexy as Whole Foods, but it’s got the potential to engage Amazon Prime customers wherever they live.The stores themselves might generate $4 billion in sales, but it’s the free advertising Amazon gets to attract more Prime members that’s the real key to Amazon Go’s ultimate success.Story continuesEverything Amazon does revolves around Prime. The Bottom Line on AMZN StockNothing Amazon does surprises me anymore. It’s got a great business model and is using technology to innovate old-school industries like grocery, convenience stores, healthcare — the list goes on. I could actually see Amazon stock hit $10,000 within five years, two-and-half years sooner than I suggested last January. However, it’s got to nail at least one of these initiatives to have a chance.As of this writing, Will Ashworth did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace  2 Toxic Pot Stocks You Should Avoid    10 F-Rated Stocks That Could Break Your Portfolio    5 Fintech Stocks to Buy As This Mega Trend Gains Steam    10 Cold Weather Stocks to Heat Up Your Returns   Compare Brokers The post Amazon Stock Will Hit $10,000 Sooner Than You Think appeared first on InvestorPlace.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

AFTVNews has discovered a page on Amazon's website where you can sign up to receive more info about a certain "Fire TV Cube." While the page is pretty much empty other than the words "What is Fire TV Cube?" and the promise of more details coming soon, it could be all about the box-like device the same publication leaked last year. Back in September, AFTVNews published the photo you can see above. It said the boxy contraption on the right is some sort of a Fire TV-Echo Dot hybrid with hands-free Alexa support.To be able to control current Fire TV devices with Amazon's voice assistant, you need to use its accompanying voice remote or a separate Echo speaker. You apparently don't need either with the cube-like device, and since it has a built-in speaker, you'd even hear Alexa's responses even if the TV isn't switched on. The device will reportedly be able to handle 4K HDR video, as well.Of course, we can't say with 100 percent certainty whether that's truly what the "Fire TV Cube" is. As AFTVNews noted, it's also unclear whether "Fire TV Cube" is an official name or something Amazon decided to use for now, since that's what fans call the device in the leaked image. Your best bet is to sign up to receive more info and hope that the e-commerce giant sends out one with all the juicy details in the near future.(AOL)MoreUpdate: A reader sent us scans of the manual that came with his Amazon Ethernet adapter, and one of the pages showed an illustration of the Fire TV Cube. The ports on the device's back are marked as "Infrared" "HDMI" and "Power," while the micro-USB port is marked "Network," which likely means it can't power the device through the TV -- you'll have to plug it into an outlet. Between the sign-up portal and this page in the manual, we might be seeing the Fire TV Cube very, very soon.

Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos said his company "will continue to support" the U.S. Defense Department, drawing a contrast with cloud-services rival Google, which has said it won’t seek some military contracts following protests from its employees.Amazon Web Services is widely seen as the favorite to win a Pentagon cloud-computing contract worth as much as $10 billion. Alphabet Inc.’s Google last week said it would no longer compete for that work, which involves transitioning massive amounts of Defense Department data to a commercially operated cloud system. Other companies vying for the accord are IBM, Oracle Corp. and Microsoft Corp."If U.S. tech companies turn their backs on the Department of Defense, this country is in trouble," Bezos said Monday at the Wired 25 Summit in San Francisco, where he was a surprise speaker. "This is a great country and it does need to be defended."Google’s announcement that it was dropping out of the running for the winner-take-all deal came months after the company decided not to renew its contract with a Pentagon artificial intelligence program, after extensive employee protests about the internet giant working with the military. Google then released a set of principles designed to evaluate what kind of artificial intelligence projects it would pursue.--With assistance from Sarah Frier.To contact the reporter on this story: Spencer Soper in Seattle at ssoper@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Jillian Ward at jward56@bloomberg.net, Molly SchuetzFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2018 Bloomberg L.P.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextButina Shouldn't Serve Any More Time in Prison, Her Lawyers SayBloombergWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolDocuments confirm what Microsoft is building in GoodyearAmerican City Business JournalsWhat to Expect When Alphabet Reports Later This MonthMotley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolTesla earnings: The big question is how big is the quarterly lossMarketWatch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo Finance5 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy in 2019Motley FoolAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceHere's What Hedge Funds Think About NIO Inc.

The chance for a small manufacturing business to reach 4.5 million viewers for free doesn't come around often.Lopreiato appeared on "Buy it and Try It," a segment for hosts to test out popular niche gizmos from infomercials in front of an enthusiastic New York studio audience. The first product they tried was a steel nonstick pan, which smoothly cooked up eggs without the use of oil or butter.Then it was Forearm Forklift's turn. After viewing a commercial for the product, ABC's Lara Spencer and Gio Benitez pulled the heavy-duty moving straps over their forearms and proceeded to lift up a washing machine and walk with it."I was pretty impressed," Spencer said to the crowd.You'd think such a shout-out from the hugely popular morning show would provide a huge boost for Lopreiato's 18-year-old family business.But this is Amazon.com's (NASDAQ: AMZN) world, and Forearm Forklift, like so many brands, is uncomfortably inhabiting it.Once a thriving product for movers and contractors available at a dozen big-box retailers including Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT), Target (NYSE: TGT) and AutoZone (NYSE: AZO), Forearm Forklift has been ravaged over the past half-decade by counterfeiters, mostly selling on Amazon. Scores of merchants have copied the patented product, using its name, images and labels and undercutting the real Forearm Forklift on price.When "Good Morning America" viewers go online to buy a set, which retails between $20 and $25, odds are they'll be purchasing someone else's product."It just keeps funneling business to the knockoffs," said Lopreiato, 48, whose wife Sophia also works at the company and traveled with him to New York. "It's almost like winning the lottery if they choose our item."Forearm Forklift is hanging on by a thread. The company is down to 21 full-time employees from 52 at its peak and recorded less than $500 in profit last year. Annual revenue in 2008 topped $4 million and has since plunged 30 percent. Retailers stopped placing orders because they were finding what appeared to be the same thing online for much cheaper.Lopreiato has diversified his product line, adding a harness for the shoulders, a strap that goes over a single shoulder and straps for carrying boxes. But nothing has come close to replicating the success of his flagship Forearm Forklift.Meanwhile, Lopreiato bears the costs of workers' compensation, product quality control, commercial insurance, mortgage payments and patent management fees all so counterfeiters can act as freeloaders."We're competing with people who are stealing our brand, stealing our pictures and stealing our intellectual property," Lopreiato said in an interview last week from his 20,000-square foot warehouse in Baldwin Park, about 20 miles east of Los Angeles.Amazon's growing dominance in commerce brings with it plenty of collateral damage. The counterfeit problem, in particular, goes largely undiscussed by CEO  Jeff Bezos  and ignored by investors and analysts.The stock has climbed 37 percent over the last 12 months making Amazon the world's fourth-most valuable company, and 89 percent of analysts tracked by FactSet say shareholders should buy more.Heading into the Seattle-based company's third-quarter earnings report Thursday, investor focus is on Amazon Web Services, Prime membership growth and additional investments in supply chain and fulfillment. Analysts at Pacific Crest Securities, in their earnings preview, called Amazon "one of the most disruptive forces in retail and technology today."Conversations with merchants elicit a very different reaction. Since CNBC.com  began reporting  on Amazon's budding counterfeit issue in May, we've spoken with dozens of merchants that have narratives similar to Lopreiato's, but very few are willing to speak on the record out of fear of retribution from Amazon.Lopreiato, an Army veteran and father of two middle-school daughters, said he felt compelled to tell his story."If Jeff Bezos knew exactly what was happening to us, he'd do the right thing," he said. "It's not that he's a bad guy. It's that there is, in my opinion, a lot of pressure put on folks at Amazon to increase sales, increase sales, increase sales. That's wonderful. That's the American way. But do it right."Story continuesAmazon's obsessive focus on pleasing consumers with discounts and service has come at the expense of brands like Forearm Forklift. In trying to provide the lowest-cost option for virtually every product on the planet, the company  opened the doors  to merchants from across the globe with little respect for intellectual property, despite an anti-counterfeiting policy that prohibits the sale of inauthentic items.That's enabled manufacturers largely from China to take advantage of cheaper production and labor costs to compete on the Amazon market.Some big brands have voiced their concerns. Birkenstock  said in July that it's no longer authorizing sales on Amazon starting in 2017. Last week Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) sued a distributor named Mobile Star for selling counterfeit power adapters and charging cables on the site, claiming the products "pose an immediate threat to consumer safety."Amazon has taken steps to crack down of late by forcing new sellers of major brands like Nike (NYSE: NKE), Hasbro (NASDAQ: HAS) and Cuisinart to show invoices proving the items are legitimate and then pay a fee. Third-party sellers are getting  suspended  in droves for activity that Amazon deems suspicious or for complaints from buyers, sparking outrage from merchants who say they're being punished for Amazon's inability to control counterfeiting."Amazon has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeits," a company spokesperson said in an e-mailed statement. "We are working closely with manufacturers and brands to identify offenders, and removing fraudulent items from our catalog. We are also taking action and aggressively pursuing bad actors in this space."The company didn't offer a comment on Forearm Forklift's situation.Until now, Forearm Forklift has been forced to self-police the site and take action to get unauthorized listings removed. See an infringer? Send a cease-and-desist letter. Suspicious of a counterfeit? Buy it, and prove to Amazon through a formal complaint that the listing should be taken down.Repeat, repeat, repeat. And pray it works.On the second floor of Forearm Forklift's warehouse, Lopreiato opens a closet filled floor-to-ceiling with cardboard boxes from Amazon purchases. Inside each, supposedly, is a version of his product.There's no subtlety. The packaging includes not only his name and label but images of his family members and co-workers moving washing machines, armoires and exercise equipment. Open a box and find orange straps that are either too thin, too short, have loose stitching or are made of entirely different and weaker material.Lopreiato said he's submitted more than 100 cease-and-desist letters to third-party sellers and takedown notices to Amazon. But go to Amazon today, and infringers are easy to spot. One listing for furniture moving straps contains an image that looks like a couple of seat belts. Among the attached photos is one of Mark's wife moving a mattress.In a July 2015 e-mail to Amazon's patent team, Marty Proops, an Amazon marketplace expert who previously worked with Forearm Forklift on its account, said he and Lopreiato had identified 53 separate sellers offering infringing products over the past year.Buyers who assume they're getting the real thing are dismayed when the product can't possibly help them move a 300-pound refrigerator. Thus, Forearm Forklift has one-star reviews from customers calling it a "cheap knockoff (don't purchase)" and "very obvious counterfeit.""That posts on our offer page on Amazon so a lot of people think we're offering fakes," Lopreiato said.He never expected this to be easy. He developed the original contraption while working as a mover and dealing with clients who didn't want dollies rolling across new wooden floors. Carrying items by hand meant bending down with 200-pound appliances to get through doorways.Lopreiato got started renting a small warehouse in 1998 and had so little money that he lived in the office. He had an evening gig at a law firm doing clerical work and waited tables on weekends.For 12 years, Lopreiato built the business by attending trade shows and networking with distributors and buyers. He forged deals with companies ranging from U-Haul and Home Depot (NYSE: HD) to Ross Stores (NASDAQ: ROST) and Canadian Tire (Toronto Stock Exchange: CTC.A-CA).He was on QVC every two months or so starting in 2003, selling more than 20,000 Forearm Forklifts per live show at the peak. He started selling to Amazon as a vendor that same year, but it was never a big part of his business, representing under 2 percent of revenue in 2008.Lopreiato was fully prepared for competition, knowing that patent protection only goes so far. But he never expected a counterfeiting onslaught.The slide started in 2010. He got a call from an Amazon employee, saying that other sellers were offering his product at a much lower price and he needed to cut his rate to keep the business.Lopreiato investigated and quickly found the rival products were fakes. He told Amazon that he would aggressively defend his intellectual property but that he couldn't compete with those prices and still make money. Amazon was unhappy with that response, and within weeks there were more than 100 knockoffs on the site, Lopreiato said."Since that date, it's just been absolutely downhill," he said.Over the past six years, Lopreiato has seen vendor managers come and go without fixing the problem or notifying him that they're leaving.He forwarded a number of e-mails from the past two years, where he and Proops showed explicit infringement and asked for help. In addition to jeopardizing Forearm Forklift's business, Proops wrote in June 2015, "Sooner or later an Amazon customer is going to be seriously injured by one of these cheap knockoffs!"Responses ranged from terse to deflecting. Amazon told Proops to send complaints to generic e-mail addresses copyright@amazon.com and patents@amazon.com. Other e-mails suggested that the company was looking into the matter, but then the account would move to another representative.In July 2015, an Amazon lawyer told Proops by e-mail that Forearm Forklift should take up infringement matters directly with the third-party sellers. "At this time we consider this matter closed and we will take no further action," he wrote.C.J. Rosenbaum, a lawyer who represents Amazon sellers, said the rapid turnover in vendor managers and inconsistency in how they treat issues is a constant source of frustration."Amazon's responses are very erratic," said Rosenbaum, who recently published the "Amazon Law Library," a book compiling the legal issues surrounding the company and platform. "You can send in one complaint through the system about an IP violation and they take down the listing, and submit the same exact thing again and just fail."For Lopreiato, legal action presents an expensive option with little upside. Individually going after infringers, who he'd first have to track down, would require more time and money than he's got in the bank. He filed one case in 2013 against a domestic company and was awarded a settlement before trial.Taking on Amazon directly has been a nonstarter for the three intellectual property lawyers Lopreiato has contacted.More than anything, he needs Amazon's help. With traditional retailers sinking fast and more retail and wholesale activity shifting to Amazon, Forearm Forklift now counts on the site for about 12 percent of revenue, a number that's growing despite the flood of counterfeits.A tiny number of additional orders rolled in after the "Good Morning America" appearance, even though Lopreiato is certain that far more went to the knockoffs.Similarly, a Facebook page called Impressive Things posted Forearm Forklift's commercial earlier this month, generating 909,000 views and counting. Again, more revenue for the fakes.On Friday morning, Lopreiato received a particularly discouraging call.Aafes, a retailer targeting military communities, had been planning to buy Forearm Forklift for 120 of its stores. The representative handling the deal was calling Lopreiato because an Aafes executive had discovered lookalikes on Amazon for a much lower price.He e-mailed a screenshot showing two different sellers using Forearm Forklift's photos (including the one below) to promote their products, one for $8.09 and the other for $11.24.Lopreiato is all too familiar with this routine. He replied with a lengthy apology and offered assurance that the cheaper products are fakes. He gave his standard "buyer beware" pitch, explaining that the knockoffs are low quality, unsafe and uninsured.He's not at all confident that it will be enough. In a text message on Friday afternoon, Lopreiato wrote, "Another prospect will probably be lost."More From CNBC Top News and AnalysisLatest News VideoPersonal FinanceReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextLockheed Martin joins the discussion about cloud computing services in spaceGeekWireZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBC'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraph57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley Fool3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceInvesting in General Electric Is All About These 3 Key ThingsMotley FoolCardinal Timothy Dolan on the Catholic ChurchWSJ

The agency said that it was not immediately clear which teams would be affected. Its consumer units include its retail and marketplace businesses, and its food delivery service Amazon Restaurants.Amazon has expanded globally at a break-neck pace in recent years. According to Reuters, it created around 130,000 jobs worldwide last year. It’s announced plans to open a second headquarters in the US, which could create an additional 50,000 jobs.In the fourth quarter of its financial year, its full-time and part-time headcount rose by 66 per cent to 566,000. That number also includes the employees of Whole Foods. Amazon agreed to buy the high end grocer in a nearly $14bn deal in summer last year.Reuters reported that new hires were largely going into areas of high growth, like Amazon Web Services and voice-controlled computing, like home assistant Alexa.Earlier in February, chief executive Jeff Bezos said that the company’s 2017 projections for Alexa were “very optimistic” and that the company had “far exceeded them”.“We don’t see positive surprises of this magnitude very often — expect us to double down,” he added at the time.Also earlier this month, Amazon reported its largest ever profit in history of nearly $2bn, particularly helped by luring customers to its Prime fast-shipping club. Prime saw more than 4 million sign-ups in one week alone during the quarter to the end of December, and revenue from subscription fees grew 49 per cent to $3.2bn, Amazon said.In the UK, Amazon has also been on a rampant hiring drive over the past year. Last February, it said that it intends to expand its workforce in Britain by 5,000 shrugging off any uncertainty unleashed by Brexit.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

Amazon determined through planning for 2018 that certain mature areas of its business no longer required as much staff for the results it was seeking, the person said.It was unclear which specific teams inside Amazon were affected. Amazon's consumer organization includes its retail and marketplace businesses, as well as programs like food delivery service Amazon Restaurants.Seattle-based Amazon has been on a hiring tear, creating some 130,000 jobs worldwide in 2017 and announcing plans to open a second headquarters in North America, anticipating up to 50,000 more jobs there. Its full-time and part-time headcount surged 66 percent in the fourth quarter to 566,000 from a year earlier. That figure includes employees at Whole Foods Market, which Amazon acquired in a $13.7 billion deal last year.But many of the corporate jobs are going to areas of soaring profit, like cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services, or areas where Amazon sees potential, like voice-controlled computing."Our 2017 projections for Alexa were very optimistic, and we far exceeded them," said Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s founder and chief executive, in a statement earlier this month. "We don’t see positive surprises of this magnitude very often — expect us to double down."Amazon hopes Alexa will become a regular part of consumers' lives and will spur shopping orders by voice.The company currently has 3,900 jobs open in Seattle, and staff facing job cuts can apply for them. The company has contracts for 1 million square feet or more of new office space in the city to hire still more employees.The Seattle Times earlier reported the job cuts.(Reporting by Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco and Arjun Panchadar in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila and Cynthia Osterman)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

You could go to a store, or order from a catalog via phone, mail or online.In the past few years, Amazon (AMZN), in its position as a global juggernaut of retail, has managed to single-handedly wrench open new windows through which to buy things.So far, two of the most interesting windows have been its Alexa system, which allows ordering by voice, and the Amazon Dash button. Of the two, there’s little love for the Dash button. It doesn’t get Super Bowl ads and is generally relegated to order products “that aren’t necessarily fun to shop for,” as one Amazon spokesperson put it to Yahoo Finance.But the Dash button, which launched in March 2015, may be the best literal representation of the company’s entire genius — it makes it possible to buy something with the push of one button.“The true innovation was allowing someone to buy something with one click,” says Dean Seifert, director, Dash and Dash Replenishment Services at Amazon. “This is a physical representation of that same concept.”Less and less frictionNo one is talking about the Dash button, but people are using it to place orders, in the millions. “A dash button order is placed four times a minute,” said Seifert, who added that many customers have more than one, if they have any. (Dash buttons also exist virtually, on the Amazon website and mobile app.)The stuff that people buy is the exact kind of stuff you’d think they buy, though there’s more than 500 buttons worldwide. Batteries, soap, laundry detergent are all amongst the top items that have a Dash button. But the most-pressed Dash button of all time, unexpectedly, is Smartwater. (Bounty, however, led 2018, according to Seifert.)As mobile has become stronger and stronger — 46% of traffic and 29% of sales were made by mobile devices, according to Adobe Analytics — and Amazon Echos are popping up in more and more homes, it’s likely that this is eating some of the Dash button’s lunch. (“We’re not trying to compete. We just try to make sure the channels work well,” Seifert noted.)The luster of the full-send one-touch physical button ordering system Amazon pioneered might not shine as brightly as it once did with the myriad of new ordering options, but it all appears to be part of Amazon 3D chess.The endgameSeifert is not just the head of Dash, but the head of Dash Replenishment Services, a part of Amazon that’s endgame is even more dominating than that of a one-touch ordering system, an integrated, or even zero-touch system.The virtual version of a Dash button, thanks to the magic of APIs, can easily be linked to the device it works with — if there’s a device. The internet of things, filled with smart fridges and coffee makers may not yet be the standard, but should that be the future, the Dash product and the automatic replenishment is the logical step.In this system, the milk is ordered automatically when the fridge says its low (or it asks you, depending on your preferences), and the washer orders detergent when it’s low, and so on.Amazon isn’t the only one betting on this. Visa (V), for its part — and it’s a big portion of the payments landscape — has been looking at these types of internet of things payments as a part of the future, recently telling CNBC, “you may end up with four, five, six, eight places in your home where you could actually buy from.”Amazon has already been making progress on this with new partners like Samsung and Whirlpool, which could have a Dash function built into their appliances. As a result it could become standard. For many people, however, it would solve a problem that doesn’t exist, and would fail to give consumers a good reason to spend extra money on additional “smart” features.But for Amazon, that’s probably fine. With Dash buttons, Alexa, subscriptions, and more, there are plenty of other ways to make a sale.Ethan Wolff-Mann is a senior writer at Yahoo Finance focusing on consumer issues, tech, and personal finance.

Customers who don’t have an Echo and sign up via SiriusXM’s website for at least six months of new service, or upgrade their current plan, can get a free Echo Dot, which normally sells for $50. SiriusXM subscribers who have an Amazon device can listen to the service by linking their accounts in Amazon’s Alexa app.The deals bring together two leaders in different realms that are rapidly converging. Amazon  amzn  has sold the most smart speakers, trailed by Google  googl  and Apple  aapl  , which are frequently used to listen to audio content, including radio stations and podcasts. A survey released by Adobe last month found that listening to music was the top use for smart speakers, cited by 70% of owners.SiriusXM  siri  has over 33 million subscriber accounts, mainly listening via about 110 million car radios that tap into its satellite broadcast network, though it has struggled to find new growth markets. Shares of SiriusXM, which have gained 17% so far this year, were down about 1% in afternoon trading on Thursday.(This story was updated on October 18 to correct the number of subscribers at SiriusXM.)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceNatural Gas Price Prediction – Prices Tumble as Supplies IncreaseFX EmpireSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolCrude Oil Weekly Price Forecast – Crude oil running into resistanceFX Empire'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadget

Banks.The digital giant has acquired worldwide rights to “Consider Phlebas,” the first novel in the series about a world known as “the Culture.” Dennis Kelly (“Matilda”) is on board to adapt the book for Amazon Studios and Plan B Entertainment.“The story of the Culture is so rich and captivating that for years Hollywood has been trying to bring this utopian society to life on the screen,” said Sharon Tal Yguado, head of scripted series at Amazon Studios. “We are honored that we have been chosen, along with Dennis Kelly and Plan B Entertainment, to make ‘Consider Phlebas’ into a television series we think will be loved by fans for years to come.”Published in 1987, “Consider Phlebas” revolves around a war that erupts between the Culture, a highly advanced and progressive society, and the Idirans, a deeply religious, war-like race intent on dominating the galaxy.“Iain Banks has long been a hero of mine, and his innate warmth, humor and humanism shines through these novels,” said Kelly. “Far from being the dystopian nightmares that we are used to, Banks creates a kind of flawed paradise, a society truly worth fighting for — rather than a warning from the future, his books are a beckoning.”The Banks estate is on board as an executive producer with Plan B and Kelly.“Consider Phlebas” is in keeping with the kind of epic fantasy fare that Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has sought for the entertainment arm of his empire. Amazon Studios is in the midst of an executive transition following the appointment earlier this month of NBC Entertainment president Jennifer Salke as its new leader.Related storiesDan McCarroll, Former President of Warner Bros.

It reported sales of $51 billion in the past few months, which is an increase of 43 percent from this time last year.As revealed last week, Amazon also reported that subscriptions for Amazon Music and Amazon Music Unlimited more than doubled in the past six months. Seeing as streaming music is a big part of the Echo experience, the rise in subscriptions is likely a result of an increase in Echo sales as well. As is typical with the online retail giant, it doesn't usually break down revenue by division. But we do know that of that $51 billion, $32 billion was from product sales, while $19 billion was from the sale of services.Amazon also continues to see its AWS cloud storage solution as a huge asset, especially since it's grown substantially in the past few months. "AWS lets developers do more and be nimbler, and it continues to get even better every day," said CEO Jeff Bezos in a statement.This is a very positive outlook of the company, especially on the heels of Jeff Bezos' mention that Amazon now has over 100 million paid Prime subscribers globally. It's also been busy investing in other areas, like the acquisition of Ring, a kid-friendly Alexa and potentially a cube-shaped update to its Fire TV. It's not afraid of exploring uncharted territory either, such as delivering packages directly to your car.Still, Amazon hasn't always had it easy. It had to fix an exploit where Alexa could listen in and record your private conversations and it's recently faced a barrage of criticism from the President Trump for not paying its share of taxes and for putting local retailers out of business.We'll update this report with any additional insights from the earnings call later this afternoon.This article originally appeared on Engadget.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadgetAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolNewsmaker: Diversity, inclusion will drive — or limit — success, Cerner exec saysAmerican City Business JournalsWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

This past week, Caterpillar shares dropped more than 7% and year-to0date the stock has dropped more than 15%.Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft will also be crucial reports from the tech sector, with the Nasdaq this week lagging the Dow and the S&P 500 as Netflix (NFLX) stock failed to hold on to its post-earnings gains and shares fell 4% to close the week.Earnings out of Amazon on Thursday after the market close will be on the week’s big events in a week full of crucial events for investors.MoreOn the economics side, the highlight will come Friday when investors get their first look at economic growth in the third quarter of this year.Expectations are the economy grew at an annualized pace of 3.4%, down from the 4.2% pace of growth seen in the second quarter but still capturing an acceleration in the economy’s expansion after tax cuts were passed by the Trump administration in late 2017.“Data next week are likely to show GDP growth slowing to 3.3% annualized in the third quarter,” Capital Economics said in a note to clients this week. “That would still be well above the economy’s potential growth rate but, looking under the hood, there are reasons to suspect that a sharper slowdown lies ahead.”No matter what way you cut it up, the week ahead is likely to be very busy. Buckle up.Economics calendarMonday: Chicago Fed national activity index, September (0.25 expected; 0.18 previously)Tuesday: Richmond Fed manufacturing index, October (24 expected; 29 previously)Wednesday: FHFA house price index, August (+0.3% expected; +0.2% previously); Markit Economics flash manufacturing PMI, October (55.4 expected; 55.6 previously); Markit Economics flash services PMI, October (54 expected; 53.5 previously); New home sales, September (-0.6% expected; +3.5% previously)Thursday: Initial jobless claims (213,000 expected; 210,000 previously); Durable goods orders, September (-1.4% expected; +4.4% previously); Pending home sales, September (-2.5% previously)Friday: Third quarter GDP, first estimate (+3.4% annualized pace of growth expected; +4.2% previously); University of Michigan consumer sentiment, October (99 expected; 99 previously)The housing market is sending troubling signals about the economyThe stock market is saying all is not well in the U.S. economy.A quick look at the XHB ETF (XHB) which tracks homebuilder stocks and the chart is not good. On 20 of the last 23 trading sessions through Friday, the XHB has declined. Since the beginning of the year the fund is down 24%. Just last week, homebuilder stocks fell 3.5%.So, what are the homebuilders trying to tell us about the economy?Homebuilder stocks have been getting decimated this year, reflecting broader concerns about the health of the U.S. economy. (Source: Yahoo Finance)MoreIn a note to clients this week, economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch led by Michelle Meyer said that, “while housing is no longer a tailwind, its headwinds are blowing very slowly.”“We are making a number of changes to our housing forecasts which reflect a weaker trajectory of sales, starts and home prices,” the firm said in its note. “The revisions largely reflect the decline in affordability — which is likely to continue to deteriorate with further increases in rates — and a shift toward more negative perceptions regarding housing.” Story continuesA major economic story for some time has been the lack of affordable housing in the economy.In July, Yahoo Finance’s Amanda Fung noted that the housing market had been losing significant momentum with the pace of existing home sales really starting to level off. On Friday, the September data on existing home sales indicated the pace of sales fell 3.4% from August to the lowest level since November 2015.“A decade’s high mortgage rates are preventing consumers from making quick decisions on home purchases,” said Lawrence Yun, chief economist at the National Association of Realtors. “All the while, affordable home listings remain low, continuing to spur underperforming sales activity across the country.”And while the cost of housing is a story that continues to make itself felt, the biggest economic shift this year has been higher interest rates. The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates three times this year. Investors expect the central bank to raise rates once more in December and up to four times in 2019, even as the Fed forecasts a slowdown in economic growth as the benefits from the Trump tax cuts fades. Higher rates are not going away.A major impact of higher rates has been an increase in the 30-year fixed mortgage rate, the mechanism by which many Americans actually experience a change in interest rates. Earlier this month, the 30-year fixed hit 4.9%, the highest since 2011.The 30-year fixed mortgage rate, which is the mechanism by which many Americans feel the impact of higher or lower interest rates, is at a 7-year high, pressuring the housing market. (Source: FRED)MoreSo with rates rising, inventory low, and prices high, it is should come as little surprise that most folks see the housing market as one that favors sellers right now.BAML economists led by the Joe Song wrote in a separate report this week that, “consumers believe the housing market has favored the seller this year. “When we ask consumers if it is a good time or bad time to sell a house, the majority of respondents have consistently reported it is a good time to sell. Unsurprisingly, that hasn’t been great for prospective home buyers.” Perhaps even more discouraging for those looking for a pick-up in home sales — and the spending on things like furniture and home improvements — the gap between current sales prices and what folks think they can afford is very wide.According to BAML, respondents to the firm’s survey of more than 3,800 consumers, respondents think they can afford to a home of $227,000 well below the median sale price of an existing home of $297,000. Millennials are, perhaps not surprisingly, the furthest away on the affordability scale, indicating the ability to afford a $198,000 home against this $297,000 median price.“With home prices continuing to track higher, albeit more gradually, finding affordable housing will be a greater challenge for millennials and for all prospective homebuyers,” BAML said. Prospective homebuyers see the likely price they could afford for a home today well below the median sales price for an existing home right now.

Based on the homeownership rate in the fields Amazon is hiring for, HotPads estimated how many renters the new headquarters would be expected to bring in each yeariii, and how this influx of new renters would affect each metro's supply of available rentals.Among the U.S. metros still vying for Amazon's second headquarters, Raleigh is one of the more affordable rental markets still in the running. The median rent in Raleigh is $1,470, up about 3.4 percent over the past year. Population wise, Raleigh is the smallest metro still under consideration for HQ2 and typically has about 10,800 available rental units on the market each year.If Amazon HQ2 went to Columbus, rental supply would need to increase by 22.1 percent to keep rent growth steady, which equates to building about 2,480 additional rental units a year. Nashville would need to increase its supply of available rental units by 15.2 percent a year, or 2,000 additional rental units. The median rent in Columbus is $1,410 a month, and the median rent in Nashville is $1,505 a month."An influx of new residents will inevitably influence the rental market, particularly in smaller markets like Raleigh and Columbus," said Joshua Clark, economist at HotPads. "Both Raleigh and Columbus have seen remarkable growth in recent years, but if selected, they'll have to undergo the most dramatic building boom to accommodate Amazon HQ2 and keep rent inflation at current levels. However, finding available land has been a recurring issue for both Amazon and housing developers in Seattle – so areas with more buildable space like Raleigh and Columbus may have an advantage when it comes to building for Amazon's future. No matter which city is chosen for HQ2, planning in advance will be critical as developers, city officials and renters adapt to a new normal that includes a strong and ever-growing tech workforce."Among the U.S. metros on Amazon's shortlist, the New York City metro would see the smallest impact on available rental inventory from HQ2. New York City typically has about 213,200 available rentals on the market each year and would need to increase its supply of available rental units by just 1.5 percent a year to keep rent growth steady.HotPads is a Zillow® Group-owned apartment and home search platform for renters in urban areas across the United States.

(NASDAQ:Z and ZG).HotPads is a registered trademark of Zillow, Inc.i For this analysis, HotPads used data from the U.S. Census Bureau to estimate the number of renters that will move to Amazon's second headquarters location, based on the renter rate for the five job categories outlined in Amazon's HQ2 Request for Proposal. HotPads then paired the Census data with its own quarterly rental inventory data on the typical flow of new rental listings – which includes new construction and existing rentals that have been off-market for a year or more – to determine how many available rental units each market will need in a year to accommodate the expected number of new renters. For more information about this methodology, email press@hotpads.com. ii Per Amazon's HQ2 Request for Proposaliii HotPads assumed a constant rate of hiring for all job types over 7.5 years – approximately the amount of time it took for Amazon's Seattle headquarters to reach its current capacity.iv HotPads also analyzed what the impact would be on the Seattle metro area's supply of available rental units if Amazon doubled the number of employees in its current headquarters instead of opening HQ2.CisionMoreView original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/amazon-effect-hq2-would-have-the-greatest-impact-on-rental-inventory-in-raleigh-and-columbus-300711010.htmlReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

Amazon, which acquired robot-maker Kiva Systems for $775 million in 2012, now has 100,000 robots zipping across 75-plus fulfillment centers in the U.S.“In the same time as we’ve deployed 100,000 robots, we’ve actually hired 315,000 people,” Wilke explained during a recent interview with Yahoo Finance, which selected Amazon as the Company of 2017. “We have continued to add humans to robots, and I think that’s going to continue for a long time across the economy.”Amazon Worldwide Consumer CEO Jeff WilkeMoreIn fact, Wilke contended that the concept of technology outright eliminating work is a “myth,” based on the last 100 years of technological change and its effect on the broader economy. Sure, some jobs will be lost, but new kinds of jobs for humans will be created — a theory, at least partly borne out by third-party estimates. According to Forrester Research, 16% of U.S. jobs will be replaced, while the equivalent of 9% new jobs will be created — a net loss of 7% of U.S. jobs by 2025. In the long-term, it’s possible that gap could shrink further. At Amazon’s fulfillment center in Tracy, California — one of more than 75 across the country — some 3,500 people work in tandem with hundreds of robots. After a customer clicks the “Buy” button on Amazon.com, Amazon’s computer algorithms tell one of the robots to pick up the shelf containing that item and bring the shelf to an employee, who picks out the item and sends it on its way to other stations to be packaged and eventually delivered — a highly efficient process Amazon has honed over the years.There are hundreds of robots zipping around Amazon’s fulfillment center in Tracy, California.MoreFor Amazon, offering such streamlined warehouse processes is vital for quickly training workers — it hired 120,000 seasonal workers this holiday season, similar to 2016 — so they can hit the ground running and meet holiday demand. (The Seattle tech giant plans on hiring thousands more employees in 2018, according to jobs site Glassdoor.) Between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday this year, 140 million products were ordered from and fulfilled by third-party sellers via Amazon, Wilke told Yahoo Finance. “What’s happened is, technology changes work,” said Wilke. “It changes the work of humans. “It allows them to do higher-quality work. It allows them to be more efficient. It allows them to be safer. I think that kind of thing is going to continue.” Click here to read more about why Yahoo Finance chose Amazon as its company of 2017 and here to learn more about Amazon’s plans for Alexa.

Danielle asked that the news outlet not use her last name.In an interview with KIRO, Amazon said the issue was “very, very rare.” According to an Amazon spokesperson, the device was triggered to record and send the audio by background noise. Here is the company’s official statement:Echo woke up due to a word in background conversation sounding like “Alexa.” Then, the subsequent conversation was heard as a “send message” request. At which point, Alexa said out loud “To whom?” At which point, the background conversation was interpreted as a name in the customers contact list. Alexa then asked out loud, “[contact name], right?” Alexa then interpreted background conversation as “right”. As unlikely as this string of events is, we are evaluating options to make this case even less likely.Danielle, who immediately unplugged all her Amazon Alexa devices, has requested a refund for her Amazon Alexa devices, reports KIRO.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextThe best lawnmowers to buy right nowThe TelegraphAmazon Music Is Available for Free NowRolling StoneWhat to Watch this weekend: The season premiere of Bosch and Tonya Harding on Worst Cooks in AmericaEntertainment WeeklyGet this $20 Alexa smart speaker instead of a $50 Echo DotBGR NewsZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolNatural Gas Price Prediction – Prices Tumble as Supplies IncreaseFX EmpireSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphCrude Oil Weekly Price Forecast – Crude oil running into resistanceFX Empire'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolA Look At The Fair Value Of Westlake Chemical Corporation (NYSE:WLK)Simply Wall St.What are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo Finance3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceInvesting in General Electric Is All About These 3 Key ThingsMotley FoolRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

Bezos says he and his wife, MacKenzie, have decided to divorce after 25 years of marriage. Bezos, one of the world’s richest men, made the announcement on Twitter Wednesday, Jan. 9, 2019. (Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP, File)MoreSEATTLE (AP) — Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie, are divorcing, ending a 25-year marriage that played a role in the creation of an e-commerce company that made Bezos one of the world's wealthiest people.The decision to divorce comes after a trial separation, according to a statement posted Wednesday on Jeff Bezos' Twitter account. He and his wife both signed the announcement, which ended with a vow to remain "cherished friends.""If we had known we would separate after 25 years, we would do it all again," the couple said.Left unanswered was one of the biggest sticking points in any divorce: How the assets amassed during the marriage will be divided.And there may never have been more money than in this case.Jeff Bezos is ranked at the top of most lists of the world's wealthiest people, and his fortune currently hovers around $137 billion, according to estimates by both Forbes and Bloomberg. Virtually all of that is tied up in the nearly 79 million shares of Amazon stock (currently worth about $130 billion) that Bezos owns, translating into a 16 percent stake in the Seattle company. Bezos, 54, also owns rocket ship maker Blue Origin and The Washington Post, which he bought for $250 million in 2013.Because the pair were married before Amazon was founded, it's likely that MacKenzie Bezos, a 48-year-old novelist, holds a large claim to that fortune, though details hinge on where the couple files for divorce and if they had a prenuptial agreement.King County, where their home is located, confirmed on Twitter Wednesday that the Bezoses had not filed for divorce in court. The couple own a home in a wealthy Seattle suburb within the county. Jeff Bezos also bought a mansion in a swanky Washington D.C. neighborhood last year for $23 million. The Bezoses have four children."The property acquired during the marriage is common property," said Jennifer Payseno, a family lawyer at the firm McKinley Irvin in Seattle. That includes stock ownership, although Amazon has not filed any regulatory documents to suggest Bezos' stake in the company has changed. Amazon didn't respond to inquiries about how the divorce may affect that stake.The Bezoses will almost certainly settle the divorce outside of court, if they haven't already, said Jacqueline Newman, a Manhattan divorce lawyer and managing partner at Berkman Bottger Newman & Rodd."For the most part, they're going to want to keep things private and quiet," she said. "Especially in the case of a public company, they're not going to want information to leak because it could ultimately affect stock prices."Amazon's stock edged up $2.84 Wednesday to close at $1,659.42. That left Amazon with a market value of $811 billion, more than any other publicly traded company in the U.S.The amicable tenor of the Bezoses' divorce announcement makes it highly likely that the couple already has reached an agreement on how to divide their assets, Payseno said.Jeff Bezos' tremendous wealth has magnified the focus on him, although his divorce seems unlikely to enthrall the public like high-profile breakups involving movie stars such as Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Or even those of other billionaires, such as Donald Trump's tabloid-fodder split with his first wife Ivana in the early 1990s, long before he was elected president.But the Bezos divorce seems likely to attract more attention than when Google co-founder Sergey Brin — currently worth $49 billion — divorced his former wife Anne in 2015.Amazon's origins trace back to a road trip that the Bezoses took together not long after they met in New York while working at hedge fund D.E. Shaw. They got married just six months after they began dating, according to Bezos.Not long after that, Jeff Bezos quit his job at Shaw and started an online bookstore. While his wife did the cross-country driving, Bezos wrote a business plan on the way to Seattle — chosen for its abundance of tech talent. By July 1995, Amazon was operating out of a garage, with MacKenzie Bezos lending a hand, according to a review she posted on Amazon in 2013 panning "The Everything Store," a book about Bezos and the company written by Brad Stone."I was there when he wrote the business plan, and I worked with him and many others represented in the converted garage, the basement warehouse closet, the barbecue-scented offices, the Christmas-rush distribution centers, and the door-desk filled conference rooms in the early years of Amazon's history," she recalled.Story continuesAmazon has since evolved from an upstart website selling books to an e-commerce goliath that sells virtually all imaginable merchandise and runs data centers that power many other digital services such as Netflix. It also has become a leader in intelligent voice-activated speakers with its Echo products, which are emerging as command centers for internet-connected homes — and a gateway to buying more stuff from Amazon.___Michael Liedtke reported from San Francisco.

StockVince MartinInvestorPlaceMay 17, 2018ReblogShareTweetShareWhatever one thinks of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock, there’s no question that the company still needs to grow into its valuation. That’s going to require continued revenue growth — and margin expansion. And that in turn makes the company’s Amazon Fresh initiative an interesting glimpse into the future of AMZN stock.That’s because, in many ways, Amazon Fresh is a microcosm of the opportunities — and risks — facing Amazon.com. The grocery home-delivery service needs to beat out competitors like Peapod and Instacart.Amazon no doubt is losing money on its initial efforts, with hopes of creating a profitable business somewhere down the line. And longer term, the core question is whether Amazon at some point can expand its margins — and its profits — before investors get anxious.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsSuccess in Amazon Fresh doesn’t necessarily make AMZN stock a buy. But a failure here might raise some concerns about the rest of the company’s potential in several key areas.What Is Amazon Fresh?Amazon Fresh is the company’s new grocery delivery service. Like Peapod and Instacart, the service allows for next-day and even same-day delivery, albeit for now only in a few major areas. Fresh requires a $14.99 per month fee on top of Amazon Prime membership, and orders under $40 add on a $9.99 delivery fee.  25 Unstoppable Stocks to Buy No Matter What  What’s interesting about the pricing is that, unlike in many other categories, Amazon isn’t necessarily undercutting competition.Peapod, for instance, charges a fee per order, but it’s just $6.95-$9.95 per order, with no membership charges. A consumer would have to use Amazon Fresh at least twice a month for its fees to be lower. The Instacart Express offering has a $149 annual fee, which in turn generates free delivery for all orders over $10.For now, Amazon’s offerings are limited to mostly major metro areas. And while Amazon hasn’t broken out any numbers on the business in terms of sales, it appears to be an exceedingly tiny part of the company’s overall revenue — for now. But for a number of reasons, even this small effort is an interesting test case for Amazon’s broader strategy.Amazon and CompetitionAmazon is behind in the space, which traditionally hasn’t served the company well. The company has had huge success in online retail and in cloud services, both areas where it was a first mover.But in hardware, Amazon’s catch-up efforts failed. It still lags Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in video. It’s behind Spotify Technology SA (NYSE:SPOT) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in music.Fears of an Amazon entrance have cast shadows over stocks in pharmaceuticals, health care and even photo prints. But as I wrote last month, there’s some evidence that Amazon’s bark is much worse than its bite. Traditionally, the company has struggled to dislodge entrenched competition (the recent rebound in shares of W W Grainger Inc (NYSE:GWW) is an interesting example).And given that bulls are expecting 20%+ revenue growth for years to come, it’s going to need to prove that it can win in new areas, not just threaten established operators. If its scale and distribution can’t drive it past two privately held, smaller companies, investors may begin to wonder if Amazon will be able to conquer territory held by larger, more experienced operators.The Margin Question for AMZNJim Cramer made the point last week that “No one is holding Amazon to a profit standard, just a growth standard.” I’ve long argued that Amazon stock can’t be judged just on its sky-high P/E because investors need to understand that the company currently has depressed margins thanks to its myriad investments, including Fresh.But at some point, Amazon is going to have to prove that it can actually start earning money. And Amazon Fresh highlights two ways in which the company can do so.First, Fresh in theory should be a relatively simple expansion of its existing investments. Amazon already has established a huge base of Prime users. It’s acquired Whole Foods Market. It’s built a distribution capability that’s second to none.It should be able to operate Amazon Fresh at a lower cost than anyone else, whether that’s Peapod and Instacart or Kroger Co (NYSE:KR) and Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT).Secondly, the company already is pushing its private-label products on Amazon Fresh. That’s part of a broader strategy which also includes apparel and which should in turn help Amazon margins.Story continuesThe third driver here is that Amazon Fresh fee income should be close to pure profit. So is the recent price increase for Amazon Prime itself. This is a company with 3% operating margins. It only takes a few hundred basis points of improvement to double Amazon’s profits, or more. How Amazon Fresh rolls out could show how easy — or how difficult — that expansion will be.Is AMZN Stock a Buy?I still think Amazon has a clear path to a $1-trillion valuation, as I wrote back in November. But I’ll also admit that the recent run to almost $1,600 has undercut some of my long-held optimism toward AMZN.From here, AMZN looks attractive but perhaps not quite compelling. Should the company post wins in Amazon Fresh and similar initiatives, and those margins start rising, there’s an obvious path for the huge, multiyear run in Amazon.com stock to continue.  Amazon Rolls Out New Whole Foods Discount for Prime Members  But if investor confidence gets weakened at all at these levels, there may be an opportunity to buy Amazon stock at a much cheaper price.More From InvestorPlace  Rising Gas Prices?

The company has had huge success in online retail and in cloud services, both areas where it was a first mover.But in hardware, Amazon’s catch-up efforts failed. It still lags Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in video. It’s behind Spotify Technology SA (NYSE:SPOT) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in music.Fears of an Amazon entrance have cast shadows over stocks in pharmaceuticals, health care and even photo prints. But as I wrote last month, there’s some evidence that Amazon’s bark is much worse than its bite. Traditionally, the company has struggled to dislodge entrenched competition (the recent rebound in shares of W W Grainger Inc (NYSE:GWW) is an interesting example).And given that bulls are expecting 20%+ revenue growth for years to come, it’s going to need to prove that it can win in new areas, not just threaten established operators. If its scale and distribution can’t drive it past two privately held, smaller companies, investors may begin to wonder if Amazon will be able to conquer territory held by larger, more experienced operators.The Margin Question for AMZNJim Cramer made the point last week that “No one is holding Amazon to a profit standard, just a growth standard.” I’ve long argued that Amazon stock can’t be judged just on its sky-high P/E because investors need to understand that the company currently has depressed margins thanks to its myriad investments, including Fresh.But at some point, Amazon is going to have to prove that it can actually start earning money. And Amazon Fresh highlights two ways in which the company can do so.First, Fresh in theory should be a relatively simple expansion of its existing investments. Amazon already has established a huge base of Prime users. It’s acquired Whole Foods Market. It’s built a distribution capability that’s second to none.It should be able to operate Amazon Fresh at a lower cost than anyone else, whether that’s Peapod and Instacart or Kroger Co (NYSE:KR) and Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT).Secondly, the company already is pushing its private-label products on Amazon Fresh. That’s part of a broader strategy which also includes apparel and which should in turn help Amazon margins.Story continuesThe third driver here is that Amazon Fresh fee income should be close to pure profit. So is the recent price increase for Amazon Prime itself. This is a company with 3% operating margins. It only takes a few hundred basis points of improvement to double Amazon’s profits, or more. How Amazon Fresh rolls out could show how easy — or how difficult — that expansion will be.Is AMZN Stock a Buy?I still think Amazon has a clear path to a $1-trillion valuation, as I wrote back in November. But I’ll also admit that the recent run to almost $1,600 has undercut some of my long-held optimism toward AMZN.From here, AMZN looks attractive but perhaps not quite compelling. Should the company post wins in Amazon Fresh and similar initiatives, and those margins start rising, there’s an obvious path for the huge, multiyear run in Amazon.com stock to continue.  Amazon Rolls Out New Whole Foods Discount for Prime Members  But if investor confidence gets weakened at all at these levels, there may be an opportunity to buy Amazon stock at a much cheaper price.More From InvestorPlace  Rising Gas Prices?

We tested two popular online grocery delivery services, Amazon Fresh and Peapod, and compared cost, convenience and service to see who came out on top. Amazon Fresh is currently available in Seattle, California, New York, and Philadelphia. Currently, you must be a Prime member to use Fresh, and there’s an additional monthly membership of $14.99. Peapod has a wider reach—it’s available in 12 states and Washington, DC. There’s no membership fee, though it does have optional membership programs through its PodPass program. You pay a fee and receive free deliveries. Otherwise, delivery costs range from $6.95-$9.95. Orders and deliveryWhen it came to ordering, Amazon has no delivery minimum, compared to Peapod, which had a $60 minimum.  Both offer a 2-hour delivery window, but Peapod had some discounted options depending on the day and time you place your order. We placed our orders the day before at 3 p.m,, and set a delivery window of 9-11 a.m. The Amazon groceries arrived at 9:36 a.m., and we were notified with a text from the driver directly. Peapod experienced delays and didn’t arrive until 11:22 a.m. While we did receive text updates from customer service, we couldn’t reach our driver directly. a We were told the driver couldn’t find our address, so anytime we wanted an update on delivery time, we had to go through customer service, who would call the driver, and then call us back. So this round goes to Amazon for promptness, and more direct communication. When we got our groceries, Amazon gave us coolers, which get picked up with your next order.  The frozen items were packed with dry ice and ice packs in a separate cooler. Peapod puts everything in regular plastic bags, which means no ice packs! Peapod customer service told us the groceries are kept in insulated coolers and packed with dry-ice on their delivery trucks, and our frozen items were still well-frozen on delivery. Still, Amazon takes another win in this round. PriceWhen it came to the price of our groceries, it was a tie for the two grocery giants. Amazon Fresh was cheaper for produce, meat and fish, and dairy items. A 4-pack of avocados on Amazon was $3.49, $2 less than Peapod’s price of $5.49. Their chicken was also a bargain buster, at $4.42 per pound, compared to $7.33 at Peapod. But Peapod inched ahead it when it came to staples, grains, and frozen items. A 25-ounce container of olive oil was $12.99, compared to Amazon’s price of $14.19. Their brand of frozen peas was just $1.09, slightly cheaper than $1.39 at Amazon. That spare change adds up: We spent $74.77 at Peapod and $81 at Amazon Fresh. They both had a $10 delivery fee, though Peapod varies from $6.95-$9.95, depending on the size of the delivery. But Peapod offers coupons through the mail, which often negate the cost of delivery. Peapod snags a last round win, for being more affordable overall, with no monthly fee. So who reigns supreme? If you don’t mind the extra fees or are already a Prime Member, our money’s on Amazon. But if you’re looking at your bottom line, Peapod is the better bargain, and is available in more states.

The internet giant has confirmed a third season of the 1950s comedy/drama before the second season has even premiered -- and that's after ordering two seasons right out of the gate. That kind of trust in a show isn't completely unheard of for Amazon (just ask the creators of Jack Ryan), but it's rare when streaming services frequently order one season and wait until after a show's debut to make another commitment.The decision isn't exactly coming out of left field. Mrs. Maiselwon two Golden Globes in January, and it just picked up a Peabody. There's a very real possibility that the second season (due later in 2018) is in line for more awards, including Emmys. Amazon thrives on the prestige associated with these prizes, especially now that it's focused on producing widely appealing blockbusters. Meld that with the consistent quality of creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and a third season may have been more a question of "when" than "if."Variety, Rachel Brosnahan (Twitter)This article originally appeared on Engadget.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksWalmart Wants to Take On Amazon in Digital AdvertisingMotley FoolWill Amazon (AMZN) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?ZacksZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo Finance1 Big Reason Why Disney Stock Is Just Getting StartedMotley FoolSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance'American Ninja Warrior Junior': Get an exclusive sneak peek at the semi-finals!AOL.comWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergCoachella Weekend 2: What to Watch ForVariety

Image source: MercadoLibre.The Amazon is in Brazil, after all...Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN), the global leader in e-commerce, has been in meetings with a number of manufacturers as it ramps up plans to warehouse and sell a wide array of products in Brazil, according to a report by Reuters. The company wants to sell everything from perfume to consumer electronics in Latin America's largest retail market. Amazon will also be deploying its own call centers and transportation assets in Brazil, according to the report.  Until now, Amazon has proceeded cautiously with its entry into Brazil's online arena due to the complexity and unique attributes of the local market. Amazon first began selling e-books in the country in 2012, gradually introducing physical books later on.

Image source: MercadoLibre.The Amazon is in Brazil, after all...Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN), the global leader in e-commerce, has been in meetings with a number of manufacturers as it ramps up plans to warehouse and sell a wide array of products in Brazil, according to a report by Reuters. The company wants to sell everything from perfume to consumer electronics in Latin America's largest retail market. Amazon will also be deploying its own call centers and transportation assets in Brazil, according to the report.  Until now, Amazon has proceeded cautiously with its entry into Brazil's online arena due to the complexity and unique attributes of the local market.

I think it goes down first," said Mark Newton, technical analyst at Newton Advisors, on CNBC's " Trading Nation " on Wednesday.A decline to $1,650 represents a 17 percent drop from current levels, pushing it into a correction but shy the 20 percent decrease that marks a bear market.Newton says Amazon's moves in recent sessions have raised some technical flags that point to a possible pullback."RSI now, on a monthly basis, is at 89.5, the highest level overbought that it's been since 1999. At that time obviously Amazon had a very difficult time as did most stocks into 2002, 2003," said Newton.Its monthly relative strength index, which measures momentum changes, was last as high as 90 in April 1999. From that peak to its bottom in September 2001, Amazon shares plummeted 95 percent."Even on a weekly basis when you see that RSI gauge over 75 (for example, it's happened about six times just since 2015 alone), five of those six times you were actually down over 10 percent, as much as 20 percent, really in the two to three months that followed," said Newton.Boris Schlossberg , managing director of FX strategy at BK Asset Management, also sees its big swing higher as a warning sign."Amazon, of course, is the ultimate momentum stock at this point," said Schlossberg on "Trading Nation" on Wednesday. "I would not want to chase it at this point. I think it's too dangerous."Schlossberg has a strategy for playing Amazon's surge in anticipation of any market pullback."If I was going to sell it, I would sell it against the other $1 trillion company, Apple. I would do a pairs trade — short Amazon, long Apple," Schlossberg explained. "If we do get any kind of pullback in the market, I think the market is going to run to safety of cash-rich companies and Apple is going to outperform Amazon."Amazon has seen gains more than double Apple in 2018 so far. In the year to date, Amazon has climbed 71 percent, while Apple has increased 32 percent.More From CNBC Advanced Micro just did something it hasn't done since the dot-com bubbleThree incredible stats about Apple as it tracks for its best month since 2012Classic chart pattern points to S&P 3,500ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksWalmart Wants to Take On Amazon in Digital AdvertisingMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

The company said today it plans to adjust wages and bonuses to ensure those workers don’t receive lower wages as a result.Senator Bernie Sanders, critical of large firms paying low wages, praised Amazon’s initial announcement, then questioned the company after reports indicated some workers would have lower annual income.A company spokesperson told Fortune that all hourly employees “will see an increase in their total compensation as a result of this announcement.” Amazon said it has worked “site by site and person by person” to adjust wages.For warehouse workers at lower pay tiers in particular, routine productivity bonuses that the company offered, and which were increased around the holidays, could add hundreds or thousands of dollars a year in income. Amazon cut these bonuses as part of its rise in base pay, but said the higher hourly rate would “more than compensate” for the difference. “Because it’s no longer incentive-based, the compensation will be more immediate and predictable,” a spokesperson said.The company also formerly issued warehouse workers restricted stock units (RSUs), which vest on their employment anniversary, after which point employees own the shares and may retain or sell them. Workers received 1 RSU for each anniversary and an additional one to mark five years with the company. Existing grants that vest in 2019 and 2020 remain in place, and those employees will receive the stock if they remain employees to those anniversaries, while also receiving increased wages.In lieu of stock, Amazon will pay a cash bonus of $1,500 at five years, and $3,000 at each subsequent five-year employment anniversary. An Amazon share is worth nearly $1,755 on Oct. 10. Warehouse workers making below $15 an hour currently will receive raises that amount between $2,000 and $7,000 more a year, depending on location, length of employment, and position.In a particularly apt remark given today’s stock market decline, especially among tech stocks, Amazon said that while employees “have benefited from a bull market and the unusually strong appreciation of Amazon’s stock price in recent years,” it’s not guaranteed to continue. However, Amazon will offer a direct stock purchase plan for employees starting in 2019.The Seattle Times and other outlets interviewing workers by name and anonymously have found that information about the $15-an-hour minimum wage and other wage and bonus changes have been unevenly communicated to workers.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolWalmart Wants to Take On Amazon in Digital AdvertisingMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolNatural Gas Price Prediction – Prices Tumble as Supplies IncreaseFX EmpireSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphCrude Oil Weekly Price Forecast – Crude oil running into resistanceFX EmpireWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

And it was an even shorter one year later that it bailed on its project.“We want to be a large company that’s also an invention machine,” wrote Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in his 2015 letter to shareholders.“We want to combine the extraordinary customer-serving capabilities that are enabled by size with the speed of movement, nimbleness, and risk-acceptance mentality normally associated with entrepreneurial start-ups. Can we do it? I’m optimistic.”Amazon CEO Jeff BezosMoreBloomberg reported that it took “a lot of convincing” for Bezos to be comfortable with the deal, which was far bigger than any acquisition Amazon has made in its history.“Most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70% of the information you wish you had,” Bezos wrote in this year’s letter to Amazon shareholders. Ultimately, then, Bezos took something like his own advice.“If you wait for 90%, in most cases, you’re probably being slow,” Bezos wrote. “Plus, either way, you need to be good at quickly recognizing and correcting bad decisions. If you’re good at course correcting, being wrong may be less costly than you think, whereas being slow is going to be expensive for sure.”In other words, act boldly and decisively. Acquiring a grocery store chain for almost $14 billion is, most would agree, a bold and decisive move.But that it was an acquisition large in size need not mean it is one Amazon will be committed to if it does not further the company’s goal to be “earth’s most customer centric company.”Because while so much of the commentary around the deal has focused on what this deal might mean for consumers, Stratechery’s Ben Thompson argued on Monday that Whole Foods did not get snapped up by Amazon as a selling platform, but as a customer of Amazon’s services.In this sense, then, Amazon’s ability to leverage its logistical expertise to service Whole Foods better will be the marker of the deal’s success, not an increase in same-store sales at Whole Foods locations.And with Amazon’s investor base clearly having been trained to give Bezos and his management team the benefit of the strategic doubt, expect investors to be willing to look past a continuation of discouraging sales trends at Whole Foods.It may still, however, turn out that Amazon, which has tried to make a splash in the fresh food space with its AmazonFresh business, cannot leverage Whole Foods’ resources as an answer to its efforts to break into food. And if this is the case, Amazon will probably be fine with it.—Myles Udland is a writer at Yahoo Finance.

Stocks are at record highs. And some of the biggest names in the market are set to report fourth quarter earnings.In the week ahead, the latest Federal Reserve meeting and the January jobs reports will be economic highlights, after this past week revealed that the economy grew at a slower pace than expected during the final three months of 2017.No change is expected in the Fed’s interest rate policy and there will be no press conference with Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen after the meeting. The central bank should keep its benchmark interest rate target pegged between 1.25%-1.50%.

They don’t like to talk about narratives.”For Shiller, the most likely story right now is that the current run we’re seeing in the stock market is a descendent of the 1928 stock market, which boomed under a pro-business president before the crash of 1929 which ushered in the Great Depression. And whether you’re a stock market bull or bear, no one likes to hear that a repeat of the 1929 crash is right around the corner.But Shiller’s probing for one big story to explain the market comes at a time when it does seems as if there are a few market themes most investors agree on.Robert ShillerMoreFor one, global economic growth is strong and likely to remain strong through the end of the decade, as the IMF laid out this week. Another is that the tax cuts passed by the Trump administration last year were not priced into the market. This second idea is, of course, related to the first — strong growth will continue because taxes are now lower in the world’s largest economy. And the market is only now accepting this relationship.Story continuesBut a third idea gaining traction is that whether it’s wage announcements due to lower taxes, investor optimism on the rise, or participation among retail investors surging, everything happening in markets and the economy right now is late cycle behavior. So everything is good right now, but everyone also knows it won’t last forever.The current enthusiasm about markets and the economy, then, appears less an echo of the 1929 market which saw proclamations of markets having reached a new “permanently high plateau” and more a reflection of an investor class that knows business cycles still exist. Central bank actions after the financial crisis may have changed the length and shape of the current cycle, but ultimately rising employment, rising asset prices, and rising leverage overheat an economy and the excesses are burned off.What ends each economic cycle and what the negative impacts are from a cycle’s end are unique in each downturn. But the story right now might be that for all of the optimism among consumers, politicians, business leaders, and investors, no one thinks there won’t be another downturn.—Myles Udland is a writer at Yahoo Finance.

Indeed, a subwoofer would add much-needed bass to Amazon's Echo range of smart speakers, which critics say have a relatively thin sound compared with speakers like the Alexa-powered Sonos One.Leaked Amazon Sub imageMoreAmazon UK via PocketLintThe listing also notes a new feature that enables two compatible Echo speakers to pair together and deliver true stereo sound. Currently, Amazon's Echo speakers can be paired, but not in stereo — the sound isn't separated into left and right channels, but simply duplicated. Adding stereo functionality could allow Echo speakers to deliver a more dynamic sound and better position Echo devices as primary sound systems rather than only smart speakers.The Smart Plug is a wall-power-outlet adapter designed to give basic Alexa functionality to any device plugged into it. For example, a lamp plugged into the Smart Plug could be controlled with Alexa using your voice at home or the app while you're away, or you could set a schedule to turn it on and off.Leaked Amazon Smart PlugMoreAmazon UK via Pocket-lintThe Smart Plug's price tag seems a bit steep compared with other smart plugs sold on Amazon that also work with Alexa and cost $10 to $30. We might find out during Amazon's event why the Smart Plug is so expensive.Both device listings showed availability on October 11, according to Pocket-lint.We're likely to get the details of these new devices on Thursday — if Amazon plans to announce them during the event.

The new device costs $50 and is available starting today. So, what's different about this year's model?The retailer says that the new Echo Dot is 70% louder than the previous model. Additionally, it sports a new fabric-covered design — a design, it should be noted, that makes it look a lot like Google's Home Mini smart speaker.The Echo Dot miniature smart speaker is Amazon's best-selling Echo product, and Amazon says it's the "best-selling speaker ever." The update to the Echo Dot was unveiled alongside several new devices at an event in Seattle on Thursday.In case you're not familiar, the Echo Dot is one of Amazon's many Alexa-powered devices. You can ask it questions, command it to play music, and even order stuff from Amazon — all of that is powered by Amazon's voice assistant "Alexa." The Echo Dot is Amazon's most popular version of its Echo devices. It's small, inexpensive, and widely available.Echo DotMoreJeff Chiu/APMore than just a louder version of last year's speaker, the updated Echo Dot adds a new mic array to hear commands more clearly. And the louder sound isn't just boosted volume, but louder sound "with lower distortion and enhanced bass reproduction."In so many words, Amazon claims the new Echo Dot is much louder, and the sound it's producing is of a higher quality.Beyond the new look and updated sound, the 2018 Echo Dot is still a Bluetooth speaker, and it still has a line out port so you can use it to control other, more traditional speakers in your home.One other thing that hasn't changed: The price.

Amazon Just Raised the Cost of Prime — But Only for Some MembersYahooSearchNo matching results for ''Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsGive feedback on the new search experienceCancelSign inMailFinanceWatchlistsMy PortfolioScreenersMarketsIndustriesVideosNewsPersonal FinanceTechU.S. Markets closedS&P 5002,905.03+4.58(+0.16%)Dow 3026,559.54+110.00(+0.42%)Nasdaq7,998.06+1.98(+0.02%)Russell 20001,565.75-1.85(-0.12%)Crude Oil64.000.00(0.00%)Gold1,277.90+1.90(+0.15%)Silver14.97+0.01(+0.07%)EUR/USD1.12470.0000(-0.0000%)Amazon Just Raised the Cost of Prime — But Only for Some MembersBrad TuttleMoneyJanuary 19, 2018ReblogShareTweetShareAre you affected?MoreOn Friday, Amazon surprised customers by increasing the price of Amazon Prime for some members.Prime subscribers who pay on a monthly basis will now be charged $12.99, up from $10.99. Monthly Prime Student subscriptions, available to college students, were also subject to a price hike, rising from $5.49 to $6.49 per month.Prices for annual Prime memberships remain unchanged, at $99 per year for regular customers, and $49 per year for students. All Prime members receive free two-day shipping on most Amazon orders, as well as access to unlimited streaming of Amazon video and music content.Obviously, the annual membership is a much better deal for anyone maintaining a Prime subscription over the course of 12 months or more. The total cost of a by-the-month Amazon Prime membership now runs just under $156 for a year, up from around $132.The new price hikes have likely been instituted to nudge monthly Prime members into becoming annual members. Prime members tend to be wealthy, and tend to spend significantly more at Amazon than non-Prime members. But the option of monthly memberships, introduced in 2016, offered customers the possibility of taking advantage of Amazon Prime for only a brief period: People could sign up for a single month—perhaps during the winter holiday shopping season—simply to get free shipping on multiple orders. Amazon could easily be losing money on such Prime customers, assuming they remembered to cancel subscriptions at the end of the month.By jacking up monthly Prime prices, Amazon will at least be extracting more money from these customers—thereby helping the e-retail giant recover some of its shipping costs.Amazon’s monthly Prime price hikes could also help convince some customers that it’s more worthwhile to become annual Prime members. And that’s one of Amazon’s ultimate goals: It wants as many customers to pay for Amazon Prime upfront and in full, and it wants them to be loyal Amazon shoppers year in, year out.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaThe Morning After: The Weather Channel got hackedEngadgetTrailers of the Week: 'Child's Play,' 'Hobbs and Shaw,' 'Big Little Lies 2'Rolling StoneWhere to Stream Movies FreeConsumer ReportsAmazon Music's free ad-supported tier is now available for all Alexa usersBGR NewsZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraph57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCN'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley Fool3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceInvesting in General Electric Is All About These 3 Key ThingsMotley FoolCardinal Timothy Dolan on the Catholic ChurchWSJ

But what happens once the campaign is over? Enter Amazon (AMZN), which launched a new partnership that hopes to keep the momentum going even after a Kickstarter project meets, or exceeds, its funding goal.Ahead of the company’s blowout quarter on Thursday, Amazon announced a collaboration with Kickstarter that now features more than 300 products hatched on the crowdfunding platform. The new collaboration with Kickstarter is part of LaunchPad, a one-year-old program that showcases products from startups. Now, products launched on Kickstarter will be available for purchase on Amazon.com. In addition to being available on a standalone landing page, the 300 products are listed on Amazon.com in their respective categories (e.g. electronics, wireless devices). Those products range from Prynt — a case that turns your phone into a Polaroid camera — to Zivix, a portable smart guitar. The companies don’t need to pay Amazon an extra fee; the financial relationship is just like that between Amazon and any vendor on its site. Amazon offers two selling plans to its vendors — the professional plan costs $39.99 per month plus per-item selling fees (which vary by category) and the individual plan costs sellers $0.99 per item sold plus additional fees. The partnership is intended to be a mutually beneficial, co-marketing experience, says Amazon PR manager Lori Richter. “Kickstarter takes companies up to a certain point,” she told Yahoo Finance. “And Amazon can help them get the product on a retail platform and really execute in a bigger way.”Kickstarter’s communications manager, Justin Kazmark, says the partnership helps startups keep up the success they’ve accrued on Kickstarter. “Now they have a second home by landing on Amazon,” he says. “They are in a place with a huge global reach and the project can continue to be discovered.” One of the concerns with Kickstarter is that you’re betting on a product that hasn’t been created yet. Even if you’re promised a pair of shoes or a keyboard waffle iron by a certain date, a manufacturing or shipping issue may delay when you actually receive the product from a company you’ve invested in.“When you’re pledging to something on Kickstarter, it really is just an idea. You’re taking a chance on somebody. And delays do occur but there is more success than anticipated,” Kazmark says. Amazon requires that the 300 Kickstarter companies ensure that their products will be ready to ship before their product is made available on their Launchpad program, according to Richter. She says Amazon consults with 100 venture capital firms and startup accelerators to get a sense of “the coolest new startups” it would like to feature on its site. It’s a huge win for the startups because without paying additional cost, they get to take advantage of Amazon’s fulfillment center. All the entrepreneur needs to do is handle the manufacturing; Amazon takes over to handle the customer service, shipping and delivery. This initiative is part of Amazon’s larger push to let consumers know it offers a bevy of products that aren’t ones you’d necessarily search for. The company, often referred to as “the everything store” is frequently used by consumers who know exactly what they are looking for, whether it be a TV or baby food.Mike Burtov, the founder of GeoOrbital, a company that makes an electric bike wheel, raised $1.26 million from 1,623 people during its 45-day campaign on Kickstarter. The company met its goal of $75,000 within 58 minutes of being online. This puts GeoOrbital in the top .05% of all crowdfunding platforms in terms of capital raised.He says 70% of the purchases were being shared organically by friends of the company, but he needs to find a retail partner in order to get to the next level — sales. “The virality of Kickstarter is super important in order to get exposure but afterward we thought, ‘What happens next?’” he says. “Amazon could be that next chapter. It’s an excellent thing.”Melody Hahm is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.

REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol/File PhotoMoreBy Daina Beth SolomonMEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) will begin selling food and drinks online in Mexico, including snacks, sweets and wines, it said on Thursday, a move that could intensify its competition with Wal Mart de Mexico (WALMEX.MX) to claim shoppers in a nascent e-commerce market.Online shopping represents a fraction of total retail sales in Mexico but has grown swiftly, putting Amazon and its rivals in a race to ramp up investments in logistics, technology and product offerings.Amazon views food and drink sales as key to growth, eyeing routine purchases to stock pantries as a way to generate other types of sales, but has yet to dominate the category.The new items on its Mexico site, which it launched in 2015, span coffees, teas, liquors, wines and beers, as well as cooking ingredients, non-perishable snacks and sweets."We're committed to offering our clients as many products as we can," Fernando Ramirez, Amazon Mexico's senior product manager, said in a statement.The launch shows Amazon's intent to claim more of Mexicans' wallets, said Gene Munster, research head at Loup Ventures."Non-perishables are the first step to capturing food spending, and likely indicate Amazon's ambitions to increase its offering related to fresh food," he said.In the United States, Amazon moved into online grocery sales through a $13.7 billion purchase of Whole Foods Market last year. It offers two-hour delivery and lets shoppers pick up Amazon products from Whole Foods stores.Walmart (WMT.N), meanwhile, aims to deliver groceries to over 40 percent of U.S. households by year's end.The company plans to accelerate its online grocery business in Mexico as well, Walmart International's Chief Executive Judith McKenna said earlier this year.Soriana (SORIANAB.MX), La Comer (LCMRUBC.MX) and Chedraui (CHDRAUIB.MX) are among Mexican grocers that also offer delivery services, along with online marketplace MercadoLibre (MELI.O).Walmart's Mexico unit, Walmex, is counting on its 2,390 stores to help execute speedy deliveries.Amazon may struggle to match the selection of traditional stores, said Jose Acosta, a former Walmex executive who is now CEO of digital payments application Pagamobil."Brick-and-mortar players have done a very good job of defining a very wide catalogue, and that's not something you develop so fast," he said.Small warehouses stocked with snacks and drinks will be crucial for Amazon to deliver fast, said Alfredo Garcia, business development head at Mexican e-commerce delivery service Skydrop.Convenience is also important."If you have a party ... what a drag if you go to Amazon to buy beer and potato chips, but you have to use another application to buy meat and tomatoes," Garcia said.(Reporting by Daina Beth Solomon; additional reporting by Julia Love in Mexico City, Nandita Bose in New York and Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco; editing by Susan Fenton and Sandra Maler)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextThe Best Places to Retire to AbroadInvestopediaWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

Here's Where the Search StandsGrace DobushFortuneSeptember 7, 2018ReblogShareTweetShareWilly Wonka would be pleased: One year ago today, Jeff Bezos announced Amazon’s search for a second headquarters, triggering a flood of publicity and a frenzy of interest from cities hoping to nab a golden ticket. The 238 HQ2 applicants were narrowed down to 20 finalists back in January.Amazon  amzn  promises to invest more than $5 billion in the city it chooses for its second headquarters and create 50,000 well-paying jobs over the next decade. Its effect on its current hometown of Seattle has been staggering: The company employs more than 40,000 people there and claims each dollar it has invested in Seattle generated an additional $1.40 for the city’s economy.The e-commerce giant has said it will make its final HQ2 decision by the end of this year.So where does the search stand today? As Amazon hovers around a $1 trillion market cap, the list of candidate cities remains at 20 across the U.S. plus Toronto, Canada.Geekwire tried to divine the HQ2 location by analyzing Amazon’s recent job postings. The Washington, D.C., metro area had the most open positions this summer, and three finalist cities are in that region: the District of Columbia itself, Northern Virginia and Montgomery County, Md. Online betting shops also say Northern Virginia is the most likely to win it.A CNBC analysis found that Texas was the most attractive location, with Dallas and Austin among the top 20 finalists. An earlier analysis by ATTOM Data Solutions ranked Raleigh, N.C., and Atlanta at the top of the list. Atlanta was an early favorite, and Wells Fargo Securities predicted Boston would be the frontrunner,CNN reports details about the economic climates of these cities as included in their proposals are attracting other investors as well.Cities often woo corporations that are considering building in their region, but it’s rare to see a company openly audition cities this way. The candidate cities have been falling over themselves to offer the most attractive tax incentive packages, but it’s difficult to tell what will make Bezos pick a city — and there’s no telling how tax cuts might affect the chosen city’s bottom line.While courting Amazon for its second headquarters seems like an obvious win, experts warn of downsides, such as increased traffic and inflated housing prices. “It feels like Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,” Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, told NBC News. “It’s a real prize, but they’re going to need to be very disciplined. It’s a big deal, a big project with lots of moving parts.”ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolNatural Gas Price Prediction – Prices Tumble as Supplies IncreaseFX EmpireSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphCrude Oil Weekly Price Forecast – Crude oil running into resistanceFX EmpireWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolA Look At The Fair Value Of Westlake Chemical Corporation (NYSE:WLK)Simply Wall St.Breaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo Finance3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceInvesting in General Electric Is All About These 3 Key ThingsMotley Fool

"Alexa for Hospitality" lets guests ask Alexa -- via an in-room Amazon Echo -- for help with hotel information, booking guest services, playing music and managing room controls, such as lighting and temperature.We've seen hotels leverage Alexa before -- in 2016 Wynn's Las Vegas hotel installed an Echo in all 4,748 of its rooms, letting guests control environmental conditions with vocal commands. The Marriot partnership takes things further, giving the hotels the option to configure and customize voice-first features based on their specific property and guest offering. You'll be able to use Alexa to book a massage if the hotel has a spa, for example, or ask Alexa where the gym is located, if it has a fitness center. Hotels can also choose to give their guests access to thousands of Alexa skills that can help with other aspects of traveling, such as checking flight times or local public transit systems.Personalization is also on the cards. Alexa for Hospitality will eventually allow guests to temporarily connect their Amazon account to the Echo in their room so they can play their own music from services including Amazon Music and Spotify, or listen to audiobooks via Audible. When they check out, their account will be automatically disconnected from the device.The system has been built to work with existing hotel technology, so locations won't need to retrofit or upgrade anything, but whether or not you'll get to try it out during your summer holidays will depend on where you're heading. It's arriving at Marriott hotels in Charlotte, NC, and Irvine, CA, first, with other hotel locations "by invitation" from today, before rolling out internationally later this season.AmazonThis article originally appeared on Engadget.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextNatural Gas Price Prediction – Prices Tumble as Supplies IncreaseFX EmpireState defends South Dakota pipeline protest legislationAssociated PressCrude Oil Weekly Price Forecast – Crude oil running into resistanceFX Empire1 Big Reason Why Disney Stock Is Just Getting StartedMotley FoolMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolSouthwest CEO says more Hawaii service in part depends on 'when the Max returns'American City Business JournalsSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCIt's Time to Start Saving for This Annual Expense TodayMotley FoolWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraph57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNAll the Best 4/20 Day Deals on Pizza, Pot, Nachos, Lyft Rides, and MoreMoney'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolWoman wears 9 extra pounds of clothing on flight to avoid $85 airline feeAOL.comBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley Fool3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo Finance

Further, it efficiently offesr scalability and availability to customers as well as manages critical MongoDB workloads at scale.The latest move is likely to add strength to AWS’ database services portfolio, which already comprises a wide range of relational as well as non-relational database services.Gaining Momentum in NoSQL Database SpaceNoSQL or non-relational databases are gaining traction among cloud customers as well as application developers.Moreover, these databases are best known for their scalability, ease of development and functionality which are boosting adoption rate in the cloud computing market.Per a report by Market Research Media, NoSQL technology is becoming mainstream in the database space. The report also suggests that the technology holds immense growth potential and is expected to witness a CAGR of 21% between 2019 and 2024 and reach $3.4 billion.AWS with Amazon DocumentDB expands its non-relational database services offerings. This is likely to help the company reap benefits from the potential non-relational database space.Amazon.com, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Amazon.com, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote Competition RifeThe cloud battle continues to become intense with strong initiatives of AWS as well as of other major cloud services providers such as Microsoft’s MSFT, Alphabet’s GOOGL Google Cloud and International Business Machines’ IBM cloud division, to name a few.Microsoft’s Azure DocumentDB is a NoSQL document database service that is fully managed and highly responsive database-as-a-service (DBaaS). The service provides faster processing of JSON data and is easily available.Further, IBM Cloud’s NoSQL database service — Cloudant — offers scalable JSON document database for web, mobile, IoT and serverless applications.Google Cloud Datastore also provides high scalability and features NoSQL database.Nevertheless, AWS is likely to maintain its dominant position in the cloud computing market on the back of its recent move. The compatibility feature of its new service with the existing MongoDB APIs will enable the company attract application developers to its platform.Apart from Amazon DocumentDB, AWS also offers Amazon DynamoDB which is another NoSQL database service.We believe that an expanding portfolio of non-relational database services will continue to strengthen its competitive position against the above mentioned companies.Currently, Amazon sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The e-commerce giant has just announced two new benefits for its subscribers: an additional 10 percent discount off sale items and deep discounts on select best-selling items every week. To take advantage of the discounts, Prime members have to physically go to a Whole Foods location and find the yellow 10 percent off and the blue special deal signs.

Additionally, over the past year, Amazon has created 130,000 jobs, not including its Whole Foods locations. By the end of last year, Amazon employed more than 560,000 globally, up nearly 66% from last year.Shares were up nearly 3% on Monday. Related ArticlesCuomo wants voluntary payroll tax to ease pain of US tax lawFormer pharma exec, Christie backer seeks to oust MenendezSeattle eyes taller, denser in affordable housing proposalReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraph57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCN'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley Fool3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceInvesting in General Electric Is All About These 3 Key ThingsMotley FoolCardinal Timothy Dolan on the Catholic ChurchWSJ

The device is aimed squarely at rival Amazon (AMZN), which released its Echo three years ago.The smart home speaker, as a category, appears to be taking off.Google jumped in with Google Home, released six months ago. Microsoft (MSFT) is getting in with a Harman Kardon speaker called Invoke, which it announced last month. Each of these devices is also a showcase for each company’s voice assistant technology: HomePod is powered by Siri; Echo runs on Alexa; Google Home is powered by Google Assistant (it’s very Google to avoid a cute human name); Invoke will use Microsoft’s voice tech Cortana.But for the time being, Amazon is miles ahead in this race—and not just because it was first out of the gate.“The Amazon Echo portfolio of products is definitely the one to beat right now,” says Adam Wright, research analyst at IDC. “Amazon has leapt ahead of the competition once again with the launch of its latest addition to the portfolio.”He means the Echo Show, coming on June 29, which looks nothing like the rest of the Echos: it’s a standing rectangle with a video touchscreen. It more closely resembles a portable DVD player, if you remember those relics.The Echo Show has not gotten a ton of press attention, but insiders are impressed with its 7-inch color screen and its 5-megapixel camera. Adding a visual experience to the speaker, Wright says, “affords Amazon a lead over Google for now.” Inside Higher Ed predicts the Echo Show will “revolutionize higher education.”Amazon currently controls more than 70% of the voice-enabled speaker business, eMarketer estimates.L-R: Amazon Echo; Google Home; Apple HomePod. (images via Amazon, AP Photo, Apple)MoreGoogle Home does offer an impressive conversational experience. And it could “further this edge,” Wright says, with the expected continued incorporation of Google Assistant with new features (like hands-free phone calls) and with other Google devices, like Lens. But Amazon was first to the space and is iterating so fast with Echo that it’s daunting to compete.And now there’s Apple. Its speaker comes along three years after Amazon’s, six months after Google’s, and is almost three times as expensive ($349) than either of those ($179 and $109, respectively). As Mizuho Securities wrote in a new research note after Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference keynote on Monday, HomePod’s pricing is “at a premium to competing offerings.” That’s an understatement. And HomePod isn’t just competing with those, but also with high-end wireless speakers like Sonos and Jawbone Jambox. “It’s unclear,” Wright says, “whether Apple can compete well in this space.”Indeed, tech media as well as some analysts have criticized Apple for its late entry, accusing the company, once known for its innovations, as being a copycat now. HomePod even looks a lot like Google Home.But this race is in its early days. The market for voice-activated home assistant devices is “still in its infancy,” Wright says. Former Apple analyst Gene Munster, now a partner at Loup Ventures, told Fox Business the same on Monday: “They’re about two years late, but… I would also point out that this market hasn’t even started.”Amazon and Google don’t typically break out sales of their individual devices, but Mizuho estimated that Amazon sold 8.6 million Echos last year, and predicts Echo revenue could balloon to $11 billion by 2020. RBC predicts 60 million units by 2020.If only 10 million units of smart home speakers have sold, that’s small potatoes. Munster pointed out that it takes 500 million units to really consider a category “mainstream.”In other words, Apple has ample time.—Daniel Roberts covers tech at Yahoo Finance.

And now the service is rolling out to an increasing number of users.Credit: ShutterstockThe feature gives you a real-time view of where your packages are and lets you know when you might get your delivery. It also gives you a map view, so you can see where your delivery truck is and how many stops it'll need to make before your package arrives.Credit: ShutterstockMoreThe tool is available in the Amazon mobile app. Simply boot it up and access your orders.

You can keep coming back to the app to see where the package is.MORE: Amazon Prime Day: When It is, Shopping Tips and MoreNow, before you start combing through the app to search for packages, there are some caveats to keep in mind. For one, the feature isn't available on any packages that are being shipped through traditional carriers, like UPS, FedEX, or the U.S. Postal Service. Instead, you'll only be able to track packages that are shipped entirely through Amazon's own logistics chain.And, as noted above, the feature launched last month and has been slowly making its way to people across the U.S. There's still a chance that you won't have access to the tracker yet and, if you're living outside the U.S., you won't have access to it.Amazon shed little light on the rollout schedule and international availability in a statement to CNET, which earlier reported on the feature. Instead, the company said that its Map Tracking feature is "another delivery innovation" that aims at improving "convenience for our customers."Amazon has unveiled a variety of new technologies to improve deliveries, including options to have packages delivered in your home or even your car trunk. And as it tries to build out its logistics network to rely less on traditional carriers, those efforts will only expand.See also :  Is Amazon Prime Worth It?

Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN), the e-commerce and cloud computing giant, is reportedly toying with the idea of selling cheap white-box networking switches to enterprise customers.A gateway to AWSAmazon is already using white-box switches inside its data centers, according to The Information's sources. Other large internet companies have taken that path as well, including Facebook and Alphabet's Google. Google has gone even further, designing its own custom chips for artificial intelligence.Data cables plugged into hardware.MoreImage source: Getty Images.But selling custom hardware to third-parties is a new frontier. Some customers are already reportedly testing Amazon's switches, with a launch planned within the next 18 months. Amazon's strategy will be focused on price, with plans to undercut the switches from Cisco by 70% to 80%.Amazon's switches will be unbranded and run open-source software. They'll have built-in connections to Amazon Web Services (AWS), enabling customers to more easily operate in a hybrid-cloud configuration, where on-premise hardware is mixed with public cloud computing. That could help make the process of moving to the cloud simpler and less painful for large enterprises.Given the reported pricing, Amazon probably won't make much money from selling the hardware itself. Instead, the switches could drive more business to AWS, which is by far the most profitable part of Amazon.Speaking to The Information, a Cisco spokeswoman downplayed the report: "Only Cisco offers an end-to-end intent-based networking portfolio that delivers assurance, industry-leading security, policy-based automation, and segmentation. We look forward to continue leading the industry on innovation and helping our customers simplify and manage their networks."Should Cisco be worried?One thing to remember: Cheap white-box networking hardware is not new. Cheap alternatives to Cisco's pricey hardware are also not new. If price were the only factor, Cisco wouldn't dominate the market for networking switches. But it does, with a market share of 53.4% in the first quarter, according to IDC.Other cloud computing companies have every incentive to work with networking hardware companies to fight back against the threat from Amazon. Cisco and Google are already collaborating, working on developing software that will connect data centers with Cisco hardware to Google's cloud services. Cisco is also a partner for Azure Stack, Microsoft's hybrid cloud solution.Amazon certainly shouldn't be underestimated, but selling enterprise hardware for use in on-premise data centers is a very different business than renting public cloud computing resources. Swapping out hardware from Cisco or other providers isn't trivial -- there are meaningful switching costs. And AWS certainly isn't the only game in town when it comes to hybrid cloud. Whether companies would want to lock themselves into AWS with Amazon's switching hardware is an open question.Amazon may ultimately abandon this effort, instead sticking with using the hardware in its own data centers. Even with low prices, winning market share will be a slog. Cisco has revamped its business model in recent years, moving to a subscription model with its latest Catalyst 9000 line of switches. Those products have proven popular, and the fact that they're bundled with subscription software may make it even more difficult for customers to move away from Cisco. Cisco has increasingly become a seller of networking solutions, and that makes its products and services even stickier.Story continuesCisco has been under attack from cheap commodity hardware for years. The company's dominance has so far held up. Just like Amazon shouldn't be underestimated, neither should Cisco.

As The Verge saw in the state's disclosure records, the three giants contributed a significant amount of money to a campaign pushing back against the initiative: Amazon and Microsoft donated $195,000 each, while Uber pitched in a smaller-but-still-noteworthy donation worth $50,000. Google, AT&T, Facebook and Verizon -- four of the first corporations that backed the fight against the initiative -- all plunked down $200,000. Facebook and Verizon eventually withdrew their support, however, with the former doing so after Mark Zuckerberg was hauled in front of Congress to answer questions about the Cambridge Analytica scandal.The California Consumer Privacy Act aims to give California residents the right to know what kind of data companies have on them and to tell those companies not to sell their personal info. Tech companies believe that it could ruin the way they develop their products and do business. A spokesperson for Amazon told The Verge, for instance: "While we share the initiative's overarching goal of protecting consumer privacy, we are concerned by unworkable requirements that would hinder our ability to innovate on behalf of our customers."Committee to Protect California Jobs spokesperson Steven Maviglio echoed that in a statement to Govtech. He said that bill author Alastair Mactaggart didn't consider the "workability" of his proposal and that it's nigh impossible for tech giants to comply with it. "[A]nyone who orders anything from Amazon can request where their information went, and that can not only overwhelm a large company like Amazon but also smaller ones too," the spokesperson explained. Microsoft also released a statement that pretty much said the same thing: "We believe the California measure could have unintended consequences for both businesses and consumers and that there is a better way to give consumers the privacy rights they deserve."So far, the Californians for Consumer Privacy Act has already collected 637,000 signatures. Authorities have to be able to verify 402,468 signatures for the proposal to make it to the November ballot -- we'll know for sure after the California Secretary of State announces the result on June 25th. Even if it does make its way to the ballot, the opposition now has a lot of money to spend on campaigns to fight its approval. The Committee to Protect California Jobs, for one, plans to make sure citizens know about the potential impact it may have on jobs in the state if companies choose to up and leave for another HQ.The Verge, California Secretary of StateThis article originally appeared on Engadget.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextDocuments confirm what Microsoft is building in GoodyearAmerican City Business JournalsWhat to Expect When Alphabet Reports Later This MonthMotley FoolHemp companies are raising capital at a fast clip and cannabis retailers can expect 4/20 sales spikeMarketWatchZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceState defends South Dakota pipeline protest legislationAssociated PressSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBC'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceIn Ukrainian candidate's hometown, a cry for changeAssociated PressAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadgetMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

Amazon and Microsoft announced a new partnership that will allow better integration between the tech titans' two voice-powered digital assistants.MoreAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) announced a new partnership that will allow better integration between the tech titans' two digital assistants.Amazon's voice-powered digital assistant Alexa will now be able to activate Microsoft's own assistant Cortana, and vice versa. The partnership means  Amazon customers can use Alexa  to access Cortana's exclusive features such as accessing work calendars, while Microsoft customers can use Cortana to ask Alexa to order products from Amazon or control their smart home devices."Ensuring Cortana is available for our customers everywhere and across any device is a key priority for us," said Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, in a press release Wednesday."Bringing Cortana's knowledge, Office 365 integration, commitments, and reminders to Alexa is a great step toward that goal."Amazon's personal assistant Alexa was first announced in November 2014 alongside the Echo, Amazon's smart speaker. Meanwhile, Cortana was announced by Microsoft in May 2015 and released for its Windows Phone product."There are going to be multiple successful intelligent agents, each with access to different sets of data and with different specialized skill areas. Together, their strengths will complement each other and provide customers with a richer and even more helpful experience," Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon, said in a press release."It's great for Echo owners to get easy access to Cortana."More From CNBC A bitcoin rival that has quietly surged nearly 1,400% this yearBurger King has launched its own version of bitcoin in Russia called ‘WhopperCoin’Samsung launches huge 6.3-inch Note 8 smartphone and hopes to price it under $1,000ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextDocuments confirm what Microsoft is building in GoodyearAmerican City Business JournalsCan Microsoft (MSFT) Keep the Earnings Surprise Streak Alive?ZacksConsole gaming is at a crossroadsEngadgetData Sheet—Why We Should Stop Haranguing Our Kids to Put Down Their PhonesFortuneMicrosoft introduces tools to better VR experience for users with low visionAFP Relax NewsZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceTesla's board is about to get a lot smallerTechCrunchAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergApple may bring Siri Shortcuts and Screen Time to macOSEngadget

The company is aiming to give AWS customers an "easy button" to get into the same technology that underpins bitcoin."They can focus on their scenario and they don't have to become PhDs is cryptography, we give them a simple platform to build their company on blockchain," said Steve Cerveny, one of the founders of Kaleido.Blockchain technology records transactions on a public, distributed ledger, which advocates say gets rid of the need for a third party in many cases. The technology is touted as faster and more secure by advocates."Introducing Kaleido to AWS customers is going to help customers move faster and not worryabout managing blockchain themselves," Amazon Web Services said in a statement. It is the first Blockchain SaaS solution available on the AWS Marketplace and will help them rapidly advance their blockchain projects."Amazon Web Services is a subsidiary of Amazon that offers a paid subscription for cloud computing platforms to individuals, companies and governments. AWS is using a partner-led strategy instead of building from the ground up."They've been looking for partners to help get blockchain into their customers hands," Cerveny said. "They're putting it in the marketplace will accelerate what their customers are going to do with it."The founder of the Ethereum blockchain platform, which is what Kaleido and AWS will be using, said this is the biggest move yet by the tech giant to get into blockchain."This is a heavy duty, full stack way of getting the company into blockchain solutions," said Joseph Lubin, founder of Ethereum.Blockchain can help Amazon in other arms of the ever-expanding business he said, using supply chain as one example. Lubin said Consensys, which oversees more than 50 blockchain projects, has seen a major increase in interest around the technology."Three years ago we were getting calls from companies trying to spell blockchain and trying to order one in a color because their boss told them they should get a blockchain," Lubin said. "At this point there are tens of thousands of companies around the world that have real sophistication around this."Amazon joins other tech giants including Microsoft and Facebook exploring use cases for blockchain.Facebook announced last week it is going through a reorganization that will include a new blockchain effort and aims to address privacy concerns. The experimental blockchain group will be led by David Marcus, the executive most recently in charge of Facebook's Messenger group.IBM, Accenture, Deloitte, JP Morgan, and HSBC are among the other corporate names working on blockchain initiatives.WATCH: Amazon is so much more than online shopping — here's how big its becomeMore From CNBC Blockchain company BitPesa wants to transform payments in AfricaIBM joins forces with a start-up to combine crypto with environmental credit tradingCryptocurrency exchange Coinbase is trying to lure big institutional investorsReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBlockchain cross-border transactions space set for unprecedented growthCoin RivetHow CSG plans to take blockchain mainstream for telecom paymentsAmerican City Business JournalsPrivacy Crypto Monero Celebrates Its 5th BirthdayCoindeskJimmy Song discusses Bitcoin, blockchain, and the crypto spaceCoin RivetGibraltar Blockchain Exchange Appoints New CEOBitcoin MagazineZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolTesla's board is about to get a lot smallerTechCrunchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraph57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNQualcomm's joint venture with Chinese province to shut down: The InformationReuters'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolEquity Shot: Pinterest zooms into the public markets (and yet another tech company files for an IPO)TechCrunchBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley Fool3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo Finance

A paid service, however? That's relatively rare... or at least, it has been. Amazon, Netflix and multiple Hollywood studios (including Disney, Fox, Sony, Universal and Warner Bros.) have sued SET Broadcast over allegations its SET TV service is used expressly for piracy. While there is a dedicated set-top box, the centerpiece is a $20 per month subscription service that offers access to over 500 live TV channels and "thousands" of on-demand shows, including Netflix shows and movies that are still officially limited to theaters. As you might guess, the media giants argue SET TV is focused "overwhelmingly, if not exclusively" on pirated material.The companies also accuse SET Broadcast of going so far as to pay for video reviews and other sponsored material to drive subscriptions. The firm hasn't commented on the case so far.The lawsuit could have SET pay dearly. The court would order the service shut down, of course, but it would also impound devices and demand damages up to $150,000 for every piece of pirated work. That could easily amount to millions of dollars even if the penalties were limited to on-demand videos. Between the number of media industry companies involved in the case and the penalties they're asking, it's clear that the lawsuit is intended as a message to anyone that would design a service with piracy in mind -- especially if they have the gall to charge for it.GeekWireThis article originally appeared on Engadget.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolNetflix might have more Beyoncé specials planned after 'Homecoming'EngadgetZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool'American Ninja Warrior Junior': Get an exclusive sneak peek at the semi-finals!AOL.com'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceCoachella Weekend 2: What to Watch ForVarietyAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance Video

Called Alexa Skill Blueprints, the new feature is open to anyone with an Echo device. You can create custom Alexa content like quizzes, jokes, games, and instructions for babysitters or house guests.That way, when you say things like, "Alexa, who's the best-looking member of the family?", it will answer with a custom response. To get started, you'll have to log on to Amazon's Alexa Skill Blueprints website. There, you'll find more than 20 templates to choose from. The templates are pre-filled, but you can also customize the language so Alexa will talk more like you and your family. After you're done, the new skill will be available on all your Amazon devices. Until now, the personalization options on Echo devices has been somewhat limited. You've always been able to tell Alexa what to call you and set up a custom routine, but beyond that, you've never really been able to choose what Alexa will say back to you. This is also the first time users have been able to easily make their own Alexa skill. Thanks to the pre-made templates, you don't need to be a developer to create a skill for your Echo. Plus, the custom skills you create won't go into the Alexa Skills section of the app — they will only appear on the devices registered to your Amazon account. Here are all the customizable skills available at launch:- Custom Q&A- House guest info- Babysitter info- Pet sitter info- Family jokes- Trivia- Inspirational quotes- Family trivia- Bachelorette party trivia- Birthday trivia- Burns- Compliments- Double Trouble game- Categories game- Adventure story- Fairy tale- Sci-fi story- Fable- Flash cards- Facts on a specific topic- QuizNOW WATCH: Facebook can still track you even if you delete your account — here's how to stop itSee Also:Amazon just visited New Jersey — and the state is offering a $7 billion incentive to land HQ2The unlikely way Jeff Bezos became one of the first investors in Google, which probably made him a billionaire outside of AmazonApple is considering a low-cost HomePod, says KGI SecuritiesSEE ALSO: These wireless earbuds look exactly like Apple's AirPods — but they cost a fraction of the price and work with any smartphoneReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolState defends South Dakota pipeline protest legislationAssociated PressSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCIn Ukrainian candidate's hometown, a cry for changeAssociated PressWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraph57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNButina Shouldn't Serve Any More Time in Prison, Her Lawyers SayBloomberg'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatchBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley Fool3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceInvesting in General Electric Is All About These 3 Key ThingsMotley FoolCardinal Timothy Dolan on the Catholic ChurchWSJ

REUTERS/Pascal RossignolMoreBy Noel Randewich and April Joyner(Reuters) - Amazon.com (AMZN.O) became the second most valuable publicly listed U.S. company on Tuesday, surpassing Google parent Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) for the first time.Amazon shares finished up 2.69 percent at $1,586.51, for a market capitalisation of $768 billion, underscoring Wall Street's confidence in its relentless expansion into cloud computing, groceries and other new businesses.Alphabet lost 0.39 percent, trimming its stock market value to $762 billion, as Wall Street fretted about regulatory fallout following revelations that a political consulting firm had improperly obtained personal data on 50 million Facebook Inc (FB.O) users.Together, Alphabet and Facebook dominate online advertising. They have previously faced government criticism for how they employ their user data.Amazon's stock has surged 81 percent over the past year, through Monday, bolstered by scorchingly fast revenue growth as more shopping moves online and businesses shift their computing operations to the cloud, where Amazon Web Services leads the market."They're using their cash flow to develop new businesses," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment strategist at Inverness Counsel in New York. "They could have Apple in their sights at some point."Seattle-based Amazon dislodged Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) as the No. 3 U.S. company by market capitalisation in February. Apple (AAPL.O) is the world's most valuable publicly listed company, with a market capitalisation of $889 billion.Obviously, past stock gains are not a reliable predictor of future performance, and the surge in Amazon shares in recent years has been exceptional by most standards. But if Amazon's stock were to keep growing on the trajectory seen over the past year, its market capitalisation would hit $1 trillion in late August.Apple's market cap would reach $1 trillion around a month later if its stock price continued to rise at the 25 percent pace seen over the past year.Alphabet's stock has risen 4 percent so far in 2018 and is up 26 percent in the past year.The median of analyst price targets for the three companies put Amazon's market capitalisation at $823 billion, Alphabet's at $914 billion and Apple's at $989 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.(Reporting by Noel Randewich; Editing by Leslie Adler)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextAt $1 Trillion, Apple is Bigger Than These ThingsInvestopedia3 Stocks to Buy Ahead of the Next Market CrashMotley FoolWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolHere's what smart rich people really do with their nest eggMarketWatchA 'tired' stock market is a reason for caution, says chart watcherMarketWatchZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraph57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCN'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley Fool3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceInvesting in General Electric Is All About These 3 Key ThingsMotley FoolCardinal Timothy Dolan on the Catholic ChurchWSJ

The packages are being sold in five price tiers, at a flat fee -- no monthly service contracts, a significant disruption of how many home security services are sold today.The least expensive, $240 for Outdoor Base, gives you an Echo Dot plus indoor and outdoor lighting designed "to make it look like you're home" The most expensive tier, $840 for Smartest, includes an alarm siren, motion sensors, safety sensors, a camera, and Echo Dot, the lighting and a video doorbell -- potentially rolling in previous security launches from the company like Amazon Key and Cloud Cam. All include two visits from Amazon employees to consult you and help with the installation.The Last July it emerged that Amazon was quietly working on its own answer to Best Buy's Geek Squad -- offering repairs and installations of home WiFi, smart home devices, Alexa installations, and other hardware-related services.Amazon never appeared to confirm it at the time, but that service now officially seems to be called "Smart Home Services" and it has expanded to Washington, Oregon, California, Arizona, Texas, Nevada, North Carolina, Georgia, Illinois, New Jersey, Washington D.C. and Florida.The security offering we are describing here -- which was initially flagged to us by a reader -- falls under that general banner, and it is being promoted at the top of the Smart Home Services homepage.Giving consumers the option of a more full-service security offering, beyond selling alarms and other devices a la carte, makes sense for a couple of reasons.The first is that while there are some early adopters who might like the challenge of installing these services themselves, there will be many middle and later adopters who will not be interested in facing that learning curve. Amazon has positioned itself in the smart home security space as more than just a reseller of third-party devices -- although it sells those, too -- with acquisitions of the smart doorbell startup Ring and the smart camera and doorbell startup Blink.The second is that most often, home security systems are coupled with service installations it in your home that include maintenance contracts, so if Amazon hopes to eat up some of that market, it needs to offer something comparable to the market.It's an interesting development also of the company's wider strategy to move into selling services, beyond physical products -- one of Amazon's various efforts to diversify its business by targeting different categories of commerce and different demographics.Another foray into human-powered services was its Thumbtack-style competitor Amazon Home Services, a marketplace it launched back in 2015 for finding tradespeople and other freelance service providers like masseurs and language tutors. (Notably, Amazon makes a big deal in its security pages of using Amazon employees to install its security systems.)Earlier this month, it also emerged that Amazon was stealing a march on Apple in smart homes, specifically by inking deals with smart home builders, who were opting for Amazon as their preferred supplier for consulting and installing such services for their home buyers.A report in The Information noted that one such home builder, Lennar, was "prioritizing Amazon" in its recommendations, while still working with Apple, in part because of the former company's stronger efforts to integrate with more third-party products, giving buyers a wider range of choices.Ramping up into security services fits with this, too. Lennar, as it happens, is directly linked now on Amazon's security homepage, but to be clear, the offering is not exclusive to Lennar homeowners.We've asked Amazon about the security service pages, and the company has acknowledged the question but still has not replied. We'll update this post as and if we learn more.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadgetAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolTesla's board is about to get a lot smallerTechCrunchWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunch

The tech giant is currently trading at $2,013 per share as of Thursday 11:30am Eastern timeWith a current market cap of $980.6 billion, some are speculating that it could be the second trillion-dollar company, after Apple hit the $1 trillion mark earlier this month.Given the company started off as an online book vendor and has now branched into all types of e-commerce, web hosting, and video streaming, CNBC’s Melissa Lee asks, “how much bigger can Amazon get?”Going further, Tim Seymour questioned “What is Amazon? … Is it a retail stock, is it a tech stock, is it a consumer staples stock? To me, the most aggressive moves that Amazon has made have really been in this trillion-and-a-half dollar consumer staples/consumables space, where they’re competing with Walmart, with Target, with Kroger, with a lot of mom-and-pop stores, and again, it’s a low-margin business. That, to me, is where the disruption lies.”On the other hand, Pete Najarian claims, “I view Amazon as a tech company, and the reason I say that is AWS. That’s where the margins are.”Yesterday, Amazon rebuffed criticism from Senator Bernie Sanders, who had recently lambasted Amazon for low wages and poor working conditions.In a statement released online, Amazon said on Wednesday, “Senator Sanders continues to spread misleading statements about pay and benefits. Amazon is proud to have created over 130,000 new jobs last year alone. In the U.S., the average hourly wage for a full-time associate in our fulfillment centers, including cash, stock, and incentive bonuses, is over $15/hour before overtime. We encourage anyone to compare our pay and benefits to other retailers.”Some of the main consumer discretionary ETFs were buoyed Wednesday by Amazon’s rise. Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLY) was up almost 1% yesterday, as was Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF (VCR) , both of which are weighted almost 25% by Amazon alone.For more information on tech ETFs, visit our technology category.POPULAR ARTICLES FROM ETFTRENDS.COMKevin O’Leary Betting on Small Caps to Outperform S&P 500Amazon Passes $2,000 Per Share, Nears $1T Market CapA Review of Tesla’s Go-Private Roller CoasterCrypto Mining Giant Bitmain Might Go Public With $18B IPOMarkets Won’t Crash if Trump ImpeachedREAD MORE AT ETFTRENDS.COM >ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceGeorge Conway calls for Trump impeachment after Mueller report | Laura Ingraham says president owed an apologyMarketWatchHere's Where to Find Every 2020 Presidential Candidate's Tax Returns (If They've Released Them)MoneyWhat The Potential 2020 Candidates Are Doing And Saying, Vol. 15FiveThirtyEight2020 campaign trail runs through churches in South CarolinaAssociated PressZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBC'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraph57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley Fool3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolInvesting in General Electric Is All About These 3 Key ThingsMotley FoolMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceCardinal Timothy Dolan on the Catholic ChurchWSJRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

Further, it provides continuous backup service which enables the companies to automate the data backup process.The addition of such disaster-resilient services to the services portfolio of Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) is likely to strengthen the company’s key offerings. Moreover, the buyout will bolster the reliability of AWS services.Cloud Backup Market Holds PromiseGrowing proliferation of cloud services worldwide is a testament to the fact that the cloud industry is booming. Several small, medium and large companies are transferring their workloads and infrastructure to a cloud platform.Meanwhile, crime and cyber attacks are taking place in an alarming rate in today’s world. These are resulting in misuse well as loss of massive amounts of data stored on a cloud platform.This has created a strong demand for data recovery services from such disasters in order to avoid any kind of operational loss.Per a report from HTF Market Intelligence, the global cloud backup market is expected to witness a CAGR of 23.4% between 2018 and 2025. Further, it is projected to hit $6.82 billion by 2025.We believe if the speculated acquisition occurs, AWS will be able to rapidly penetrate this potential market. Further, disaster recovery services will help the company in attracting customers to its platform, in turn strengthening its clientele.Consequently, this will aid in the revenue generation of AWS.Amazon.com, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Amazon.com, Inc. Revenue (TTM) | Amazon.com, Inc. QuoteIntensifying CompetitionGrowth opportunities in the global cloud backup market are attractive enough to lure other major cloud providers such as Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet’s GOOGL Google and Alibaba BABA, to name a few.Microsoft’s Azure Security Centre offers advanced analytics and global threat intelligence services which help its cloud customers to pace with the cyber attacks. Moreover, its advanced security management services for hybrid cloud workloads are major positives.Further, Google Cloud offers a wide range of products and services that have high availability features. These help the customer in the disaster recovery process.Meanwhile, Alibaba Cloud’s hybrid backup and disaster recovery solutions which are equipped with automated mechanism, are also gaining traction in the market.Nevertheless, Amazon’s latest move is likely to strengthen competitive position against the above-mentioned companies. Further, its growing focus on hybrid cloud architecture services will help it in gaining further momentum among the customers, which in turn will aid its cloud dominance.Currently, Amazon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The question now is should investors consider buying Amazon stock on the dip as we move into 2019?Holiday Shopping Amazon posted record-breaking sales during the vital holiday shopping period, according to a company statement Wednesday. The company sold millions of more Amazon devices, which include the new Echo Dot and Fire TV Stick 4K, compared to 2017.Overall, Amazon shipped more than one billion items for free as part of its Prime membership offerings in the U.S. alone. Jeff Bezos’ firm also saw “tens of millions” of people start their free Amazon Prime trials and begin their paid memberships.Amazon stock jumped 5% to reach $1,411.10 a share in morning trading Wednesday. Despite this surge, AMZN stock still sat 31% below its 52-week high of $2,050.50 a share. Investors should note that other beaten-down stocks, including Facebook FB and Apple AAPL, also surged as the larger market tries to rebound from a rough December.OverviewAmazon is coming off a Q3 that saw its revenue grow far slower than recent periods. Third quarter sales climbed 29% to reach $56.6 billion, which came in below Q2’s 39% surge and Q1’s 43% climb. The question for investors is can they find new reasons to be excited about Amazon?Right off the bat, Amazon is projected to capture approximately 50% of the total U.S. e-commerce market in 2018, up from 44% last year. This should help the e-commerce giant remain strong compared to Target TGT, Walmart WMT, and Costco COST. Meanwhile, Amazon grabbed 35% of the cloud infrastructure services market last quarter, which helped it come in well above second-place Microsoft’s MSFT roughly 15%, as well as IBM IBM, Google GOOGL, and Alibaba BABA.Outlook Looking ahead, our current Zacks Consensus Estimate calls for Amazon’s Q4 revenues to jump 18.5% to reach $71.61 billion. More specifically, Amazon’s cloud computing business is expected to jump roughly 43% from $5.113 billion in the year-ago period to reach $7.298 billion, based on our NFM estimate. For reference, Amazon Web Services revenues surged 46% last quarter and 49% in Q2.Amazon fiscal 2018 revenues are expected to surge 30.8% to touch $232.69 billion. Peeking ahead to fiscal 2019, Amazon’s top line is projected to hit $280.4 billion, which would mark a 20.5% jump above our 2018 estimate.At the bottom end of the income statement, Amazon’s adjusted fourth quarter revenues are projected to skyrocket 154% to reach $5.48 per share. AMZN’s full-year earnings are also expected to soar 328.6%. Plus, fiscal 2019’s EPS figure is projected to come in 37% higher than our 2018 estimate. It is also worth noting that Amazon’s positive earnings estimate revision activity helps it earn a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at the moment.Bottom Line Amazon’s days of insane top-line growth might be over—for now at least. But the firm has some newer businesses that look poised to help it continue to expand.One with some serious potential is Amazon’s digital advertising segment. The company is set to move into third-place this year behind only Google and Facebook. Amazon will continue to grow its ad business as more consumers begin their product searches across its website and app. Plus, Amazon has jumped deeper into the pharmaceutical industry with its PillPack purchase, which should help it challenge CVS CVS and Walgreens Boots WBA.Amazon is also ready to expand its Prime Video offerings to help it stand out against Netflix NFLX and soon enough Disney DIS, Apple, and AT&T T as we race into what could become an almost completely streaming future. And Amazon has actively grown its brick-and-mortar business, with a focus on its cashierless Amazon Go stores.Today's Stocks from Zacks' Hottest StrategiesIt's hard to believe, even for us at Zacks. But while the market gained +21.9% in 2017, our top stock-picking screens have returned +115.0%, +109.3%, +104.9%, +98.6%, and +67.1%.And this outperformance has not just been a recent phenomenon. Over the years it has been remarkably consistent. From 2000 - 2017, the composite yearly average gain for these strategies has beaten the market more than 19X over.

Wall Street analysts were generally expecting $1.27 per share on revenues of $49.96 billion. In the same quarter last year, earnings were $1.48 per share on $35.7 billion in revenue.caThe stock surged over 6% in after-hours trading.Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos pointed to Amazon Web Services, or AWS, as one of the company’s ongoing, key revenue drivers. The rapidly evolving service remains one of the most widely used go-to cloud computing services for over 1 million businesses and organizations, including McDonald’s (MCD), Netflix (NFLX), Spotify (SPOT), and UnderArmour (UAA). “AWS had the unusual advantage of a seven-year head start before facing like-minded competition, and the team has never slowed down,” Bezos said in the earnings release published on Thursday . “As a result, the AWS services are by far the most evolved and most functionality-rich. AWS lets developers do more and be nimbler, and it continues to get even better every day. That’s why you’re seeing this remarkable acceleration in AWS growth, now for two quarters in a row. A huge thank you to all our AWS customers, and you can be sure we’ll keep working hard for you.” One of the biggest bit of news Amazon dropped on Thursday? It’ss raising the price on its popular Amazon Prime program, from $99 a year to $119 a year, effective May 11. Previously, the company announced Prime had over 100 million subscribers.The last several months have been busy for Amazon. In late March and early April, President Trump criticized Amazon via Twitter and said Amazon’s agreements with the U.S. Postal Service are “not a level playing field” and that Amazon is putting “many thousands of retailers out of business.” Amazon stock temporarily took a hit in the immediate wake of President Trump’s unfavorable tweets but has since recovered.President Trump’s current anti-Amazon stance could affect AWS’ odds of landing an exclusive 10-year multibillion-dollar contract it’s competing for — alongside Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) — that would modernize the U.S. Department of Defense’s information technology system.In an interview with Yahoo Finance this month, Amazon CTO Werner Vogels declined to offer an update on the process, other than to suggest that the company remained unfazed by Trump’s attacks. Regardless, Amazon’s chances of scoring the government contract are pretty good, given the company already hosts classified systems with the CIA, as well as other top defense contractors like Lockheed Martin.Amazon executives have also been preoccupied in recent months with its ongoing search for a second U.S. headquarters, dubbed HQ2. Since Amazon announced last year it planned on opening a new $5 billion headquarters outside of Seattle, the company has narrowed its search down from 238 U.S. cities and towns to 20 finalists, with news outlets speculating Washington D.C. and Boston could have the edge, based on those markets’ local talent pool, Amazon’s significant presence in those areas, not to mention the fact Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos purchased a $26 million home in D.C.—JP Mangalindan is the Chief Tech Correspondent for Yahoo Finance covering the intersection of tech and business. Email story tips and musings to jpm@oath.com. Follow him on Twitter or Facebook.More from JPFacebook beats earnings expectations, stock jumpsMeet the Silicon Valley matchmaker helping top tech executives find loveNetflix CEO takes jab at Facebook over privacy controversyFacebook to combat pornography and hate speech with more content reviewersFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg owes lawmakers answers to these questionsRichard Branson: Government regulation of Facebook ‘makes sense’ ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextState defends South Dakota pipeline protest legislationAssociated PressFoxconn says it remains committed to Wisconsin investment projectReutersButina Shouldn't Serve Any More Time in Prison, Her Lawyers SayBloombergWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolWhy the Infamous Trump Tower Meeting Didn't Take Down TrumpFortuneZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceTesla earnings: The big question is how big is the quarterly lossMarketWatchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolHere's What Hedge Funds Think About NIO Inc.

Research has also indicated that Prime members spend about $1,300 per year on Amazon.com, $600 more than what the non-Prime Amazon customer spends.(If you’re wondering how Amazon Prime membership stacks up to Netflix, Spotify, and other subscription services, check out the numbers.)In after hours trade, Amazon shares were up about 1.5% after Bezos’ disclosure.In previous letters to shareholders, Bezos has discussed Amazon’s goal of making Prime such a good value that customers would be “irresponsible” not to pay for the service, which costs $99 a year in the U.S. and offers two-day free shipping among other benefits for members.Part of Amazon’s efforts to build its Prime member base has been its investment in Prime Video, its streaming service that competes with Netflix (NFLX) and Hulu, among others.“Prime Video continues to drive Prime member adoption and retention,” Bezos said in his letter. “In the last year we made Prime Video even better for customers by adding new, award-winning Prime Originals to the service, like The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, winner of two Critics’ Choice Awards and two Golden Globes, and the Oscar-nominated movie The Big Sick.”Bezos also said that Amazon’s streaming of NFL games on Thursday night accumulated more than 18 million viewers over 11 games. Amazon reportedly paid $50 million to stream NFL games, meaning it cost them about $2.78 for each viewer.A recent survey from Loop Capital Markets indicated that 23% of Prime members would definitely cancel their membership if streaming were not included.—Myles Udland is a writer at Yahoo Finance.

That's a massive global member base of customers that pay Amazon for the privilege of shopping on the site, enjoying a growing collection of benefits, most notably free two-day shipping. While it's hard to figure out exactly how much revenue Amazon is bringing in from Prime membership fees, since members are located all around the world and pay varying fees based on geography, it's clear that Prime is one of the most successful membership programs ever.For context, here's how Prime compares to other membership-based businesses (including some subscription businesses that may not technically refer to customers as "members").Amazon warehouse showing huge racks full of different productsMoreWhat can't you buy with Amazon Prime? Image source: Amazon.Costco: 92.2 millionThe wholesale warehouse chain is the most relevant comparison, as Costco (NASDAQ: COST) operates a global network of retail locations that similarly sells everything under the sun at aggressive price points. At the end of the last quarter, Costco had a total of 92.2 million cardholders that it counts as members.Costco's model has long been to sell products at modest markups, just enough to cover its operating expenses. If you were to ignore membership fees, Costco would have made just $270 million in operating income last quarter, or just a meager 0.8% operating margin. In other words, the $716 million that the company collected in membership fees during the quarter comprised nearly 75% of reported operating income, which is why Costco is so focused on member satisfaction.It's worth noting that Costco only has 50.4 million paid memberships, as families with multiple shoppers are able to share memberships within the household. Membership fees range from $60 per year to $120 per year.Netflix: 98.75 millionWhile it operates in a completely different industry, online video streamer Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) also refers to its paid subscribers as members. At last count, the company had 98.75 million total memberships, making it relatively comparable to Amazon Prime. Netflix acquires members with a free trial, of which there are about 4.4 million. The remaining 94.4 million memberships are paid. Investors cheered last quarter when Netflix crushed its own subscriber targets again.The majority of Netflix's member base is concentrated within the U.S., which accounts for 50.9 million total memberships (49.4 million paid memberships). Netflix continues to aggressively expand internationally, which will require a lot of localized original content and marketing.Spotify: 74.5 millionSpeaking of streaming content, Spotify Technology (NYSE: SPOT) went public last month. Ahead of the direct listing, the company estimated that it had 73 million to 76 million premium subscribers at the end of the first quarter, or 74.5 million at the midpoint. Technically, the Swedish music streamer doesn't refer to paying customers as members, but rather premium subscribers.Spotify's total monthly active user (MAU) base is 168 million to 171 million, topping Prime, but free users are under no obligation or ongoing need to continue using the service, unlike a shared Costco membership, for example (everyone needs groceries). Still, Spotify is the dominant music-streaming platform by a significant margin, enjoying roughly twice as many paid subscribers as its next closest rival.Membership- and subscription-based businesses are the way to go these days.

Prepare your bank account.MorePrime Day 2018 is upon us. And that means if you’re an Amazon (AMZN) Prime member, someone who likes a good deal or simply have a pulse, you’re going to spend an inappropriate amount of time browsing the site for some incredible deals beginning July 16. Naturally, you can expect plenty of tech deals this year. But before you click “Add to Cart,” or get fired for gross negligence for spending the entire 36-hour sale shopping rather than, you know, working, brush up on the best tips for buying everything from smartphones and laptops to TVs and smart home gadgets.Whatever you decide to buy, we’ve got you covered.What to look for in a new TVIf you’re hoping to score a sick new TV during Prime Day, and chances are there will be at least one, there are a few important thoughts to keep in mind. The first is size. My rule is always go big or go home. Just don’t go too big or it won’t fit in your room.The point is, you want to find a television that’s the right size for your home. Check out the size of the TV on sale during Prime Day, then measure the space you want to place it to make sure it’ll fit. And remember, you’re definitely not going to be able to make your friends jealous with a new TV that’s small.A Sony TV that was on sale during last year’s Prime Day.MoreIf you’re buying that sweet new television to upgrade from your current 1080p set, you’ll want to purchase a 4K model. 4K TVs have a higher resolution than 1080p panels, creating a sharper image. It’s worth noting, though, that you’ll only really see a difference in sharpness on TVs that are 55 inches or larger. A 32-inch, 4K TV is pretty much pointless.It’s also worth checking to see if your new TV offers high-dynamic range (HDR) compatibility. HDR increases the contrast ratio of the image on the screen making for a wider array of colors, as well as deeper blacks and brighter whites. Chances are, if you’re buying a TV that offers HDR capability, it’ll also be 4K. You’ll also want to make sure that the TV you’re buying is compatible with HDR10 and Dolby Vision, two of the more popular HDR formats.A TCL TV from Prime Day 2017.MoreFinally, if you’re buying a new TV, make sure it has enough HDMI ports for all of the devices you want to connect. Sure, you can always get an HDMI splitter, but those don’t necessarily work with every device you use.What to look for in a new smartphonePast Prime Days have included sales on smartphones, which means we’ll likely see the same this year. But when you’re buying a smartphone online there are a few important options to consider.First thing’s first: Make sure the handset you’re buying is compatible with the network you use. For instance, if you see a deal on a Huawei or ZTE smartphone, you might not be able to use it in the U.S. if you’re a Verizon or AT&T customer because of the handset’s antennas. Not every phone uses the same bands needed to be compatible on U.S. networks, especially if they’re from overseas companies.If you’re interested in buying a smartphone during Prime Day, make sure it works with your carrier.MoreStory continuesYou’ll also want to look at how much storage the smartphone offers. If you tend to keep all your photos, music, movies, shows and documents saved on your phone rather than in the cloud, you’ll need a handset with a good amount of storage space. I’d recommend going with a phone with 128GB of storage, just to make sure you have plenty to spare in the future. If you’re a serious storage hog, then opt for a handset with 256 GB. You can also check out smartphones with microSD card slots to add your own amount of storage.Finally, make sure that the phone you’re buying is the right size for you. Some people prefer smaller handsets, others love pocket-busting behemoths. Just be sure to note the size and make sure the one you buy fits your needs. What to look for in a computerShould you find a sweet, sweet laptop for sale during Prime Day, don’t pull the trigger before you check out exactly what you’re getting. If you’re the kind of person who wants the best of the best when it comes to your tech, you’ll definitely want to look at the kind of processor, graphics chip and RAM comes packed into the machine you’re checking out.Hoping for a laptop this Prime Day? You’ll need to make sure it offers the kind of specs for your needs.MoreYou’re not going to want to buy a slick new laptop that has a two-year old processor and graphics chip that can’t handle the best games on the market. Do your research and make sure you’re getting a system with a CPU that’s from this or last year.If you’re going to be doing some serious multitasking on your computer, you’ll want to get a machine with at least 6GB of RAM. Last year, Amazon was selling some completely insane gaming laptops, so buckle up, because this year could be even better.Smart home devicesGot a smart speaker at home and want to grow your tiny electronic outpost into a fully connected digital empire? Then Prime Day might be the best way to get started. Importantly, you’ll have to make sure that whatever connected device you buy works with your particular system.The vast majority of smart home devices work with Amazon’s Alexa, the most popular system available. Up next is Google’s Home, followed by Apple’s (AAPL) HomeKit. If you want to set up an Apple-centric smart home system, you’ll have to make sure that your devices are compatible with HomeKit.The Amazon Echo dot.MoreGot an Echo in the house? Then you can buy pretty much any device; it’ll likely work without issue. More of a Google (GOOG, GOOGL) fan? You’ll also find what you’re looking for. But if you’re an Apple person, getting the smart home device you want could be more difficult since there aren’t as many on the market. All that being said, just be sure that the device you’d like to buy actually works with the smart home assistant you’re using.Now grab your credit cards, check your bank account and get ready to drop some cash on what should be some solid tech deals. Or just browse aimlessly until you stumble on a price cut for bulk underwear purchases. At least that’s what I’ll be doing.Illo by: David FosterMoreRead more about Prime Day:Amazon Prime Day 2018 tech shopping guideYour super-quick guide to Amazon Prime DayA few tips and tools for shopping on Prime DayChart: Amazon Prime Day depresses retail foot trafficHere’s how much Amazon is poised to make from Prime DayHow to shop smart and make money on Prime DaySurvey shows how much people plan to spend on Amazon Prime DayEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@oath.com; follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley. Follow Yahoo Finance on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaThe Morning After: The Weather Channel got hackedEngadgetTrailers of the Week: 'Child's Play,' 'Hobbs and Shaw,' 'Big Little Lies 2'Rolling StoneWhere to Stream Movies FreeConsumer ReportsAmazon Music's free ad-supported tier is now available for all Alexa usersBGR NewsZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolTesla's board is about to get a lot smallerTechCrunchBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo Finance3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceInvesting in General Electric Is All About These 3 Key ThingsMotley Fool

Now, it is one of the biggest shopping events in the world! It’s such a large shopping event, and it has grown so quickly, that Prime Day has some significant investment implications.First off, investors want to judge whether or not Prime Day performed well relative to expectations to see whether Amazon remains an e-commerce juggernaut. Secondly, investors also want to see what sold well on Prime Day to glean insights as to where consumer demand is strongest.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  7 Alternative Internet of Things Stocks to Buy  With that in mind, here’s a list of three winners and one loser from this year’s Amazon Prime Day:Amazon Prime Day Winner: Amazon (AMZN)Source: AmazonPerhaps it goes without saying, but the biggest winner from Prime Day is the event’s host, Amazon.Despite website glitches and worker strikes, third-party data and Amazon statements have come together to paint a picture that Prime Day was a huge success for Amazon. According to algo-commerce company feedvisor, total sales in the first 12 hours of Prime Day were up 89%, versus an 80% gain in the prior year. Google Tends shows a huge spike in search interest to all-time highs for both “Amazon.com” and “Prime Day“.Meanwhile, Amazon said in a press release that more than 100 million products were purchased worldwide during Prime Day. They also said that the best selling products of those 100 million were Amazon products like Fire TV Stick and Echo Dot.Thus, not only did Prime Day generate a ton of sales through Amazon’s e-commerce platform, but it also helped Amazon sell a ton of its own products. That is a double win for Amazon, and it comes despite noise in the background from website glitches and worker strikes.What does all this mean? The Amazon e-commerce powerhouse remains as strong, as important, and as irreplaceable as ever.Amazon Prime Day Winner: Royal Philips (PHG)Source: ShutterstockIn the world of smart devices, everything is going smart. We aren’t just talking smartphones and smartwatches, but also smart appliances.The smart appliance market is admittedly limited in scope at the present moment. But there are pockets of it that are booming, and one of those pockets that is booming is the smart lighting category.Smart lights have been a consumer favorite for some time now. This popularity continued on Prime Day. Philips Hue smart lights and related appliances, made by Royal Philips (NYSE:PHG), were a top seller on Prime Day across multiple countries, including the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Belgium, and Australia. Also, PHG’s smart toothbrush was the top top-selling item on Prime Day in China.What does all this mean? Clearly, PHG is at the forefront of the smart appliance trend. In many respects, that makes PHG stock an Internet of Things (IoT) stock with huge growth drivers on the horizon.  7 Cybersecurity Funds for Growth Investors  Indeed, PHG’s growth strategy is all about the connected health market, and consequently, results have been quite good for the past several years. That is why PHG stock has nearly doubled over the past two years. Further gains seem possible considering the huge tailwinds in connected health and smart appliances.Amazon Prime Day Winner: Sony (SNE)Story continuesSource: Dalvenjah via FlickrThe PlayStation gaming console, made by Sony (NYSE:SNE), had a strong showing on Prime Day.PlayStation gaming consoles, games, and related accessories and memberships were top-sellers on Prime Day across multiple countries, including Germany, France, and Australia. In Australia, PlayStation made a particularly strong showing with the top two selling items (a PlayStation 4 gaming console and the FIFA 18 game for PlayStation 4).What does all this mean? Sony isn’t purely a gaming company. But, games are a big part of what the company does. This business has been doing well, thanks to growing demand for next-gen video game consoles as well as the explosion in eSports and the huge digital shift in the video game industry. With augmented and virtual reality catalysts right around the corner, this business also promises to keep doing well over the next several years.A strong PlayStation showing on Prime Day simply bolsters the bull thesis on Sony’s gaming growth prospects. As such, it looks fairly certain that Sony experiences strong growth in gaming over the next several quarters and years, and that this growth helps power SNE stock higher.Amazon Prime Day Loser: Newell Brands (NWL)The biggest loser from Amazon Prime day is Newell Brands (NYSE:NWL), the company behind the once mega-popular Crock-Pot.The Crock-Pot has been on its way out for a few quarters now. The new fad centers around multipurpose cookers like the Instant Pot, which are widely viewed as more versatile and less dangerous. Indeed, over the past several quarters as Instant Pot has stolen market share from Crock-Pot, NWL has reported sluggish sales growth and even reported negative core sales growth in the past two quarters.Prime Day suggests there is more pain ahead for NWL stock.The Instant Pot, which was the top-selling Prime Day item in the U.S. and Canada in 2017, was again the top-selling Prime Day item in the U.S. and Canada in 2018. Considering the U.S. and Canada are presumably two of Amazon’s biggest markets, Instant Pot nabbing the top-selling spot means that a lot of Instant Pots were sold through Amazon on Prime Day.  5 Strong Earnings Stocks to Buy Post-Netflix Plunge  What does all this mean? The Crock-Pot continues to lose popularity, and that will continue to show up in NWL’s numbers. Bad numbers usually lead to a weak stock, so I think there is more weakness ahead for NWL stock.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long AMZN and PHG.  Compare Brokers The post Amazon Prime Day: 3 Winners, 1 Loser appeared first on InvestorPlace.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

That’s according to Daniel Ives, head of research for the marketing insights firm GBH Insights, who estimates Amazon’s 36-hour sales event will be its most successful since it debuted Prime Day in July 2015, when the Seattle tech giant celebrated its 20th anniversary. Ives declined to provide an estimate regarding how much in sales Amazon generates during a normal 36-hour period other than to say that sales during Prime Day would be significantly higher. “We expect this to be the biggest, most successful Prime Day Amazon has ever had,” said Ives, who estimates that 60%-70% of all items on Amazon.com will be discounted. This year’s Prime Day, which kicks off on Monday, July 16 at 3 p.m. ET and wraps up on Tuesday, July 17, will include over 1 million deals — 50% more than the year prior.A Jumbotron-sized ad for AmazonIllo by: David FosterMoreWhile analysts like Ives generally expect Amazon (AMZN) and third-party retailers to profit from Prime Day sales — albeit with razor-thin margins — Prime Day serves as an excellent way for Amazon to steal the limelight for several days every year. Not only does Prime Day serve as an excellent Jumbotron-sized virtual billboard for Amazon proper, it’s a big splashy ad for Prime, given Prime Day deals are only available to Prime members. In April, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced Prime had 100 million subscribers — a marked improvement from the “tens of millions” of Prime members Amazon had touted for years. “[Prime Day] is all about getting more people to sign up for Prime,” contends Anthony Chukumba, an analyst for Loop Capital Markets. “Are they going to make money? Probably a little bit of money. But they don’t really care either way. It’s about advertising for Amazon, and it’s about Prime, and it’s about getting people to sign up for those free Prime memberships and hopefully getting some of those people to convert to a regular annual membership.”More Prime users mean more sales for Amazon. Data released in July 2017 from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners indicates that the average Prime user spends $1,300 on Amazon each year versus just $700 per-year for non-Prime members. The research firm surveyed 500 U.S. consumers who made purchases on Amazon.com between April and June in 2017.Non-Prime members aren’t as jazzed about Prime DayStill, Prime Day may not be reason alone for many shoppers to sign up for Prime. A survey conducted by Yahoo Finance this week found less than 7% of the 1,084 non-Prime members surveyed said they would become Prime members before July 16, or Prime Day. In fact, the majority indicated they would only sign up for a free trial. Also bear in mind that a portion of items sold during this year’s Prime Day will be heavily-discounted, in particular Kindle e-readers and Echo speakers, which are essentially Trojan horses to boost customer loyalty. According to Mark Mahaney, senior tech analyst for RBC Capital Markets, just 15% of the “tens of millions” of Echo owners use their speakers to make purchases on Amazon. “That’s a pretty small penetration,” concedes Mahaney. “But I think that’s something that rises over time. It will take a couple of years, because that’s a behavioral change that doesn’t come quickly, but it will happen.”If we’ve learned anything about Amazon, of course, it’s that it doesn’t mind playing the long game. —JP Mangalindan is the Chief Tech Correspondent for Yahoo Finance covering the intersection of tech and business. Email story tips and musings to jpm@oath.com. Follow him on Twitter or Facebook.Read more about Prime Day:Almost half of Amazon Prime members surveyed plan to spend over $100 on Prime Amazon Prime Day 2018 tech shopping guideYour super-quick guide to Amazon Prime DayA few tips and tools for shopping on Prime DayChart: Amazon Prime Day depresses retail foot trafficHere’s how much Amazon is poised to make from Prime DayHow to shop smart and make money on Prime DayReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

That’s according to Daniel Ives, head of research for the marketing insights firm GBH Insights, who estimates Amazon’s 36-hour sales event will be its most successful since it debuted Prime Day in July 2015, when the Seattle tech giant celebrated its 20th anniversary. Ives declined to provide an estimate regarding how much in sales Amazon generates during a normal 36-hour period other than to say that sales during Prime Day would be significantly higher. “We expect this to be the biggest, most successful Prime Day Amazon has ever had,” said Ives, who estimates that 60%-70% of all items on Amazon.com will be discounted. This year’s Prime Day, which kicks off on Monday, July 16 at 3 p.m. ET and wraps up on Tuesday, July 17, will include over 1 million deals — 50% more than the year prior.A Jumbotron-sized ad for AmazonIllo by: David FosterMoreWhile analysts like Ives generally expect Amazon (AMZN) and third-party retailers to profit from Prime Day sales — albeit with razor-thin margins — Prime Day serves as an excellent way for Amazon to steal the limelight for several days every year. Not only does Prime Day serve as an excellent Jumbotron-sized virtual billboard for Amazon proper, it’s a big splashy ad for Prime, given Prime Day deals are only available to Prime members. In April, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos announced Prime had 100 million subscribers — a marked improvement from the “tens of millions” of Prime members Amazon had touted for years. “[Prime Day] is all about getting more people to sign up for Prime,” contends Anthony Chukumba, an analyst for Loop Capital Markets. “Are they going to make money? Probably a little bit of money. But they don’t really care either way. It’s about advertising for Amazon, and it’s about Prime, and it’s about getting people to sign up for those free Prime memberships and hopefully getting some of those people to convert to a regular annual membership.”More Prime users mean more sales for Amazon. Data released in July 2017 from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners indicates that the average Prime user spends $1,300 on Amazon each year versus just $700 per-year for non-Prime members. The research firm surveyed 500 U.S. consumers who made purchases on Amazon.com between April and June in 2017.Non-Prime members aren’t as jazzed about Prime DayStill, Prime Day may not be reason alone for many shoppers to sign up for Prime. A survey conducted by Yahoo Finance this week found less than 7% of the 1,084 non-Prime members surveyed said they would become Prime members before July 16, or Prime Day. In fact, the majority indicated they would only sign up for a free trial. Also bear in mind that a portion of items sold during this year’s Prime Day will be heavily-discounted, in particular Kindle e-readers and Echo speakers, which are essentially Trojan horses to boost customer loyalty. According to Mark Mahaney, senior tech analyst for RBC Capital Markets, just 15% of the “tens of millions” of Echo owners use their speakers to make purchases on Amazon. “That’s a pretty small penetration,” concedes Mahaney. “But I think that’s something that rises over time. It will take a couple of years, because that’s a behavioral change that doesn’t come quickly, but it will happen.”If we’ve learned anything about Amazon, of course, it’s that it doesn’t mind playing the long game. —JP Mangalindan is the Chief Tech Correspondent for Yahoo Finance covering the intersection of tech and business. Email story tips and musings to jpm@oath.com. Follow him on Twitter or Facebook.Read more about Prime Day:Almost half of Amazon Prime members surveyed plan to spend over $100 on Prime Amazon Prime Day 2018 tech shopping guideYour super-quick guide to Amazon Prime DayA few tips and tools for shopping on Prime DayChart: Amazon Prime Day depresses retail foot trafficHere’s how much Amazon is poised to make from Prime DayHow to shop smart and make money on Prime DayReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

The company is raising the price from $10.99 per month to $12.99 per month -- an 18% increase. Student members that pay monthly will see their prices rise by a comparable percentage, from $5.49 per month to $6.49 per month.However, the changes only apply to members that pay on a monthly basis. The annual subscription prices ($99 per year, or $49 per year for students) are unchanged. It's been nearly four years since the last Prime price increase, when Amazon bumped the annual price from $79 to $99 back in 2014.Amazon warehouse employee sorting ordersMoreImage source: Amazon.Here's everything you need to know about the changes, and why Amazon's making them.Net shipping losses are growingThere are a couple likely reasons why Amazon is making the change. First and foremost is to generate more revenue to cover rising shipping costs. Amazon used to disclose its net shipping costs each quarter, but abruptly stopped in Q2 2017. The company has been increasingly losing money on shipping costs, and while Amazon has an incredibly high tolerance for absorbing losses if those losses can drive growth, the figures underscore why a price increase is in order.Shipping losses jumped precipitously in 2016.   Metric   2014   2015   2016       Shipping revenue   $4.5 billion   $6.5 billion   $9 billion     Shipping costs   ($8.7 billion)   ($11.5 billion)   ($16.2 billion)     Net shipping cost   ($4.2 billion)   ($5 billion)   ($7.2 billion)   Data source: SEC filings.For Q1 2017, the last quarter that investors have net shipping cost data for, net shipping losses widened by 30%.   Metric   Q1 2016   Q1 2017       Shipping revenue   $1.8 billion   $2.5 billion     Shipping costs   ($3.3 billion)   ($4.4 billion)     Net shipping cost   ($1.5 billion)   ($1.9 billion)   Data source: SEC filings.Shipping revenue includes some (unspecified) portion of the Prime membership fees as well as fees earned from merchants for Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) services, but excludes any shipping fees charged by third-party merchants where Amazon does not fulfill the orders. Amazon now only discloses its shipping costs ($5.4 billion in Q3 2017) but not shipping revenue, so investors no longer have a sense of its net shipping costs, but the trend was already abundantly clear.Pushing members to annual plansThe monthly subscription option may have been more popular among lower-income consumers or those that don't want a long-term subscription, but the price structure change even more strongly encourages consumers to sign up for the annual plan.    Tier   Annual Cost (Paid Monthly)   Annual Cost (Paid Annually)   Difference       Prime before price change   $131.88   $99   $32.88     Prime after price change   $155.88   $99   $56.88     Prime Student before price change   $65.88   $49   $16.88     Prime Student after price change   $77.88   $49   $28.88   Data sources: Amazon and author's calculations.The savings associated with the annual plan just jumped quite a bit. That's a strong incentive for monthly members to upgrade to the annual plan. Of course, Amazon would prefer customers on the annual plan because Prime members tend to spend more on Amazon, and it can foster long-term relationships with those customers while enjoying greater financial visibility.It's hard to quantify what financial impact the change might have. How many Prime members Amazon has is a closely guarded secret. Even if investors knew this number, they'd need to know the mix of monthly subscribers vs. annual subscribers as well, since the change only affects the former group.The value is still therePrime offers such incredible value that it's extremely unlikely that the price increase will cause any type of mass customer exodus. It's comparable to Costco memberships or Netflix subscriptions -- both of which also receive price increases every few years. Those companies' respective member bases don't see any lasting adverse effects from price increases, since they still provide strong value to consumers.The same will hold true for Amazon.

REUTERS/Ralph D. Freso/FilesMoreBy Phil Wahba and Deepa Seetharaman(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc plans to hike the annual fee for its popular Prime service by 25 percent to $99 starting next week, a move announced on Thursday that risks losing customers for a feature that has helped drive its business.The increase comes about six weeks after Amazon warned that it may raise prices by as much as $40 to offset rising fuel and shipping costs. Prime, which offers unlimited two-day shipping among other perks, had cost $79 since its introduction in 2005.Later on Thursday, Amazon rival ShopRunner offered a free one-year membership to its own $79-a-year service to disgruntled Prime users who have not renewed their subscription at the higher rate. ShopRunner partners with brick-and-mortar retailers like Nieman Marcus and offers unlimited two-day shipping.The $20 hike for Prime is unlikely to spur users to drop the service en masse, analysts said. But it may temper Amazon's ability to attract new customers to Prime, seen as instrumental to boosting purchases of goods and digital media."We wonder if a meaningful price increase would dissuade some on-the-fence potential Amazon Primers from ponying up for the membership," RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said in a research note.The move comes as Amazon faces mounting pressure to show sustained bottom-line growth, following years of rapid revenue expansion at the cost of profits. In 2013, Amazon's shipping costs grew almost 30 percent to $6.6 billion as its sales grew.The increase in Prime's fee could add about half a billion dollars to Amazon's annual operating income, according to some analyst estimates."If you consider things like inflation and fuel costs, a Prime membership valued at $79 in 2005 would be worth more than $100 today," Amazon spokeswoman Julie Law said. She declined to say how the company calculated the figure.Prime customers get a limited selection of book downloads as well as film and television streams as part of the service, which has helped expand Amazon's presence on mobile devices.There are about 20 million Prime members in the United States, and they spend at least twice as much as non-Prime members in a given year, according to some analyst estimates.One analyst said the hike was expected and consumers would get accustomed to paying more."Based on our surveys of consumers, key reasons to shop on Amazon (and online more generally) include convenience, selection, and price comparisons," R.W. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian wrote in a research note. "Prime helps to amplify the first two drivers."But others said consumers tended to strongly resist online fee hikes, such as when Netflix Inc tried in 2011 to raise its annual subscription fee by what it called "the price of a latte." It backtracked after a customer revolt.Some Prime members bristled at the increase in Prime, saying it was unfair to Prime users who spend more than non-users."I'm going to cancel: My thought is that the price should be going down. Prime customers order more from Amazon because of their membership," Caryn Brooks wrote on a Facebook Inc discussion moderated by Reuters."By having Prime members they have more guaranteed sales ... they should nurture those folks, not repel them," Brooks said.Amazon shares ended little changed on the Nasdaq at $371.51.(Reporting by Phil Wahba and Franklin Paul in New York; and Deepa Seetharaman in San Francisco; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn, Jeffrey Benkoe and Tom Brown)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolCrude Oil Weekly Price Forecast – Crude oil running into resistanceFX EmpireSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraph1 Big Reason Why Disney Stock Is Just Getting StartedMotley FoolWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

The company has already renewedJack Ryan for a second season despite a months-long wait for Prime Video show's August 31st premiere. If you ask Amazon, it's a combination of its reaction to watching the show (generally a good idea) with early hints of customer interest. Reportedly, there was a 400 percent jump in watchlist additions for Jack Ryan following Amazon's Super Bowl ad campaign.There's very little to say about season two at this stage, although Amazon noted that Ryan will go to a "new, exciting and dangerous world." You can presume he survives the first season, then.The renewal bodes well for the series, although we'd take Amazon's hype with a grain of salt. It's not exactly shocking that watchlist additions would surge for a show when it gets one of the most coveted ad spots on the planet. And the watchlist doesn't guarantee that people will watch the season at all, let alone every episode. Think of this as an experiment on Amazon's part -- it's betting that a strong presence in show queues will translate to strong audience numbers. If that bet pays off, viewers won't have to wait as long for the follow-up as they would if Amazon had been more conservative.AmazonThis article originally appeared on Engadget.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksWalmart Wants to Take On Amazon in Digital AdvertisingMotley FoolWill Amazon (AMZN) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?ZacksZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo Finance1 Big Reason Why Disney Stock Is Just Getting StartedMotley FoolSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance'American Ninja Warrior Junior': Get an exclusive sneak peek at the semi-finals!AOL.comWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergCoachella Weekend 2: What to Watch ForVariety

On Tuesday, the UK’s Metro newspaper asked whether Gunn will still direct the project for Amazon in the wake of his Disney firing.The answer is no.A spokesperson for Amazon Studios tells Yahoo Finance that Amazon backed out of the project months ago—before Gunn’s current scandal.“We passed on the project completely months ago,” says the spokesperson. “There was no statement. This is the same for any other project we do not move forward with.”Director James Gunn at a discussion during the E3 Expo on June 13, 2017, in Los Angeles, Calif.

It is unclear whether the series could still get made by a different distributor; Yahoo Finance has reached out to Sony TV for comment.Gunn has publicly apologized for the tweets, and said, “I understand and accept the business decisions taken” by Disney.

The company's experimental hiring tool used artificial intelligence to give job candidates scores ranging from one to five stars - much like shoppers rate products on Amazon, some of the people said."Everyone wanted this holy grail," one of the people said. "They literally wanted it to be an engine where I'm going to give you 100 resumes, it will spit out the top five, and we'll hire those." But by 2015, the company realized its new system was not rating candidates for software developer jobs and other technical posts in a gender-neutral way.That is because Amazon's computer models were trained to vet applicants by observing patterns in resumes submitted to the company over a 10-year period. Most came from men, a reflection of male dominance across the tech industry. (For a graphic on gender breakdowns in tech, see: https://tmsnrt.rs/2OfPWoD) In effect, Amazon's system taught itself that male candidates were preferable. It penalized resumes that included the word "women's," as in "women's chess club captain." And it downgraded graduates of two all-women's colleges, according to people familiar with the matter. They did not specify the names of the schools.Amazon edited the programs to make them neutral to these particular terms. But that was no guarantee that the machines would not devise other ways of sorting candidates that could prove discriminatory, the people said.The Seattle company ultimately disbanded the team by the start of last year because executives lost hope for the project, according to the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Amazon's recruiters looked at the recommendations generated by the tool when searching for new hires, but never relied solely on those rankings, they said.Amazon declined to comment on the recruiting engine or its challenges, but the company says it is committed to workplace diversity and equality.The company's experiment, which Reuters is first to report, offers a case study in the limitations of machine learning. It also serves as a lesson to the growing list of large companies including Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc that are looking to automate portions of the hiring process.Some 55 percent of U.S. human resources managers said artificial intelligence, or AI, would be a regular part of their work within the next five years, according to a 2017 survey by talent software firm CareerBuilder.Employers have long dreamed of harnessing technology to widen the hiring net and reduce reliance on subjective opinions of human recruiters. But computer scientists such as Nihar Shah, who teaches machine learning at Carnegie Mellon University, say there is still much work to do."How to ensure that the algorithm is fair, how to make sure the algorithm is really interpretable and explainable - that's still quite far off," he said.MASCULINE LANGUAGE Amazon's experiment began at a pivotal moment for the world's largest online retailer. Machine learning was gaining traction in the technology world, thanks to a surge in low-cost computing power. And Amazon's Human Resources department was about to embark on a hiring spree: Since June 2015, the company's global headcount has more than tripled to 575,700 workers, regulatory filings show.So it set up a team in Amazon's Edinburgh engineering hub that grew to around a dozen people. Their goal was to develop AI that could rapidly crawl the web and spot candidates worth recruiting, the people familiar with the matter said.The group created 500 computer models focused on specific job functions and locations. They taught each to recognize some 50,000 terms that showed up on past candidates' resumes. The algorithms learned to assign little significance to skills that were common across IT applicants, such as the ability to write various computer codes, the people said.Story continuesInstead, the technology favored candidates who described themselves using verbs more commonly found on male engineers’ resumes, such as "executed" and "captured," one person said.Gender bias was not the only issue. Problems with the data that underpinned the models' judgments meant that unqualified candidates were often recommended for all manner of jobs, the people said. With the technology returning results almost at random, Amazon shut down the project, they said.THE PROBLEM, OR THE CURE? Other companies are forging ahead, underscoring the eagerness of employers to harness AI for hiring.Kevin Parker, chief executive of HireVue, a startup near Salt Lake City, said automation is helping firms look beyond the same recruiting networks upon which they have long relied. His firm analyzes candidates' speech and facial expressions in video interviews to reduce reliance on resumes."You weren’t going back to the same old places; you weren’t going back to just Ivy League schools," Parker said. His company's customers include Unilever PLC and Hilton.Goldman Sachs has created its own resume analysis tool that tries to match candidates with the division where they would be the "best fit," the company said.Microsoft Corp's LinkedIn, the world's largest professional network, has gone further. It offers employers algorithmic rankings of candidates based on their fit for job postings on its site.Still, John Jersin, vice president of LinkedIn Talent Solutions, said the service is not a replacement for traditional recruiters."I certainly would not trust any AI system today to make a hiring decision on its own," he said. "The technology is just not ready yet." Some activists say they are concerned about transparency in AI. The American Civil Liberties Union is currently challenging a law that allows criminal prosecution of researchers and journalists who test hiring websites' algorithms for discrimination."We are increasingly focusing on algorithmic fairness as an issue," said Rachel Goodman, a staff attorney with the Racial Justice Program at the ACLU.Still, Goodman and other critics of AI acknowledged it could be exceedingly difficult to sue an employer over automated hiring: Job candidates might never know it was being used.As for Amazon, the company managed to salvage some of what it learned from its failed AI experiment. It now uses a "much-watered down version" of the recruiting engine to help with some rudimentary chores, including culling duplicate candidate profiles from databases, one of the people familiar with the project said.Another said a new team in Edinburgh has been formed to give automated employment screening another try, this time with a focus on diversity.(Reporting By Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco; Editing by Jonathan Weber and Marla Dickerson)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

REUTERS/Pascal RossignolMoreLONDON (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc is expanding its nascent European product insurance business, according to recent job adverts, which industry watchers say could signal the start of broader ambitions in insurance.Amazon Protect, which provides extensions to manufacturers' warranties for items like mobile phones or washing machines bought on Amazon's website, launched last year in Europe.It is Amazon's only insurance business globally.Recent job advertisements for the EU product insurance division described "launching a new business" and "creating a new palette of services"."This is a sure sign disruption is on the way for the UK insurance market," said Patricia Davies, financial services analyst at data and analytics firm GlobalData.An Amazon UK spokesman declined to comment.Specialist insurers are concerned that Amazon and other online players will encroach on their territory, and are looking to partner with them.Investment in insurtech firms in Europe has risen sharply in the first half of 2017, often with the backing of big insurers. [nL5N1LW28W]Amazon Protect launched in Britain in April 2016, quickly expanding to the firm's main European markets of France, Germany, Italy and Spain.Its policies give customers an extension on manufacturers' two-year warranties for up to five years, insuring against accidental damage, breakdown and theft.The Warranty Group, which underwrites Amazon Protect policies, did not respond to a request for comment.Amazon posted the jobs on LinkedIn and "Where Women Work" in recent weeks."Along with internal and external partners, we are re-defining the warranties and product insurance experience, disrupting the way traditional product insurance services are acquired and delivered and creating a new palette of services," one job ad, which is no longer accepting applications, said.Another asked: "Would you like to take part in launching a new business?"Insurers have been looking at ways of tapping into the so-called connected home, for instance by offering home insurance cover which will alert you if your pipes have sprung a leak.Amazon's launch of voice-activated home personal assistant Alexa could give an opportunity for it to expand into this area of home insurance, Davies said."I don't expect them to come up with traditional insurance products," she said.(Reporting by Carolyn Cohn and Noor Zainab Hussain; Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextHealthcare stocks take a beating as Bernie Sanders' 'Medicare for all' plan grows in popularityThe IndependentThis Is The Part Of 'Medicare For All' That You Never Hear AboutHuffPostWorth the risk?

Then in late June, on the first day of vacation with his wife in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, Cipriano noticed over a dozen missed phone calls and messages alerting him that his books had been pulled from the Kindle store and that his ability to publish through KDP was suspended. “It was the worst week of my life,” Cipriano said. “We spent the entire vacation in the hotel worried if I was ever going to make another penny again and worrying about how I was going to pay off all of the expenses for everybody and if we could even afford to eat dinner that night.”Cipriano says he has yet to receive a clear, detailed explanation from Amazon beyond the assertion that he manipulated KDP services — services that include Amazon’s all-you-can-read $9.99 Kindle Unlimited — despite reaching out to customer support to explain the situation. Feedback from Amazon largely came in the form of a generic form letter via email:Source: J.A. CiprianoMoreMichael-Scott Earle, an author of over 45 pulp fiction, science fiction and fantasy novels for men, experienced a similar scenario play out. In mid-July, the Austin, Texas-based native was on the phone with his editor going over changes to the draft of his latest novel, when he received an email from Amazon stating his KDP account was also involved in the “manipulation of KDP services including Kindle Unlimited.”“I imagine I make them probably about a half-million dollars a year which is nothing to them — it’s probably a rounding error to them,” says Earle, who says he has sold roughly 300,000 copies of his books. “But could they have called me or maybe sent me an email? I’m not even worth someone reaching out to and saying, ‘Hey, Michael-Scott, we’re seeing this or that with your account. What’s going on?’”Story continuesAuthor Michael-Scott Earle, pictured with his daughter Betty, has self-published over 45 novels through Amazon. Source: Michael-Scott EarleMoreAmazon, for its part, declined to go into specifics about why it banished these authors. But it appears the company has come down particularly hard on some KDP Select authors in recent weeks. Four other authors Yahoo Finance spoke to on the condition of anonymity acknowledged they had somewhat similar experiences and were also notified that they had somehow manipulated KDP services, including Kindle Unlimited.  “As I’m sure you understand, we don’t comment on actions we take against specific author accounts, but we take attempts to manipulate our services very seriously,” an Amazon spokesperson tells Yahoo Finance. ‘There are people who abuse the system’Since it launched in 2007, the Kindle Direct Publishing platform has become a behemoth in self-publishing, cementing itself as one of the largest marketplaces for authors looking to independently publish their work. In the years since, thousands of authors have flooded KDP with books across many genres, from fiction and romance to business and investing. The KDP platform has become successful enough such that Amazon, in addition to having its own book publishing imprints like 47 North and Grand Harbor Press, offers a slew of tools aimed at helping aspiring independent authors get started. Because KDP has become a crowded platform, some authors who publish through KDP are strongly compelled to enroll in KDP Select, a program that offers enrollment in Kindle Unlimited and the Kindle Owners’ Lending Library for added visibility in exchange for book exclusivity with Amazon. If an author participates in Kindle Unlimited, it’s more likely their books will also be promoted elsewhere in the Kindle store, which can yield more sales. The catch: Authors whose books are available on Kindle Unlimited get paid differently than the rest of the book industry. Instead of receiving a percentage of each book sold, authors are paid each month from one collective royalty fund. And each monthly payment is determined not by how many times an author’s book is downloaded, but by how many ebook pages are read.Thousands of authors self-publish on Amazon’s KDP platform across many genres, from fiction to business and investing. Source: Amazon.comMoreThat business model, unfortunately, has led to authors who try to game the system by faking the number of book pages read — a scam called “book stuffing.” One method involves scammers exaggerating or falsifying the number of pages read by adding a “disruptive link” at the start of a book promising “bonus content.” Clicking on the link jumps the reader to the end of the book, however long it may be. That way, the reader’s device sees that they have finished a book, even if a reader has only read just 5% of it. Yet the book’s author is paid more for it. This June, Amazon further clarified its publishing guidelines such that “disruptive links” are explicitly banned and bonus content should “make up no more than around 10% of an e-book.” Such “manipulations” of Amazon’s KDP service are also grounds for the company to pull an author’s books from Amazon.com and terminate that author’s KDP account. Jessica Park, an author in Manchester, New Hampshire, who has self-published seven books on the KDP platform, says she’s only had positive experiences with Amazon but expressed sympathy for authors whose works may have unjustifiably been banned. “There are some people who abuse the Kindle platform, and that’s slimy,” acknowledged Park. “But some of these cases sound to me like KDP has misinterpreted something or is not communicating well, and it’s shutting off accounts with insufficient explanation. They [Amazon] built this world to let people publish and encouraged them to get their work out there. So I really don’t know, but I am frustrated for them if they’ve truly not done anything wrong.” An imperfect systemAuthors such as Cipriano and Earle, who say they haven’t engaged in any such practices, are now facing the realization that this could be the end of their careers as full-time novelists. After all, Amazon is a dominant force in the publishing industry — and publishing through Amazon was their only source of income. Although Amazon terminated Earle’s KDP account, he attempted a workaround: employing a third-party publisher and their KDP account to potentially publish his works to the Kindle Store on his behalf. On Thursday morning, however, Amazon rejected the publisher’s attempts and additionally told Earle he would not receive the remaining book royalties due to him. Because Amazon’s terms of service state KDP authors can’t sue the company, Earle may pursue arbitration against Amazon in the months ahead if his attorney can’t resolve the issue with Amazon.“I love Amazon, because they offered me the opportunity to publish for a living,” says Earle. “Without them, I wouldn’t have been able to write. But what other choice do I have? It seems like they’re banning my books.”Michael-Scott Earle has written over 45 novels, which have sold over 300,000 copies to date.MoreAnother self-published author, whose works were removed from the Kindle Store this summer, spoke to Yahoo Finance under the condition of anonymity and expressed similar ambivalence: gratitude to Amazon for the ability to jumpstart their career as an independent author but frustration and anguish over playing by Amazon’s rules and still getting dinged.“It may not be Amazon’s intention to do that — it could simply be the result of an imperfect system that can’t properly differentiate between high volumes of legitimate sales and fake, bot-generated sales, for example — but the fact remains that to become a successful self-published author on Amazon is to put yourself at higher risk of having your income obliterated overnight through no fault of your own and without any explanation,” explains the author, who also says he did not receive a detailed explanation of their alleged wrongdoing. “I now feel that even though Amazon may be a decent platform for a hobbyist, it has shown itself to be unreliable, unfair, and arbitrary for people who are serious about self-publishing.”For now, the author plans on taking a “much needed” break from publishing.“Since Amazon is the biggest online book retailer there is, publishing exclusively on non-Amazon storefronts may not be a sustainable plan,” the author adds. Cipriano, who says he was once approached by a major publisher, now faces another reality. Even if he wanted a future book published through a traditional publishing house, the possibility would be unlikely, Cipriano argues.   “Why would a company want to work with a writer like me knowing Amazon doesn’t want me?” he explains. In the eyes of Amazon and some of their hard-won fans, Cipriano, Earle and authors like them are now viewed as tainted goods — whether they gamed Amazon’s publishing platform or not. —JP Mangalindan is the Chief Tech Correspondent for Yahoo Finance covering the intersection of tech and business. Email story tips and musings to jpm@oath.com. Follow him on Twitter or Facebook.More from JP:Pandora CEO: ‘We’re in the early innings of turning things around’ Facebook woes ‘deeper than a 1-day sell-off’Facebook user number disappoint and revenue guidance disappoint, stock collapsesReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksWalmart Wants to Take On Amazon in Digital AdvertisingMotley FoolWill Amazon (AMZN) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?ZacksZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo Finance1 Big Reason Why Disney Stock Is Just Getting StartedMotley FoolSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceCoachella Weekend 2: What to Watch ForVarietyWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloomberg'American Ninja Warrior Junior': Get an exclusive sneak peek at the semi-finals!AOL.com

The ACLU and a coalition of civil rights groups are calling on Amazon chief Jeff Bezos to stop offering Rekognition facial detection system to government customers after learning that the company is actively helping law enforcement implement the potentially invasive technology. Police in multiple regions have partnered with Amazon on surveillance projects, including an Orlando proof-of-concept that lets Amazon search for "people of interest" through city cameras as well a Washington County, Oregon initiative that lets officers scan people to see if they turn up in a mugshot database.The ACLU also learned that Amazon provided Washington County a roadmap under a non-disclosure agreement, and offered to link the county to other government customers interested in Rekognition, such as a body camera manufacturer. That's particularly problematic when facial recognition on body cameras is illegal in Oregon. Amazon deleted mentions of body cams from its site after the ACLU raised the issue.The concern, as you might guess, is that law enforcement and governments could easily use this for all the wrong reasons. Rekognition is powerful enough to track faces in crowded scenes, and could theoretically be used to locate activists and dissidents. New York police, for instance, have already been caught filming protesters as an intimidation tactic -- Rekognition could automate that process by flagging people who routinely show up at protests, no matter how innocent they are. The ACLU also warns of immigration officials abusing this to track newcomers (legal and otherwise), while cities could "routinely" surveil residents regardless of their crimes.In a statement, Amazon didn't directly address the civil rights complaints. It said that it would "suspend" access to Amazon Web Services-based features like Rekognition if a customer "abused" them, and pointed to positive uses such as finding lost children or identifying guests at the recent royal wedding in the UK.It's not certain if Amazon will formally address the objections. However, the outcry highlights some of the problems with the adoption of this surveillance technology: companies are shopping it around to governments and police with no real public input, and little consideration for privacy violations and other abuses. The ACLU and other organizations are clearly concerned that tech giants like Amazon focus on profit while neglecting the social impact of their products.ACLU, AmazonThis article originally appeared on Engadget.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksWalmart Wants to Take On Amazon in Digital AdvertisingMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolState defends South Dakota pipeline protest legislationAssociated PressSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergIn Ukrainian candidate's hometown, a cry for changeAssociated Press'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo Finance3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceInvesting in General Electric Is All About These 3 Key ThingsMotley Fool

Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote and Echo Dot were the best-selling devices.This year Prime Day, Amazon's summer marketing event, started on July 16 and lasted 36 hours.The technical glitches lasted for at least two hours and was likely exacerbated by excessive demand and traffic volume, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Mahaney said.The retailer likely got between $1.5 billion and $2 billion in revenue from Prime Day and gross merchandise value topped $3.5 billion, Mahaney said.Amazon said it sold over a million smart home devices in the United States.The company did not provide total sales figures for the event, which was open only to members of its Prime subscription service across 17 countries, up from 13 last year.(Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

That notion doesn't seem to fit with Italian soccer giants Napoli, however, as the club has just become the first team in the world to launch its own "brandstore" on Amazon's sprawling marketplace.Instead of choosing to make its new jersey available on just the club website and its own stores, Napoli created a dedicated portal on the Amazon website, allowing fans to grab not only a replica kit but also a wide array of other official apparel. Right now, it's available on Amazon's UK, Italian, German, French and Spanish websites, with the aim to bring it to the US and Canada in the "near future."Amazon's entry into sports clothing isn't all that surprising. The company recently confirmed it had won streaming rights to the English Premier League, providing Prime subscribers with access to 20 matches per season. Customers can also stream ATP Tennis, while perusing a selection of rackets, balls and suitable attire.Despite pushback from major brands, the company has forged ahead with its own in-house clothing lines, allowing customers to throw a pair of jeans in their online basket, alongside some toilet paper and a streaming stick.Napoli BrandstoreThis article originally appeared on Engadget.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadgetAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetTesla's board is about to get a lot smallerTechCrunch

Still, it was the first time Amazon had reached the  milestone,  and was a long way from the company's 52-week low of $682.12.According to FactSet, just 14 other U.S. stocks trade above $1,000 per share, and the only other tech company in the club is Priceline Group, currently trading around $1,865. Of note: Amazon is more than four times more valuable than those 14 other companies combined.Amazon has split three times since its IPO in 1997. In 1998, it issued a 2-for-1 split. In January 1999, it issued a 3-for-1 split and in September 1999, it split 2-for-1. When Amazon hit $1,000, it's technically the equivalent of a $12,000 share price in today's terms.Amazon topped estimates in late April when it posted revenue of $35.7 billion and  an earnings  per share of $1.48, sending the stock on its upward trend. Amazon said sales increased 23 percent during the quarter and its Amazon Web Services business sales increased 42 percent, showing increased demand for its cloud services business.Alphabet (GOOGL) isn't too far behind; shares of its Class A stock are trading above $995.-- CNBC's Peter  Shacknow  contributed to this reportWATCH:An inside look at how Amazon Prime Now delivers food and household items in less than two hoursMore From CNBC Andreessen says we're wrong about the robots, just like we've always beenSteve Ballmer: We took too long to get into hardware when I was at MicrosoftNew York Times executive editor Dean Baquet: Tweets can be journalisticReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

It is unclear how choosing Toronto might affect worsening trade relations between Ottawa and Washington. Other bidders include Washington and two surrounding communities: Montgomery County, Maryland and Northern Virginia."The international politics is for Amazon to deal with," said Toby Lennox, CEO of Toronto Global, which submitted the bid for Toronto and surrounding cities with support of provincial and federal governments. "We are just going to put forward our best offer possible."Canadian federal officials declined to discuss what steps the government might take to campaign on behalf of Toronto or comment on how that might affect relations between Canada and the United States."Canada is a beacon of stability, reliability and openness," Economic Minister Navdeep Bains said in an emailed statement. "We offer a low-risk, business-friendly environment with the lowest business taxes and costs in the G7."Amazon is already expanding in one major Canadian city. In November unveiled plans to open a second corporate office in Vancouver, doubling staff to 2,000 by early 2020.The company disclosed that it was considering boosting investment in Canada just a day after Apple's said it would boost investment in the United States. The iPhone maker promised to open a new U.S. campus, hire 20,000 people and spend $30 billion in a five-year U.S. investment plan.The search for a second North American headquarters after Seattle set off a frenzied competition, with some 238 initial submitting applications, offering incentives including big tax breaks.Toronto's bid shied away from promising tax breaks, while New Jersey offered $7 billion in financial incentives for Amazon to choose Newark. Atlanta's suburb of Stonecrest offered 345 acres of industrial land to create a new city called Amazon, making Bezos mayor for life.Here is the full list of candidates:AtlantaAustin, TexasBostonChicagoColumbus, OhioDallasDenverIndianapolisLos AngelesMiamiMontgomery County, MarylandNashville, TennesseeNewarkNew York CityNorthern VirginiaPhiladelphiaPittsburghRaleigh, North CarolinaTorontoWashington(This version of the story has been refiled to fix typo in first paragraph)(Reporting by Alastair Sharp in Toronto; Additional reporting by Supantha Mukherjee and Shariq Khan in Bengalaru, Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco; Editing by Nick Zieminski and Jim Finkle)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextState defends South Dakota pipeline protest legislationAssociated PressFoxconn says it remains committed to Wisconsin investment projectReutersButina Shouldn't Serve Any More Time in Prison, Her Lawyers SayBloombergWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolWhy the Infamous Trump Tower Meeting Didn't Take Down TrumpFortuneZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

(Bess Adler/Bloomberg via Getty Images)MoreAmazon (AMZN), the second-largest private-sector employer in the U.S., plans on hiring fewer workers for the holidays this year. On Wednesday, the e-commerce giant announced its plan to hire 100,000 workers for the coming holiday season, a 16.7% drop from last year, when its hiring target was 120,000. Amazon has been announcing its holiday season hiring plans annually since 2012. This is the first year that it has lowered its hiring goals. Amazon will hire fewer people for the holiday season this year. (Krystal Hu/Yahoo Finance)MoreThe deceleration comes at a tough time for companies seeking seasonal workers — the labor market is very tight. In September, the unemployment rate fell to 3.7% — a 48-year low. Amazon said the main reason for fewer job openings this holiday season is that most of its employees are full-time. “Since the last holiday season, we’ve focused on more ongoing full-time hiring in our fulfillment centers and other facilities,” an Amazon spokesperson told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday. The Seattle-based retail behemoth has been on a hiring spree as its valuation ballooned to nearly $1 trillion. Amazon said it created over 130,000 new full-time jobs last year. Today, it employs 250,000 full-time employees in fulfillment centers across the country. Amazon is also converting more temporary workers to full-time employees through programs like Career Choice.Even in the tight labor market, the 100,000 openings this year are likely to be filled. Earlier this month, Amazon received more than 70,000 applications within 48 hours of its announcement that it will raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour.Andy Challenger, vice president at outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, doesn’t see Amazon’s holiday-season hiring plans as a negative reflection of its business. “There is no indication it’s because their business has less demand,” Challenger told Yahoo Finance. “All the major retailers are expecting a really big holiday season.”Amazon’s slowdown comes as other major retailers and shipping companies ramp up their hiring plans this year. According to a tally of 31 companies released Wednesday by Challenger, Gray & Christmas, holiday hiring is expected to hit a record high with 704,000 jobs available this year.Krystal Hu covers e-commerce for Yahoo Finance.

A decision could come as early as this week.The Seattle, Washington-based company first announced its HQ2 project in September 2017. The company said it expected to invest over $5 billion in construction and create as many as 50,000 high-paying jobs for the second headquarters.“It will be a full equal to our current campus in Seattle,” the company said in a previous statement. Last year’s HQ2 announcement sparked a competition among more than 200 cities vying to win over the online behemoth. Many cities took up a charm offense for the high-stakes bid, with Tucson, Arizona sending Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos a 21-foot-tall cactus and other communities including Newark, New Jersey and Montgomery County, Maryland offering major tax breaks for the corporation.Amazon narrowed the options down to 20 finalists earlier this year. The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday that the company was in late-stage talks with several communities including Crystal City in Virginia, Dallas, and New York City.An Amazon spokesperson declined to comment about the company’s plans.In this Sept. 13, 2018, file photo Jeff Bezos, Amazon founder and CEO, speaks at The Economic Club of Washington’s Milestone Celebration in Washington.(AP Photo/Cliff Owen, File)More—Emily McCormick is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. Follow her on Twitter: @emily_mcckRead more from Emily:Netflix user growth beats expectations, shares spike Now is a ‘once-in-a-lifetime chance’ to invest in US pot companies, investor says There are ‘4 headwinds’ facing markets rights nowArk Invest CEO: Tesla ‘is a replay of Apple’ China’s slowing economy could be a problem for Apple   ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolAfter just one day of trading, Zoom Video is the most highly valued tech stock by this metricMarketWatchComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

The first stock split came almost immediately after Amazon shares hit the $100 per-share mark. The pace of gains accelerated in late 1998 and early 1999, and that prompted a more aggressive 3-for-1 split to knock down a stock price that had climbed above $150.

Apple introduced the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max in late September. Previously, Amazon sold only older model iPhones.“Amazon is constantly working to enhance the customer experience, and one of the ways we do this is by increasing selection of the products we know customers want,” the Seattle-based company said in a statement. “We look forward to expanding our assortment of Apple and Beats products globally.”IPhone unit sales barely increased in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, Apple reported earlier this month, even though the new flagship devices came out in the period. The smartphone remains the Cupertino, California-based company’s most important device, generating about 60 percent of quarterly sales and tying customers to other services such as Apple’s music and video streaming.The two tech giants have clashed in the past.Amazon in 2015 stopped selling the Apple TV media-streaming device that wasn’t easily compatible with the e-commerce giant’s video service, an example of Amazon using its clout as the world’s biggest online retailer to promote products that helped push its own streaming content.In 2016, Apple filed a lawsuit against Amazon alleging that the online retailer was selling counterfeit Apple products on its web store.Amazon won’t be selling Apple’s HomePod, the iPhone maker’s competitor to Amazon’s popular Echo brand of home wireless speakers.To contact the reporters on this story: Mark Gurman in San Francisco at mgurman1@bloomberg.net;Spencer Soper in Seattle at ssoper@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net, Andrew Pollack, Alistair BarrFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2018 Bloomberg L.P.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextFoxconn says it remains committed to Wisconsin investment projectReutersAt $1 Trillion, Apple is Bigger Than These ThingsInvestopediaWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadgetAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceTesla earnings: The big question is how big is the quarterly lossMarketWatchWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergNewsmaker: Diversity, inclusion will drive — or limit — success, Cerner exec saysAmerican City Business Journals

Walmart-owned Jet.com, Click & Collect and Instacart are now solid competitors in the online grocery wars.According to the survey, while online grocery shopping has gained significant momentum, conventional grocery shopping still remains the most frequent grocery channel. Walmart (WMT) Supercenters came in second, and clubs/warehouses such as Costco (COST) and Sam’s Club took the third spot.Primary grocery shopping channel (RBC Capital Markets Proprietary Survey)MoreWhen survey respondents were asked what the primary driver was for grocery shopping in general, price came in at the top with 39% saying that it was the leading decision driver. While location was the second most important driver, the number decreased from 31% in 2017 to 26% in 2018. RBC attributed the decline in the importance of location to the growing online options being offered.Leading reason for choosing primary grocery store (RBC Capital Markets Proprietary Survey)MoreThirty-six percent of respondents said they purchased groceries online in 2018, and 28% said that they purchased groceries online through Amazon. Last year 74% of online grocery shoppers turned to Amazon, but that number took a plunge in 2018 to only 38% as Jet.com and Instacart stole some of the market share.A shifting marketplace for the top online grocery shopping sites (RBC Capital Markets)MoreSatisfaction was an important indicator that the online grocery space has more room to grow. The survey concluded that 79% of respondents that purchased groceries online planned on continuing to do so.RBC concluded that if Amazon wants to hold onto the top spot, getting customers to keep coming back to its online grocery shopping platform remains critical. “The goal, particularly for Amazon, is to create habitual shoppers in their ecosystem.”“2018 saw an acceleration in online grocery shopping adoption. Online grocery pulled off a rare retail feat: increasing shopper frequency and basket size. At the same time, perceived quality is increasing and repeat and expected trial scores improved. A large contributor to this has been availability of Click & Collect and Instacart. Amazon is still growing as the share leader, but it appears others have gained share,” RBC said.Heidi Chung is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Long time market cap king Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) ceded the crown to long time runner up Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) after announcing weak third quarter numbers. Then, Microsoft stock started to drop. Meanwhile, the third horse in this race, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), started to regain lost ground. Amazon stock became number one before too long.Those trends persisted in early 2019. Now, AMZN has officially taken the market cap crown. That marks the second market cap crown exchange in roughly just as many months.The buck stops here. There will be no more market cap exchanges in the foreseeable future. Amazon stock is the ideal combination of big, innovative, disruptive, and rapidly growing which warrant it wearing the market cap crown.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  10 Stocks You Can Set and Forget (Even In This Market)  Microsoft is just big and innovative. There isn’t enough disruption or growth there. Apple is just big. Innovation, disruption, and growth are all lacking. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) is big and innovative. But, growth and disruption lag Amazon.There also isn’t any other contestant. The next largest company after the aforementioned Big Four is Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) at under $500 billion.In other words, Amazon stock has taken the market cap crown, and it’s not giving it up any time soon.Why Amazon Deserves the Market Cap CrownIf you were to talk about the largest publicly traded companies with individuals who don’t follow the stock market, the Big Four of Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Google would make sense to pretty much everyone. These are all companies that touch consumers and enterprises on a daily basis and which have widely recognized and valuable brands.But, Amazon stands out from the pack in terms of innovation, growth, and expansion.When you think of Apple, you think of the iPhone and other legacy hardware products. Sure, there’s something to be said for the Apple Watch. But, it’s no iPhone 2.0.For Microsoft, you think about all the cloud offerings, and while those are growing nicely, the company really isn’t expanding dramatically beyond its core cloud business.For Google, you have a company that represents the backbone of the internet and has a rapidly growing cloud business. But, until the self driving business gets off the ground, this company, too, isn’t the gold standard for growth or expansion.Now, let’s talk Amazon. We all know Amazon for its huge and still rapidly growing e-commerce business. We also all know Amazon for its market-leading cloud business. But, that’s just the tip of the iceberg for this company.Amazon is rapidly developing an offline retail business, which projects to go from essentially zero stores two years ago, to 500 Whole Foods locations and 3,000 Amazon Go convenience store locations by 2021.The company is also rapidly building out a digital advertising business, that has gone from hardly being on the scene a few years ago, to a $10 billion annualized revenue business today.There is also the nascent but promising logistics and pharmaceutical businesses, both of which represent multi-billion dollar opportunities.Overall, Amazon’s innovation, growth, and expansion are simply unparalleled. That isn’t a knock against Apple, Microsoft, or Google. Those are all great tech companies with stocks that are long term winners. But, it’s simply to say that no one matches Amazon when it comes to combining size with growth drivers.Because of that, Amazon stock rightly deserves the market cap crown.The Case for $2 TrillionGiven the company’s multi-faceted and long-running growth drivers, there is a case for Amazon stock to not only regain its $1 trillion valuation, but eventually hit a $2 trillion valuation in the long term.The math is pretty simple. You can see it here. But, the brief synopsis for where Amazon’s businesses could be by 2025 are as follows:Ecommerce: $600 billion-plus revenues, 5% operating margin, $30 billion-plus operating profitsCloud: $110 billion revenues, 35% operating margin, ~$40 operating profitsAdvertising: $50 billion revenues, 35% operating margin, ~$20 billion operating profitsAdding it all up, Amazon’s potential operating profit opportunity by 2025 sums to nearly $90 billion. Taking out 10% for taxes, that’s about $80 billion in net profits. A big-growth 25X multiple on that to account for growth potential in pharma and logistics implies a 2025 valuation of $2 trillion for Amazon stock.Story continuesBottom Line on Amazon StockIt’s fair to say that Apple is in the later innings of its growth narrative. Microsoft and Google are both in the middle innings. Amazon is still in the early innings.As such, now that AMZN has taken the market cap crown, it won’t give it up anytime soon.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long AAPL, AMZN, and GOOG. More From InvestorPlace  2 Toxic Pot Stocks You Should Avoid    7 Retail Stocks to Buy for Winning the Online Battle    The 7 Best Stocks in the Entrepreneur Index    7 5G Stocks to Buy as the Race for Spectrum Tightens   Compare Brokers The post Amazon Stock Has Taken the Market Cap Crown, and It Isn’t Giving It Back appeared first on InvestorPlace.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextFoxconn says it remains committed to Wisconsin investment projectReutersAt $1 Trillion, Apple is Bigger Than These ThingsInvestopediaWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolDocuments confirm what Microsoft is building in GoodyearAmerican City Business JournalsComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

Such moves lend credence to the disruptive nature of Amazon. But in other cases, the disruption could be seen a million miles away. That’s the case for the latest rumor centering on an Amazon streaming video game service.According to inside sources, Amazon is developing a platform to stream video games over the internet. This decision pits the company directly against Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), which is working hard to launch a similar service. The e-commerce giant is also going up against video-game powerhouses Sony (NYSE:SNE) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).The news couldn’t come soon enough. Despite its dominant presence, the markets haven’t been kind to Amazon stock. Sure, AMZN did return 28% for its shareholders last year, which is a deeply impressive haul considering the circumstances. But since the end of August, shares are down nearly 18%. Plus, the choppiness over the past three months isn’t helping matters.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsIn theory, a groundbreaking reveal like Amazon’s streaming games service should bolster the case for the company. In the nearer-term, I can see Amazon stock tick a little higher. But over the long run, the forecast is a little hazy.  7 Stocks at Risk of the Global Smartphone Slowdown  Let’s take a look at both sides of the issue, beginning with the positives:Amazon Stock Has a New WeaponThe appeal for Amazon stock doesn’t just rely on the underlying company’s disruptive strategies. In many cases, it creates new markets and subsequently dominates them. A prime example is their smart speakers. While Alphabet is catching up, Amazon owns the greatest market share by a country mile. More importantly, rival Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has no answer.Considering this track record, I can appreciate the optimism for Amazon’s upcoming streaming games service. For starters, it brings a new revenue stream for the company that previously didn’t exist. Moreover, as its Prime media-content platform has demonstrated, Jeff Bezos & Co. can compete with anyone, even well-established players. That should make the management teams at Sony and Microsoft uncomfortable.Adding to that point, Amazon could possibly put physical gaming consoles on the endangered-species list. Rather than producing its own console, an Amazon streaming service would store the energy-intensive hardware in-house. This allows the tech company to transmit data through the internet.Two advantages readily stand out. First, such a mechanism will entirely forego a physical console. This saves space and cost for the gamer. Second, streaming allows consumers to enjoy graphically intense games on smaller devices like smartphones or tablets. If that’s the case, Sony and Microsoft are futilely spinning their wheels developing their next-generation consoles.Amazon Streaming Service Is Not Practically FeasibleOn a surface level, the bullish argument for video game streaming as a catalyst for Amazon stock is extremely convincing. Apparently, it’s a no-brainer. Considering the rapid proliferation of gaming culture, the e-commerce giant has another guaranteed money-maker on its hands.But does it really? While I generally have a positive view on AMZN stock, I’m not entirely convinced that Amazon’s video game streaming service will get the job done. The venture might even lose money for the vaunted organization.We must consider why consoles exist in the first place. Essentially, they are purpose-driven computers: their entire functionality revolves solely on gaming. Additionally, these devices utilize graphics processor units (GPU) from leading companies like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). GPUs are processors designed to accommodate the intensive data requirements of today’s top video games.Amazon intends to replace this physical platform through streaming. Even with 5G technology, this is an ambitious undertaking.More critically, Amazon’s intended input devices — smartphones, tablets, TV controllers — don’t work well with most modern games. For example, a “Call of Duty” game is tough enough as it is on a traditional console and dedicated controller. I can’t imagine the frustrations involved playing that on my iPhone.Story continuesBottom Line on AMZNIf you’re asking me about my overall opinion on Amazon stock, I maintain my long-term bullishness. AMZN already changed how we shop. Eventually, it will shape how an entire generation lives.But as a gamechanger in gaming? I’m not sure I can buy into that story. Amazon may think it can stream state-of-the-art video games from its data center. But when Sony and Microsoft continue to pound out successor consoles, eventually, the inherent advantages of having a dedicated (and decentralized) platform will outweigh the conveniences of a streaming setup.As long as management keeps expectations in check, and doesn’t go overboard with expenses, this new venture could work. But if they think they can topple the alpha dogs in this sector, they’re in for a rude awakening.As of this writing, Josh Enomoto is long SNE.More From InvestorPlace  2 Toxic Pot Stocks You Should Avoid    10 Stocks You Can Set and Forget (Even In This Market)    10 Virtual Assistants for the Future of Smart Homes    7 5G Stocks to Buy as the Race for Spectrum Tightens   Compare Brokers The post Amazon’s Streamed Gaming Service Is Neat, But It’s Not a Disruption appeared first on InvestorPlace.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextDocuments confirm what Microsoft is building in GoodyearAmerican City Business JournalsWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolTesla earnings: The big question is how big is the quarterly lossMarketWatch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo Finance5 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy in 2019Motley FoolAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceHere's What Hedge Funds Think About NIO Inc.

(Other reports say it’s ten 30-second ads, which would equal five minutes total, which would be fewer than two minutes of ads per hour, since the average game lasts for 3 hours 7 minutes; Amazon will not answer which is correct.) The rest of the ads that you’ll see will be the same as the national spots that appear on cable networks.For the Amazon-only ads, Amazon has sold packages that reportedly cost $2.8 million. It’s unclear exactly how many minutes are included in each package, and Amazon will not share how many separate packages it has sold, but Amazon does say the packages include banner ads elsewhere on Amazon.com, that don’t run during the games.The ability to sell this volume of ads against the games likely accounts for the rise in price tag compared to the $10 million Twitter paid to stream 10 TNF games last season.And Amazon will track sales data after each ad, so that it can tell a brand exactly how many people purchased or looked up its products after seeing its ad. Saurabh Sharma, director of ad platforms at Amazon, uses Gillette as an example. Amazon will be able to tell Gillette how many people bought its razors and blades on Amazon during or immediately after a game stream. “That’s very exciting, and has never been done,” says Sharma. “We’re taking what we already do with digital ads and applying it to the NFL.”So, what can we expect from the Amazon-only ads during the streaming TNF games? You might assume, since some Prime members will watch the game on a computer, phone, or tablet, that some of the ads might be interactive or innovative in some other way.But the likelihood is the ads won’t look any different than the standard 30-second or 60-second spots you see on television.“Unfortunately I don’t think we’re going to see much different… which is a big mistake,” says Brian Cristiano, CEO of ad agency Bold Worldwide. “Maybe someone surprises us, and I’m hopeful that they do, but I think that’s what’s going to happen. What should be happening is, What story can we tell that starts before, during, and after the game, that a brand can own?”Indeed, at a promotional event at its AWS Loft in Manhattan last week, Amazon showed some of the ads that will appear during the first game. Some of the ads are for Amazon itself, and the rest are mostly from brands that are already official NFL sponsors, like Pepsi, Hyundai, and Gillette (owned by P&G). But there was also an ad from Showtime, not an NFL sponsor, for its series “Ray Donovan.”Even if the ads don’t look unique, what matters is the data Amazon will get from them and give to the advertisers. As Cristiano acknowledges (sounding a lot like Amazon exec Sharma), the ability to figure out how many people purchased directly from Amazon after seeing an ad during the Amazon stream “has never been done before.”Which games Amazon is streaming, and how to watchAmazon is showing 10 Thursday Night Football games and a Christmas Day (this year, a Monday) game.

(Other reports say it’s ten 30-second ads, which would equal five minutes total, which would be fewer than two minutes of ads per hour, since the average game lasts for 3 hours 7 minutes; Amazon will not answer which is correct.) The rest of the ads that you’ll see will be the same as the national spots that appear on cable networks.For the Amazon-only ads, Amazon has sold packages that reportedly cost $2.8 million. It’s unclear exactly how many minutes are included in each package, and Amazon will not share how many separate packages it has sold, but Amazon does say the packages include banner ads elsewhere on Amazon.com, that don’t run during the games.The ability to sell this volume of ads against the games likely accounts for the rise in price tag compared to the $10 million Twitter paid to stream 10 TNF games last season.And Amazon will track sales data after each ad, so that it can tell a brand exactly how many people purchased or looked up its products after seeing its ad. Saurabh Sharma, director of ad platforms at Amazon, uses Gillette as an example. Amazon will be able to tell Gillette how many people bought its razors and blades on Amazon during or immediately after a game stream. “That’s very exciting, and has never been done,” says Sharma. “We’re taking what we already do with digital ads and applying it to the NFL.”So, what can we expect from the Amazon-only ads during the streaming TNF games? You might assume, since some Prime members will watch the game on a computer, phone, or tablet, that some of the ads might be interactive or innovative in some other way.But the likelihood is the ads won’t look any different than the standard 30-second or 60-second spots you see on television.“Unfortunately I don’t think we’re going to see much different… which is a big mistake,” says Brian Cristiano, CEO of ad agency Bold Worldwide. “Maybe someone surprises us, and I’m hopeful that they do, but I think that’s what’s going to happen. What should be happening is, What story can we tell that starts before, during, and after the game, that a brand can own?”Indeed, at a promotional event at its AWS Loft in Manhattan last week, Amazon showed some of the ads that will appear during the first game. Some of the ads are for Amazon itself, and the rest are mostly from brands that are already official NFL sponsors, like Pepsi, Hyundai, and Gillette (owned by P&G). But there was also an ad from Showtime, not an NFL sponsor, for its series “Ray Donovan.”Even if the ads don’t look unique, what matters is the data Amazon will get from them and give to the advertisers. As Cristiano acknowledges (sounding a lot like Amazon exec Sharma), the ability to figure out how many people purchased directly from Amazon after seeing an ad during the Amazon stream “has never been done before.”Which games Amazon is streaming, and how to watchAmazon is showing 10 Thursday Night Football games and a Christmas Day (this year, a Monday) game. On television, some of those games are on CBS, some on NBC, and some on the NFL Network.The 11 games are as follows: Bears at Packers (Sept. 28); Patriots at Buccaneers (Oct. 5); Eagles at Panthers (Oct. 12); Chiefs at Raiders (Oct. 19); Dolphins at Ravens (Oct. 26); Seahawks at Cardinals (Nov. 9); Titans at Steelers (Nov. 16); Redskins at Cowboys (Nov. 30); Saints at Falcons (Dec. 7); Broncos at Colts (Dec. 14); Steelers at Texans (Dec. 25). (A wall at Amazon’s AWS Loft in SoHo, Manhattan, shows all 11 games.)A wall at Amazon’s AWS Loft in Manhattan showing its streaming NFL games.

Square had previously been bid up in anticipation of Reddit’s acceptance. And, another tech darling is taking a hit: Nvidia (NVDA). Investors are still thinking about the chipmaker’s decision to temporarily suspend its self-driving car program, which it announced yesterday. Also lower were shares of Red Hat (RHT) — the software name taking it on the chin on Wednesday after a post-earnings rally on Tuesday. With Wednesday’s losses, the stock has given up more than all of its gains from the earnings move.Stocks in the green include Lululemon Athletica (LULU), shares of which soared today after the company reported earnings after the bell yesterday that beat expectations. Online sales were a bright spot for the company last quarter. Shares of RH (RH), formerly known as Restoration Hardware, shot up today. The company reported earnings late yesterday that were better than expected and also announced expansion plans. Finally, Equifax (EFX) is also having a good day, as shares of the credit reporting agency are up on the day after Mark Begor was named as new CEO. Equifax still trying to recover from fallout surrounding a massive data breach last year. ReblogShareTweetShareWhat to Read NextNatural Gas Price Prediction – Prices Tumble as Supplies IncreaseFX EmpireState defends South Dakota pipeline protest legislationAssociated PressCrude Oil Weekly Price Forecast – Crude oil running into resistanceFX Empire1 Big Reason Why Disney Stock Is Just Getting StartedMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

Grocery store openings declined 29 percent last year as expansion plans cooled and some supermarkets prepared to file for bankruptcy in the year Amazon AMZN acquired Whole Foods, according to a new report from Jones Lang LaSalle.But investments in grocery-anchored shopping centers in 2017 climbed 5.3 percent from 2016, JLL found, making it one of the only retail sectors to see deal growth in a year of low transaction volume."Traditionally, retail has such a reputation right now of everybody being afraid of disruption by e-commerce," James Cook, JLL's director of retail research in the Americas, told CNBC. "Grocery is considered to have a moat around it to defend against e-commerce, and because of that, these [assets] are seen by retail property investors as a safe investment."To be sure, these investors aren't interested in all grocery-anchored centers, Cook cautioned. Just this month, for example, Williamsville, New York-based Tops Friendly Markets filed for bankruptcy, and reports surfaced that Winn-Dixie owner Bi-Lo was preparing to do so, too. There's a glut of shopping centers built around weak tenants that risk going dark, just like many malls anchored by weak department stores."In many U.S. markets you might have six or more grocery chains," Cook said. "In most cases, investors are only interested in the top one or two. Those are the most defensible."The short list for those top grocery contenders include Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Florida-based Publix, Wegmans and some of Kroger KR 's brands. And for the most part today, these chains are opening few new stores. Instead, they are investing in their existing locations to fulfill online orders and ease the delivery of groceries to homes.The strongest U.S. markets for grocery stores, where the most businesses continue to expand, include California, Virginia and North Carolina, according to JLL. Texas, although it's still a top market for grocers, added fewer stores in 2017 than in 2016. The growth in that state has stemmed from a spurt of new residential development. Where there are homes, people need more grocery stores.Source: Jones Lang LaSalle "Retailers die but retail does not," Cook said about the ongoing evolution in the grocery space. "There's just churn as retailers are either disrupted by new business models, or they go out of fashion."Germany-based Lidl was one new player in the U.S. grocery market that everyone had their eyes on in 2017, when it began opening stores across the Southeast. Shortly thereafter, Lidl halted several of its construction projects, local news outlets have reported, as the company admitted it might have started expanding too quickly. Lidl opened nearly 50 stores across the U.S. last year.In turn, Lidl offered other supermarket chains a warning sign: Many markets weren't ready for another grocer in town. The German company also had to fix a few snags internally. It's still working out its private-label items, its layout of U.S. stores and its marketing strategy for American consumers.The most successful grocers today have well-known private labels, fresh food at affordable prices and digital platforms that allow for shopping online, Cook said."We've got two types of classes in grocery right now: One is about offering the best goods at the lowest prices — it's a price play that's targeted at the families in America shopping on a budget, so someone like Aldi is a part of that," he said. "Another avenue of success is offering a great shopping experience to shoppers who aren't as price sensitive — those leaders are Whole foods and Wegmans."5 trends to watch for in grocery retail in 2018, according to JLL:  Smaller grocery stores. (Companies including Whole Foods and Publix are testing new store formats.) Technology implemented in stores that gives retailers more data about their shoppers Blockchain technology, specifically for food safety purposes. (Walmart WMT has been a leader thus far here.) More mergers and acquisitions within the industry (i.e. Albertsons buying Rite Aid RAD ). Rapid checkout. (Walmart, Kroger and Amazon are spearheading their scan-and-go options.)

The shot of the CEO, which went viral and inspired a stream of breathless coverage like GQ Magazine’s “Jeff Bezos’ big-ass biceps will shame you into working out this weekend,” served as a stark symbol of how far he and Amazon have come since Bezos jump-started Amazon in his Seattle garage to peddle books online. Amazon (AMZN) still sells books, of course. But it does so much more now, from cloud-based services to food delivery, much to the delight of more than 300 million shoppers spoiled by its competitive pricing and fast shipping.While Amazon continues to account for a relatively small share of retail overall, the company continuously made business headlines.The e-commerce giant’s broad reach is also drawing the attention of lawmakers like Senator Cory Booker, who argue that big tech companies like Amazon and Google have simply become too big and should face greater antitrust scrutiny.Amazon has had quite the year, which is why Yahoo Finance’s editors selected the Seattle tech giant as 2017’s Company of the Year. Credit: David Foster/Yahoo FinanceMoreIndeed, Amazon’s massive size and influence is part of the reason why, when the time came once again for Yahoo Finance’s editors to select a Company of the Year, the answer was clear. Amazon — which has innovated, moved markets, and pushed boundaries — joins past winners such as Facebook (FB), Disney (DIS), and Nvidia (NVDA). While it might seem like an obvious choice for Company of the Year, there’s no denying that 2017 was huge for Amazon.To be sure, Amazon wasn’t the market’s strongest performer in 2017. Still, Amazon shares soared nearly 60% in 2017 — following moves like the $13.7 billion Whole Foods deal, strong quarterly earnings, Amazon Web Services’ $18 billion annual revenue run rate, and reports that Amazon could break into pharmaceuticals. At the same time, Alexa became the undisputed market leader for voice assistants.But while Amazon’s achievements up-to-date are praiseworthy (see our timeline for Amazon’s path to domination in 2017), some of the company’s most exciting offerings appear yet to come. ‘We’re not focused on conquering’“Our focus is pioneering,” Amazon Worldwide Consumer CEO Jeff Wilke told Yahoo Finance recently during an interview at the company’s Santa Monica, California, offices. “We’re not focused on conquering. That’s a business model some people could choose, but we’re trying to invent — not disrupt. If customers like what we’ve invented, they’re going to choose our invention sometimes, and that may lead to disruption for others, but we expect it to accelerate invention and there will be more opportunity for others to build great models, too.”Despite Wilke’s assertions, disrupt is what Amazon did, so much so that Amazon was cited over 2,000 times on corporate earnings calls this year. One of the year’s largest deals — CVS’s (CVS) $69 billion acquisition of health insurer Aetna (AET) — is viewed by many pundits as a preemptive strike should Amazon barrel into pharmaceuticals the way it has into other areas like retail, groceries and food delivery.   “That seems to be the nature in which every business operates now,” RBC Capital Markets analyst George Hill explains, pointing to moves like Target’s (TGT) $550 million acquisition of Shipt, a same-day delivery company, which was announced in December. “Has Amazon led this charge? Absolutely. As Amazon continues to up its game in owning the ‘last mile’, they’re going to force every participant to up their game, as well.”Story continuesAmazon’s obsession with that “last mile” — the final journey of an order from the warehouse to the shopper’s doorstep — has forced virtually every retailer to rethink delivery since the tech giant launched Amazon Prime’s two-day delivery in 2005 and spearheaded an all-out arms race for faster shipping. Before Prime, anyone who wanted their orders quickly would have to pay FedEx or UPS big bucks or just have to wait. Now two-day or same-day shipping is the norm for an estimated 90 million Prime members, or 63% of Amazon customers in the U.S. A “genius” acquisitionOne pundit calls Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods Market, which closed in August, the “second best” acquisition of the decade — second only to Facebook’s acquisition of Instagram in 2012. Source: Francisco Antunes/FlickrMoreThe tech giant’s boldest move this year was also its most surprising. In June, Amazon announced it would acquire Whole Foods for $13.7 billion — its largest acquisition to date. Although it toyed with groceries before — most visibly with an in-house groceries delivery service called Amazon Fresh — the Whole Foods acquisition was by far Amazon’s biggest signal yet that it is serious about expanding its overall presence in brick-and-mortar retail, starting with taking over Whole Foods’ 460-plus stores. Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at at NYU Stern School of Business and author of the book, “The Four: The Hidden DNA of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google” calls Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods the second-best acquisition of the decade — second only to Facebook’s (FB) $1 billion acquisition of the popular photo-sharing app Instagram in 2012. “For Amazon, buying Whole Foods was genius,” Galloway contends. “It gives them access to the wealthiest refrigerators in the world, one of the best and largest consumer brands in the world and lets them pick up 500 new warehouses all in one purchase.”The week Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods Market closed, Whole Foods started selling Amazon Echo speakers in-store.MoreThe effect on competition was immediate. That same Thursday in August when Amazon announced it would cut prices, Kroger (KR), Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM), SuperValu (SVU), Costco (COST), Target, and Wal-Mart Stores (WMT) stock all took a nosedive.Whole Foods, meanwhile, saw new life after announcing its sixth consecutive quarter of falling same-store sales early this year. Foot traffic to its stores jumped 17% year-over-year during the week Amazon initially cut prices, according to the data analytics firm Thasos Group. Of those new shoppers, 24% came from Walmart, 16% came from Kroger, and 15% crossed over from Costco. “The purpose of the acquisition was very simple: we’re fans,” explained Wilke, who added that the grocery chain’s healthier selection helped change the way he consumed food soon after he relocated from Pittsburgh 18 years ago to work with Bezos at Amazon. “I think we had a great opportunity to partner with a terrific company and a great brand. They essentially invented the natural and organic category.”  Amazon’s other home runAmazon may not have invented the voice assistant, but that doesn’t seem to matter to the tens of millions of shoppers who now own an Echo speaker. According to estimates from digital research firm eMarketer, the Echo cornered roughly 70% of the U.S. market for voice-controlled speakers this year. You knew Alexa had entered the pop culture lexicon when “Saturday Night Live” aired its geriatric-themed spoof in May. Unlike Apple (AAPL), which keeps Siri under lock and key, Amazon early on opened up access to Alexa so outside companies and developers could develop functions for it, even integrate it into their own devices. It was a risky business move, to be sure, but one that turned out to be a masterstroke. At last January’s Consumer Electronics Show, hundreds of Alexa-enabled devices from outside parties — fridges, self-driving cars, even baby monitors — lined the convention halls. “We envisioned Alexa and all the products that connect to her to be based mostly in the cloud, and I think that’s the kind of paradigm shift that we’ve seen with this technology as opposed to previous technologies in consumer electronics, because Alexa being up in the cloud allows us to improve her every single day,” Dave Limp, Amazon SVP of devices and services, told Yahoo Finance at Amazon’s Seattle headquarters recently.  “And because developers can extend her through software skills and through hardware partners, you’re seeing her now in refrigerators and cars and baby monitors and cameras.”The hunt for HQ2Although Amazon’s Seattle headquarters is already sprawling, the tech giant plans on opening a second headquarters elsewhere in the U.S. Source: AP Photo/Elaine ThompsonMoreAs Amazon expanded its brick-and-mortar footprint in 2017, it also made headlines by announcing it planned on opening a second headquarters somewhere else in the U.S, dubbed HQ2, with an estimated cost of $5 billion.Soon after, the tech giant received 238 proposals from across North America, several of which got creative in wooing Amazon. Arizona representatives sent Amazon a 21-foot cactus, and a Pittsburgh sandwich chain offered to feed every Amazon employee. But the city of Stonecrest, Georgia, dangled the most outrageous deal of them all in offering to create an entirely new city called “Amazon” where Bezos could serve as mayor “for life.” (Yes, really.) Media reports suggested a number of cities as top contenders, from Austin, Texas to Boston. But Stonecrest, Georgia, may have the edge. In early December, Amazon registered an in-house lobbyist specializing in “clean energy and technology” with the Georgia State Ethics Commission ahead of the state’s legislative session in January. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed on Tuesday to Yahoo Finance that this is not at all related with the search of Amazon’s second headquarters and is part of their ongoing investment efforts across the country through different projects. The spokesperson also pointed out that over the last 5 years, Amazon has invested more than $100 billion in the U.S in fulfillment center infrastructure (they have now 75 fulfillment centers in the U.S.), data centers, wind farms, regional tech hubs, corporate offices and compensation to its teams.For his part, Wilke contends that Amazon is still in the early process of evaluating bids.“We don’t want to over-describe or over-constrain what we’re interested in because there will be trade-offs probably in all of these cities,” he said, “but it needs to have a large enough pull, a large enough workforce where we can attract and retain the kind of people that work at Amazon, including technical folks.”What’s in store for 2018? In the months and years to come, Wilke says, Prime members in particular will reap the benefits of the Whole Foods purchase with more exclusive discounts. For Amazon, Whole Foods also represents a trove of logistical and supply chain data. As the company expands its physical footprint beyond lockers stuffed with shoppers’ orders, physical bookstores and autonomous stores like Amazon Go, the tech giant is looking to better understand aspects of brick-and-mortar like foot traffic, in-stores sales versus online sales, and sales technology — all things Amazon needs to master if it wants to expand its Amazon Go store beyond its employees-only Seattle location. The Amazon employees-only Amazon Go store in Seattle uses a tracking system with sensors and cameras to determine what a customer has bought without anyone ever having to scan an item. Source: AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, FileMoreOne day, regular shoppers in the U.S. will eventually pick up any item they want to buy in-store and simply walk out without ever having to interact with another human being or having to scan their items to purchase them. Amazon naturally wants to be at the forefront of that change.  As for Alexa, Wilke suggests more skills for the popular voice assistant are coming in 2018 focused on letting shoppers do more on Amazon.com simply using their voice.  “It’s early days, but you can imagine that the way we’re communicating right now would be a natural way to communicate when they’re something you want to buy,” Wilke hints.2018 could also prove to be the year in which regulators pay closer attention to Amazon, not to mention other big tech companies like Google and Facebook, as public sentiment with Silicon Valley has soured. Just over the weekend, news emerged that Amazon could face an investigation by UK’s Advertising Standards Authority over complaints that Prime didn’t come through on its promises of “unlimited one-day delivery” with some shoppers. Still, Wilke isn’t concerned about regulators or critics who argue Amazon is too oppressive on competition or needs to be broken up into smaller pieces. In typical Amazon fashion, he’s more concerned about winning over consumers.“I would just direct them to the fact that we have less than 1% of worldwide retail and there are several companies, many companies actually, who are larger than us, even in retail,” Wilke emphasizes. “We’re not at a place where we should worry about that. We should be continuing to take care of customers. We, Amazon, should worry about continuing to take care of customers, invent on their behalf.”He also points to the fact that over 50% of all sales on Amazon.com are sales done by third-party sellers and between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday alone, 140 million products were ordered and fulfilled by third-party sellers. “Our services are being used by third parties to build businesses independently of Amazon,” adds Wilke. “If that continues — and it will — there will be many winners in retail.” The caveat being of course, those winners, are beholden to Amazon for its revenues, whether they like it or not.Source: David Foster/Yahoo FinanceMoreClick here to find out more about Amazon’s culture and here to discover its plans for Alexa.—JP Mangalindan is the Chief Tech Correspondent for Yahoo Finance covering the intersection of tech and business. Email story tips and musings to jpm@oath.com. Follow him on Twitter or Facebook.More from JP:Facebook named the No. 1 place to work in the USFacebook targets 6- to 12-year-old demographic with Messenger Kids Facebook publishes ad rules in wake of Russias revelations ‘Scandal’ creator Shonda Rhimes: Why I left ABC for NetflixIntuit CEO: Old-school accountants will be ‘struggling in 5 years’ because of A.I.How Amazon quickly trains 120,000 employees for the holidaysPayPal CEO: ‘It’s expensive to be poor’Why the Russia ad scandal could actually be a win for FacebookFacebook diversity chief ‘frustrated’ over progressMelinda Gates on ‘the hardest thing’ she’s ever had to doRBC analyst: Only 2 scenarios would spur investors to flee FacebookMeet the man behind Facebook Messenger’s growth spurtLEAKED AUDIO: New Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi reveals 3 things employees should know about himReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatchWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopedia3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Watch in AprilMotley FoolWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

At last January’s Consumer Electronics Show, hundreds of Alexa-enabled devices from outside parties — fridges, self-driving cars, even baby monitors — lined the convention halls. “We envisioned Alexa and all the products that connect to her to be based mostly in the cloud, and I think that’s the kind of paradigm shift that we’ve seen with this technology as opposed to previous technologies in consumer electronics, because Alexa being up in the cloud allows us to improve her every single day,” Dave Limp, Amazon SVP of devices and services, told Yahoo Finance at Amazon’s Seattle headquarters recently.  “And because developers can extend her through software skills and through hardware partners, you’re seeing her now in refrigerators and cars and baby monitors and cameras.”The hunt for HQ2Although Amazon’s Seattle headquarters is already sprawling, the tech giant plans on opening a second headquarters elsewhere in the U.S. Source: AP Photo/Elaine ThompsonMoreAs Amazon expanded its brick-and-mortar footprint in 2017, it also made headlines by announcing it planned on opening a second headquarters somewhere else in the U.S, dubbed HQ2, with an estimated cost of $5 billion.Soon after, the tech giant received 238 proposals from across North America, several of which got creative in wooing Amazon. Arizona representatives sent Amazon a 21-foot cactus, and a Pittsburgh sandwich chain offered to feed every Amazon employee. But the city of Stonecrest, Georgia, dangled the most outrageous deal of them all in offering to create an entirely new city called “Amazon” where Bezos could serve as mayor “for life.” (Yes, really.) Media reports suggested a number of cities as top contenders, from Austin, Texas to Boston. But Stonecrest, Georgia, may have the edge. In early December, Amazon registered an in-house lobbyist specializing in “clean energy and technology” with the Georgia State Ethics Commission ahead of the state’s legislative session in January. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed on Tuesday to Yahoo Finance that this is not at all related with the search of Amazon’s second headquarters and is part of their ongoing investment efforts across the country through different projects. The spokesperson also pointed out that over the last 5 years, Amazon has invested more than $100 billion in the U.S in fulfillment center infrastructure (they have now 75 fulfillment centers in the U.S.), data centers, wind farms, regional tech hubs, corporate offices and compensation to its teams.For his part, Wilke contends that Amazon is still in the early process of evaluating bids.“We don’t want to over-describe or over-constrain what we’re interested in because there will be trade-offs probably in all of these cities,” he said, “but it needs to have a large enough pull, a large enough workforce where we can attract and retain the kind of people that work at Amazon, including technical folks.”What’s in store for 2018? In the months and years to come, Wilke says, Prime members in particular will reap the benefits of the Whole Foods purchase with more exclusive discounts. For Amazon, Whole Foods also represents a trove of logistical and supply chain data. As the company expands its physical footprint beyond lockers stuffed with shoppers’ orders, physical bookstores and autonomous stores like Amazon Go, the tech giant is looking to better understand aspects of brick-and-mortar like foot traffic, in-stores sales versus online sales, and sales technology — all things Amazon needs to master if it wants to expand its Amazon Go store beyond its employees-only Seattle location. The Amazon employees-only Amazon Go store in Seattle uses a tracking system with sensors and cameras to determine what a customer has bought without anyone ever having to scan an item. Source: AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, FileMoreOne day, regular shoppers in the U.S. will eventually pick up any item they want to buy in-store and simply walk out without ever having to interact with another human being or having to scan their items to purchase them. Amazon naturally wants to be at the forefront of that change.  As for Alexa, Wilke suggests more skills for the popular voice assistant are coming in 2018 focused on letting shoppers do more on Amazon.com simply using their voice.  “It’s early days, but you can imagine that the way we’re communicating right now would be a natural way to communicate when they’re something you want to buy,” Wilke hints.2018 could also prove to be the year in which regulators pay closer attention to Amazon, not to mention other big tech companies like Google and Facebook, as public sentiment with Silicon Valley has soured. Just over the weekend, news emerged that Amazon could face an investigation by UK’s Advertising Standards Authority over complaints that Prime didn’t come through on its promises of “unlimited one-day delivery” with some shoppers. Still, Wilke isn’t concerned about regulators or critics who argue Amazon is too oppressive on competition or needs to be broken up into smaller pieces. In typical Amazon fashion, he’s more concerned about winning over consumers.“I would just direct them to the fact that we have less than 1% of worldwide retail and there are several companies, many companies actually, who are larger than us, even in retail,” Wilke emphasizes. “We’re not at a place where we should worry about that. We should be continuing to take care of customers. We, Amazon, should worry about continuing to take care of customers, invent on their behalf.”He also points to the fact that over 50% of all sales on Amazon.com are sales done by third-party sellers and between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday alone, 140 million products were ordered and fulfilled by third-party sellers. “Our services are being used by third parties to build businesses independently of Amazon,” adds Wilke. “If that continues — and it will — there will be many winners in retail.” The caveat being of course, those winners, are beholden to Amazon for its revenues, whether they like it or not.Source: David Foster/Yahoo FinanceMoreClick here to find out more about Amazon’s culture and here to discover its plans for Alexa.—JP Mangalindan is the Chief Tech Correspondent for Yahoo Finance covering the intersection of tech and business. Email story tips and musings to jpm@oath.com. Follow him on Twitter or Facebook.More from JP:Facebook named the No. 1 place to work in the USFacebook targets 6- to 12-year-old demographic with Messenger Kids Facebook publishes ad rules in wake of Russias revelations ‘Scandal’ creator Shonda Rhimes: Why I left ABC for NetflixIntuit CEO: Old-school accountants will be ‘struggling in 5 years’ because of A.I.How Amazon quickly trains 120,000 employees for the holidaysPayPal CEO: ‘It’s expensive to be poor’Why the Russia ad scandal could actually be a win for FacebookFacebook diversity chief ‘frustrated’ over progressMelinda Gates on ‘the hardest thing’ she’s ever had to doRBC analyst: Only 2 scenarios would spur investors to flee FacebookMeet the man behind Facebook Messenger’s growth spurtLEAKED AUDIO: New Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi reveals 3 things employees should know about himReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatchWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopedia3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Watch in AprilMotley FoolWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

But now it’s saying goodbye to the cheaper and smaller store format.Whole Foods CEO John Mackey told employees the grocery chain will not open new Whole Foods 365 stores anymore, according to an internal email reviewed by Yahoo Finance. The existing 12 stores, the newest of which just opened in Atlanta in December, will remain in business.Mackey said the main reason behind the strategy shift is Whole Foods’ prices. “As we have been consistently lowering prices in our core Whole Foods Market stores over the past year, the price distinction between the two brands has become less relevant,” Mackey wrote on Wednesday. “As the company continues to focus on lowering prices over time, we believe that the price gap will further diminish.”“Learnings and innovations from 365 have been incorporated into Whole Foods Market and the company will continue to innovate and experiment,” a Whole Foods spokesperson said in a statement.Amazon has been rolling out discounts and weekly deals for Prime members who shop at Whole Foods stores. But in August, 40% of more than 2,000 Whole Food shoppers surveyed by Yahoo Finance said they believe the prices of products in stores aren’t really lower.Launched in 2016, 365 stores heavily feature Whole Foods private-label products, including 365 Everyday Value products, to lure budget shoppers who have avoided the premium stores once known as the Whole Paycheck. Following Amazon’s acquisition, those brands have become increasingly available in regular Whole Foods stores, Amazon.com and even Amazon Go stores.The team would concentrate efforts on growing the core Whole Foods Market brand, according to the email. Employees who have been working for 365 will be integrated into other Whole Foods’ regions.Brittain Ladd, CEO of Six-Page Consulting, said the move signals more private-label products could come to Whole Foods stores, a common strategy for grocers to lower prices in a business with thin margins.Amazon’s grocery strategy(David Foster/Yahoo Finance)MoreWhole Foods set high expectations for its 365 stores. It was the premium retailer’s effort to attract cost-conscious millennial shoppers. In May 2017, one month before Amazon announced its $13.7 billion acquisition of the chain, Mackey told investors Whole Foods had 22 365 stores under development in the U.S. and they would be increasing that number.The discontinuation of the 365 stores comes at a time when Whole Foods is planning a national expansion. With support from Amazon, Whole Foods is looking to open more stores in locations with more than 45,000 square feet and eyeing sites that used to host retailers like Sears.Meanwhile, Amazon has expanded its own smaller-format grocery store footprint with Amazon Go. With a cashierless checkout experience, Amazon Go has grown to nine locations in the U.S. this past year.“Whole Foods Market’s leadership independently made this decision and it is unrelated to Amazon Go,” said the grocery’s spokesperson, referring to its pull back of 365 stores.According to Ladd, the move fits into Amazon’s overall grocery strategy. “Why do you need both Whole Foods 365 and Amazon Go, when Amazon Go carries the almost same number of SKUs (Stock Keeping Unit)? It was too confusing to the customers,” he said. “Amazon keeps a strategy where they have larger Whole Foods stores that provide a significant immersion experience of grocery shopping, and Amazon Go be the quick and convenience shop.”Krystal Hu covers technology and trade for Yahoo Finance.

Source: WebSummitMoreAmazon VP of Alexa Al Lindsay has a bold goal for Alexa, the popular voice-controlled personal assistant: one day, Alexa should be capable of holding conversations up to 20 minutes long.  “A lot of what people ask Alexa for today are fairly short interactions,” Lindsay told Yahoo Finance at the annual Web Summit tech conference, held this week in Lisbon, Portugal. “Longer conversations aren’t yet the norm.”Indeed, use any one of the voice-controlled personal assistants currently on the market, such as Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant or Cortana, and you’ll quickly realize Lindsay and his competitors still have a lot more to work to do before five-, 10- or 20-minute conversations are possible. For now, interactions with Alexa are a start-and-stop affair where users instruct it to perform one or two of over 25,000 different tasks: telling you the latest news, calling an Uber or playing the latest Nick Jonas album off Spotify. But what Alexa can’t do, for instance, is book an entire trip to the Bahamas in one go. You can do bits and pieces — book a hotel, check your flight status — but it’s not as intuitive as booking it yourself online yet or talking to an old-school travel agent. That’s still the stuff of Lindsay’s longer-term, unfulfilled dreams: a truly versatile “Star Trek”-like computer that accomplishes virtually anything you throw at it with a simple voice command. “To truly realize that vision, you’ll want a number of things: you’ll want to have it everywhere, be able to talk to it from anywhere, be able for it to do all of the things you would want an intelligent assistant do for you, and ultimately do it in a very conversational way,” Lindsay added.  A long road aheadGetting there will require a lot of work accomplished by the 5,000 or so Amazon employees who now work on Alexa in places as far-flung as Germany and India, as well as outside developers. Perhaps realizing that making Alexa a conversational whiz was a herculean task, Amazon readily shares Alexa’s software development tools with third parties. Last year, Amazon announced the Alexa Prize, a $2.5 million competition for university students who develop “social bots” using Alexa’s technology that can convincingly chat with people about pop culture and news events for up to 20 minutes. This March, Amazon announced the Alexa Fund, a $100 million venture capital fund that gives cash to companies and developers who drum up new “skills” that let Alexa perform new tasks. “If we can actually get to the point where it’s truly conversational and equivalent to speaking to another human, anyone will be able to interact with it effectively,” Lindsay explained. “You won’t have to learn how to use a touchscreen or how to use an app. You just speak to it.” The Amazon executive’s goal of having Alexa become truly ubiquitous could become reality faster than many think. The voice-controlled assistant started simply enough in 2014 when the first Echo speaker launched, but if this year’s CES in January was a good indicator, Alexa could soon be everywhere you want it to be. There were Alexa-compatible smartphones, baby monitors, air purifiers, self-driving cars, even refrigerators. It’s an ambitious effort, though hardly an altruistic one. The more Alexa-enabled devices there are in the world – and Lindsay tells Yahoo Finance there are already “tens of millions” of Alexa-enabled devices now — the more people interact with Alexa. And the more engaging Alexa becomes, the more likely they are to use Amazon’s wide array of services and buy things, whether it’s a new album off Amazon Music or dinnerware from Amazon.com. After all, Amazon has a 76% market share of the home smart speaker market in the U.S., according to Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, and the Seattle tech giant clearly wants to keep it that way. —JP Mangalindan is Chief Tech Correspondent for Yahoo Finance covering the intersection of tech and business.

The company said it was an easy to deploy tool and comes up with no up-front costs to manage it.Amazon said its Amazon Inspector helps customers pay for the assessments that they run and that the first 250 assessments were free for a customer's first 90 days. The online retailer said the scale and the flexibility of the AWS cloud would make it possible for customers to establish and deploy apps and services quicker than before.AWS' Chief Information Security Officer, Stephen Schmidt, commented, "Customers have asked us if we could help them do the same rigorous security assessments on their applications that we do for our AWS services. Amazon Inspector delivers key learnings from our world-class security team as a managed service, so customers benefit from our continuous implementation of best practices and threat intelligence. Companies of all sizes can now perform assessments of their applications in an automated way and proactively remediate vulnerabilities."Shares of the company traded down by 1.28 percent on Tuesday.See more from BenzingaMarkit To Hold Earnings Conference Call On May 10Franklin Street Properties To Hold A Conference Call On April 27LCNB Q1 Profit Rises 4.6%© 2016 Benzinga.com.

It acquired Whole Foods for $13.7 billion in August to help it deliver groceries to shoppers' doorsteps.Amazon's results defied expectations that it would invest nearly all of its earnings into new areas as it has in the past. The world's largest online retailer said net income rose to $256 million, or 52 cents per share in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Analysts on average were expecting 3 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Prime Day, a summer marketing event Amazon has created to replicate the shopping frenzy that is more typical of the winter holiday season, helped boost sales.The event fared better this year internationally than last year, Amazon's Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a call with reporters.Revenue jumped 34 percent to $43.7 billion in the third quarter, including $1.3 billion in sales from the upscale grocer. Analysts had expected $42.1 billion.This was "another strong performance, with top-line growth accelerating in the core retail segment," Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian said.In a first, Amazon broke out sales for its online retail business and for its physical bookstores and Whole Foods locations. Revenue from its online stores jumped 22 percent to $26.4 billion, the fastest growth Amazon has seen in the segment in more than a year.Key to its success has been signing more people up for Amazon Prime, its fast-shipping and video-streaming club, whose members tend to buy more from the company. Revenue from subscription fees such as Prime showed unusually strong growth of 59 percent, to $2.4 billion.And Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's most profitable unit, which handles data and computing for large enterprises, posted a 41.9 percent rise in sales to $4.58 billion, beating the average estimate of $4.52 billion, according to analytics firm FactSet."They are firing on all cylinders. The machine is churning," Benchmark Co analyst Daniel Kurnos said.Amazon expects an operating profit in the current quarter between $300 million and $1.65 billion. Analysts are expecting $930.78 million for this critical holiday sales period, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.STILL BETTING ON HOLLYWOODAmazon shares have a high valuation, with a price-to-earnings ratio more than eight times that of cloud-computing rival Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), for instance.Unlike peers, Amazon runs on razor-thin profit margins because it sinks most of its profit back into its business.In a call with media, CFO Olsavsky listed a dizzying number of investments: warehouses around the world to ship goods faster to shoppers, data centers to handle the computing needs of large enterprises, and a 77 percent uptick in employees last quarter, including Whole Foods workers.The company plans to spend more on video content next year as well, Olsavsky said. Analysts estimate Amazon will have spent $4.5 billion this year.The commitment to content comes after Amazon Studios chief Roy Price resigned last week, and other top studio hands left the company.It is unclear what impact the shakeup may have on Amazon's ability to secure video that competes with Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) for viewers' attention.Amazon Studios came up short at the Primetime Emmy Awards last month, and some have criticized it for not appealing to a broad audience.The company's shares, which closed down 0.05 percent on Thursday, rose about 7.5 percent to $1,046.00 in after-hours trading following the earnings statement. They had gained about 30 percent this year.(Reporting by Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco and Aishwarya Venugopal in Bengaluru; Editing by Peter Henderson and Lisa Shumaker)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaThe Morning After: The Weather Channel got hackedEngadgetTrailers of the Week: 'Child's Play,' 'Hobbs and Shaw,' 'Big Little Lies 2'Rolling StoneWhole Foods Will Sell a Limited-Edition Cheese for The Royal Baby's BirthFood & WineWhere to Stream Movies FreeConsumer ReportsZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceTesla earnings: The big question is how big is the quarterly lossMarketWatchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolBoeing's earnings report brings the 737 Max debacle into focusMarketWatch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceThis High-Yield Dividend Stock Could Richly Reward InvestorsMotley FoolAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceWhat to Expect When Alphabet Reports Later This MonthMotley FoolWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergCan U.S. Steel Revive Sentiments with Its Q1 Earnings Results?Market Realist

Since the Seattle tech giant rolled out the first Alexa-enabled speaker in 2015, the sleeper hit has become the undisputed market leader and in the process, contributed to Amazon’s selection by Yahoo Finance’s editors as 2017’s Company of the Year. (See our timeline for Amazon’s path to domination in the past year.)According to eMarketer, the Echo cornered roughly 70% of the U.S. market for voice-controlled speakers this year, eclipsing competitors like Google Home, Microsoft Cortana and Apple’s Siri, to the point at which “Saturday Night Live” aired a geriatric-themed Echo spoof in May. “We envisioned Alexa and all the products that connect to her to be based mostly in the cloud,” explains Dave Limp, senior vice president of devices and services. Source: Yahoo FinanceMoreOver the next 12 months, Amazon says more skills for the popular voice assistant are coming focused on letting shoppers do more on Amazon.com simply using their voice. That’s good for the tens of millions of Echo owners and Prime users in the world today, but as is frequently the case, also good for Amazon’s bottom line. And, as the Echo becomes more ubiquitous, particularly in business settings, Amazon may be compelled to reassure users that the home assistant isn’t invading their privacy.Amazon says the cloud is the key to Alexa’s successIn September, Amazon unveiled several new Echo speakers, including a more compact Echo and a souped-up Echo Plus. Source: AmazonMoreThe Echo’s success as a voice-controlled speaker is undoubtedly impressive, and the key to America embracing Alexa in their homes was making Alexa cloud-based, contends Dave Limp, Amazon SVP of devices and services. “We envisioned Alexa and all the products that connect to her to be based mostly in the cloud, and I think that’s the kind of paradigm shift that we’ve seen with this technology as opposed to previous technologies in consumer electronics, because Alexa being up in the cloud allows us to improve her every single day,” Limp told Yahoo Finance at Amazon’s Seattle headquarters recently. Limp added: “And because developers can extend her through software skills and through hardware partners, you’re seeing her now in refrigerators and cars and baby monitors and cameras. The momentum just continues to build throughout the year and I think we’ll see it continue into 2018 as well.”Unlike Apple (AAPL), which keeps Siri under lock and key, Amazon early on opened up access to Alexa so outside companies and developers could develop functions for it, even integrate it into their own devices. It was a risky business move, but ultimately a savvy one. At last January’s Consumer Electronics Show, Alexa was the breakout star, with hundreds of Alexa-enabled devices from outside parties — fridges, air purifiers, self-driving cars, even baby monitors — lining the convention halls en masse.  What’s next for AlexaFor now, interactions with Alexa are a start-and-stop affair where users instruct it to perform one or two of more than 25,000 different tasks: telling you the latest news, cracking a sassy joke, calling an Uber or playing the latest Ariana Grande album off Amazon Music or Spotify. But what Alexa can’t do is hold a rich, lengthy conversation that picks up on things like cues and context. “I can barely hold a 20-minute conversation, so you can imagine how hard it is for technology,” Limp quips. Getting to that point will require a lot of work from 5,000 or so Amazon employees who now work on Alexa in places as far-flung as Germany and India, as well as outside developers. Perhaps realizing that making Alexa a conversational whiz was a herculean task, Amazon shares Alexa’s software development tools with third parties to create tasks, or “skills,” of their own.Story continuesIn 2015, Amazon announced the Alexa Fund, a $100 million venture capital fund that gives cash to companies and developers who drum up new skills that let Alexa perform new tasks. For Amazon, all these efforts — sharing software tools with third parties, the fund and student competitions — are a means to an end. The more Alexa-enabled devices there are in the world, the more people interact with Alexa. And the more engaging Alexa becomes, the more likely they are to use Amazon’s wide array of services and order things.Amazon’s efforts may help stave off increasing competition from companies such as Apple, which releases the HomePod — its answer to Amazon Echo — some time next year. Source: Yahoo FinanceMoreThose efforts may also help stave off competition like Google Home, Microsoft’s (MSFT) Cortana and Apple’s Siri, which is already usable on Mac computers and arrives loaded on the HomePod — Apple’s (AAPL) answer to the Amazon Echo — when the speaker arrives some time in 2018.Ask Limp about the growing competition, and he’ll contend Echo continues to distinguish itself in the way it interacts with users. “Some of those assistants are very different,” Limp says. “They’re focused on one-to-one interaction with a person themselves, usually on the phone, and that’s not what we’re trying to do with Alexa. We’re trying to do something very different. It’s in a home setting — it’s very communal.”  The Amazon executive also says the Alexa team pays serious attention to feedback from Echo owners. Case in point, in early December, the team rolled out a new Alexa “skill,” or task, that lets people use their voice to set an alarm that wakes them up with music. One Echo customer requested that feature roughly a year ago, Limp says.‘Privacy can’t be bolted on as a last feature’In November, Amazon announced Alexa for Business, which lets organizations bring the popular voice assistant into the office. Source: Amazon/YouTubeMoreAnother potentially big area of opportunity in the coming months? Alexa for Business, which the tech giant announced at Amazon Web Services’ re:Invent conference this November, and lets businesses bring the voice assistant into the office so entire teams or offices can use it. In addition to setting reminders, managing schedules and ordering office supplies, Alexa is now capable of simplifying certain office tasks. “I walk into the conference room, and all I say is, ‘Alexa, start the meeting,’” Limp explains. “The cloud knows which meeting it is, which attendees, which A/V [audio-visual] system to set up, and it all just automatically gets set up.”  While businesses like Capital One (COF), Brooks Brothers and WeWork have already signed up as clients, one business Yahoo Finance spoke under the condition of anonymity said it was evaluating Alexa for Business but expressed privacy and security concerns, because Alexa is allegedly “always on” and “always listening” to what’s going on in a room. According to a report from The Information in July, for instance, Amazon was thinking about giving developers access to raw transcripts of users’ interactions with Alexa — a report Limp vehemently denied to Yahoo Finance. Limp acknowledges that security and privacy remain a valid concern but contends Amazon has its bases covered on that front, whether it’s having a Mute button on the device or that blue ring that turns on once Alexa is listening. “Privacy can’t be bolted on as the last feature you would put into this,” he says. “From the very beginning, we thought about privacy as a foundational element. Alexa isn’t always on. All she’s listening for is that wake word [Alexa], and that’s local. Nothing is going to the cloud, and secondarily, once we do start streaming to the cloud, we make it very clear to everyone in the room by that circle of light that, hey, right now we are streaming up to the cloud. That’s critical. Because without that user interface, you would never know.” Despite Amazon’s efforts, privacy will likely remain a concern with devices such as the Echo as they become more successful and ubiquitous.Click here to read more about the work culture at Amazon.—JP Mangalindan is the Chief Tech Correspondent for Yahoo Finance covering the intersection of tech and business. Email story tips and musings to jpm@oath.com. Follow him on Twitter or Facebook.More from JP:Facebook named the No. 1 place to work in the USFacebook targets 6- to 12-year-old demographic with Messenger Kids Facebook publishes ad rules in wake of Russias revelations ‘Scandal’ creator Shonda Rhimes: Why I left ABC for NetflixIntuit CEO: Old-school accountants will be ‘struggling in 5 years’ because of A.I.How Amazon quickly trains 120,000 employees for the holidaysPayPal CEO: ‘It’s expensive to be poor’Why the Russia ad scandal could actually be a win for FacebookFacebook diversity chief ‘frustrated’ over progressMelinda Gates on ‘the hardest thing’ she’s ever had to doRBC analyst: Only 2 scenarios would spur investors to flee FacebookMeet the man behind Facebook Messenger’s growth spurtLEAKED AUDIO: New Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi reveals 3 things employees should know about himReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

Source: AmazonMoreThe Echo’s success as a voice-controlled speaker is undoubtedly impressive, and the key to America embracing Alexa in their homes was making Alexa cloud-based, contends Dave Limp, Amazon SVP of devices and services. “We envisioned Alexa and all the products that connect to her to be based mostly in the cloud, and I think that’s the kind of paradigm shift that we’ve seen with this technology as opposed to previous technologies in consumer electronics, because Alexa being up in the cloud allows us to improve her every single day,” Limp told Yahoo Finance at Amazon’s Seattle headquarters recently. Limp added: “And because developers can extend her through software skills and through hardware partners, you’re seeing her now in refrigerators and cars and baby monitors and cameras. The momentum just continues to build throughout the year and I think we’ll see it continue into 2018 as well.”Unlike Apple (AAPL), which keeps Siri under lock and key, Amazon early on opened up access to Alexa so outside companies and developers could develop functions for it, even integrate it into their own devices. It was a risky business move, but ultimately a savvy one. At last January’s Consumer Electronics Show, Alexa was the breakout star, with hundreds of Alexa-enabled devices from outside parties — fridges, air purifiers, self-driving cars, even baby monitors — lining the convention halls en masse.  What’s next for AlexaFor now, interactions with Alexa are a start-and-stop affair where users instruct it to perform one or two of more than 25,000 different tasks: telling you the latest news, cracking a sassy joke, calling an Uber or playing the latest Ariana Grande album off Amazon Music or Spotify. But what Alexa can’t do is hold a rich, lengthy conversation that picks up on things like cues and context. “I can barely hold a 20-minute conversation, so you can imagine how hard it is for technology,” Limp quips. Getting to that point will require a lot of work from 5,000 or so Amazon employees who now work on Alexa in places as far-flung as Germany and India, as well as outside developers. Perhaps realizing that making Alexa a conversational whiz was a herculean task, Amazon shares Alexa’s software development tools with third parties to create tasks, or “skills,” of their own.Story continuesIn 2015, Amazon announced the Alexa Fund, a $100 million venture capital fund that gives cash to companies and developers who drum up new skills that let Alexa perform new tasks. For Amazon, all these efforts — sharing software tools with third parties, the fund and student competitions — are a means to an end. The more Alexa-enabled devices there are in the world, the more people interact with Alexa. And the more engaging Alexa becomes, the more likely they are to use Amazon’s wide array of services and order things.Amazon’s efforts may help stave off increasing competition from companies such as Apple, which releases the HomePod — its answer to Amazon Echo — some time next year. Source: Yahoo FinanceMoreThose efforts may also help stave off competition like Google Home, Microsoft’s (MSFT) Cortana and Apple’s Siri, which is already usable on Mac computers and arrives loaded on the HomePod — Apple’s (AAPL) answer to the Amazon Echo — when the speaker arrives some time in 2018.Ask Limp about the growing competition, and he’ll contend Echo continues to distinguish itself in the way it interacts with users. “Some of those assistants are very different,” Limp says. “They’re focused on one-to-one interaction with a person themselves, usually on the phone, and that’s not what we’re trying to do with Alexa. We’re trying to do something very different. It’s in a home setting — it’s very communal.”  The Amazon executive also says the Alexa team pays serious attention to feedback from Echo owners. Case in point, in early December, the team rolled out a new Alexa “skill,” or task, that lets people use their voice to set an alarm that wakes them up with music. One Echo customer requested that feature roughly a year ago, Limp says.‘Privacy can’t be bolted on as a last feature’In November, Amazon announced Alexa for Business, which lets organizations bring the popular voice assistant into the office. Source: Amazon/YouTubeMoreAnother potentially big area of opportunity in the coming months? Alexa for Business, which the tech giant announced at Amazon Web Services’ re:Invent conference this November, and lets businesses bring the voice assistant into the office so entire teams or offices can use it. In addition to setting reminders, managing schedules and ordering office supplies, Alexa is now capable of simplifying certain office tasks. “I walk into the conference room, and all I say is, ‘Alexa, start the meeting,’” Limp explains. “The cloud knows which meeting it is, which attendees, which A/V [audio-visual] system to set up, and it all just automatically gets set up.”  While businesses like Capital One (COF), Brooks Brothers and WeWork have already signed up as clients, one business Yahoo Finance spoke under the condition of anonymity said it was evaluating Alexa for Business but expressed privacy and security concerns, because Alexa is allegedly “always on” and “always listening” to what’s going on in a room. According to a report from The Information in July, for instance, Amazon was thinking about giving developers access to raw transcripts of users’ interactions with Alexa — a report Limp vehemently denied to Yahoo Finance. Limp acknowledges that security and privacy remain a valid concern but contends Amazon has its bases covered on that front, whether it’s having a Mute button on the device or that blue ring that turns on once Alexa is listening. “Privacy can’t be bolted on as the last feature you would put into this,” he says. “From the very beginning, we thought about privacy as a foundational element. Alexa isn’t always on. All she’s listening for is that wake word [Alexa], and that’s local. Nothing is going to the cloud, and secondarily, once we do start streaming to the cloud, we make it very clear to everyone in the room by that circle of light that, hey, right now we are streaming up to the cloud. That’s critical. Because without that user interface, you would never know.” Despite Amazon’s efforts, privacy will likely remain a concern with devices such as the Echo as they become more successful and ubiquitous.Click here to read more about the work culture at Amazon.—JP Mangalindan is the Chief Tech Correspondent for Yahoo Finance covering the intersection of tech and business. Email story tips and musings to jpm@oath.com. Follow him on Twitter or Facebook.More from JP:Facebook named the No. 1 place to work in the USFacebook targets 6- to 12-year-old demographic with Messenger Kids Facebook publishes ad rules in wake of Russias revelations ‘Scandal’ creator Shonda Rhimes: Why I left ABC for NetflixIntuit CEO: Old-school accountants will be ‘struggling in 5 years’ because of A.I.How Amazon quickly trains 120,000 employees for the holidaysPayPal CEO: ‘It’s expensive to be poor’Why the Russia ad scandal could actually be a win for FacebookFacebook diversity chief ‘frustrated’ over progressMelinda Gates on ‘the hardest thing’ she’s ever had to doRBC analyst: Only 2 scenarios would spur investors to flee FacebookMeet the man behind Facebook Messenger’s growth spurtLEAKED AUDIO: New Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi reveals 3 things employees should know about himReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

It acquired Whole Foods Market for $13.7 billion (£9.8 billion) last year to help it send groceries to shoppers' doorsteps.Amazon's results bucked expectations that it would plow more profit into investments, as it has done in the past. Amazon said net income rose to $1.6 billion, or $3.27 per share in the quarter ended March 31. Analysts on average were expecting $1.26 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Sales rose 43 percent to $51.0 billion in the quarter, beating analysts' average estimate of $49.8 billion.The fast ascent of Amazon and its Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, now the richest person in the world, has drawn the attention of U.S. President Donald Trump.

Sales from Prime fees and other subscriptions grew 60 percent to $3.1 billion."We still feel it's the best deal in retail," Brian Olsavsky, Amazon’s chief financial officer told a conference call, adding the number of items eligible for free two-day shipping increased in recent years from 20 million to more than 100 million.Revenue from third-party sellers paying to promote their products on Amazon.com was an unusually large bright spot during the quarter. Advertising and "Other" sales, including from co-branded credit cards, grew 139 percent to $2.03 billion."The significant acceleration in Other revenues suggests Amazon's advertising ambitions continue to ramp quickly, and is now large enough to drive upside in Amazon's margin profile," said Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian in a note.Amazon said it expects operating profit this quarter between $1.1 billion and $1.9 billion, up from $628 million a year earlier.

For nearly every product category, Amazon is offering curated options that are priced very competitively and consistently please the masses.The list of categories — which began in 2015 with AmazonBasics and “Pinzon” (another home essentials brand) — was already growing quickly when it gained another boost by Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods and its popular 365 brand. Whole Foods itself illustrated a distinct take on generics, as its upscale reputation gave its generic brand 365 prestige.This strategy, according to SunTrust analysis, could carry the business to sales of $25 billion a year by 2025, far above 2018’s current projection of $7.5 billion.Amazon has found the missing piece for generics with its techIn many ways, Amazon’s approach to generic products isn’t that different from classic in-store generics. Generics sit next to their name-brand counterparts at the pharmacy or grocery store, like Costco’s Kirkland brand, CVS’s CVS brand, or Whole Foods 365. Their location, subtle design hints like packaging shape and color, active ingredients, and the occasional “compare to Listerine” would serve to inform consumers of the lower-cost alternative.The Amazon model is largely the same thing, but in search results — instead of on the shelf. You search for sunscreen on Amazon and you see Amazon’s “compare to Coppertone” next to the Coppertone. But there are a few secret weapons inherent to Amazon’s platform that make its current forays into generics a force that could reshape retail.One trick up its sleeve: reviews. If a shopper were ever on the fence deciding between a generic and a name-brand product, a chorus of 5,000 Amazon reviews with a 4.8-star average is often enough to make someone trust the in-house generic. No one wants to pay more than they have to, and if you don’t care about buying a brand-name suitcase or electric kettle, the cheaper generic has a very good shot.But Amazon itself has also become a name brand of sorts, as its brand connection may be seen as a pro, not a con for some items.Amazon Essentials, men’s clothing (Amazon.com)MoreSince the Amazon marketplace is filled with countless inexpensive, largely anonymous brands — like Yungsong and Qianxiang for iPhone cables — Amazon’s often similarly priced offerings stand out. Unlike the unknown brands, Amazon’s products are backed by a large, established company with a track record of customer satisfaction and a “customer-obsessed” CEO who has a stake in the reputation of products carrying the brand.“A big advantage of AmazonBasics is being able to deal directly with Amazon for warranty replacement,” wrote one commenter on the Wirecutter, a popular online review site owned by The New York Times. “For me, that often helps tip the scales.”Story continuesEven if an Amazon-branded product appears to be identical to a competitor’s, its branding carries an implicit promise of quality control, customer service, and a generous return policy that makes it risk-free to try. Like Whole Foods elevating generics with its 365 brand, the Amazon mark may be a value-add.Amazon said it adds products too quickly to have metrics to share about the average reviews or return rates of its in-house branded products, but a Yahoo Finance analysis across multiple product categories found very strong showings that regularly match or exceed their counterparts.Amazon is a search engine, and its products are doing well on itAmazon’s most overlooked quality may be the fact that its marketplace is a search engine, and one that research has shown has supplanted Google as the first place an online shopper goes to buy something.Amazon search results have long been a battleground for retailers looking for prominent placement because customers seldom look beyond the first page. The retailer has, unsurprisingly, become savvy at playing the placement game with its own private-label products.Search for anything on the site and you’ll see an Amazon brand in the first few results, as well as “sponsored” products at the top. (The company sponsors Amazon-brand items on its own site.) Yahoo Finance searched dozens of product categories with a cleared browser and Amazon’s house brands were staples among the first three results.The Amazon algorithm, sellers have told Yahoo Finance, is based on a handful of factors, including positive reviews, number of reviews, sales, SEO-quality copy, and price, a characteristic that enables the company to be especially competitive, given its tolerance for microscopic margins.“These marketplaces always have new requirements, things they’re testing,” said Neha Gajwani, CEO of SmackTom, which sells electronics accessories and more on Amazon and other platforms, earlier this year. “All of that goes into where they put you in search.”Amazon refines its search algorithm continuously, and like a grocery store it has no obligation to treat its own products and competitors equally. Neutral or not, Amazon says that it is focused on providing a broad selection, including both in-house and independent brands.Data, quality and recognitionAmazon’s review system and generous return policy have allowed it to expand generics into hundreds of categories throughout its site. Armed with a precise understanding of the products people search for, Amazon can tailor its offerings.If, for example, 40-watt light bulbs or bocce ball sets become popular items — and they have good reviews and a low price — Amazon may give the product its coveted “Amazon’s Choice” badge in a search result. (There are also “Best Seller” badges.) The idea behind “Amazon’s Choice” is similar to the reviewing model used by the Wirecutter. In short, the model is: “This product works well for most people.”Amazon’s Mama Bear organic baby food (Amazon.com)MoreBut it has long been considered an open secret that besides using this data to give popular products a badge, Amazon uses the data on what people are searching for, buying, and reviewing positively to jump in to provide its alternative, especially if it’s an everyday product that’s easy to get for a private label.“Got a Hot Seller on Amazon?” asked one Bloomberg headline from 2016, “Prepare for E-Tailer to Make One Too.”The open secret holds that if Amazon house-brand products don’t already dominate these badges, they’re probably strong possibilities for what’s coming next. (Amazon launched its own pet food brand, Wag, in May.)Amazon didn’t directly confirm this open secret, but told Yahoo Finance that the idea for in-house products began by listening to and learning from customers to bring them products they’ll like.Amazon declined to elaborate on its data use and about how many data scientists work on these projects, but from CEO Jeff Bezos’s comments in the past, and Amazon’s behavior in product rollouts, data likely plays a major role.“There is a right answer or a wrong answer, a better answer or a worse answer, and math tells us which is which. These are our favorite kinds of decisions,” he wrote in a 2005 letter to shareholders. “Quantitative analysis improves the customer’s experience and our cost structure.”Practically all manufacturers and retailers use data, but Amazon’s data-driven approach may be the key to its success.On the Wirecutter, Amazon brands have performed well, earning prominent spots over the years in cables, umbrellas, paper shredders, and spots on its travel guide. As Courtney Schley wrote for the site in 2016: “We…test AmazonBasics offerings whenever they’re relevant and even recommend its stuff as a top pick or alternate in our guides to paper shredders, HDMI cables, school backpacks, and 12 other reviews (as of this writing).”Schley advised consumers to read the customer reviews, noting the quality for some was really good but poor for others. Amazon’s lightning pace of adding products every month means a near-impossible task for professional reviewers for sites like Wirecutter and the Strategist.Already, consumers are able to wake up with their phone plugged into an Amazon cable in an Amazon charger in an Amazon power strip, sitting next to their Rivet (Amazon) bedside table with an Amazon basics light with Pinzon (Amazon) sheets, shave, brush, and shower with Solimo shampoo, put on Amazon clothing, and so on — we haven’t even gotten 10 minutes into the day yet.

REUTERS/Joshua RobertsMoreBy Munsif Vengattil and Jeffrey Dastin(Reuters) - Jeff Bezos, Amazon.com Inc's (AMZN.O) founder and the world's richest person, said on Thursday he will commit $2 billion to helping homeless families and starting pre-schools for low-income communities.The announcement marks a deeper foray into philanthropy for Bezos, whose fortune has soared to more than $160 billion thanks to his stake in Amazon. Dominance in e-commerce and the nascent field of cloud computing has made Amazon the world's second-most valuable public company.Bezos solicited ideas on Twitter last year for ways to donate some of his wealth. While he has financially supported cancer research and scholarships for immigrants, among other causes, Bezos has primarily devoted his fortune to his Blue Origin rocket company, which he described on Thursday as an "investment in the future of our planet through the development of foundational space infrastructure."His private ownership of The Washington Post, which has published articles critical of the White House, has also put him at odds with U.S. President Donald Trump.The new philanthropic effort is called the Bezos Day One Fund, a nod to the executive's management philosophy that organizations must view every day with the fervor of a new start, or face stagnation and decline.Within this, the "Day 1 Families Fund" will support existing non-profit organizations that offer shelter and food to young homeless families.The "Day 1 Academies Fund" will start an organization to operate a new network of full-scholarship pre-schools for low-income communities. Citing the Amazon mantra of customer obsession, Bezos said in a tweet https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/1040253796293795842: "The child will be the customer."Bezos said in remarks to the Economic Club of Washington that it is "really really hard" for a child to catch up if they fall behind in their early years. The money will pay "gigantic dividends for decades."He said he did not know how much money he would eventually give away.Bezos has yet to join "The Giving Pledge" created by fellow billionaires Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett, whose more than 180 signatories have promised to give more than half of their fortunes to philanthropy.The Amazon chief's wealth has become problematic for some.Earlier this month, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, proposed a bill in Congress called the "Stop BEZOS" Act, which would make large corporations pay workers more or pay for public assistance programs like Medicaid. Amazon has said Sanders' statements about the company were "inaccurate and misleading."(Reporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru and Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco; Additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington Editing by Shailesh Kuber and Paul Tait)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool









amazon's all-new echo is a more attractive smart assistant

After all, who would want a speaker in their homes they could talk to?It turns out a lot of people. Enough, in fact, for Amazon to launch five more smart speakers since then, including the all-new Echo. Available now for $99 — that’s less than the original’s $179 price tag — the new Echo improves upon both its predecessor’s looks and performance.It’s a great buy for consumers who are just getting into the smart assistant market. However, there might not be much reason for existing users to upgrade since the cloud-based Alexa gets all the same improved functionality in both the new and old versions of the Echo.An Echo that’s at home in your homeThe original Echo stood out for both its impressive capabilities as a smart speaker and almost alien design. Amazon crafted the Echo in the shape of a tall, black cylinder that was instantly recognizable. But as competitors like Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) Home and Apple’s (AAPL) upcoming HomePod opt for more traditionally decorative designs, Amazon is adjusting the Echo’s look.The new Echo is still a cylinder, but it’s squatter than the original. And like Google’s Home, which has a customizable base, the Echo now has an interchangeable shell that you can fit to your home’s style. The base shells come in black or grey fabric and are genuinely attractive. I can see both easily fitting in on my end table or night stand. I can also see my cats deciding to tear into them like they did with my Google Home’s fabric base.Evidence that my cats hate or love my Google Home.MoreIf you want a different look, you can purchase walnut, oak, or silver finish shells for $29 a piece. Replacing them is a snap. You simply push the small indent in the bottom of the Echo and push the speaker out of the shell. Slide it into your new one and you’re all set.Unlike the first-generation Echo, this new version doesn’t have a twistable volume ring at its top. Instead, Amazon has included volume up and down buttons. It’s not a big change and really makes no functional difference. Still, I liked the simplicity of being able to twist the top of the Echo to quickly adjust the volume when I needed to turn down Taylor Swift before the delivery guy got to my door and found me out.Amazon did away with the Echo’s twisting top in favor of traditional volume buttons.MoreAmazon did, however, add an AUX jack to the new Echo, which means you can connect it to any speaker. Want to turn your big home entertainment center into a giant smart speaker? You’ve got it.Pump up the jamConsumers don’t just use their smart speakers to talk to disembodied voices. They’re also solid standalone speakers for listening to music and podcasts. But Amazon couldn’t just release a new Echo with the same speakers as the previous model. So the company upped the audio capabilities of the Echo by dropping in a 2.5-inch subwoofer and 0.6-inch tweeter.Story continuesThe new Echo next to the older, taller Echo.MoreI’m by no means an audiophile — I think the headphones that came with my smartphone are more than adequate — so I’m not exactly picky when it comes to audio quality. That said, I found the new Echo’s speakers to be a bit clearer and deeper than the original’s.If you’re the kind of person who needs the absolute best audio experience, well, the Echo probably isn’t going to cut it. But then that’s what that AUX jack is for.Can you hear me, Alexa?Amazon says the new Echo has improved beam-forming microphones that allow it to hear your voice from farther away. I live in a New York City apartment, which means, well, there’s not a ton of room to really put the Echo’s mics to the test. I noticed it, like other smart speakers, had a bit of trouble hearing me over excessively loud music, but both it and the older Echo picked up my voice with ease from a moderate distance.The point is, this Echo isn’t going to blow away the last version, which is great for owners of the original.The Amazon Echo without its fabric shell.MoreThat holds equally true when it comes to the new Echo’s overall capabilities. The second-generation Echo can do everything its predecessor can. That means you can call other Echo devices, as well as people with the Alexa app, make voice calls to your family’s and friends’ mobile phones and landlines and set up multi-room listening.Both Echos also have the ability to let you perform multiple tasks at once with one voice command. You can, for example, say, “Alexa, goodnight,” and it will run a set routine of tasks like lock the doors, turn off the lights and more. You can also train both Echos to recognize your voice, so when you say “Play my favorites playlist,” it will play your playlist and not your roommates. The same feature also works with making calls. So, if you tell your Echo to call your Mom, it will call your own mother and not your friend’s.Should you get it?The Amazon Echo is already the best smart speaker you can buy thanks to its ability to communicate with hundreds of connected devices, as well as Amazon’s own massive online store.The addition of a vastly improved design, and slightly upgraded sound, simply serve to make it a more attractive purchase for first-time smart speaker buyers. Should you ditch your current Echo for the gen 2? Not necessarily.I’d only suggest making the switch if you’re sick of your current Echo’s look, or you really want that AUX jack. If not, stick with your original.Update: This post has been updated to reflect that the echo can make voice calls and recognize individual voices.More from Dan:Why Microsoft is playing nice with iPhones and AndroidThe biggest problem holding VR back right nowGoogle Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL review: Android phones done right‘South Park: The Fractured But Whole’ review: Disgusting, smart and funWhat it takes to play video games for a living: Insane hours and tons of stressEmail Daniel at dhowley@yahoo-inc.com; follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextGoogle Allows YouTube App on Amazon's Fire TV Once AgainIndiewireGet this $20 Alexa smart speaker instead of a $50 Echo DotBGR NewsXbox One S, Bushnell, iPad Pro, Fire TV Cube, and more deals for April 19MashableAmazon and Google launch free music services in challenge to SpotifyThe TelegraphZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraph57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCN'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley Fool3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceInvesting in General Electric Is All About These 3 Key ThingsMotley FoolCardinal Timothy Dolan on the Catholic ChurchWSJ

But the stores serve a number of strategic purposes for Amazon, and selling books may be the least of them.Most media discussion of the store has centered around the method of display: books are shelved with the covers facing out (as opposed to the spines) and with a user review from Amazon.com below every book, plus the number of total reviews the book has and its average score. Only books with 4 stars or higher can earn a spot in the stores, with the exception of a few new releases.Most of the sections are organized based on data from Amazon.com (Highly Rated: 4.8 Stars & Above; Frequently Wished-For on Amazon.com; If You Like, You’ll Love) or data from Kindle (Page Turners: Books Kindle Readers Finish in 3 Days or Less).A display shelf in Amazon’s bookstore (Daniel Roberts)MoreAll of this has led to the criticism you’d expect the book world to have when the big bad guy moves into town: Quartz wrote that the store “sucks the joy out of buying books.”But the other striking characteristic of the store is a large section for products that aren’t books: Amazon hardware devices like the Echo and Echo Dot.That’s no afterthought. Think of Amazon’s physical bookstores as a proving ground for its many other, larger brick-and-mortar plans.A test for future Amazon stores“This is a way for them to figure out how to do physical stores,” says Spencer Millerberg, CEO of e-commerce researcher One Click Retail. “Amazon started [in 1994] in physical media like books and CDs that were easy to stock and sell cheap and didn’t expire. Now they’re doing consumables, groceries, clothing, and what they’re trying to do there is really, really hard. They don’t understand the minutia and mistakes they’ll make in the meantime. This store is just a beachhead for Amazon in order to get into consumables, clothing, and electronics, all in physical retail.”Indeed, Amazon had planned to open its first Amazon Go, a cashier-less convenience store, in Seattle in early 2017, but in March it delayed the opening. That may signal it hasn’t quite figured out the kinks of brick-and-mortar yet.The bookstores could be useful for some of Amazon’s other business endeavors, too. “They’re never going to tell you, but you can sense that you might need a physical location for drones to do delivery,” says Millerberg. “Having these stores act as distribution hubs is not a bad way to go, or having these function as a physical place to touch and smell their devices is not a bad way to go.”And of course, it’s yet another Amazon venture that it hopes can buoy Prime memberships. The store is cashless: you must pay with a credit or debit card, or Amazon Prime members can check out with the Amazon app (and get a discounted price).Using a bookstore as a showroom for Amazon devicesThere’s a dirty word in the bookstore business: “showrooming,” which refers to when people browse a physical bookstore (or Best Buy or Macy’s) to make decisions, then buy nothing and go home and order the books online. The irony is that in Amazon’s store, showrooming is encouraged, and feeds itself: people can browse physical books and then buy them on their own Kindle instead (right in store), or do the same for Amazon tech gadgets, a la Apple Store.Jennifer Cast, VP of Amazon Books, in an interview at the store, rejected the showroom label, but then went on to describe the store as exactly that.Story continues“I wouldn’t call it a showroom,” she said. “The way that people use showrooming in retail—we’re fine with that too—but with our devices, customers have been asking for a place that they can test drive for a long time. And here, not only can you see the Kindles, and they’ve got books on them, but Echo can play books on Audible, so there’s obvious synergy between our devices and books. We are completely agnostic here. We have a lot of physical books in this store, and our goal is not to showroom, our goal is to encourage you to discover a book. But if you want to buy an Audible book, or a Kindle book, or you don’t want to schlep the big cookbook that you found and loved, ship it home, we don’t care.”Amazon now sells more in groceries and clothing than booksPhysical media (books, DVDs, physical video games) made up $8 billion of Amazon’s $136 billion in total sales in 2016, according to One Click Retail. Consumables (grocery, fresh, beauty products) surpassed that at $9 billion. Apparel (including shoes and handbags, too) was bigger yet, at $11 billion. Hard-copy books are now Amazon’s smallest category, apart from digital books ($3 billion).In other words: the table stakes for Amazon’s bookstores are low. But what it stands to gain is knowledge and lessons for additional brick-and-mortar efforts down the road.What booksellers have to fearThat’s not to say that smaller booksellers don’t have to worry about Amazon invading their space. On the Amazon store’s grand opening day, multiple shoppers inside told Yahoo Finance they were impressed with the presentation of the books—many noted the covers facing out and liked the change—and said they plan to return. (See the Yahoo Finance video at the top of this page, from the grand opening.)Jay DePaolo, owner of the wellness-focused specialty bookstore Choices in Manhattan, predicts, “The initial brick-and-mortar store will cause a great deal of excitement because it is Amazon and it is something new.” But he isn’t too worried in the long run, because he’s not convinced Amazon can change buyer behavior back to physical stores: “Once the initial hoopla is over, if people can get it online cheaper and faster, especially the youth, [Amazon] will phase this out and within three years they will close the stores. Look at what happened to Borders and Barnes & Noble.”Independent and specialty stores like DePaolo’s have proven an exception to the larger brick-and-mortar crisis, and there’s something Amazon’s store has in common with the bookstores that do remain today: they contain quite a lot of items that aren’t books. DePaolo says his store once sold 75% books and 25% gift items; it’s the opposite balance now. “I believe in today’s market if you’re not doing several things in your business, you won’t last,” he says. “Today you have to wear many hats.”Even if selling books is a secondary goal, if the store does well you can trust Amazon will open more of them. For now, it has two more planned in New York City this year.—Daniel Roberts is a writer at Yahoo Finance, covering technology and media.Read more:Why Amazon will have success selling workout clothesAmazon Prime Day is a raw deal for e-book buyersAmazon crushes earning expectations again on the strength of Web ServicesHow baseball’s tech arm got so big that Disney had to have a pieceNew novel envisions American economic collapse in near futureReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley Fool1 Big Reason Why Disney Stock Is Just Getting StartedMotley FoolSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCHere's What Hedge Funds Think About NIO Inc.

Only books with 4 stars or higher can earn a spot in the stores, with the exception of a few new releases.Most of the sections are organized based on data from Amazon.com (Highly Rated: 4.8 Stars & Above; Frequently Wished-For on Amazon.com; If You Like, You’ll Love) or data from Kindle (Page Turners: Books Kindle Readers Finish in 3 Days or Less).A display shelf in Amazon’s bookstore (Daniel Roberts)MoreAll of this has led to the criticism you’d expect the book world to have when the big bad guy moves into town: Quartz wrote that the store “sucks the joy out of buying books.”But the other striking characteristic of the store is a large section for products that aren’t books: Amazon hardware devices like the Echo and Echo Dot.That’s no afterthought. Think of Amazon’s physical bookstores as a proving ground for its many other, larger brick-and-mortar plans.A test for future Amazon stores“This is a way for them to figure out how to do physical stores,” says Spencer Millerberg, CEO of e-commerce researcher One Click Retail. “Amazon started [in 1994] in physical media like books and CDs that were easy to stock and sell cheap and didn’t expire. Now they’re doing consumables, groceries, clothing, and what they’re trying to do there is really, really hard. They don’t understand the minutia and mistakes they’ll make in the meantime. This store is just a beachhead for Amazon in order to get into consumables, clothing, and electronics, all in physical retail.”Indeed, Amazon had planned to open its first Amazon Go, a cashier-less convenience store, in Seattle in early 2017, but in March it delayed the opening. That may signal it hasn’t quite figured out the kinks of brick-and-mortar yet.The bookstores could be useful for some of Amazon’s other business endeavors, too. “They’re never going to tell you, but you can sense that you might need a physical location for drones to do delivery,” says Millerberg. “Having these stores act as distribution hubs is not a bad way to go, or having these function as a physical place to touch and smell their devices is not a bad way to go.”And of course, it’s yet another Amazon venture that it hopes can buoy Prime memberships. The store is cashless: you must pay with a credit or debit card, or Amazon Prime members can check out with the Amazon app (and get a discounted price).Using a bookstore as a showroom for Amazon devicesThere’s a dirty word in the bookstore business: “showrooming,” which refers to when people browse a physical bookstore (or Best Buy or Macy’s) to make decisions, then buy nothing and go home and order the books online. The irony is that in Amazon’s store, showrooming is encouraged, and feeds itself: people can browse physical books and then buy them on their own Kindle instead (right in store), or do the same for Amazon tech gadgets, a la Apple Store.Jennifer Cast, VP of Amazon Books, in an interview at the store, rejected the showroom label, but then went on to describe the store as exactly that.Story continues“I wouldn’t call it a showroom,” she said. “The way that people use showrooming in retail—we’re fine with that too—but with our devices, customers have been asking for a place that they can test drive for a long time. And here, not only can you see the Kindles, and they’ve got books on them, but Echo can play books on Audible, so there’s obvious synergy between our devices and books. We are completely agnostic here. We have a lot of physical books in this store, and our goal is not to showroom, our goal is to encourage you to discover a book. But if you want to buy an Audible book, or a Kindle book, or you don’t want to schlep the big cookbook that you found and loved, ship it home, we don’t care.”Amazon now sells more in groceries and clothing than booksPhysical media (books, DVDs, physical video games) made up $8 billion of Amazon’s $136 billion in total sales in 2016, according to One Click Retail. Consumables (grocery, fresh, beauty products) surpassed that at $9 billion. Apparel (including shoes and handbags, too) was bigger yet, at $11 billion. Hard-copy books are now Amazon’s smallest category, apart from digital books ($3 billion).In other words: the table stakes for Amazon’s bookstores are low. But what it stands to gain is knowledge and lessons for additional brick-and-mortar efforts down the road.What booksellers have to fearThat’s not to say that smaller booksellers don’t have to worry about Amazon invading their space. On the Amazon store’s grand opening day, multiple shoppers inside told Yahoo Finance they were impressed with the presentation of the books—many noted the covers facing out and liked the change—and said they plan to return. (See the Yahoo Finance video at the top of this page, from the grand opening.)Jay DePaolo, owner of the wellness-focused specialty bookstore Choices in Manhattan, predicts, “The initial brick-and-mortar store will cause a great deal of excitement because it is Amazon and it is something new.” But he isn’t too worried in the long run, because he’s not convinced Amazon can change buyer behavior back to physical stores: “Once the initial hoopla is over, if people can get it online cheaper and faster, especially the youth, [Amazon] will phase this out and within three years they will close the stores. Look at what happened to Borders and Barnes & Noble.”Independent and specialty stores like DePaolo’s have proven an exception to the larger brick-and-mortar crisis, and there’s something Amazon’s store has in common with the bookstores that do remain today: they contain quite a lot of items that aren’t books. DePaolo says his store once sold 75% books and 25% gift items; it’s the opposite balance now. “I believe in today’s market if you’re not doing several things in your business, you won’t last,” he says. “Today you have to wear many hats.”Even if selling books is a secondary goal, if the store does well you can trust Amazon will open more of them. For now, it has two more planned in New York City this year.—Daniel Roberts is a writer at Yahoo Finance, covering technology and media.Read more:Why Amazon will have success selling workout clothesAmazon Prime Day is a raw deal for e-book buyersAmazon crushes earning expectations again on the strength of Web ServicesHow baseball’s tech arm got so big that Disney had to have a pieceNew novel envisions American economic collapse in near futureReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley Fool1 Big Reason Why Disney Stock Is Just Getting StartedMotley FoolSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCHere's What Hedge Funds Think About NIO Inc.

Two things had investors excited about the company: 7nm chips and the news that Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) will be using AMD’s Epyc server chips in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing division.That AWS announcement represents a big win for AMD, and when it hit, AMD stock shot up by nearly 9% before settling down. But it’s the 7nm chips that may prove the bigger blow to rival — and industry leader — Intel (NASDAQ:INTC).AMD Announces AWS Will Adopt Epyc Server ChipsOn November 6, AMD announced a new partnership with Amazon Web Services. Starting immediately, AWS will be offering three of its most popular products on servers using AMD’s Epyc server chips. That’s obviously good news for Advanced Micro Devices (and AMD stock), but what’s in it for Amazon compared to using Intel hardware? InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAMD says “The powerful combination of cores, memory bandwidth and I/O on AMD EPYC processors create a highly differentiated solution that can offer lower TCO for our customers.”  7 Dividend Stocks To Consider for Growth  In other words, AMD is pushing the advantages its Epyc server processors (launched last year) have over Intel’s Xeon, and it just landed a very big win with AWS. Amazon is touting the advantages of Epyc as well. It announced that AWS customers who choose solutions powered by AMD Epyc silicon will be able to take advantage of a 10% price savings.AMD 7nm Chips ComingWhile the Amazon partnership was a big part of the AMD stock gain, the company made another announcement yesterday that is even more important in the long term. The company will start shipping its first products featuring 7nm chips by the end of 2018. The new Radeon Instinct MI60 GPU ships to data centers later this year.That will be followed in 2019 by consumer graphic cards using the technology, and PC processors built on AMD’s new Zen 2 architecture. Zen 2 processors will be manufactured using that 7nm process, and will include new hardware protection against Spectre attacks. The company says Zen 2 processors are currently in testing. Naturally, a 7nm version of Epyc (code-named Rome) is also on track.Why the fuss about 7nm chips? They offer double the transistor density of AMD’s current processors, so they offer big performance gains. As Ars Technica explains, this gives AMD the option of reducing the power requirement by 50% while keeping performance on par with current generation chips, or keeping power requirements at the same level while boosting overall processing performance by 25%.AMD’s move to 7nm is equivalent to Intel’s move to 10nm chips. The difference is that AMD is on track with its transition. Intel is struggling. First expected in 2016, Intel’s 10nm processors have been repeatedly delayed, rumored to be cancelled altogether, and now expected some time in 2019.With its move to 7nm chips, Advanced Micro Devices is on track to not only beat Intel to market with next generation CPUs, the AMD versions are expected to offer superior performance to their Intel equivalents.2019 Could be a Big Year for Advanced Micro DevicesAMD stock has doubled in 2018 — despite the drubbing it took after its last earnings report reflected the crash of the crypto-mining market.  10 Stocks to Buy for a Midterm Rally  The company is reportedly on track to take as much as 30% of the market for PC processors in Q4. Yesterday’s AWS announcement is a clear signal that AMD is making real gains in the enterprise server market as well. With its 7nm Zen 2 processors on track for 2019 — while Intel struggles with its 10nm transition — AMD is positioned to make further gains next year, and the days of Intel grabbing 80% or more of the world processor market could be well in the rear view mirror.As of this writing, Brad Moon did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.More From InvestorPlace  2 Toxic Pot Stocks You Should Avoid    10 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy Ahead of Black Friday    7 Dividend Stocks To Consider for Growth    5 Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Consider   Compare Brokers The post AMD Stock Pops on New 7nm Chips, Amazon Web Services Partnership appeared first on InvestorPlace.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

AFTVnewsreports that the virus -- a malware worm variant -- is not specifically targeting Fire TV devices, but they're vulnerable because of their Android-based operating system.The worm, called ADB.Miner, installs itself as an app called "Test" under the package name "com.google.time.timer". Once it's infected a device, it eats up resources mining cryptocurrency -- devices will become slow, video playback will stop abruptly and a notification saying "Test" with the green Android robot icon will appear randomly on screen.If you've never played around with your Fire TV's developer options (which are off by default), you'll be safe from the virus. If, however, you've allowed ADB debugging or apps from unknown sources, your device is at risk -- switch both to off. If you suspect you've already been infected, though, there are a couple of things you can do.First up, the tried-and-tested factory reset. But if you can't bear the thought of resetting your device and starting over, AFTVnews recommends downloading the app Total Commander from the Amazon app store, and using it to uninstall the malware directly -- this isn't ideal though, because it's not clear what other changes the malware will have made to your device.Alternatively, you can install a modified version of the malware, which updates the virus to a version that turns off the miner -- again, not ideal, but it appears to have fixed the issue for people who weren't able to remove the malware entirely. This XDA post shows you how, but you should definitely only try this if you're sure you know what you're doing.AFTVnewsThis article originally appeared on Engadget.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextBritish cyber expert pleads guilty to creating malwareAssociated PressMarcus Hutchins: British computer expert who helped shut down NHS cyberattack admits criminal charges in USThe Independent'MalwareTech' security researcher pleads guiltyEngadgetZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosTesla's board is about to get a lot smallerTechCrunchAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetApple may bring Siri Shortcuts and Screen Time to macOSEngadgetMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley Fool

The retailer’s everything-and-the-kitchen-sink annual subscription plan is about to get pricier. On May 11, Prime annual memberships will jump $20, from $99 a year to $119.The news follows a similar announcement back in January, which found the monthly version of the program increasing from $10.99 to $12.99 — a $24 increase. Of course, annual subscribers will still come out ahead — the monthly model works out to $156 a year. This is the first increase to annual pricing in nearly four years. Why the bump? Amazon’s wild content buying spree likely has something to do with it. Just this afternoon, it announced that it was extending its Thursday Night Football deal another two years. “Since we increased the annual price of Prime four years ago both the value of Prime and the cost to offer it have increased significantly,” Amazon said in a statement provided to TechCrunch. And certainly the program has grown a lot, from free a shipping program to including everything from Alexa special features to The Washington Post. The new prices apply starting May 11 for new subscribers. Existing subscribers will see an increase for renewals starting June 16.This article originally appeared on TechCrunch.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosTesla's board is about to get a lot smallerTechCrunchAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetQualcomm's joint venture with Chinese province to shut down: The InformationReuters

It can be tough for a shopper to keep them all straight, but some of these sales give you more time to shop and the chance to avoid the bargain-thirsty crowds on Black Friday itself.A woman carries a shopping bag with the words Black Friday printed on it.MoreBlack Friday represents a shopping season, not just a single day. Image source: Getty Images.Wal-MartWhile Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) has special events and sales all through the holiday season, it does plan to have a more traditional Black Friday event -- that is, if Black Friday deals beginning online at 12:01 a.m. on Thanksgiving can be considered "traditional." Wal-Mart's in-store Black Friday sale, meanwhile, will start at 6 p.m. on Turkey Day (though many stores will be open all day on the holiday). AmazonPart of the reason the shopping holiday has become more than one day is that Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) never closes. It has also intentionally spread out the season by offering deals beginning on Nov. 1.The online retailer has already opened its Black Friday store, with plans to release new deals each day through Christmas. It has some ongoing sales and some short-term offers each day, and it will have some actual Black Friday specials as well.Best BuyThe big-box electronics retailer has already released some, but not all, of its Black Friday deals. Best Buy (NYSE: BBY) is sort of hedging its bets this holiday season: It kicked things off early, but it also plans to open stores at 5 p.m. on Thanksgiving for deal-hunters. That's also the day when its special Black Friday deals will go live on its website.SearsSears (NASDAQ: SHLD) can't afford to wait until Black Friday. The struggling retailer has already launched its Black Friday deals with the hope it can bring in some desperately needed cash. The company, which also owns Kmart, is calling its promotion the "Holiday Blowout." It began Nov. 1 and runs until Nov. 25, the day after Black Friday.During the sale, the chain will offer discounts of up to 50% off at Sears and 20% to 40% off at Kmart. Most of the company's locations will be open on Thanksgiving, with Kmart stores opening at 6 a.m. and Sears stores following at 6 p.m. Stores will close as late as 2 a.m. and reopen as early as 5 a.m. on Black Friday -- you'll need to check with your local locations for details.TargetLike Best Buy, Target (NYSE: TGT) plans to open on Thanksgiving (at 6 p.m. in this case) and then close its doors at midnight. That's a change from years past when the chain stayed open straight through from Thursday until late Friday night. This year, the chain will reopen at 6 a.m. on Black Friday.The company also has some early deals on its website, and it has offered an added incentive for shoppers: Anyone who spends $50 in stores or on Target.com on Black Friday itself gets a coupon for 20% off that can be redeemed between Nov. 28 and Dec. 10.Kohl'sAnother retailer that's blurring the lines of the holiday season, Kohl's (NYSE: KSS) plans to kick off its Black Friday sales online on Monday, Nov. 20. The chain will also be opening on Thanksgiving at 5 p.m. In addition, the chain is offering $15 in Kohl's Cash (essentially free money to spend on a future visit) for every $50 a customer spends from Nov. 20 through Nov. 25.Story continuesMacy'sAnother struggling brick-and-mortar chain, Macy's (NYSE: M) will offer Black Friday deals online all day on Thanksgiving. It will then open its stores on Thursday at 5 p.m. and keep them open until 2 a.m. that night. They will then reopen at 6 a.m. on Black Friday. The chain also plans to have some special deals from 6 a.m. through 1 p.m. on Black Friday itself and from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Saturday, Nov. 25.

"I am part of what you would call a hunter/recruiter team which actively searches for sellers we believe can do well on the platform," said one.eBay claims that many of the messages followed a similar pattern, or in some cases were "literally identical." eBay cites this as evidence that Amazon HQ coordinated the scheme.One such message, carried in the suit, reads:"To whom it may concern, Good afternoon. My name is Adam I work in the shoes category at Amazon. Came across your store and really like the selection that you offer and your fantastic feedback. Have you ever considered selling on Amazon as well? If so, I'd like to chat with you about the platform. Hope to hear back from you. Best regards, Adam."eBay claims that Amazon representatives were aware they were breaking eBay's rules by soliciting business over its messaging service. It provides examples of what it calls "creative ways" sellers tried to get around the ban on sending contact details over the messenger.Creative ways to poach sellersOne representative wrote their phone number with spaces between the numbers, adding: "The funky typing isbecause eBay doesn’t allow for info like this to normally be put into messages."In another message, the operative broke up the number by inserting the words "phone" and "number," and explaining "(read between the words) since eBay doesn't allow phone numbers in these messages."Another rep explained the need for such methods to the seller they were contacting. "eBay does scan for key termsand they don’t exactly like us poking around," they said.eBay said that the scheme was systemic, and in some cases effective. "Amazon's efforts have borne fruit. Its representatives have discussed the success of their scheme with eBay seller prospects," the suit claims.Amazon declined to comment. Elsewhere, it referred The Wall Street Journal to a previous statement in which it said it was carrying out a thorough investigation into the allegations.NOW WATCH: How Sony created the perfect video game controllerSee Also:eBay is going to war with Amazon over an alleged scheme to steal business that is 'startling in breadth'Here's how Google's new $150 Home Hub compares to the Amazon Echo ShowThe security community increasingly thinks a bombshell Bloomberg report on Chinese chip hacking could be bogusReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWill eBay Announce Major Changes With Its First-Quarter Earnings?Motley FoolComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolAmazon (AMZN) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons WhyZacksAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceState defends South Dakota pipeline protest legislationAssociated PressWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceIn Ukrainian candidate's hometown, a cry for changeAssociated Press'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNButina Shouldn't Serve Any More Time in Prison, Her Lawyers SayBloombergAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphTesla's board is about to get a lot smallerTechCrunchWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin Rivet57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool

The critically-acclaimed political conspiracy series set in a colonized solar system of the future has been heralded as one of the network's best but it couldn't find high ratings on Syfy, leaving Alcon Entertainment to begin shopping the show around to different networks earlier this month to find a home for the fourth season.Amazon will certainly bring a wider audience to the show, and with Amazon still trailing Netflix in terms of original content, bringing over a big fanbase is beneficial to the company's video streaming platform as well.

The company’s study, which includes data from 500 Amazon customers, estimates that Amazon Prime subscribers spend $1,300 per year, nearly doubling the $700 per year the average non-member spends on the e-commerce site.According to CIRP, 63% of Amazon’s  AMZN  customers are Prime members, and in the past 12 months, the total subscriber base has grown by 38%.Amazon Prime is a $99-per-year service that gives the company’s customers free two-day shipping and discounted rates on overnight delivery. Prime customers also get access to Amazon’s streaming video library, free e-books, and more.Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletterFor Amazon, the value is clear. At 90 million subscribers each paying $99 per year, the company generates nearly $9 billion in revenue before those customers even buy a single product. And since they spend an average of $600 more per year than their non-member counterparts, they also appear to be loyal customers that help Amazon’s bottom line.Best of all for Amazon, there’s no indication that many of its members will leave anytime soon. In fact, CIRP found that 95% of current Prime subscribers say they’ll either “definitely” or “probably” renew. That’s up from 94% of Prime members during the same period last year.CIRP conducted its study between July and September. All of its subjects were Amazon customers who made a purchase during that period.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextComparing Amazon's vs. Alibaba's Business ModelsInvestopediaThe Morning After: The Weather Channel got hackedEngadgetTrailers of the Week: 'Child's Play,' 'Hobbs and Shaw,' 'Big Little Lies 2'Rolling StoneWhere to Stream Movies FreeConsumer ReportsAmazon Music's free ad-supported tier is now available for all Alexa usersBGR NewsZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceNatural Gas Price Prediction – Prices Tumble as Supplies IncreaseFX EmpireWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolCrude Oil Weekly Price Forecast – Crude oil running into resistanceFX Empire'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceDid The Underlying Business Drive REGENXBIO's (NASDAQ:RGNX) Lovely 384% Share Price Gain?Simply Wall St.What are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin Rivet5 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy in 2019Motley Fool

On Monday, hundreds of companies, including others like Microsoft, eBay, and Uber, — alongside a group of mayors and colleges — joined together as part of the "We Are Still In" campaign to reiterate their commitment to the principles of the climate agreement. "In the absence of leadership from Washington, states, cities, colleges and universities and businesses representing a sizeable percentage of the U.S. economy will pursue ambitious climate goals, working together to take forceful action and to ensure that the U.S. remains a global leader in reducing emissions," the campaign said in its press release.The move comes days after President Donald Trump announced on June 1 that the United States is pulling out of the Paris climate agreement, which was signed by 195 nations in December 2015. The Paris agreement was intended to slow climate change by setting limits on carbon emissions and has been widely embraced by the business community. The tech industry in particular has supported the Paris Agreement, and many of the big tech companies are currently transitioning their giant, energy-guzzling data centers to using completely renewable energy.The "We Are Still In" campaign launched with an open letter to to the world, acknowledging that the businesses and communities that signed will continue to work towards climate change. "It is imperative that the world know that in the U.S., the actors that will provide the leadership necessary to meet our Paris commitment are found in city halls, state capitals, colleges and universities, investors and businesses," the campaign wrote. "Together, we will remain actively engaged with the international community as part of the global effort to hold warming to well below 2°C and to accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy that will benefit our security, prosperity, and health."Here's a full list of all the companies that signed: 2 Point Perspective: Architecture2050 Partners, Inc.22 Designs23andMe3rd Rock Data, Inc.475 High Performance Building Supply7th Generation LabsAdidasAdmix, Inc.AdobeAdrian Dominican Sisters, Portfolio Advisory BoardAdventiveAdventureCORPS, Inc.Aegis Renewable EnergyAggie Writing ServicesAlameda Natural GroceryAleva StoresAllianz SEAlnical LLCAlphaGlider LLCAlpine Enterprises Inc.Alter EcoAlter Eco FoodsAmalgamated BankAmavida Coffee and Trading CompanyAmazonAmbata Capital, LLCAmbataliaAmeresco, Inc.American Outdoor Products, Inc.American Reading CompanyAmicus Green Building Center, LLCAmper MusicAmy's KitchenAngstrom Science Inc.Annie's, Inc.AnthemWildAnthesis GroupAnthropocene InstituteAntonelli's Cheese LLCAphra CommunicationsAppalachian Ski Mtn.

CEO Tim Cook announced the device as the day’s “one last thing.”“We think we can do a lot,” Cook said, “to make the experience [of listening to music in your home] much better.”The speaker is 7 inches tall, covered in “acoustic” mesh, with a 4-inch woofer. Along the bottom: 6 microphones and a beam-forming tweeter. It runs $349, which is far more expensive than competing products.The Apple Homepod. Photo: AppleMoreLike Amazon’s (AMZN) $179 Echo, Apple’s HomePod is not just for music. It can tell you the weather, read you news and sports scores, and perform many other tasks, all beginning with the command, “Hey Siri.”Three years after Amazon launched the Echo and six months after Google (GOOG, GOOGL) launched its $109 Home, this is Apple’s first entry to the category. And like those products, the speaker is a gateway to other Apple products, and a showcase for Apple’s voice assistant, Siri. Amazon Echo is powered by Alexa, while Google Home is powered by Google Assistant. (Last month, Microsoft announced the Invoke, a smart speaker powered by its Cortana voice assistant, set to go on sale in the fall.) Of course, you could also count the Sonos, the Beats Pill, and the Jawbone Jambox as home speakers that will have to compete with Apple HomePod now.Google Home (L) vs. Amazon EchoMoreYou might wonder why it took Apple this long to launch a home speaker. Apple senior vice president Phil Schiller answered that very question. He reasoned that there are great speakers already out there, but they aren’t “smart,” and there are smart speakers, but they don’t always deliver great quality.In addition to its own new speaker, Apple revealed that its new iOS 11 can control all the speakers in your home from your iPhone, including any Airplay-compatible third-party speakers.Announcing the Siri speaker was just one of many Siri-related upgrades that came out of this year’s WWDC. Apple opened the event by showing off new “Siri faces” for the Apple Watch Series 2 that use the voice assistant to provide quick information on the go.Later in the event, Apple ran through upgrades to Siri, including an updated voice (female and male), ability to translate from other languages, and syncing Siri’s learning about you across all your devices.So, which smart home speaker should you buy—Amazon’s, Google’s, or Apple’s?

It was just the latest in a series of moves higher that together have the stock up more than 40% in 2013. So is it time to take your profits and buy some Christmas presents on Amazon with them? Maybe in the short-term says the co-founder of Bespoke, Paul Hickey.“It’s a volatile stock,” he notes, adding “it’s had a 25% rally almost in the last several weeks, so if it pulls back 15% you may be kicking yourself.”Still, Hickey doesn’t believe the company is overvalued and the future continues to look bright. “Last week we saw weak earnings from traditional retailers, Amazon rallied on the news. It’s taking share from brick and mortar retailers, not only electronics like Best Buy (BBY)...you’re gonna see Amazon slowly taking share from general merchandisers like Walmart (WMT) and Kohls (KSS).”Hickey thinks Amazon’s offer to deliver goods seven days a week is a key to their journey toward retail supremacy, especially as the holidays draw closer. But for the company as a whole, it’s become about much more than getting that DVD to your front door faster.“When you have their web services business, you have their media business, their proprietary content coming out, those are all potential drivers for the stock,” Hickey says. “It’s valuation is high, understandably so, but it’s been that way for several years now.”However, with the stock up so much in a relatively short period of time, Hickey reminds investors that now might be a good time to at least hedge a portion of your interest in Amazon.“Retailers traditionally peak right around Thanksgiving. So even though December’s a good time for revenues, for the stocks it’s not very good,” Hickey points out. “Anytime you see a big move over a short period of time, it’s only common nature to become a little more cautious on the stock. It’s gotta at least see some sideways trading here.”ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolWhy Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical Company Limited (HKG:338) Is A Financially Healthy CompanySimply Wall St.'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergYou Might Like Tutor Perini Corporation (NYSE:TPC) But Do You Like Its Debt?Simply Wall St.What are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

The country's second-largest bookstore abandoned last-ditch attempts to save the business this week after few bidders stepped up.The nearly 400 Borders stores still open could start liquidating and selling off assets as soon as Friday. The plan is for all to be shutdown for good by September, leaving nearly 10,000 employees without jobs.There were many missteps that caused this business to fail from holding too much debt, opening too many stores as well as jumping into the e-reader business to late. But above all, there was one "disastrous move" that put the final nail in Borders' coffin, says retail expert Howard Davidowitz of Davidowitz & Associates."I think the biggest thing Borders did wrong is when they turned over their online business to Amazon," Davidowitz tells The Daily Ticker's Aaron Task and Breakout's Jeff Macke in the accompanying interview. "That move finished them off because they gave away the future."Speaking of future: Where does this leave the future of the U.S. bookstore and Barnes & Noble?With a $1 billion market cap, Barnes & Noble (BKS) faces an uphill battle against Amazon's (AMZN) massive $100 billion valuation. But Davidowitz is not willing to put the last big-box book chain down for the count just yet."I don't believe in inevitable things because I have seen a lot of great changes done in the retail business," he says, pointing to his favorite retailer Wal-Mart (WMT). Not only did Sam Walton change his business from a small variety store model to a discount retail chain, he grew his single Arkansas store into America's largest retailer and employer.Davidowitz is not giving up on the U.S. bookstore either."The retail business is a business of change," but there is still a room for the bookstore in the hearts and lives of many Americans who use them as a place for meetings, gatherings and to just hang out with friends. Davidowitz says the bookstore is going nowhere soon, but we can expect to see a lot fewer of them.As for the 10 million square feet of empty retail space, Davidowitz predicts the big multi-level stores will likely lay vacant for some time, which will put pressure on small developers and community banks in those areas. Most of the smaller Borders' stores will be gobbled up by retailers that are currently thriving, like Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY), he says.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWhy Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical Company Limited (HKG:338) Is A Financially Healthy CompanySimply Wall St.State defends South Dakota pipeline protest legislationAssociated PressCrude Oil Weekly Price Forecast – Crude oil running into resistanceFX EmpireThis startup seeks to identify water problems before they become crisesMarketWatchZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloomberg'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

In both cases, the devil is in the details, and investors are hungry to see if they got what they paid for these past few months."I expect a big number," says Eric Jackson, shareholder and founder of Ironfire Capital, in the attached video. "I think Facebook probably had a great fourth quarter, it's their biggest quarter of the year."But whether big will be big enough to satisfy investors who have seen the stock rise nearly 50% in three months remains to be seen, as Jackson says "people have been piling in since the end of the monster lock-up in November."Related: Facebook Shares Heading Back to $38 IPO Price, Says KilburgOfficially, analysts are expecting earnings per share of $0.15 on revenues of $1.5 billion. But Jackson, and many other investors, are worried that anything less than a healthy beat could trigger a round of profit taking after the stock's big run up.There's no denying that Facebook is expensive, as it currently trades at 47-times this year's estimated earnings. At roughly $31 a share, the company has grown to an $80 billion market cap, making it the 11th largest member of the Nasdaq 100 index (^NDX), and ahead of more financially robust companies licks Amgen (AMGN) and Ebay (EBAY).While Facebook's recently announced graph search is still in its infancy, Jackson says the company is throwing so many things at the wall right now that at least a few of them are bound to stick and make money, and more importantly, ''grow into its valuations."Facebook earnings are schedule to be released after the close of trading Wednesday. This will be its third report since going public at $38 share last May.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read Next3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Watch in AprilMotley FoolIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatch5 Ways The Smart Money is Playing the Billion Dollar Satellite Internet TrendInsider MonkeyWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolNOT REAL NEWS: A look at what didn't happen this weekAssociated PressZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolHyundai hires former Ghosn ally Munoz as global COO, Americas headReuters'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business Videos1 Big Reason Why Disney Stock Is Just Getting StartedMotley FoolBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBC57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolDo Institutions Own Shares In Cloudera, Inc.

Earnings forecasts are material information, especially when they are prepared by analysts who have had privileged access to company management. As lead underwriters on the IPO, these analysts would have had much better information about the company than anyone else. So the fact that these analysts suddenly all cut their earnings forecasts at the same time, during the roadshow, and then this information was not passed on to the broader public, is a huge problem.Any investor considering an investment in Facebook would consider an estimate cut from the underwriters' analysts "material information."What's more, it's likely that news of these estimate cuts dampened interest in the IPO among those who heard about them. (Reuters reported exactly this--that some institutions were "freaked out" by the estimate cuts, as anyone would have been.)In other words, during the marketing of the Facebook IPO, investors who did not hear about these underwriter estimate cuts were placed at a meaningful and unfair information disadvantage. They did not know what a lot of other investors knew, and they suffered for it.Selective dissemination of this sort could be a direct violation of securities laws. Irrespective of its legality, it is also grossly unfair. The SEC should investigate this immediately.We first heard rumblings about this last week, and we were so startled that we assumed the reports were wrong. Then, over the weekend, when Reuters reported the basic story again, we said that if it was true, Facebook IPO buyers deserved to be "mad as hell" about it. And now Reuters has the details, and they sound as bad as we had feared.There are a couple of possibilities for what happened.The first one is bad news for Morgan Stanley and the other lead underwriters on the deal.The second is also bad news for Facebook.According to Reuters, the underwriter analysts cut their estimates after Facebook issued an amended IPO prospectus in which the company mentioned, vaguely, that recent trends in which users were growing faster than revenue had continued into the second quarter.To those experienced in reading financial statements, this language was unnerving, because its mere existence could have been taken to mean that Facebook's revenue in the second quarter wasn't coming in as strong as Facebook had hoped (why else would the language have suddenly been added at the 11th hour?)To those who aren't experienced at reading filings, however, the real meaning of this language could easily have been missed. Facebook's users have been growing faster than revenue for a while, so why would it be news that this was continuing?In response to the amendment, meanwhile, all three lead underwriter analysts suddenly cut their estimates.Now, regardless of why the analysts cut their estimates (and this will be important), estimate cuts of any sort are material information, so if this news was given to some institutional clients, it also obviously should have been given to everyone.That's the first problem.The second potential question and problem is whether Facebook told the underwriters to cut their estimates--either by directly telling them to, or, more likely, by "suggesting" that the analysts might want to revisit their estimates in light of the new disclosures in the prospectus.If there was any communication at all between Facebook and its underwriters regarding the analysts' estimates, Facebook will likely be on the hook for this, too.Speaking as a former analyst, it seems highly unlikely to me that the vague language in the final IPO amendment would prompt all three underwriter analysts to immediately cut estimates without some sort of nod and wink from someone who knew how Facebook's second quarter was progressing. (To get this message from the language, you really have to read between the lines). But even if this is what happened, it is still unfair that news of the estimate cut wasn't disseminated quickly and clearly to everyone considering buying Facebook's IPO.The bottom line is that, even if dissemination laws were followed to the letter (which frankly seems unlikely), the selective disclosure here was grossly unfair.Story continuesThe SEC needs to look into this.And as it does, the SEC should also revisit the practice that allows underwriter analysts to develop estimates that are used to market IPOs to institutional clients but are not shared with the public. In Europe, research analysts publish full reports on companies BEFORE they go public. This is a much better system, and the U.S. should switch to it. But at the very least, the SEC should mandate that any information given to some clients (e.g., earnings estimates and changes in earnings estimates) be given to all clients.

But the organizers’ website ended up with only 40,620 “committed Facebook quitters,” a drop in the bucket for the huge social network.And there are some reasons to believe that Facebook will succeed.Last week, additional details about the video advertising leaked out. Ads will run only 15 seconds and users won’t see more than three per day, Bloomberg reported. And advertisers will be charged up to $2.5 million per day – more expensive per second than a TV ad on this year’s Super Bowl broadcast, which went for $4 million per 30 seconds.Facebook declined to comment.Currently, the site allows advertisers to embed video ads in posts, which users only see if they subscribe to the advertisers' feed, limiting the audience to a fraction of Facebook’s users base.But Facebook has already set a precedent for putting unavoidable ads in the main news feed. Starting last year, advertisers could buy spots to run text and picture ads in the feed. The innovation brought few complaints and much new ad revenue and helped the company report a 53% jump in second quarter sales from last year.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said last month that the company found no “meaningful drop” in customer satisfaction when it polled people who saw the static ads in their feeds versus those whose feeds were ad free. Facebook isn't planning to start putting ads yet on Instagram, the photo posting network it bought last year for $1 billion, Zuckerberg added.Google’s YouTube site has slowly but surely been increasing its video advertising without drawing significant criticism. Still, only about 14% of YouTube videos played have ads, according to analyst Rory Maher.Asked about putting video ads in Facebook news feeds on a call with analysts last month, Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg wouldn’t say much.“So the demand to do more in video on Facebook is there, and we're exploring how we can expand that, but we don't have anything new to announce today,” she said.The move would also be consistent with the long-term trend toward increasingly pervasive advertising in American culture. Once upon a time, ads in movie theaters were considered controversial. Telemarketing evolved into faxed ads, email ads, web ads, phone ads and on and on.The biggest controversy in Facebook’s history was probably its 2007 Beacon project, which was going to track users' activity around the web. Beacon set off a wave of bad publicity and Facebook quickly scaled back the plan, then abandoned it altogether in 2009. Last year Zuckerberg admitted the plan was “a small number of high profile mistakes,” the company has made.If enough users complain, Zuckerberg could easily cancel the news feed videos, too.

Facebook's Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said to CNBC's Julia Boorstin Monday:"Twelve percent of consumer media time is on mobile, and just 3% of the budgets, and we think we offer by far the best opportunity to reach customers by mobile. Facebook gets one in seven minutes on the desktop. We get one in five minutes on mobile. So, a greater percentage."(Read: 'Like' it or not: 10 things Facebook changed in 10 years)But no everyone thinks Facebook's mobile revenues are what give the company value. Brian Wieser, Senior Analyst at Pivotal Research Group, believes the large amount of time mobile users spend on Facebook doesn't matter so much to the company's top line."Time and money have very little to do with each other," says Wieser on CNBC's Street Signs' Talking Numbers segment. "If that were the case, Google would be generating about $100 million, maybe $1 billion of revenue. It's not a relevant metric but it's a nice story. The reality– and the better story for Facebook – is that it is a bedrock foundation piece of modern advertising."Talking Numbers contributor Richard Ross, Global Technical Strategist at Auerbach Grayson, says Facebook's charts alone make the company a must-have.(Read: Twitter still among 'priciest stocks in the universe'?)"Facebook has to be the cornerstone of any portfolio at this point," says Ross. "The stock is in an outstanding technical position. There's as much as 50% upside from current levels."Ross notes that the stock is now nearly double where it was a year ago thanks in large part to its defining its mobile strategy. He now sees the stock price traveling in an uptrend channel with a $73 per share price target. But he thinks the long-term trend is even more positive."Longer-term, there's 50% upside here," says Ross. "This is a $160 billion company. It could be twice that you'd still be a buyer. You have to own Facebook."To see the full discusson on Facebook with Wieser on the fundamentals and Ross on the technicals, watch the video above.More from Talking Numbers:This chart says Tesla is cheap Why you should think twice before buying Why big tobacco will never go away ________________Follow us on Twitter:  @CNBCNumbersLike us on Facebook: facebook.com/CNBCNumbersReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read Next3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Watch in AprilMotley FoolIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatch5 Ways The Smart Money is Playing the Billion Dollar Satellite Internet TrendInsider MonkeyWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolNOT REAL NEWS: A look at what didn't happen this weekAssociated PressZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolCoachella Weekend 2: What to Watch ForVarietyAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceWhy it's so hard for some Americans to get high-speed internetYahoo FinanceJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNWhere Will Netflix Be in 5 Years?Motley FoolMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceTrump sours on Mueller report after initial upbeat viewAssociated PressWhat's next for Trump following the Mueller Report?Yahoo Finance Video

Facebook already removes verifiably false posts about the dates, times and locations of polling stations — but will now exclude false posts that wrongly describe methods of voting — such as by phone or text message — as well as posts that aim to exclude portions of the population, such as based on a voter’s age, for example.Story continuesReblogShareTweetShareWhat to Read NextIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatch3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Watch in AprilMotley Fool5 Ways The Smart Money is Playing the Billion Dollar Satellite Internet TrendInsider MonkeyWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolNOT REAL NEWS: A look at what didn't happen this weekAssociated PressZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolState defends South Dakota pipeline protest legislationAssociated Press'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business Videos57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetIndia's population skews young, which may sway its electionsAssociated PressAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloomberg3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceThe Boeing 737 MAX Is 1 Step Closer to Flying Again -- but Don't Expect to See It SoonMotley FoolGM Stock Could Take Off if It Takes a Hint From Disney+Motley FoolThis 1 Assumption Could Totally Destroy Your RetirementMotley FoolSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo Finance1 Big Reason Why Disney Stock Is Just Getting StartedMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNMicrosoft staff are openly questioning the value of diversityQuartz

Sanctioning a tech CEO would be a rare move by the FTC, and could serve as a shot across the bow to other tech executives amid a growing public and political backlash to privacy and the handling of user data. Options could potentially include forcing Zuckerberg to periodically certify Facebook's privacy practices, heightened oversight by the FTC or even financial penalties, the Post said. Earlier this year, the Post reported Facebook could end up paying a record-breaking fine, in the multi-billion-dollars range, to avoid a court battle. Facebook's privacy problems grew Thursday, as the company admitted far more Instagram passwords were inappropriately stored in plain text on its internal servers than were originally reported, and a report that its "unintentional" uploading of 1.5 billion users' email contact data without their consent may have broken U.S. and EU laws.MarketWatch•2 days agoFacebook now says ‘millions’ of Instagram passwords were exposed internallyFacebook Inc. said Thursday that a security incident that exposed Instagram passwords internally was significantly worse than first thought.Bloomberg•2 days agoPinterest Soars in Debut in 2019's Second-Biggest U.S. IPOThe listing is second in the U.S. this year only to Lyft Inc.’s $2.34 billion offering in March.

Too many investors have forgotten it, largely thanks to the market's mostly unfettered advance since 2016. But we caught a brief glimpse of that reality in early 2018, when the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell roughly 10% from its peak. The bigger-picture backdrop was so overwhelmingly bullish, however, that investors were quick to forget it and rekindle the rally.This more recent stumble in October was a not-so-gentle reminder that stocks aren't bulletproof. Indeed, equities - still up 12% since early April and headed into a time of year known for marketwide weakness - appear ripe for the bearish pressures of heavy profit-taking. And some stocks that have outperformed their peers of late suddenly seem more vulnerable than others.Here are a dozen stocks to watch that may well take the biggest hits should the market tide turn fully bearish. They've been big winners of late, but they don't appear to have the kind of staying power they need to hold their ground when things get rocky.SEE ALSO: 10 Companies Already Hurt by President Trump's TariffsFacebookGetty ImagesMarket value: $442.1 billionFacebook (FB, $151.38) has been contending with some noncyclical problems of late, putting serious selling pressure on the stock. The 30% loss from its July peak, however, may only be part of its repricing should the market's broad tide worsen any further.Much of Facebook's weakness has been spurred by its own hand, such as the fallout from the Cambridge Analytica debacle. There have been other external drivers, too, including the possibility that the company is nearing its maximum user headcount. Whatever the case, the collective impact of Facebook's headwinds prompted Chief Financial Officer David Wehner to caution a quarter ago that the company expects "revenue growth rates to decline by high single-digit percentages from prior quarters."Wehner also warned that operating margins likely would fall from Q2's 44% to somewhere in the mid-30% area in the foreseeable future.Further fanning the selling flames is a frothy valuation that was deliberately dismissed for too long. Even after losing 30% of their value, FB shares trade at nearly 24 times trailing earnings, and 18.5 times 2019 profit expectations that may be too optimistic.Combine all that with the increasingly troubling market backdrop, and Facebook is among a handful of mega-cap stocks to watch as potential liabilities.SEE ALSO: Millionaires in America: All 50 States RankedNetflixStory continuesCourtesy NetflixMarket value: $144.0 billionNetflix (NFLX, $325.89) is undeniably a "story" stock, bid up to nosebleed valuations based on its premise and hopes for significant profits in the future ... at the expense of comfortable near-term results.The dynamic works when things are good. But when the backdrop turns rocky, the fragility of mere stories - rather than actual results - becomes a liability.Despite the stock's 62% advance so far this year, the pros maintain their price target of $382, up another 17% from current levels. They also still (mostly) rate it a buy, even if not an outright strong buy. That optimism also may quickly turn into a liability, however, if traders start seeing the Netflix glass as half-empty. In that case, that trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 148 starts to look really, really ugly, and the potential for downgrades adds to the threat.Another pitfall could just as easily put Netflix shares into a nosedive in the foreseeable future. Should subscriber growth come up short again as it did a quarter ago, investors may assume it's a sign that Netflix's service is within reach of saturation.SEE ALSO: 7 Sell-Rated Stocks to Avoid This FallAdvanced Micro DevicesCourtesy Matthew Rutledge via FlickrMarket value: $25.0 billionSemiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices (AMD, $25.00) was teetering on the brink of collapse just a few years ago, but some savvy design work has brought AMD back from zombie status. Tech customers are choosing Advanced Micro Devices' wares.Investors have taken notice, and responded. Even with the recent lull, AMD shares are up more than 160% since April's low, and are up nearly 900% since the end of 2015, in anticipation of sales growth that ended up panning out.Sooner or later, though, Advanced Micro Devices must turn that revenue into a respectable profit. It's not clear whether AMD will be able to do that well enough to justify a forward-looking P/E ratio of 38.Rival Intel (INTC) admittedly was caught unaware by AMD's overhaul, but it's not as dead in the water as some observers have suggested. Baird analyst Tristan Gerra expressed such doubts in early October, downgrading AMD and saying:"While AMD's fundamentals continue to improve: 1). PC share gains expectations resulting from Intel's CPU shortage may be too high; 2). Graphic cards channel inventory deleveraging is likely a multi-quarter dynamic; 3). EPYC ramp outlook is impressive but remains limited and Intel will react with new architectures," he wrote. "(The) stock is currently trading at 25x our new 2020 EPS estimate. Expectations are high while Intel continues to execute and will likely introduce new architectures to protect its share in data center in the medium term."SEE ALSO: 7 Struggling Companies in Retreat ModeSalesforce.comCourtesy Salesforce.comMarket value: $106.5 billionCustomer relationship management platform provider Salesforce.com (CRM, $137.81) has been pegged as a buyout candidate for a while now. However, it has largely sidestepped any prospective overtures by being a buyer - of companies including MuleSoft and Demandware - more than dressing itself up as a buyee.Investors have loved all the growth (organic and inorganic alike) that deal-making has driven. CRM shares are up a whopping 33% so far this year even factoring in the stock's recent weakness; they've roughly doubled since the end of 2016.Those bulls may have gotten ahead of themselves. Salesforce.com's revenues are projected to rise 26% this year and another 20% in 2019, while per-share earnings are expected to improve from $1.35 in 2017 to $2.51 this year and $2.73 next. But the stock's current valuation is nearly impossible to justify outside of the now-waning market euphoria. CRM is priced at 51 times its forward-looking earnings, and traders are taking notice, hence the 14% slide in just two weeks. And the bears might not be done repricing Salesforce.com to reflect newly realized market risks.SEE ALSO: 7 Low-Cost Gold ETFsAdvance Auto PartsCourtesy Mike Mozart via FlickrMarket value: $12.2 billionAdvance Auto Parts (AAP, $163.17) is a company that has been strangely resilient of late, defying the broad tide. But it's still just as prone to a pullback amid greater weakness, and has more to pay the piper than its peers should the ball get rolling.By almost all accounts, Advance Auto Parts should be fighting a losing battle. Not only is it competing with Amazon.com (AMZN), it's fighting a war against more durable, longer-lasting vehicles. New-car sales may be slowing, but with so many barely used cars on the road and much older vehicles still working just fine, repairs and maintenance needs are minimized.The proof is in the numbers. Advance Auto Parts' revenues and operating income have been down more often than not since late 2015. Yet AAP shares are up 55% year-to-date, translating into an uncomfortably frothy forward-looking P/E of 20.5 -- and have given up very little ground since the end of August despite all the red flags.Don't blindly rely on this apparent strength. This may be a case where the would-be sellers haven't gotten around to tearing into Advance Auto Parts, and are instead waiting on just the right trigger. With so much pent-up downside, however, AAP could get hard in one sweeping selloff.SEE ALSO: 10 of the Market's Most Shorted StocksIlluminaCourtesy IlluminaMarket value: $46.0 billionShares of health diagnostic outfit Illumina (ILMN, $304.76) have already been backpedaling, losing more than 15% of their value just since the beginning of the month. However, ILMN still is up about 40% for the year, and the drubbing might not be over yet if the environment remains bearish.Illumina is the real deal within the genome-sequencing realm. It can look at anyone's DNA and spot potential genetic problems, diagnose vulnerability to cancer and weigh reproductive hurdles. More tests are on the way too, as medical science continues to figure out exactly how human genetic material works. But even without more testing options, Illumina has enjoyed years' worth of double-digit sales growth and reliable net profits since 2014.A lot can change when investors become nervous, however. Even acknowledging strong predicted earnings growth for Illumina this year and next, ILMN's trailing P/E of 70 and projected P/E of 50 start to look problematic, especially when viewed through a bear's spectacles. Indeed, valuation might be what has sparked the selloff so far.SEE ALSO: 10 Best ETFs to Buy for an All-Weather PortfolioCincinnati FinancialGetty ImagesMarket value: $12.2 billionMost financial stocks have struggled since August, as investors weighed the potential impact of an inverted yield curve and priced in the raw toll that higher interest rates might take on finance-related activity. Shares of insurer Cincinnati Financial (CINF, $76.33) have mostly sidestepped this headwind.But it might not be able to do so indefinitely.Sure Dividend CEO Ben Reynolds explains about this Dividend Aristocrat, "Cincinnati Financial is extremely overvalued today. The company is currently trading for a price-to-earnings ratio of 29.5 and a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.6. Over the past decade, the company's stock has traded for an average price-to-earnings ratio of 20.5."Reynolds also is concerned about the time it takes CINF to work past cyclical problems, which would include a yield-curve inversion. Sure Dividend's chief continues, "Cincinnati Financial is vulnerable during recessions. Earnings per share declined from $3.54 in 2007 down to $1.32 in 2009, a 63% decline. And the company's adjusted earnings-per-share have still not hit pre-Great Recession highs."Even if turbulence doesn't turn into a full-blown recession, it could do enough damage to ding the company's bottom line for the foreseeable future. Suddenly, investors have good reason to second-guess the resiliency they've priced into CINF shares.TripAdvisorGetty ImagesMarket value: $6.2 billionTripAdvisor (TRIP, $44.20) already was in trouble before the market bumped into a headwind. While TripAdvisor still is a destination within the online travel-booking arena, its role and value are being increasingly questioned by at least a couple of its biggest customers: Booking.com (BKNG) and Expedia (EXPE).Many consumers assume all these companies are doing the same thing, in competition with one another. That's not exactly the case. Expedia and Booking rely on TripAdvisor to connect its customers with their clients, and they pay TripAdvisor for those referrals.As time marches on, though, Expedia, Booking.com and their peers increasingly don't need TripAdvisor to serve as a middleman. Meanwhile, Alphabet (GOOGL) division Google - which has been in this business for a while - just rolled out a few more tools that allow it to more effectively act as an online travel agent.Both are problematic for the beleaguered TripAdvisor. But more than that, it's a double-barreled liability most investors are choosing not to stomach. Shares are down 27% since July's high, but could fall more if investors believe the economy's recent strength is in jeopardy.SEE ALSO: The Best and Worst Presidents (According to the Stock Market)ANGI HomeservicesGetty ImagesMarket value: $9.2 billionOnline services conglomerate ANGI Homeservices (ANGI, $18.97) - you may know it better as its combined brands, Angie's List and HomeAdvisor - is a great concept. That's a big part of why IAC/InterActiveCorp (IAC) acquired Angie's List in 2017, then spun it off after combining it with HomeAdvisor. It has acquired several other similar platforms before that deal and even a couple more in the meantime, all in the name of greater scale that would lead to wider profit margins.But online consumer services is an increasingly crowded market with an increasingly limited potential for profit growth. And IAC's strategy hasn't worked out all that well. Some would say it hasn't worked at all.Most growth has been inorganic, and losses (on operating and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles bases) remain the norm. That might be a key part of why CEO Chris Terrill will be stepping down at the end of this year and passing the torch to the company's chief product officer, Brandon Ridenour. But ANGI may not have a personnel problem - it may the product (or products) itself that is the crux of the company's growth challenges.Between the sheer disruption of a CEO transition and the lingering doubts incited by the change, the 9% stumble ANGI shares have suffered since the Ridenour announcement may only be the beginning of the stock's weakness.CarvanaGetty ImagesMarket value: $6.5 billionUsed-car sales venue Carvana (CVNA, $46.57) already is feeling the pressure of a cyclical slowdown in automobile sales. If the broad market hits a speedbump, it may feel worse than it really is, but it'll still feel bad enough to bring Carvana to a screeching halt."Peak auto" in the United States was a real thing, marked by an annualized sales pace of 18.25 million new cars in November 2015. That peak caused a ripple effect, spurring the turn-ins of millions of barely used vehicles before and after the new-car mania. Now both face a slowdown; most anyone who wanted to purchase a new or relatively unused automobile now has one.Carvana still is growing its top line, though the pace of growth has diminished over the past couple quarters. Meanwhile, the company has logged a net loss in each of those two quarters, pulling it back into red ink - something CVNA hadn't planned on happening.That brewing concern is a big part of the reason CVNA has peeled back roughly 35% from the high hit in September. But with 150% year-to-date gains still in its pocket, Carvana is one of several stocks to watch for continued profit-taking potential.SEE ALSO: 45 Smart Financial Moves You Can Make in an Hour or LessTwilioGetty ImagesMarket value: $7.0 billionTwilio (TWLO, $68.02) has had an amazing 2018. Shares were up more than 260% for the year at one point, and even the recent pullback leaves TWLO with an impressive 183% gain.But like Carvana, those big gains leave Twilio vulnerable to further downside.Twilio offers businesses a variety of cloud-based services, ranging from login authentications to text marketing to call-routing and more. There's clearly a growing market for such services, as the world becomes increasingly digital and consumers are increasingly connected to their smartphones. This paradigm shift and Twilio's real solutions made for an easy bullish argument.The bulls have arguably gotten more than a little overzealous, however. TWLO shares are trading at nearly 470 times next year's adjusted earnings estimates, and at 14 times the company's trailing 12-month sales. The marketwide P/S average is a bit below 3.Translation: Even if Twilio squeezes the most profit it possibly can out of its revenue, it's still going to be valued well beyond the norm. Investors are more apt to sell off such wildly overpriced stocks if the market gets any hairier.Iridium CommunicationsGetty ImagesMarket value: $2.2 billionIridium Communications (IRDM, $19.57) isn't exactly a household name, but that doesn't make it any less vulnerable to a setback. The stock is up more than 70% from May's low despite a sizable pullback since the end of September, so there's room for profit-takers to plow in. There's reason, too.Iridium Communications makes and market satellite-based communications solutions. It names the U.S. government as a customer, but it also offers services to and with private enterprises. It's partnering with Amazon.com, for instance, to co-develop a platform that will power the Internet of Things.Business has been stable, but not impressive. It hasn't recorded sustained revenue growth since 2012, and operating income has been slipping since 2017.So why this year's big rally? Investors, as they usually do, are looking past the present into the future. The market believes Iridium's Amazon partnership could become a model for similar deals, rekindling revenue and profit growth for good. That may happen.But the difference between the company's GAAP and non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings is difficult to handicap, and investors tend to be forgiving of actual losses when the backdrop turns bleak. Never even mind that non-GAAP profits are currently edging lower.That makes IRDM among the momentum stocks to watch that are sitting dangerously close to the cliff's edge.SEE ALSO: Best Online Brokers, 2018EDITOR'S PICKS12 Top Stock Picks to Shield Your Portfolio53 Best Dividend Stocks for 2018 and BeyondAmerica\'s Most Popular Breakfast Cereals (And the Stocks Behind Them)Copyright 2018 The Kiplinger Washington EditorsReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextMarijuana Stocks: Let the Writedowns BeginMotley FoolNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunch2 Stocks You Can Buy and Hold ForeverMotley Fool2 Top Stocks You Can Buy on SaleMotley FoolBeyoncè's Netflix deal reportedly worth $60 million: VarietyMarketWatchZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool5 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy in 2019Motley FoolAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHere's What Hedge Funds Think About Old Republic International Corporation (ORI)Insider MonkeyWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphIf You Had Bought CBL & Associates Properties (NYSE:CBL) Stock Five Years Ago, You'd Be Sitting On A 93% Loss, TodaySimply Wall St.Misfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance內地熱門城市樓價回升星島日報57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolWhat's next for Trump following the Mueller Report?Yahoo Finance Video

Heck, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has rallied almost 40% off its Christmas Eve low. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) had been one of the best FANG performers during December, a surprise to many investors given how poorly the name has done since July.The sentiment is starting to charge, not only around Facebook stock, but around stocks in general. That has left investors wondering if now may be the time to get long the social media giant.After all, Facebook possesses platforms like Instagram and WhatsApp, not to mention its own legacy platform. Thanks to its rich vault of user data, it’s able to offer advertisers pinpoint accuracy when it comes to targeted ad searches. For years, that paved the way to enormous growth at Facebook, not to mention its huge margins.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe company has been under attack this year though. The media has been slugging Facebook left and right for its questionable data use and business practices, while management hasn’t exactly been upbeat. That has put a beating on the stock, as you’ll see in the two charts below.Trading FB Stockchart of FB stockMore Click to EnlargeA look at the 30-month weekly chart shows how quickly Facebook stock price has retreated. Shares sank from almost $220 at its highs in July to sub-$125 last month. From peak to trough, we’re talking about a roughly 45% decline.  10 Stocks You Can Set and Forget (Even In This Market)  That’s a big-time beating for what was one of the market’s best-performing stocks over the last few years. After falling below the 200-week moving average in December, FB stock has regained this level. In fact, it’s pushing over downtrend resistance (purple line) as well as the 10-week moving average. That’s an encouraging sign for bulls and if the market can maintain momentum, FB stock could be ready to make a large move, perhaps back to the $150-ish level.We can also see that momentum is slowly progressing to a potentially bullish setup, highlighted by the blue circle at the bottom. Should resistance succeed and knock FB back down, I want to see if $130 holds as support. If it doesn’t, $120 could be on the table.chart of FB stockMore Click to EnlargeOn the short-term chart above, we see Facebook stock poking over the 21-day moving average. However, it’s near downtrend resistance (blue line) and just below the 50-day moving average. Over the 50-day and FB stock will look much better and it could pave the way to a rally up to the $150 to $155 area.Ultimately, I need to see what levels hold up as support for FB, rather than what levels hold up as resistance. Resistance gives bears a low-risk shorting opportunity, but those looking to buy need to know what level is safe. Right now, that’s not entirely clear. I would love to see FB hold this $130 to $132 area on a market-wide pullback.Bottom Line on Facebook StockFacebook has a lot of positives, despite floating in a sea of negatives at the moment. It owns some of the internet’s most prized possessions and makes plenty of money in the process. However, the company has very much become a prove-it story.The prove-it thesis holds solid ground on the technicals, as you can see above. Facebook stock literally has to prove to investors that it has what it takes to rally, and that means it has to get out of this nasty downtrend. On the fundamental front, management needs to prove it can achieve growth.While 2018 will probably still be a solid year for Facebook fundamentally, 2019 is not the same. Facebook is forecast to grow sales and earnings about 36% this year. In 2019, earnings expectations slow to just 0.9% growth, despite almost 25% revenue growth. That leaves FB stock at about 18.4 times this year’s earnings.Story continuesNot an outrageous valuation, but without a return to earnings growth, investors won’t want to pay up to own this name. Even if it’s more profitable than social media peers like Snap (NYSE:SNAP) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)MoreFor Facebook (FB), the question about 2019 isn’t whether the year will be excruciating for the social network; it’s how excruciating it will get.Two toxic storylines that unfolded throughout 2018—Facebook’s careless treatment of users’ data and ineffectual responses to abuses of its system—won’t go away in 2019. And depending on how angry regulators and legislators get about them, they could impose serious costs on the company.Facebook, meet FTCFacebook’s most serious threat comes from a settlement it signed with the Federal Trade Commission in 2012 after it had engaged in a bout of settings changes that exposed some private data and left enraged users threatening to quit (sound familiar?).Under that deal with that regulatory agency, the firm pledged to institute a comprehensive privacy-protection program and to obtain people’s upfront permission before making any of their user data more public.Then the Cambridge Analytica data heist happened: A personality-quiz app that some 300,000 Facebook users installed wound up collecting the data of about 87 million of their friends and funneling it to that now-shuttered research firm. That’s taken a hammer to those promises and led Stifel analyst Scott Devitt to headline a late-October note to clients “Facebook: digital tobacco.”Cambridge Analytica now puts the FTC in a position to take a hammer to Facebook—if it determines the company violated the terms of its deal. That settlement left Facebook exposed to fines of $16,000 per violation, a cost that subsequent adjustments have raised to $41,484.Christopher Wylie, former director of research at Cambridge Analytica, testifies during a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee at Capitol Hill, Wednesday, May 16, 2018, in Washington. ( AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)MoreMultiply that by the 70 million-plus U.S. users whose data was compromised by the personality-quiz app at stake in the Cambridge scandal, and you’re looking at $2.9 trillion and change.In early December, Columbia University law professor Tim Wu estimated the odds of some sort of enforcement action at 80%. Two weeks later, after The New York Times reported on Facebook’s sloppy oversight of leaky data-sharing partnerships, he amended that estimate in an e-mail: “Now 95%.”Other government offices will take a bite, tooBut some action doesn’t mean strong action. Hal Singer, an economist and professor at Georgetown University’s business school, worried that the FTC would continue to exhibit symptoms of regulatory capture—when an agency listens too closely to the firms it oversees. “The FTC sure behaves that way,” he commented.Facebook’s harshest critics would like to see the FTC not just fine Facebook but also impose a structural remedy—as in, forcing the company to undo its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp and spin them off as revived competitors.That still seems unlikely. Dipayan Ghosh, a fellow at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government and earlier a privacy and public-policy adviser at Facebook, predicted “a new set of stringent commitments forced on the company that builds significantly off of its existing consent order.”But the European Union has a say too, and the EU has already shown itself far more willing to whack U.S. tech giants with punishments far harsher than anything the FTC has handed down lately. So far, however, Facebook’s only been hit with a £500,000 fine by a U.K. regulator, the maximum possible under pre-2018 regulations.Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s next visit to Congress—that’s a matter of “when,” not “if”—will also probably feature pointed questions about a structural cure.FILE- In this Sept. 5, 2018, file photo Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg testifies before the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on 'Foreign Influence Operations and Their Use of Social Media Platforms' on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File)MoreStory continuesThat interrogation is likely to come from both sides of the aisle. While many incoming Democratic House representatives campaigned on providing a check to corporate power, incoming Sen. Josh Hawley (R.-Mo.) has voiced similar critiques of social-media giants.For Republicans skeptical of complicated regulatory frameworks, injecting competition into the market by forcing Facebook to spin off Instagram may have a refreshing simplicity to it."It's not clear to me that the current system is good for innovation,” conservative pundit Bill Kristol said at a late-November event introducing a set of tech-policy proposals featuring serious curbs on the power of social networks. He compared their dominance to that of Ma Bell-era AT&T.Don’t forget that states and cities, some of which actually have comprehensive privacy rules of their own, can take action independent of Washington. On Dec. 19, Washington, D.C., attorney general Karl Racine sued Facebook for violating District privacy laws. He’s likely to have company: In March, 37 state and territory attorneys general signed a letter to Zuckerberg asking for answers about the Cambridge Analytica case.Some things Facebook could doIf Facebook spends next year responding to these criticisms by warming up the same lame defenses that persuaded few people this year—bland pledges to do better, unaccompanied by meaningful changes in policy—things will only get worse for the company.It needs to embrace transparency instead of regarding it as a medicine only administered in tightly controlled doses. (One start: finally shipping the promised “Clear History” tool to edit and delete Facebook’s data about your activity on other sites.) The company needs to hold somebody accountable—somehow, nobody seems to have gotten fired for these mistakes. And it needs to drop its growth-hacking habit of preying on everybody’s fear of missing out with incessant, nagging notifications.If Zuckerberg is serious about focusing on “time well spent,” his company needs to accept that this means less time overall on Facebook. That would be good for the company in the long run—and good for everybody else sooner.More from Rob:Facebook wants to give you a way to fight having your posts taken downGoogle Maps will now help you find Lime scootersMicrosoft is asking the government to regulate the company’s facial recognition technologyEmail Rob at rob@robpegoraro.com; follow him on Twitter at @robpegoraro.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatch3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Watch in AprilMotley FoolNOT REAL NEWS: A look at what didn't happen this weekAssociated PressMom's Post About Putting Kids in Timeout During Tantrums Goes ViralParentsThe Morning After: The Weather Channel got hackedEngadgetZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolChristchurch shooting videos are still on Facebook over a month laterEngadgetBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraph內地熱門城市樓價回升星島日報5 Ways The Smart Money is Playing the Billion Dollar Satellite Internet TrendInsider MonkeyAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin Rivet3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolWhy Livestreaming TV Can't Break ThroughMotley FoolWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceThe Boeing 737 MAX Is 1 Step Closer to Flying Again -- but Don't Expect to See It SoonMotley FoolThis 1 Assumption Could Totally Destroy Your RetirementMotley FoolWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo Finance

The stock is up about 450% overall, and it's more than doubled over the past three years.But Facebook is facing some problems: a data privacy scandal that's still unfolding, leading to investigations from the FTC and SEC; evidence that teens have little interest in using Facebook; and a valuation that bakes in some optimistic assumptions about growth and profitability.If you want to invest in a stock that could outperform Facebook in the coming years, three of our Fool.com contributors have some ideas.

These are valuable tools as product development cycles get shorter and companies need on-demand services to quickly expand production, test materials, and offer customization, all more quickly than traditional manufacturing methods. PRLB Revenue (TTM) ChartMorePRLB Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts.The financial growth Proto Labs has shown from its rapid prototyping model speaks for itself. Over the last decade, both revenue and net income are up over 400% and show no sign of slowing down. The company continues to add both manufacturing facilities and capabilities for rapid prototyping that make it more useful to designers. It's also technology agnostic, adding and subtracting technology and tooling as necessary, rather than betting its future on one technology that may go out of favor. Where I think Proto Labs has a durable advantage over the competition is as a preferred supplier to the key decision makers in the design process. It's not trying to sell 3D printers to consumers or schools, a mistake 3D printer manufacturers made. Instead, Proto Labs is working directly with the designers building parts and making manufacturing decisions. If the company is able to please those customers, it'll be able to build on its already solid foundation and generate outstanding returns for investors in the long term. Story continuesA retail resurgenceTim Green (Walmart): With Facebook valued at around $600 billion and facing investigations into its lax data security, I don't think it's a stretch to say that the stock may be in for a rough ride. Walmart, the megaretailer that's reinventing itself for the age of e-commerce, could end up producing better returns for investors.You may not consider Walmart to be a growth stock, but I think that's a mistake. Comparable-store sales have been steadily growing for years, at a time when the retail industry is going through a reckoning. Walmart's online business is also booming, with the company expecting around 40% growth this year. Online grocery as well as free two-day shipping are helping to drive customers to the retail chain.Because Walmart is so big, even modest growth translates into big increases in sales. With about $500 billion of annual revenue, each percentage point of growth leads to $5 billion of additional revenue. The bottom line is taking a hit as the company invests in e-commerce, but the end result will be an even bigger retailer with a solid foothold in online retail.If you think Amazon is going to dominate online retail indefinitely, I think you're in for a surprise. Walmart should not be counted out. If the company can keep growing its e-commerce sales at a brisk pace while maintaining the solid performance of its stores, the stock could be a winner over the next few years.An emerging security leaderJeremy Bowman (Axon Enterprise): Facebook has become one of the biggest companies in the world thanks to its dominance of social media, the power of network effects, and platforms like Instagram and WhatsApp, which create a multiplier effect.Axon Enterprise, the company formerly known as TASER International and maker of the eponymous stun gun, has many similar qualities in its industry, security and law enforcement.  Like Facebook, Axon is the market leader in its own niche of conducted electrical weapons (better known as Tasers). However, that's not the company's only business, as it's also the leader body cameras, which are growing more popular amid controversy over police shootings and violence. It also has its own cloud-based digital evidence management software, Evidence.com. Those three business components support and reinforce each other to create a tight web of network effects, as the information from body cameras, in-car video, and audio recordings can easily be uploaded onto the Evidence.com database.That combination of businesses has delivered solid growth for Axon. Revenue increased 28% in its most recent quarter to $101 million, and its operating margin nearly doubled from 6.8% a year ago to 13.4%. That margin expansion is due to its software and sensors segment, and should continue, as Evidence.com is a subscription-based business, a model that naturally expands as it draws more users. As a result, adjusted earnings per share in the quarter more than doubled from $0.14 to $0.32. Thanks to a surge after both of its earnings reports this year, Axon shares are up a whopping 160% so far in 2018, but with a potent combination of businesses and the increasing need for security and evidence management, this stock could just be getting started.

(NASDAQ:FB) has begun to rise again. The Facebook stock chart took a beating following the Cambridge Analytica scandal. However, with a solid earnings report, FB stock gained some of that value back. Now, as FB recovers from the lowered focus on ads and Cambridge Analytica, FB again resumes its growth path. FB currently trades 10% below its 52-week high. I believe FB can recoup lost advertising revenue and gain the 10% back in the near term for three reasons.Reason 1: Less Emotion-Driven TradingThe year 2018 has proven itself to be a roller coaster ride for the Facebook stock chart. As many might recall, the downward moves on the Facebook stock chart began with negative FB stock news. CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the FB News Feed would have more of a “friends and family” focus. The equity sold off further on Facebook’s alleged role in influencing the 2016 presidential election.However, traders need to exercise perspective in this regard. InvestorPlace’s Josh Enomoto correctly stated that traders made an emotion-driven decision in selling off FB. The theory that Russian hackers influenced the outcome of the 2016 Presidental election has persisted in the news cycle for months. For that reason, stock analysts might understand why even the hint of involvement from the social media giant might motivate investors to sell the stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  10 Small-Cap Stocks With Large-Cap Potential  Still, I think sellers failed to see the big picture. The idea that FB, which is having to manage perceptions of anti-conservative bias, influenced the election in favor of President Trump comes across as lacking credibility. Further, as Enomoto stated in his analysis, “who did the actual voting?” Fortunately for FB stock investors, the emotions that drove this downward move have begun to fade.Reason 2: The Facebook Dating AppWhile arguments about Facebook influencing elections may lack credibility, its strategic moves do not. Much like its big tech counterpart Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), FB strikes fear amongst potential competitors. Twitter Inc (NASDAQ:TWTR) and Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) have reeled under Facebook’s competitive threat. FB’s next victim has become Match Group Inc (NASDAQ:MTCH). MTCH stock fell 18% upon Facebook’s announcement of its dating app.MTCH investors should be afraid. FB already has the most of the data needed to present its users as dating prospects. With the new app, users will have an easier time filling out a profile. Also, they will not have to pay high fees to belong to a dating site. This app serves as another powerful way to apply FB’s massive data trove. It also opens up a new avenue to sell ads. Furthermore, FB thrived through the years because users voluntarily handed over personal data. A dating app gives users reasons to share more data — sometimes of a very personal nature — which FB could find more ways to monetize.Reason 3: Compelling Chart and FundamentalsIf dating apps or the emotion-driven trading decision of recent months do not show FB stock as a buying opportunity, perhaps other factors will. The Facebook stock chart saw a dramatic reversal to the upside following earnings. With the earnings beat, both the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) and the stochastics indicate the uptrend has returned.Even after the 9% increase in earnings, FB stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 23. Moreover, earnings estimates project an average annual growth rate exceeding 20% over the next three years.The Facebook stock chart and the fundamentals show FB can rise 10% to return to its 52-week high. More importantly, it can return to the growth trajectory that has given FB one of the largest market caps in the world.Concluding Thoughts on FB StockFacebook stock will rise back to its 52-week high and beyond for several reasons. FB stock took a hit first by reducing ad space and second, by its supposed role in the Cambridge Analytica scandal.However, both the earnings numbers and the stock chart show this correction in Facebook was driven by one thing — feelings. The latest earnings report shows these feelings to be largely unfounded. Moreover, with the upcoming Facebook dating app, Facebook will be well-positioned to recoup lost ad revenue and gain new data which could they potentially monetize. Furthermore, the stock trades at a forward PE of about 23 and enjoys a near-term earnings growth rate above 20%.

3 Stocks That Could Be Added to the Dow NextYahooSearchNo matching results for ''Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsGive feedback on the new search experienceCancelSign inMailFinanceWatchlistsMy PortfolioScreenersMarketsIndustriesVideosNewsPersonal FinanceTechU.S. Markets closedS&P 5002,905.03+4.58(+0.16%)Dow 3026,559.54+110.00(+0.42%)Nasdaq7,998.06+1.98(+0.02%)Russell 20001,565.75-1.85(-0.12%)Crude Oil64.000.00(0.00%)Gold1,277.90+1.90(+0.15%)Silver14.97+0.01(+0.07%)EUR/USD1.12470.0000(-0.0000%)3 Stocks That Could Be Added to the Dow NextSean Williams, The Motley FoolMotley FoolJuly 20, 2018ReblogShareTweetShareWith the exception of the Dow Jones Transportation Average, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) is America's oldest and most prized stock index. Despite a handful of glaring flaws, including the Dow's reliance on share-price weighting as opposed to market-cap weighting, many Wall Street professionals and retail traders look to the Dow for reassurance on the health of the U.S. economy and stock market.Change is commonplace with America's most watched stock index However, over its 122-year run as America's most watched stock index, the Dow has undergone plenty of change. Originally introduced as a 12-component index on May 26, 1896, it would later expand to 20 components in 1916, and finally to the 30 components we're familiar with today in 1928. Just one of those 30 stocks in the Dow on its expansion date in October 1928 still remains today: ExxonMobil, which back then was known as the Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey. A welcome mat lying on a deck.MoreImage source: Getty Images.Since May 26, 1896, the Dow has undergone more than 50 component changes to the index. A committee that meets a few times annually and decides whether or not to make changes attempts to present the best picture of the U.S. economy using only 30 stocks. This means packing the Dow with meaningful companies, while also attempting to represent as many sectors and industries as possible. It's not an easy task, and any number of changes in a company's corporate structure via a merger, spinoff, or perhaps just poor performance could mean the removal of a Dow component from the index.Recently, we witnessed industrial conglomerate General Electric get the boot from the Dow after what was a more than 110-year run in the index. ExxonMobil still has another 20 years to go if it wants to top that mark set by GE. But General Electric's departure demonstrates that change is a relative constant in the Dow.Earlier this week, I looked at the next three stocks that I believe have the best chance of being kicked out of the Dow, with DowDuPont being my likeliest selection. Considering that DowDuPont has plans to break up into three separate but focused companies by the first half of 2019, its relevance in the Dow could fall, prompting the S&P Dow Jones Indices committee to show the industrial giant the door. Which stocks could be added to the Dow next? But the real question is: Which stock(s) could be the next to join the Dow?While it's nothing more than dart throwing at this point, I have my eye on three possible substitutes.A customer with a basket of fruit waiting in line at the supermarket to pay.MoreStory continuesImage source: Getty Images.Costco Wholesale With plenty of healthcare and technology sector representation in the Dow, one interesting aspect about the index is that there's very little representation from the food industry. Yes, beverage giant Coca-Cola and fast-casual restaurant chain McDonald's are part of the index, but that doesn't tell us enough about the food industry or consumers' buying habits. That's why I believe the addition of Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) to the Dow would be a nice fit.To begin with, approximately two-thirds of Costco's sales are food items, which would give the Dow a considerably more accurate representation of the food industry.Secondly, unlike a majority of retailers, Costco isn't a company that relies on netting the bulk of its profit in two or three months out of the year. Most of its margin is derived from a membership fee charged annually to customers who wish to shop at its warehouses. This membership fee actually allows Costco's profits to front-run consumer purchases as opposed to lagging those purchases, as is common with mall-based retailers. That should allow for earnings consistency not often seen with consumer-based companies included in the Dow.And finally, because these membership fees, which often have a very high renewal rate among existing members, provide the bulk of Costco's profits, the company tends to keep the margins on its food items razor thin. This can provide an even more accurate glimpse of how the food industry is performing, as well as how those prices are impacting consumer buying habits. Let's not forget that around 70% of U.S. gross domestic product is consumption-based.With a $217 share price and a meaningful market cap of $95 billion, Costco would make for a smart addition to the Dow.Surgeons in an operating room with an individual's vitals displayed on a computer screen.MoreImage source: Getty Images.Medtronic David Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, opined in a statement when booting GE out of the Dow that "[C]onsumer, finance, healthcare, and technology companies are more prominent today." That's sort of a clue to Wall Street and investors that the committee will be looking to ensure strong representation in these sectors in the years to come. Assuming Pfizer gets the heave-ho at some point in the future, which I predicted as a possibility earlier this week, a possible replacement might be medical device behemoth Medtronic (NYSE: MDT).Right now, the Dow is represented by five healthcare companies: the nation's leading insurer UnitedHealth Group, pharmacy giant Walgreens Boots Alliance, healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), and drug giants Pfizer and Merck. While most healthcare avenues are covered here, there's a redundancy with two drugmakers, Pfizer and Merck, in the Dow. Even with Pfizer being the larger company by market cap, it has the lowest share price in the index, making it potentially expendable (remember, the Dow is entirely a price-weighted index).Medtronic would be a solid fit since it would be the largest pure-play medical device maker that the committee could add. Don't get me wrong -- Johnson & Johnson's global device unit is huge -- but it's not a medical device pure play. J&J has its hands in consumer healthcare products and drug development, as well. In fact, the percentage of Johnson & Johnson's sales derived from pharmaceuticals has been steadily growing for more than a half decade and nearly hit 50% of total sales in the second quarter. With Medtronic, the Dow would get a $120 billion company with a reasonably high $88 share price. More so, it would position the index to take advantage of an aging American population that'll likely require a growing number of medical devices to live longer and healthier lives. If Pfizer were to be shown the door, I believe Medtronic is a logical replacement.A Facebook engineer writing code on his computer.MoreImage source: Facebook.FacebookLastly, there's always the potential that social media kingpin Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) could get added to the Dow. Sporting the fifth largest market cap in the U.S. at $592 billion and a $208 share price, the argument can clearly be made that this is a relevant business.According to the company's first-quarter operating results, there were an average of 1.45 billion daily active users, up 13% year over year, with 2.2 billion monthly active users. In fact, the company's four main assets -- Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram -- represent four of the seven most visited social media sites in the world. That type of relevance shouldn't be overlooked by the S&P Dow Jones Indices committee.However, Facebook has two knocks against it that could thwart its addition to the Dow. First, it's a relatively young company. Even though it's been dominant, Facebook only debuted six years ago as a publicly traded company. The committee generally only adds companies after they've demonstrated that they have a time-tested business model. We're not exactly there yet with Facebook.The other issue is that there are already six technology stocks represented in the Dow (note, I'm lumping Apple in as a tech stock, even though it's occasionally referred to as a "consumer goods" company). That's 20% of the index. If a company like IBM, which has struggled to keep up with the changing tech landscape, were shown the door, then a company like Facebook would be a potentially logical addition. But without removing any tech stocks, it could be a tough sell to get Facebook into an already tech-heavy Dow.Still, it's hard to ignore a company worth $592 billion with a huge economic moat -- meaning there's still a chance Facebook gets the call during the next round of changes.

3 Stocks Warren Buffett Would Buy if He Were a MillennialYahooSearchNo matching results for ''Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsGive feedback on the new search experienceCancelSign inMailFinanceWatchlistsMy PortfolioScreenersMarketsIndustriesVideosNewsPersonal FinanceTechU.S. Markets closedS&P 5002,905.03+4.58(+0.16%)Dow 3026,559.54+110.00(+0.42%)Nasdaq7,998.06+1.98(+0.02%)Russell 20001,565.75-1.85(-0.12%)Crude Oil64.000.00(0.00%)Gold1,277.90+1.90(+0.15%)Silver14.97+0.01(+0.07%)EUR/USD1.12470.0000(-0.0000%)3 Stocks Warren Buffett Would Buy if He Were a MillennialJeremy Bowman, The Motley FoolMotley FoolFebruary 21, 2018ReblogShareTweetShareIt's easy to see why Warren Buffett is considered the greatest investor of all time. His company Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) has become one of the most valuable in the world largely due to his investments, both in stocks and the companies he's bought. Investors who were lucky or smart enough to buy Berkshire stock in its early days have become millionaires as shares gained an amazing 1,826,163% from 1965 to 2015. That's an annual growth rate of 21.6%, more than double the 9.9% that the S&P 500 has returned in that time with dividends included. Investors flock by the thousands to Berkshire's annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, and his aphorisms about economic moats, value, and other subjects have become virtual gospel in the market. However, like anyone, Buffett is a product of his time and generation, and as an 87-year-old, his perspective on investing is skewed by his age.For instance, he ignored the greatest story in business in the last generation -- the emergence of the tech industry -- as he long refused to buy tech stocks because he said he could not value them or predict where they were going. Today, the tech industry is more valuable than any other. In fact, the five most valuable American companies, and the only ones bigger than Berkshire, are all tech companies.Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway's annual investor meetingMoreImage source: The Motley Fool.When Buffett finally broke his personal boycott of tech stocks, he did so by dumping more than $10 billion in 2011 into IBM, in part because he was so familiar with the company after reading its annual report for 50 years. That investment turned into a terrible bet as IBM shares dropped around 20% during the seven years Buffett owned them, while the S&P 500 more than doubled. He later said he should have bought Alphabet or Amazon, instead.Even Buffett's own personal tastes seem to color his stock picks. For instance, he is a big fan of junk food in general and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) products in particular, and the beverage giant is his second-largest holding. Buffett once even mocked Whole Foods Market, saying he doesn't see many customers smiling there. However, Coke stock has also significantly underperformed the market over the last 10 years. If Buffett had been born 50 years later, his investing style would be the same, but his stock picks would probably be much different. It's impossible to know what the Oracle of Omaha would buy if he were just getting started today, but here are three stocks that would likely be on his radar.1. FacebookMillennial Buffett would be all over social media, of course, communicating with investors, and posting selfies on Instagram. No doubt he'd be a fan of Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), and not just the platform, but the stock, too. Facebook has plenty of the qualities that a tech-savvy, value investor like Millennial Buffett looks for. First off, it has a huge economic moat, thanks to the network effects of a platform with more than 2 billion members, and the unique value it offers advertisers. The 87-year-old Buffett has long been a fan of newspaper stocks, noting that newspapers can essentially act as local monopolies if they have no nearby competition. Facebook offers this same advantage, but on a global scale in the digital age, thanks to the power of the internet. Story continuesBuffett himself also recognized the power of digital advertising, noting that he should have bought Google after he realized the click rates that GEICO, his auto insurance subsidiary, was paying the search giant. Facebook, like Google, has similar pricing power. At a P/E of 33, Facebook may not look like a typical value stock, but considering its earnings per share jumped 54% to $5.39 last year and it had a 50% operating margin, the stock looks cheap for its growth rate.  2. StarbucksMillennial Buffett was into the kombucha craze for a minute, but these days he's a devoted cold-brew aficionado. While he likes to visit independent coffee shops from time to time, he's been a longtime Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) Rewards member, and he keeps the java giant's app handy on his phone. Young Buffett also recognizes the market power of Starbucks. In many ways, Starbucks is to his generation what Coca-Cola was to the real Buffett's. He once boasted that Coca-Cola was such a strong brand that if you gave him $100 billion to take away Coke's market leadership in soft drinks, he would give it back to you and say it couldn't be done. However, these days Starbucks seems to be doing just that.Domestic soda sales have declined every year since 2004, and the coffee chain is a big reason. Millennials are largely turning away from sugary sodas and the artificial sweeteners in diet beverages, but coffee consumption seems likely to continue to grow as workplace culture for millennials has been moving out of the traditional and into places like coffee shops.Starbucks has also capitalized on the huge opportunity in China, which chairman Howard Schultz believes will one day be its biggest market, ahead of the U.S. It's also established itself as a consistent dividend payer, likely to be a Dividend Aristocrat one day, and trades at a reasonable P/E of 27.4, not much higher than Coke at 23.5.3. PayPalSplitting checks is so Gen-X. After Millennial Buffett grabs a bite with his buddies at happy hour, he just Venmos them a few bucks on the Uber ride home. The actual Buffett's favorite investing play has traditionally been banking and insurance companies. Buffett loves the business model in insurance as the "float," or the money he gets from premiums that have yet to be paid out, can be invested to earn a profit. PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) offers the same business model, but again has the power of mobile and digital behind it. Like credit card companies, PayPal collects transaction fees of around 2.9% on payments with debit and credit cards, but the company also benefits from the float, or money that users leave in their PayPal accounts that PayPal earns interest on.  In 2014, PayPal acquired Venmo, the app that's become popular with millennials for sending money to reimburse one another for expenses like drinks or rent. PayPal has been slow to monetize Venmo, but has been taking steps recently, such as testing Venmo payments at retail locations.  Nonetheless, PayPal is growing fast, as the opportunity for digital payments could be huge. In 2017, earnings per share grew 27% on a 21% increase in revenue, and management expects to increase another 20% in EPS this year.  At a P/E of 41, the stock may not be cheap, but if the company maintains its lead in digital payments, investors should reap the long-term benefits.  More From The Motley Fool   3 Growth Stocks at Deep-Value Prices    5 Expected Social Security Changes in 2018    6 Years Later, 6 Charts That Show How Far Apple, Inc.

Facebook stock trades at barely 19x earnings. Back out some $14 per share in cash, and the price-earnings multiple assigned to FB stock gets closer to 17x. For a tech giant expected to grow revenue 24% next year, that multiple seems absurd.Yes, spending is going to rise next year, hitting earnings. Guidance for that spend led Facebook stock to the largest one-day loss in stock market history back in August. But spending will normalize going forward, meaning Facebook should get back to growth as soon as 2020. Yet, a 17x ex-cash multiple suggests hardly any growth is priced in at this point.Despite the attractive numbers, however, there are reasons to sell Facebook stock. And those reasons are mounting. Facebook continues to run into problems and Mark Zuckerberg & Co. continue to manage those problems poorly. At some point, the risk here is that Facebook is going to turn off users, and not just investors.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  5 Blue-Chip Stocks That Could Break Their Bull Trend  If that happens, even a price that is threatening a 22-month low won’t be cheap enough, or close.The “Never One Cockroach” Problem for Facebook StockAs Warren Buffett put it regarding scandal-plagued Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), “What you find is there’s never just one cockroach in the kitchen when you start looking around.” That old investing saw has been proven yet again when it comes to Facebook stock.For most of 2018, there’s been a steady drip of negative news. It started with the Cambridge Analytica scandal in March. FB stock bounced back quickly from those declines before the post-Q2 earnings plunge. But even then, bad news was starting to build up. WhatsApp founder Jan Koum departed, reportedly over privacy issues. In June, the Wall Street Journal reported that Facebook gave developers access to user data after it had insisted otherwise. The paper disclosed an SEC probe the following month. At the same time, concerns about the platform’s use in lynchings in India and violence in Myanmar began to rise.The company itself disclosed a security issue in September. In November, as Larry Ramer pointed out, the New York Times reported that COO Sheryl Sandberg had tried to keep Russian misinformation efforts quiet – and that a Facebook-hired lobbying firm had tried to tie Facebook opponents to billionaire activist (and target of right-wing disdain) George Soros.Now, the company is being sued by the District of Columbia. And the Times is reporting that the company gave away much more data than it disclosed to partners including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). FB stock is down nearly 5% on the news.Can we be sure that no more bad news is on the way? And do investors really want to wake up every morning waiting for the next shoe to drop – and for Facebook stock to do the same?The Management Problem for FB StockFacebook admittedly has had more than its share of problems of late. But it’s also done a terrible job responding to those problems. The company increasingly seems tone-deaf and authoritarian. Sandberg hemmed and hawed her way through the Soros scandal. She first denied any knowledge that the company had hired lobbying firm Definers. The Facebook COO then acknowledged that “some of their work was incorporated into materials presented to me and I received a small number of emails where Definers was referenced” – in a post that the company tried to bury by releasing it on the day before Thanksgiving.CEO Mark Zuckerberg seems to alternate between saying the problems aren’t that big, will be fixed, have to be fixed, or already have been fixed. A post from another Facebook executive in regard to Wednesday’s Times story insisted that no data was released without users’ permission – then pointed out that most of the features were shut down anyway, while the company is “already in the process of reviewing all our APIs”. Which is it? Does anyone trust that response at this point?There’s simply a constant perception here that Facebook has something to hide. There’s a consistent response of “delay, deny, and deflect,” as the Times put it. Even beyond that, there’s a sense that Facebook can’t even control itself. Why are privacy issues only being reviewed in 2018? Why was data privacy not a greater focus in the past?Story continues  10 Small-Cap Stocks That Look Like Bargains  Even giving the company the benefit of the doubt, it repeatedly seems like Facebook itself is surprised to see all the ways in which its data can be abused. That further erodes confidence in management at this point.Will Users Leave?The risk in the near- to mid-term is that users will stop giving Facebook the benefit of the doubt. The story of Facebook stock can’t be separated from the story of Facebook users, as I wrote in April. The #DeleteFacebook movement fizzled out, admittedly. And user growth has been stable, if slowing (that’s hardly surprising given the sheer size of the user base).But bad news and clumsy responses are going to affect Facebook’s brand image. And once defections start, they may not stop. Facebook is the classic beneficiary of the “network effect”: each incremental user adds to the experience and value of the existing base. It’s fun to go to Facebook because everyone is on Facebook.That effect works in reverse as well. Users now have multiple reasons to leave the platform – or at least limit their usage. Some may not want to further line Zuckerberg’s already full pockets. Others may see too much privacy risk. For some (myself included), the sheen has worn off.This isn’t to say that Facebook necessarily is the next Myspace. WhatsApp and Instagram can cushion any weakness in the namesake platform. But even at 17x earnings, user declines probably aren’t priced in.Are Regulators Coming?Big tech firms are seeing increased political risk – and Facebook probably faces the most at the moment. It’s alienated liberals by attacking Soros and allowing Russian disinformation to spread. Conservatives believe the platform, and the company, have an intrinsic left-wing bias. Facebook probably doesn’t have many allies in Congress – or the White House.I’m skeptical a legally-forced breakup of Facebook is on the way. But stranger things have happened. At the least, Facebook already is facing increasing regulation around privacy in Europe. U.S. regulators and legislators could follow.And because of its missteps of late, Facebook has put itself in the crosshairs. Zuckerberg just a few years ago appeared a wholesome American success story. He now looks like a villain in many citizens’ eyes. As such, politicians can score points attacking Facebook now. The more bad news that gets released, the higher those scores go.  10 Best Stocks to Buy That Represent the Future  The broad point is that the bad news for Facebook likely isn’t over. And the effects of that bad news are unclear. At the least, the risks to Facebook stock from user fatigue and political action are rising. As long as that continues, FB stock will stay stuck at best.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.More From InvestorPlace  2 Toxic Pot Stocks You Should Avoid    10 Small-Cap Stocks That Look Like Bargains    7 Trade War Losers Set to Become Big 2019 Winners    5 Oil Stocks to Buy Even If Oil Prices Keep Falling   Compare Brokers The post 4 Reasons to Sell Facebook Stock Near the Lows appeared first on InvestorPlace.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatch3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Watch in AprilMotley FoolWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolNOT REAL NEWS: A look at what didn't happen this weekAssociated PressMom's Post About Putting Kids in Timeout During Tantrums Goes ViralParentsZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolHere's What Hedge Funds Think About NIO Inc.

That turned out to be a huge mistake: The stock subsequently surged into triple-digit territory.I've been hesitant to get back into Facebook, but I finally pulled the trigger after its post-earnings plunge in late July. Here are my top five reasons for buying the stock again.A cloud of people representing social connections.MoreImage source: Getty Images.1. It's still posting impressive growthFacebook's revenue rose 42% annually to $13.2 billion last quarter, but missed estimates by $120 million and represented the company's slowest growth in nearly three years. It expects that growth rate to further decelerate by high single digits over the next few quarters.That slowdown sounds alarming, but a 20%-30% growth rate would still be impressive. It also indicates that Facebook plans to monetize its users more carefully in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Wall Street still expects Facebook's revenue to rise 37% this year and 25% next year, so its high-growth days certainly aren't over.Facebook is also still incredibly profitable. Its operating margin slipped three percentage points to 44% last quarter, but its net income rose 31% to $5.1 billion as its EPS rose 32% to $1.74, topping expectations by three cents. Analysts expect Facebook's earnings to grow 33% this year and 16% next year.2. It trades at historically low valuationsAt $175, Facebook trades at nine times next year's sales and 21 times next year's earnings. Those are both historically low valuations for the company, and they're easily justified by its forward growth rates.FB PS Ratio (TTM) ChartMoreFB PS Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsFor comparison, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) trades at about 26 times forward earnings, compared to analyst projections of 23% growth this year and 21% growth next year.3. It's still gaining new active users and monetizing themFacebook is still the largest social network in the world by a wide margin. Last quarter its monthly active users (MAUs) rose 11% annually to 2.23 billion, as its daily active users (DAUs) grew 11% to 1.47 billion.The fact that Facebook's revenue growth continues to outpace its active user growth indicates that its average revenue per user is still rising. This isn't surprising, since Facebook and Alphabet's Google hold a near-duopoly on internet ads across many markets (including the United States).Story continuesMoreover, Facebook's business model, based on crafting targeted ads based on users' social profiles and connections, is arguably superior to Google's less-personalized model of using search, browsing, and location queries.4. It still has plenty of new revenue streamsMany investors often forget that Facebook also owns Instagram, which has over a billion MAUs, and WhatsApp, which has over 1.5 billion MAUs. Facebook's own Messenger app, which it's expanded as a stand-alone platform for mini-apps, reaches over 1.3 billion MAUs.Facebook only recently started monetizing these platforms, with more ads in Instagram, business-oriented features in WhatsApp, and the introduction of new services like mobile payments and games in Messenger.A woman checks social media messages on her phone.MoreImage source: Getty Images.Last quarter Facebook stated that 400 million people were already sharing Instagram Stories, the new feature which it launched to counter Snap's (NYSE: SNAP) Snapchat Stories, and that 450 million people were using WhatsApp Status, which lets user send ephemeral texts, photos, videos, and GIFs like Snapchat.Earlier this year KeyBanc analyst Andy Hargreaves estimated that Instagram could generate nearly $9 billion in annual revenues this year (equivalent to 16% of its estimated sales), and eventually $22 billion in sales by 2022. Therefore, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger -- and possibly even Oculus VR -- will give Facebook plenty of ways to monetize users beyond its core social network.5. Its growing pains should be temporaryMany American investors seemed to lose faith in Facebook after the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Yet the company continued to grow its user base, and the data breach and controversy over Facebook's role in the 2016 election aren't major news stories in overseas markets.Facebook has already introduced new measures to tighten its privacy settings and combat fake news and propaganda accounts. If Facebook gets past these growing pains, it could emerge as a stronger and more mature tech company.Should you buy Facebook too?Facebook isn't a stock for everyone. Some investors may have ethical objections with its business model, or consider the stock too volatile. However, I think investors who buy Facebook on this prolonged dip should be well-rewarded in the future as the social media company evolves.

The user base is still small, and many big companies are leery of investing. In 2019, however, we could see some shifts in the VR landscape as new hardware and software are introduced. Here are the five companies I'll be watching to see where VR is headed. Digitized woman in VR headset.MoreImage source: Getty Images.FacebookIt may be a small part of Facebook's business, but Oculus is a giant in the world of virtual reality. It's one of the two main high-end VR devices -- along with HTC Vive -- and Oculus is quickly expanding its VR platform. In 2018 it launched the Oculus Go, a low-end device that's great for 360 videos and comes at an accessible price point of $200.In 2019 Oculus expects to launch the Quest headset, which will be the first high-end stand-alone VR headset, at a price point of $400. The product could make VR much more accessible to consumers, and help increase the install base beyond the few million units in the market today. Facebook is trying to become the platform of choice for VR consumers and developers. If the Oculus Quest goes well, 2019 could be the year it takes a big step in that direction. SonyIt may sound surprising, but Sony (NYSE: SNE) is actually the leader in virtual reality headsets worldwide. In August the company passed 3 million PSVR headsets sold, far exceeding around 1 million for Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. Sony has the benefit of having sold over 73 million PS4 units, which power the PS4 headset, but users seem to like the device's value proposition over competitors.The challenge for Sony will be staying ahead of devices like the HTC Vive Pro, which brings better graphics and performance for high-end users, and Oculus Quest, which will be great for the masses. PS4's computing power will ultimately be a limiting factor for PSVR unless the company decides to upgrade in 2019.Rumor has it that Sony will upgrade PSVR when it releases PS5, which should be out in 2020 or 2021. That's a long time to wait for another headset upgrade, but for the leading VR headset on the market today it's the best that enthusiasts are going to get. Video games' power trioConspicuously absent from the VR industry thus far have been Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI), Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA), and Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ: TTWO). They look at the relatively small install base of VR headsets compared to PC, console, and mobile, which combined have billions of potential customers, and just don't see an opportunity worth investing in... yet. I think 2019 could be the year at least one of these companies dips its toes into the VR waters. Quest's introduction should help expand the market and improve the accessibility of the technology. If the install base of that device reaches a million or more in the first few months, it could make the industry more enticing for large developers. They also don't want to risk losing the industry to upstart competitors. Population: One, a Fortnite-like VR game, is expected to be introduced by BigBox VR in spring 2019, and games like Beat Saber are growing in popularity. These could be the equivalent of Candy Crush or Clash of Clans, which took over mobile, building a brand and user base lead that big game makers can only acquire, not build organically themselves. Someone needs to be an early mover, but who will it be?Story continuesVR will have a big year, one way or anotherGiven all of the developments coming to the VR industry, 2019 is going to be a big year. Either the billions of dollars of development money will start to pay off, or they won't. I tend to believe the technology is good enough and content is coming out fast enough for adoption to grow, and Facebook, Sony, and video game companies could be big winners. But the industry has had high hopes before, only to be dashed by weak adoption rates -- and ultimately the user base size will decide if 2019 is a good year for VR.  More From The Motley Fool   10 Best Stocks to Buy Today    3 Stocks That Are Absurdly Cheap Right Now    5 Warren Buffett Principles to Remember in a Volatile Stock Market    The $16,728 Social Security Bonus You Cannot Afford to Miss    The Must-Read Trump Quote on Social Security    10 Reasons Why I'm Selling All of My Apple Stock  Travis Hoium has no position in any of the stocks mentioned and owns a virtual reality start-up.

On Tuesday, Marcus published a post outlining the six major trends, or themes, he sees influencing Messenger — and its 1.3 billion monthly active users — throughout the year.His predictions outline a mix of logical extensions and course-corrections for the messaging service he joined in 2014. More real-time features If 2017’s deluge of political and pop culture news reinforced anything, it was that on-the-fly communication proved instrumental, not just for keeping in touch, but for keeping tabs on what happened in the world. There were grim stories of sexual harassment in Hollywood posted across social media; there were survivors of natural disasters who communicated their safety on Facebook (FB). And, of course, there were President Donald Trump’s tweets. Regardless of the kind of content, those examples illustrated the klout of messaging and social media once again. To wit, Marcus foresees Messenger rolling out more ways to make sure users stay connected, whether it’s in the U.S. or in emerging markets. “This year, you’ll see us continue investing in real-time communications to make sure that no matter where you are, you can easily stay connected to your loved ones,” Marcus wrote in the post. “No one wants to miss a special moment, but real-time communication is what connects us in times of crisis too… and we unfortunately saw more than our share of that last year.” Beefier group chatsGroup chat was one of Messenger’s most popular features. In 2017 alone, the messaging service said 2.5 million new group chats were created on Messenger everyday, with the average group chat having 10 people. In addition to group chat features rolled out last year, like the @mentions ability to call out someone in a chat by their username, Marcus suggested that the Messenger group chat experience will grow further in 2018, by, for instance, finding ways to integrate group chat into live video group chat.  A more streamlined experience While Messenger grew to 1.3 billion monthly active users in September, it also got flack by some tech media for trying to do too much. As part of Facebook’s larger push to emulate Snapchat’s Stories, for example, Messenger launched a similar feature of its own at the beginning of last year — a feature that was consolidated with Facebook Stories in November. Earlier this month, the Messenger team said M, the human-powered personal digital assistant being tested with some 2,000 users, would be retired. A Facebook spokesperson told Yahoo Finance in early January that Facebook would take its learnings from M and use them to power other artificial intelligence-related projects at the social network. “Over the last two years, we built a lot of capabilities to find the features that continue to set us apart,” Marcus explained. “A lot of them have found their product market fit; some haven’t. While we raced to build these new features, the app became too cluttered. Expect to see us invest in massively simplifying and streamlining Messenger this year.”More visual ways to communicate Marcus thinks visual messaging — using images, videos, GIFs and stickers — to “fully explode.” That’s probably of little surprise to some, given Messenger users sent over 500 billion emojis and shared 18 billion animated GIFs last year in 2017. Expect Messenger to roll out even more ways for users to visually express themselves, as it works to draw more emoji-loving, GIF-happy teens and millennials to its service. Messaging as a preferred method of customer service Likewise, Marcus also remains bullish on messaging platforms shouldering more customer service requests, as more people learn they can message and interact with companies on platforms like Messenger rather than having to dial a company’s customer service number the old-fashioned way. To wit, according to a Facebook-commissioned study by Nielsen published in December, 56% of people prefer to message a business rather than call customer service, while 67% of those same people expect to message businesses even more over the next two years.“While calling still plays a prominent role in customer service, this has opened the door for brands and businesses to communicate with their customers in a variety of new ways to not only respond to issues or one-off questions, but to offer an up-sell opportunity to benefit both people and the business,” Marcus wrote. Story continuesMessaging as a marketing channelMore and more, Marcus has learned that people expect to find businesses with some sort of messaging component: a live chat box on a company’s website, a customer service chat bot inside an app, or the ability to interact with a business on a full-blown service like Messenger. Likewise, more marketers over the past 12 months have expressed interest in using messaging as a way to connect with their customers. “We’ve been encouraged to see that bigger brand names are bringing a presence to Messenger (LEGO, Katy Perry, Apple Music) which signals the acceptance from CMOs [chief marketing officers] that it’s time to create a unique and effective experience that can reach more people at scale,” Marcus wrote. “Look for investment in rich messaging experiences, not only from global brands, but small businesses who need to be creative and nimble to stay competitive.” While Facebook has taken heat at times over tweaks and changes — last week’s controversial News Feed changes come to mind — Marcus’s pledge to simplify Messenger in some ways, while doubling down on popular features such as group chat should be well-received as the service works to snag its next 1 billion users. —JP Mangalindan is the Chief Tech Correspondent for Yahoo Finance covering the intersection of tech and business. Email story tips and musings to jpm@oath.com. Follow him on Twitter or Facebook.More from JP:AMD CEO: Our processors are more affordable than Intel’sAmazon Alexa and Google Assistant duke it out at CES Sennheiser co-CEO: Why we’re betting on AR and VR with 3-D audioAMD CEO on chip security flaws: ‘We’re absolutely all over’ securitySamsung’s plan to dominate the self-driving car industryHarman Kardon wants to lighten your mood with MoodscapeSamsung to offer one app to rule all your devicesAmazon: Yahoo Finance’s Company of the YearAmazon Web Services CEO: We’re going to see an ‘explosion’ of voice appsFacebook named the No. 1 place to work in the USFacebook targets 6- to 12-year-old demographic with Messenger Kids Facebook publishes ad rules in wake of Russias revelations ‘Scandal’ creator Shonda Rhimes: Why I left ABC for NetflixIntuit CEO: Old-school accountants will be ‘struggling in 5 years’ because of A.I.How Amazon quickly trains 120,000 employees for the holidaysFollow Yahoo Finance on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool5 Ways The Smart Money is Playing the Billion Dollar Satellite Internet TrendInsider Monkey'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceChristchurch shooting videos are still on Facebook over a month laterEngadgetAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolWhy Livestreaming TV Can't Break ThroughMotley FoolWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCThe Boeing 737 MAX Is 1 Step Closer to Flying Again -- but Don't Expect to See It SoonMotley FoolReport: FTC considering oversight of Facebook's ZuckerbergAssociated PressMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo Finance

So when a stock is upgraded, or more rarely, downgraded, the market takes note. This is especially the case for a market-leading stock like Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) — see below!We used TipRanks to find the most interesting recent stock ratings- and zeroed in on the stocks with a ‘Strong Buy’ Street consensus. Why is the sentiment now shifting for these seven stocks? Could it be that the market is looking more optimistic?“I’m not a real positive guy, but I’m starting to turn more positive. We’re starting to see good things across the marketplace. Value is being uncovered,” Wells Fargo Securities’ Chris Harvey told CNBC on May 6.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHe continues: “You don’t have to run. It’s really selective, be slow, be methodical and look for opportunities,” Harvey said. “It’s a walk, not run-type of situation.”  The Top 20 Stocks of 2018  So with this in mind, let’s dive in now and find out what these seven stock upgrades are all about. It’s time to get bullish:[Editor’s Note: This story was originally published on May 14, 2018. It has since been updated and republished to reflect new information.]Strong Buy Stock: Dynavax Technologies (DVAX)Source: ShutterstockCutting-edge biotech stock Dynavax Technologies Corp (NASDAQ:DVAX) now has JP Morgan’s seal of approval. The move comes ahead of the all-important ASCO conference on June 1-5. DVAX will present key clinical trial data on its immunotherapy treatments for cancer. Most notably, this will include a Phase 2 melanoma update for Dynavax’s lead product candidate SD-101.Top JP Morgan analyst Anupam Rama believes the market is vastly underestimating the potential of this drug. The stock’s current valuation ignores the early signs of efficacy demonstrated by SD-101 says Rama. Encouragingly, Dynavax has committed to initiate a Phase 3 trial in melanoma by the end of this year and in head and neck cancer in early 2019.He adds: “We believe the recent downside has created an interesting entry point ahead of ASCO, additional SD-101 readouts in 2018 and the Heplisav launch long-term.” This is especially true when you consider that Heplisav is a “best-in-class Hepatitis B vaccine.” The vaccine has already been launched in the US with a 60-person field sales team.In conjunction with the rating upgrade, Rama boosted his price target from $25 to $27 (38% upside potential). The new rating also brings Rama in line with Street consensus. Our data shows that the stock currently floats a ‘Strong Buy’ rating with five recent bullish calls. These analysts have a $30 average price target (53% upside potential).What’s more, Cantor Firzgerald’s Elemer Piros reiterated a “buy” rating on DVAX stock just nine days ago. Piros noted that Dynavax’s Heplisav-B has “demonstrated higher protection in general patient groups and in high-risk patient populations…”Strong Buy Stock: Facebook (FB)fbMoreSource: ShutterstockFive-star Stifel Nicolaus analyst Scott Devitt is one of the Top 50 analysts on TipRanks. His stock picking ability is second-to-none (this 25% average return per rating). But even top analysts can make mistakes. “Post-1Q earnings, we chose to stick with our recent view on Facebook and were wrong to do so. With the information available now, FB stock is too cheap to ignore despite its challenges” stated Devitt on April 26.Story continuesDevitt downgraded the stock in early January and explains why here: “We became concerned about Facebook on the heels of survey data suggesting platform fatigue. Our views were emboldened when Mr. Zuckerberg began to discuss fixing Facebook in 2018.”Now, however, “we may be getting closer to the other side in these areas of concern and valuation may provide the support to see us through.” Plus FB has the benefit of key growth drivers like WhatsApp, Instagram and video to ‘fuel above-market ad revenue growth for the next several years.’We can see that his FB upgrade comes with a $202 price target. That translates into 8% upside from current levels. However, this is still far below the Street.  7 Stocks Paying Monthly Dividends That You Should Consider Buying  Based on the last three months of ratings, analysts have an average FB price target of $220. This suggests more appealing upside potential of 18%. Thirty out of 32 recent analyst ratings on FB are bullish.Strong Buy Stock: MDC Partners (MDCA)sbacmsnMoreSource: ShutterstockKeep a close eye on small-cap MDC Partners Inc. (NASDAQ:MDCA) — an intriguing marketing and communications network. Most interestingly, MDC was recently upgraded by five-star Wells Fargo analyst Peter Stabler. He has a $10 price target on the stock (130% upside potential).So what prompted this move? According to Stabler, shares offer compelling valuation and favorable risk/reward. Weighed down by disappointing Q1 earnings results, shares are now at $4.35, down from over $7 five days ago.“Though MDC’s results this quarter again remind us that the company’s small size can lead to higher volatility, we continue to view the macro marketing landscape as generally more favorable for smaller agency players” the analyst argued. He concluded, “we continue to believe future margin upside is possible.”Three top analysts have published recent buy ratings on MDCA. With an $11.50 average price target, these analysts are projecting upside potential of over 160%.Strong Buy Stock: Voyager Therapeutics (VYGR)Source: ShutterstockVoyager Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VYGR) is developing intriguing gene therapies for neurological diseases. Case in point: the company is working with AbbVie Inc (NYSE:ABBV) to develop a revolutionary Alzheimer’s treatment. The deal includes a $69 million upfront payment to Voyager and more than $1 billion in potential milestone payments.However, Voyager shares plunged recently, dropping 34% in March. Bear in mind though that on a year-to-date basis, shares are still up 10%. The move downwards was enough to convince top Wedbush analyst David Nierengarten to return to the Voyager bull story. He blamed confusing hedging language in Voyager’s 10Q filing as part of the reason for the fall.Now the risk/ reward ratio is much more compelling says Nierengarten — especially ahead of the pivotal trial for VY-AADC. This is the company’s lead product candidate for the treatment of Advanced Parkinson’s disease.  5 Tech Stocks That Will Turn It Around Soon  His $28 price target indicates massive upside potential of over 50%. In total, this stock has scored eight consecutive buy ratings in the last three months. From the current share price, analysts are projecting big growth of over 98%, with five-star analyst Dane Leone recently slapping VYGR shares with a “buy” rating and a $32 price target.Strong Buy Stock: New Relic Inc (NEWR)Source: ShutterstockSoftware vendor New Relic, Inc. (NYSE:NEWR) has just reported earnings results that crushed expectations. Post report, shares jumped 18% on May 9. The move came as investors digested an impressive 34% revenue growth. The company, which helps businesses track and quickly fix software bugs, ascribed the beat to an increase in spending per customer.“We’ll obviously be getting new customers, but the average spend we expect to continue to go up in our existing folks,” said CFO Mark Sachleben during the earnings call. “We saw some great metrics around that this past year.”On the news top BMO Capital analyst Keith Bachman upgraded NR from “hold” to “buy.” He also bumped up his price target to $95 (from $83). According to Bachman, the company’s “competitive advantage in leveraging large performance data sets to help deliver value.” He also describes himself as “encouraged” by customer revenue growth.“We continue to see good opportunities for more expansion/upside as APM [application performance management] penetration grows, Infrastructure gains momentum, and new machine learning and analytics-driven opportunities emerge” commented top Oppenheimer analyst Ittai Kidron on May 9.Strong Buy Stock: NiSource (NI)Source: Andy Arthur via FlickrNiSource, Inc (NYSE:NI) serves nearly four million natural gas and electric customers across seven states. And now Goldman Sachs has upgraded NI because it ‘deserves a premium valuation’. Not from Hold to Buy as you might expect, but from Buy to Conviction Buy. NI is now one of an elite alpha-generating group of stocks that Goldman Sachs expects to outperform.“[We] view this defensive, small-cap utility as one of our top ideas into [the second half of 2018],” says Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Lapides.Above-average EPS, dividend growth and an attractive valuation all bode well for share prices. However, Lapides is particularly excited about the “next leg of the NI story” and sees multiple upward EPS revisions for 2019 and beyond. His $30 price target indicates upside potential of just over 20%.  10 Stocks That Are Screaming Buys Right Now  In total, NI has scored four recent buy ratings from top analysts. These analysts see NI shares spiking 8.3% to $27 in the coming months.Strong Buy Stock: Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT)Source: ShutterstockSarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRPT) is a commercial-stage biopharma, which focuses on the treatment of rare neuromuscular diseases. Primarily, the company is busy developing its product candidates for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). And even a spate of unwelcome news (including a regulatory setback in Europe) hasn’t dampened investor enthusiasm.Shares are up by over 68% in the last three months, with strong demand for Exondys 51 boosting prices. This is the first Duchenne muscular dystrophy (“DMD”) treatment to gain approval in the U.S. since September 2016. Management projects the peak annual sales potential of its late-stage DMD drugs- which include Exondys 51- at a whopping $2 billion.Barclays’ Gena Wang comments:“While we see limited EU opportunity for Exondys 51, and some risk in golodirsen approval based on biomarker data, a good safety profile of PPMO assets could replace suboptimal PMO franchise. We expect a reasonable chance for SRPT’s microdystrophin program to show promising clinical activity.”Indeed the PPMO platform of drugs could be “ten times more effective” than Exondys 51 according to Sarepta’s CEO Doug Ingram.As a result, this five-star analyst upgraded SRPT from Hold to Buy on May 11. Her new rating comes with a bullish price target of $107. Overall, our data show that this ‘Strong Buy’ stock has scored 16 recent top analyst buy ratings versus only two hold ratings. These analysts have an average SRPT price target of $98.64.Which stocks are the top 25 analysts recommending right now? Find out here.TipRanks offers investors the latest insight into eight different sectors by tracking the activity of 4,500 analysts, 5,000 financial bloggers and even 37,000 corporate insiders.

Is a Must-Own StockLuke LangoInvestorPlaceMay 14, 2018ReblogShareTweetShareFacebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) recently fell victim to what was arguably its worst PR incident ever after a whistle-blower exposed a data leak that happened in 2015 regarding political analytics firm Cambridge Analytica.A few weeks later, Facebook reported what was arguably its best earnings report ever.Facebook reported its best financial results ever against the backdrop of its worst PR incident ever. That is shocking. More importantly, it’s a testament to just how powerful and necessary the Facebook machine has become.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs such, Facebook stock has rallied off its post-Cambridge Analytica lows of $150 to trade in the $180’s. That is right around where it was trading prior to the data leak news hitting the wire.Have you missed the rally?Hardly. This was just a rebound. A minor blip in the overall upward trajectory for Facebook stock.This upward trajectory will persist. Facebook stock is supported by some of the strongest fundamentals in the market, with a big growth narrative converging on a relatively discounted valuation. That creates a compelling opportunity to buy and hold FB stock for the long-run.Facebook is so massive that it has become an integral part of how the internet functions, and it is poised not only to grow more, but to provide more services in one place — and the markets are not currently valuing it this way.Here’s an in-depth look at why Facebook stock is a must-own here and now:1. 2 out of 3 People Who Can Have a Facebook Account, Do Have a Facebook AccountPerhaps the most important and most attractive thing about Facebook is its size.The social media behemoth has 2.2 billion monthly active users. The world has about 7.6 billion people, and of those, only roughly 4.1 billion have access to the internet. About 800 million of those internet users are in China, where Facebook is blocked. Therefore, the global internet population that has legal access to Facebook numbers around 3.3 billion.Again, Facebook has 2.2 billion monthly active users. That means that essentially 2 out of every 3 people in the world that can have a Facebook, do have a Facebook account.No other company in the world has that scale. Not Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Not Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX). And not even Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) or Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).Facebook is on its own playing field in terms of global size, reach and scale.And that doesn’t even consider Facebook’s newly minted “Family of Apps”. Those 2.2 billion monthly active users are on the core Facebook platform alone. Facebook has another 1.5 billion monthly users on WhatsApp, 1.3 billion monthly users on Messenger, and 800 million monthly users on Instagram.  5 Tech Stocks That Will Turn It Around Soon  Put it all together, and that is 5.8 billion users. Granted, there is heavy overlap between users, so it isn’t 5.8 billion distinct users. But the entire Facebook ecosystem essentially acts like and has the power of a platform that has 5.8 billion combined monthly users because what matters isn’t distinct users, but rather, the number of eyeballs you capture and for how long you capture them (if a user goes from Facebook to Messenger to Instagram, that same user will have used 3 different apps, but stayed within the Facebook ecosystem the whole time).2. Facebook Is the Internet IDIn many senses, Facebook’s massive size is its greatest asset. Because it is so big, Facebook has become an irreplaceable part of the internet.I like to think of Facebook as the internet ID. In the physical world, everyone has a physical ID that they use to identify themselves and get into places. If you are walking into a bank, they ask for your ID to confirm identity. If you get pulled over by the cops, they also ask for your ID. And if you want to a drink at a restaurant or a bar, chances are they will be asking for your ID, too.fbMoreStory continuesSource: ShutterstockFacebook is exactly this for the digital world. Facebook is your digital ID, complete with a profile picture, life details like birth-date and workplace, and a list of friends and recent activity. Because of this, it has all the information and data that anyone needs to identify you. Also, because everyone has a Facebook, it is a universal means for digital identification.This is why there are so many “Login with Facebook” options across the internet.Streaming music platform Spotify Technology SA (NYSE:SPOT) uses “Login with Facebook”. So does dating app Tinder — owned by  Match Group Inc (NASDAQ:MTCH). As do ride-sharing app Uber, rent-sharing app Airbnb, social payments platform Venmo — owned by Paypal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL), professional networking site LinkedIn — owned by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), sports news platform ESPN (a Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) property), and many, many more.They all use this feature because: 1) it is easier, 2) everyone has a Facebook, 3) is it arguably more secure, and 4) Facebook has all the data in the world that any of them need in order to get started on creating a personalized account for new users. It doesn’t matter that Facebook is in direct competition with some of these companies. That’s how vital Facebook has become.From this perspective, it is easy to see how Facebook’s size and data have allowed it become to the internet’s ID. In doing so, Facebook has become part of the underlying fabric of the internet.Moreover, because Facebook’s database is so large, the company has indeed become an irreplaceable part of the internet. Facebook has relevant information data on more than 2 billion people globally. Until another platform can rival that scale, Facebook is irreplaceable.3. Facebook’s Size Is Also Its Greatest Financial WeaponFrom a financial perspective, Facebook’s size is so important for two reasons: 1) unparalleled reach and 2) unparalleled targeting abilities. All advertisers want is the most bang for their buck, and that means max reach with max engagement. Facebook is the only platform that maximizes both due to its size.On a raw basis, its 2 billion-plus user base is unrivaled, and naturally, Facebook offers the most global reach for advertisers. On a deeper lever, Facebook has a lot of data on 2 billion people-plus, and can use that unparalleled database to create unparalleled targeted advertising solutions. Thus, Facebook’s size allows it to offer advertisers max reach with max engagement, a combination which has allowed Facebook to dominate other social media peers in the digital advertising space.Moreover, Facebook’s size makes it a successful imitator. Case and point: Instagram Stories and WhatsApp Status. Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) was killing Facebook for several years and teens were ditching Facebook and flocking to Snapchat. Then, Facebook cloned Snapchat’s core feature, Stories, and put it into its app ecosystem.The net result was that because of the initial size of Instagram and WhatsApp, Instagram Stories and WhatsApp Status became huge hits. Now, Facebook is behind the two largest Stories platforms in the world.Facebook’s size allows it do this replication in essentially any space, and be successful in doing so. That is why Facebook Dating poses a meaningful threat to Match Group Inc (NASDAQ:MTCH), and why Facebook can jump into almost any business that it wants to.4. Facebook User Growth Is High in Low Internet Penetration MarketsA lot of folks are concerned that the growth in Facebook’s user base has stalled out. While the numbers support this slowing growth trend, I don’t think it’s fair to say that Facebook is done growing its user base.User growth has come down from 30% to 20% to 15% and lower over the past several years. But that is simply a result of the law of large numbers. Once you get to a point where 2 out of every 3 internet users is on your platform, user growth is naturally going to slow.Source: ShutterstockBut don’t underestimate the global internet growth narrative.Roughly 95% of the entire North American population is on the internet. That is a maxed out market. As such, Facebook’s US & Canada monthly user base grew by only 3% last quarter.Europe also has a pretty high internet penetration rate of 85%. That is also a maxed out market. Not surprisingly, Facebook’s Europe monthly user base growth was also weak. It grew just 7% last quarter.Everywhere else, however, is a completely different story.Asia’s internet penetration rate is below 50%, while Facebook’s Asia-Pacific monthly user base grew by an impressive 22% last quarter.In other parts of the world, the internet penetration rate is right around 50%, which is why Facebook’s Rest of World monthly user base grew by 12% last quarter.Overall, what we see is not too surprising. In markets where internet penetration is high, Facebook user growth is slow, around 3-7%. But in geographies where internet penetration is still low and growing, Facebook user growth is still strong, in the 10% to 20%-plus range.5. Facebook Could Hit 3 Billion Users SoonOn a global scale, it looks Facebook still has a ways to go in terms of user growth.The global internet penetration rate is just 55%, miles below North America’s rate of 95%. Presumably, internet usage globally is only growing, and that 55% global rate will continue to grind higher towards 95%. As that happens, Facebook’s total addressable market will expand. If Facebook can maintain its share in that growing market, then Facebook’s user base could easily keep growing at a healthy rate for the next 5-10 years.  The Bottom Line on a Really Encouraging Earnings Season  How much bigger can it get?Well, it is unlikely global internet penetration rates hit North America levels, but a 70% rate seems achievable in 5-10 years. Assuming global population heads towards 8 billion, then that would imply 5.6 billion global internet users, including China. Assuming Facebook maintains a roughly 53% penetration rate among global internet users (including China), then you are looking at nearly 3 billion Facebook users in 5-10 years.And that doesn’t even include the billion-plus users on WhatsApp and Messenger, and the nearly billion users on Instagram. Thanks to global internet expansion, those numbers will head higher, as well.6. Messenger and WhatsApp Give The Advertising Business a Lot of Unused FirepowerUser growth through global internet usage expansion is a promising growth driver for Facebook stock going forward.But it isn’t the only one.Indeed, Facebook stock’s explosion in 2015, 2016, and 2017 from $80 to $180 was largely driven by a ramp in monetization trends. Namely, Facebook started monetizing Instagram, and that added extra firepower to average revenue per user (ARPU) growth.For the longest time, Facebook wasn’t making any money from Instagram. It was just a platform with a ton of users but not many ads and not much money running through the system.Then, in 2015, Facebook decided to get serious about putting ads on Instagram and making money from the platform. I remember the initial gut reaction from users was: “Ugh! More ads? I’m going to stop using Instagram so much.” But that never happened. Because the ads were non-intrusive and actually relevant (thanks to the company’s huge database), nobody quit Instagram. Instead, the platform’s user base has nearly tripled since then from 300 million to 800 million.Meanwhile, Facebook started making a ton of money off Instagram.Between 2011 and 2014, Facebook’s domestic ARPU grew at a 41% rate from roughly $3 to roughly $9. During that same stretch, global ARPU grew at a 27% clip from roughly $1.40 to around $2.80.Once Facebook started seriously monetizing Instagram in 2015, everything changed. For the better.From 2014 to 2017, Facebook’s domestic ARPU grew at a 44% rate to nearly $27. Global ARPU, meanwhile, grew at a 30% clip to nearly $6.20.In other words, despite dramatically increasing scale and tougher laps, Facebook’s unit monetization growth actually accelerated in 2014-17 versus 2011-14.Why? Instagram.Now, the Instagram ad ramp is largely in the rear-view window, but Facebook is still sitting on two other, much larger platforms that have yet to be monetized in Messenger and WhatsApp. That means Facebook stock has two Instagram-like catalysts still in the pipeline.Facebook has barely monetized these platforms so far. Right now, Messenger only has ads on the contact list, which are unintrusive to the point that many users don’t register them. (Facebook’s most recent earnings mention Messenger as a component of ad revenue, but don’t spike out the individual numbers for the app.)  WhatsApp has no ads.Thus far, management hasn’t figured out the ideal way to monetize on a messaging app, whether it be through ads or social commerce or anything else. Eventually, though, management will figure this out. At that point in time, Facebook will start making big bucks from Messenger and WhatsApp.Financially, that means that ARPU, although it is really big right now, could get a lot bigger. If so, Facebook stock could explode higher.7. Watch & Workplace Are Big Growth Drivers for Facebook StockUp until this point, this article has focused exclusively on Facebook’s advertising business and why that business isn’t going to slow anytime soon. As a result, Facebook stock should head higher even if Facebook was just its advertising business.But it’s not.Facebook stock has been hammered, falling 20% from the highs it made just last month. While hard to do, it's time to start nibbling FB stock.MoreFacebook is building out multiple nascent hyper-growth businesses that could one day be huge contributors to both the top and bottom lines. The sum of these businesses not only strength the fundamentals supporting Facebook stock, but also add significant longevity to Facebook stock’s growth narrative.First, there is Facebook Watch. Facebook launched Watch in mid-2017 after it become crystal clear that streaming on-demand entertainment was the way of the future. At that time, Netflix was just carving up the traditional cable industry, and there was a massive shift happening from the cable model to the streaming model. As such, Facebook launched Watch to get into this space.Watch hasn’t made much of a splash just yet, but again, it is only matter of time before Watch scales into something meaningful. After all, Facebook does have the largest potential streaming audience in the world (2 billion-plus users) and a whole bunch of cash on the balance sheet. Thus, once Facebook appropriately deploys its massive amount of resources to developing and/or acquiring content, Facebook will be able to stream that content to the largest on-demand, streaming audience in the world.Considering how much money Netflix is making in the streaming world, Facebook Watch could easily morph into a huge money-maker for Facebook stock.  7 Consumer Goods Stocks That Will Rise Again  Second, there is Facebook Workplace, which is a highly undervalued part of the Facebook business. Workplace is the social network’s enterprise edition. It’s essentially a cloud-based communication tool designed for businesses of all sizes. And, it’s exactly like Slack, the hyper-growth start-up which has made a killing selling enterprise communication tools.Formerly known as Facebook at Work, Workplace debuted in October 2016 to very little fanfare. Most investors have since forgotten about it. But Workplace scored a big win last year by signing on the world’s biggest employer, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT). And that will likely be only the first in a series of major wins for Workplace as enterprise social networking goes mainstream (IDC expects the ESN market to grow at a 19% clip annually to $3.5 billion by 2019).Facebook makes money off of Workplace by charging a subscription fee. At $3 per month per user for premium, Workplace could easily scale into a material revenue stream for Facebook if the ESN market gains momentum over the next several years.8. Marketplace & Native Payments Are Bigger Growth Drivers for Facebook StockBeyond Watch and Workplace, there is Facebook Marketplace. Much like Watch, Marketplace has been around for a few quarters, but hasn’t made much of a splash just yet. But also like Watch, it really is only a matter of time before Facebook turns Marketplace into something big.As it stands, Marketplace looks like a digital garage sale of 2 billion-plus potential buyers and sellers. That model makes sense, but isn’t a complete version of what Marketplace could be. It will eventually morph into a place that accommodates those 2 billion-plus buyers and sellers, while also making room for official retailers to sell goods to a targeted group of buyers (yet another use-case of Facebook’s massive database). In this sense, Marketplace could one day scale to be the place for all e-commerce transactions.Along the same lines as Marketplace, Facebook is rolling out native payment capability across its ecosystem. Pretty soon, “Buy Now” features will be common across all of Facebook. Imagine you see an advertisement, and that ad interests you.Currently, there is a decent amount of friction in the process of turning that interest into financial action. You have to click that ad, likely veer away from Facebook, open another window, enter separate payment and delivery info, so on and so forth.Source: ©iStock.com/kravcsIn the future, Facebook will add capability which removes those frictions. You will be able to store your payment and delivery info within the Facebook ecosystem, so that if you see an ad on Instagram or Facebook that interests you, you are literally just a few clicks away from turning that interest into financial action.This capability at scale could be huge for Facebook. Facebook could take a commission off every sale that happens through its platform, much like a payments processing company does. If so, Facebook could make a ton of money off people buying and selling directly through the Facebook ecosystem. Facebook could also charge higher rates for its digital real estate in a world where they reduce commerce friction, thus adding even more firepower to the already super-charged advertising business.9. The Street Underestimates Facebook’s GrowthTo recap, Facebook’s size gives the company perhaps the biggest moat in the world, while also enabling the company to replicate essentially any business at scale. Further, Facebook’s advertising business is on fire, and the future monetization of social conversation apps Messenger and WhatsApp mean that the ad business still has a ton of firepower. Meanwhile, Facebook is developing multiple nascent hyper-growth businesses like Watch, Workplace, Marketplace, and native payments, the sum of which could add meaningful contributions to the financials over the next 5-10 years. Put that all together, and I really don’t understand why the Street thinks revenue growth is going to slow all the way to 25% next year, versus nearly 50% last quarter. Yes, I understand the law of large numbers. Growth is supposed to slow with scale.But that hasn’t happened at Facebook. Revenue growth last quarter was nearly 50%. In the year ago quarter, it was also nearly 50%. Two years ago, it was a hair over 50%. Three years ago, it was a hair under 50%.Why, then, is Facebook’s revenue growth going to all the sudden plummet to 25% after spending multiple years right around 50%?Law of large numbers? The company has defied that trend for a while, and revenues are still less than $100 billion. Google has revenues in excess of $100 billion, so I really don’t see law of large numbers kicking in just yet.Muted user growth? Maybe. But global internet usage expansion should keep user growth healthy in the 10%-plus range, and that level of growth led to 50% revenue growth this past quarter. That trend shouldn’t change any time soon.Instagram ad ramp is over? Again, maybe. But also unlikely. Judging by Snap’s recent results, Instagram is kicking Snap’s butt, and that means a ton of teen-oriented ad dollars are flowing into Instagram. Plus, Messenger and WhatsApp still have yet to be monetized.Digital ad business is nearing saturation? Again, maybe, but unlikely. And largely irrelevant. By the time the ad business does near saturation (after WhatsApp and Messenger have been fully monetized), the other businesses like Watch, Marketplace, and Workplace will be the big growth drivers.Overall, then, I really don’t see why Facebook’s revenue growth is slated to come off the rails over the next several years. The biggest growth drivers remain strong, and there are more growth drivers in the pipeline. As such, it looks like Facebook stock will continue to benefit from successive beat-and-raise quarters over the next several years.How Much Is Facebook Stock Worth?Given that last quarter’s 50% growth rate has been consistent for the past several years and there are big growth drivers still in the pipeline, I don’t think revenue growth will come down by all that much over the next several years. At around $100 billion in revenues, I do expect law of large numbers to start kicking in. I also expect ad revenues to slow some as Facebook and Instagram start to get maxed out. But the overall growth rate will remain robust.All things considered, I think this is a 30% revenue growth company per year over the next 5 years. I also think that operating margins will stay high in the 50% range thanks to robust demand for the company’s ad products. That combination leads me to believe that FB can earn around $18 per share in 5 years.  10 Stocks That Are Screaming Buys Right Now  A market-average growth multiple of 20-times forward earnings on those $18 earnings implies a four-year forward price target for FB stock of $360. Discounted back by 10% per year, that equates to a fair value for FB stock of above $240.Bottom Line on Facebook StockFB stock is a case of big growth converging on a discounted valuation. That convergence normally results in significant share-price out-performance in a multi-year window.That is exactly what will happen over the next several years with Facebook stock. As such, this is a must-own stock for investors with a long-term horizon.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long FB, AMZN, GOOG, and AAPL.More From InvestorPlace  7 Cheap Stocks With Strong Technical Signals    10 Stocks That Are Screaming Buys Right Now    3 Augmented Reality Stocks That Look Like Winners    Flipkart Won't Save Walmart Inc Stock Just Yet   Compare Brokers The post 9 In-Depth Reasons Why Facebook, Inc.

His second such call with the media in two weeks.“I think life is about learning from mistakes and what you need to do moving forward,” Zuckerberg explained during the call.Facebook conducted the call just hours after it disclosed that the information of as many as 87 million people — 37 million more than initially reported — may have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica. In the weeks since the scandal surfaced in mid-March, Facebook stock has tumbled 16% to $155 a share, all while critics have called for government regulation.Facebook, meanwhile, is now running a full-court press after a shaky start: having Zuckerberg interview with numerous outlets, as well as taking steps to reign in the personal data made available to third-party developers. The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee also announced on Wednesday Zuckerberg will testify about the Cambridge Analytica matter on April 11. Zuckerberg took a humble tact when addressing the scandal during the Wednesday call.“Our job was to give them tools — it was largely to give them responsibility,” Zuckerberg added. “Given what we know today and across all of our tools and what our place is in society, we need to take a broader role of responsibility. We need to take full responsibility for the outcome for how people use those tools as well.” But while public scrutiny may be taking its toll on Facebook’s stock, the #deletefacebook movement which calls for users to delete their accounts and advertisers to walk away hasn’t made a significant impact on Facebook’s massive 2.13 billion user base or advertising dollars.“I don’t think there’s been a meaningful impact we’ve observed,” Zuckerberg said. “But look, it’s not good… It still speaks to people feeling like this is a massive breach of trust, and we have a lot of work to do to repair that.”—JP Mangalindan is the Chief Tech Correspondent for Yahoo Finance covering the intersection of tech and business. Email story tips and musings to jpm@oath.com. Follow him on Twitter or Facebook.More from JPRichard Branson: Trump’s steel tariffs are ‘counterproductive’ for US economy Richard Branson: Government regulation of Facebook ‘makes sense’ Forget Photoshop, Adobe’s fastest-growing business is marketingFormer Facebook employees sold their shares before the social network’s stock took a real hitFacebook botches response to a scandal, againReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatch3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Watch in AprilMotley FoolWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolNOT REAL NEWS: A look at what didn't happen this weekAssociated PressMom's Post About Putting Kids in Timeout During Tantrums Goes ViralParentsZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley Fool1 Big Reason Why Disney Stock Is Just Getting StartedMotley FoolSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergNetflix might have more Beyoncé specials planned after 'Homecoming'Engadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley Fool'American Ninja Warrior Junior': Get an exclusive sneak peek at the semi-finals!AOL.comAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceThe Boeing 737 MAX Is 1 Step Closer to Flying Again -- but Don't Expect to See It SoonMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCN

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File photoMoreHow Facebook (FB) makes money can confuse anybody. Just ask Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), who during Tuesday’s Senate interrogation of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg asked the 33-year-old how the social network stayed in business.Zuckerberg’s four-word answer: “Senator, we run ads.”But it’s how those ads come together that’s interesting, and everybody on Facebook should understand how the company can use its deep knowledge of our interests to attract advertisers anxious to aim their pitches at customers with the greatest potential returns. Fortunately, Facebook’s ad machinery isn’t a secret; anybody who maintains a public page, myself included, can use the same basic tools to target ads at people by telling Facebook what kind of interests and demographics they want to attract — or exclude.Address for successZuckerberg’s refrain “we do not sell data to advertisers” holds up on this closer inspection. Facebook has never let me see details about individual users or target them by name.Facebook ads work the other way. You tell the social network what kind of people should see your ad, and Facebook obliges as best as it can.Companies and individual with Facebook pages can use the company’s vast array of user information to target specific groups for their ads.MoreIt starts with a request to select the target audience’s gender (your only choices are male or female) and age range (you can set that as low as 13, Facebook’s minimum age). Then you choose a location.Since in this test, I would be boosting a post about what Facebook should do to restore trust among its users, there was one obvious choice: Facebook’s street address of One Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025. I then included anybody within 20 miles of there.That’s not too different from digital advertising as offered by Facebook’s competitors — including Yahoo Finance’s corporate parent Verizon (VZ).Your interests can be interestingBut you can also target people on Facebook by their interests, something Facebook knows better than most other online companies. Type a term or phrase, and Facebook will suggest possible matches from an immense inventory of demographics, interests and behaviors.The word “minority,” for instance, yields suggestions like “Lesser Poland,” “Los Angeles Dodgers minor league players” and “Nucleic acid double helix.” You’re more likely to be surprised by interests you can’t target — for instance, HBO’s comedy “Silicon Valley” is in Facebook’s database, but not Showtime’s drama “Billions.”An example of how companies can set up ads to target specific Facebook users.MoreWords and phrases tied to various sorts of bigotry also appear off-limits, to judge from experimentation that hopefully doesn’t have Facebook thinking I’m a Nazi. That’s a change from what Pro Publica found last year, when its reporters could buy ads with anti-Semitic termsIn this ad test, I added such interests as “Facebook and Privacy,” the Federal Trade Commission, and “Personally identifiable information.” I tried adding “General Data Protection Regulation,” but the European Union’s sweeping privacy rule isn’t on Facebook’s list. Facebook predicted this exercise in targeting could reach 1.7 million people — if I paid generously. Limiting my ad budget to $10 would only reach 1,000 to 3,900 people in a day.Story continuesYou can also exclude demographics and interests from an ad. Last year, Pro Publica found that this system let advertisers hide housing ads from minorities, but this dialog didn’t let me add ethnic, racial or religious terms.Custom audiencesThe other way to target people by Facebook requires first finding them outside the social network. Its Custom Audiences feature lets you upload a customer list and have Facebook show your ad to those people — if your information matches what it knows about them.The easiest way to do this is to create and upload a simple spreadsheet with people’s email addresses, phone numbers, names, birthdays and other details. You don’t, however, need their street addresses — just city, state and Zip code. I tested this with my own info and that of three Yahoo Finance colleagues — with their permission, since Facebook’s rules require that upfront. (The minimum size for a Custom Audience upload is 100; I filled out the rest with made-up entries.)Facebook allows advertisers to target specific users, but only if they have the users’ permission.MoreRoughly a half hour later, Facebook had matched my database with Facebook accounts — but it didn’t tell me which ones. It then offered to expand this list’s reach by creating a “lookalike audience” of people who match the Facebook-determined traits of my custom audience.You can also generate a Custom Audience by adding a “Facebook Pixel” to your site to track and record what visitors do there.I didn’t actually purchase this ad after going to all this trouble, but I have bought Facebook ads before — in the spring and fall of last year, the site offered me a credit to try boosting a post on my page. The results weren’t all that impressive.What remains a mysteryAs a Facebook user, much of the social network remains a black box to me — I can only guess about some of its “People You May Know” suggestions, for instance. And while the Ad Preferences interface (facebook.com/ads/preferences) lets me see and edit what Facebook thinks fascinates me, it doesn’t tell me how it learned that.But as an advertiser, much of this is mysterious too. I can’t tell how Facebook decides which users will be interested in a particular topic. And while I may want to avoid looking like a practitioner of surveillance capitalism, I couldn’t tell Facebook to consider only data based on people’s activity on Facebook itself.But Facebook ads clearly work — according to the research firm eMarketer, it accounted for 19.9% of digital ad spending in 2017, second only to Google (GOOG, GOOGL). If you don’t like that, all I can suggest for now is this: try not to click on too many Facebook ads.More from Rob:New study finds 66% of shared links on Twitter came from botsWe need a federal law protecting consumers from data leaksHow Facebook should fix its privacy problemSorry baseball fans: These TV networks strikeout at online streamingBig Tech’s accountability-avoidance problem is getting worse Email Rob at rob@robpegoraro.com; follow him on Twitter at @robpegoraro. ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatch3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Watch in AprilMotley FoolWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolNOT REAL NEWS: A look at what didn't happen this weekAssociated PressMom's Post About Putting Kids in Timeout During Tantrums Goes ViralParentsZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business Videos'American Ninja Warrior Junior': Get an exclusive sneak peek at the semi-finals!AOL.comWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceCoachella Weekend 2: What to Watch ForVariety'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBC57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolNetflix might have more Beyoncé specials planned after 'Homecoming'EngadgetAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley Fool

Facebook did not cite the source of these accounts, but The New York Times reported that they were run by Americans."Many were using fake accounts or multiple accounts with the same names and posted massive amounts of content across a network of Groups and Pages to drive traffic to their websites," Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of cybersecurity, wrote."Many used the same techniques to make their content appear more popular on Facebook than it really was. Others were ad farms using Facebook to mislead people into thinking that they were forums for legitimate political debate."According to The New York Times, the removed accounts included Right Wing News — a page that sometimes spread fake news with a right-wing slant — as well as the left-wing pages Resistance and Reverb Press.The activity echoes the actions of Russia during the 2016 US election, when it attempted to influence American politics using a coordinated campaign of fake accounts that spread hoaxes and misleading information.Facebook said it looked at the behavior of the accounts, rather than the content posted, in its decision to ban them."Today, these networks increasingly use sensational political content — regardless of its political slant — to build an audience and drive traffic to their websites, earning money for every visitor to the site. And like the politically motivated activity we've seen, the 'news' stories or opinions these accounts and Pages share are often indistinguishable from legitimate political debate," Gleicher wrote. "This is why it's so important we look at these actors' behavior — such as whether they're using fake accounts or repeatedly posting spam — rather than their content when deciding which of these accounts, Pages or Groups to remove."A Facebook spokesperson did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for clarification on the sources of the accounts and details of the accounts themselves.Some critics have attacked Facebook on the timing on the removals, coming just weeks before the US midterm elections. "Early voting is already happening in some states, and Election Day is a few weeks away, so it’s especially inexcusable that Facebook is only now deleting political disinformation pages. Facebook has long been aware of the presence and activities of these pages but did nothing until the company sensed a potential public relations disaster as reporters started working on stories about right-wing networks intentionally promoting misinformation through their operation of these pages," Angelo Carusone, president of media watchdog Media Matters, said in a statement. "So, while it’s a good thing that Facebook is finally taking this action, it’s yet another example that Facebook is not prepared to proactively meet the challenges of abuse and misinformation on its platform; instead, the platform does the bare minimum to respond to the latest PR crisis."Do you work at Facebook?

The most recent findings indicate that 36% of teens use the social media platform, compared with 45% in the spring (and 60% in the spring of 2016).(Photo: screenshot/Piper Jaffray)MoreOnly 5% of teens ranked Facebook as their No. 1 favorite social network, versus 32% for Instagram and 46% for Snapchat (SNAP). This number has continued to drop since spring 2016, when 15% of teens said Facebook was their favorite platform. The report isn’t surprising, as it was previously reported that 42% of Facebook users have taken a break from the site in the last year. In a Pew Research survey, 44% of users between the ages of 18 and 29 admitted to deleting the Facebook app from their phones. Piper Jaffray analyst Sam Kemp previously told Yahoo Finance that Facebook isn’t as addictive for teenagers the way Snapchat is.(Photo: REUTERS/Eric Thayer)More“When Facebook first came up, it was the only option for new media formats,” he said. “Now, the alternatives are more gratifying for teens.”These alternatives include Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter (TWTR), Pinterest, and Tumblr. Instagram is the most-used platform, followed by Snapchat and Twitter. And this doesn’t even factor in the number of teens who are increasingly turning to video games and Netflix (NFLX).While it’s up for debate whether this decline in use stems from data breaches, better options from other social media platforms, or other factors, it’s clear that, if this trend continues, Facebook may soon become a thing of the past.Adriana is an associate editor for Yahoo Finance.

YouTube acknowledged Wednesday that its algorithm had not worked properly in surfacing the video prominently.“In 2017, we started rolling out changes to better surface authoritative news sources in search results, particularly around breaking news events,” a spokesperson said in a statement. “We’ve seen improvements, but in some circumstances these changes are not working quickly enough.

Any video flagged to us that violates this policy is reviewed and then removed. We’re committed to making more improvements throughout 2018 to make these tools faster, better and more useful to users.”On Tuesday, Hogg told CNN that he is “not a crisis actor,” adding: “I’m someone who had to witness this and live through this and I continue to be having to do that.”ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatch3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Watch in AprilMotley FoolWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolNOT REAL NEWS: A look at what didn't happen this weekAssociated PressMom's Post About Putting Kids in Timeout During Tantrums Goes ViralParentsZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceState defends South Dakota pipeline protest legislationAssociated PressWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool1 Big Reason Why Disney Stock Is Just Getting StartedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business Videos'World's smallest baby boy' set to go home in JapanAFPAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceIn Ukrainian candidate's hometown, a cry for changeAssociated PressWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance Video

Critics have dubbed this as an effective "link tax," but proponents say hyperlinks will be exempt.Meanwhile, Article 13 calls for "effective content recognition" technology to filter out copyright-protected content. Detractors hold that this part of the law could threaten social media users' ability to share anything from internet memes to snippets of music and film.Reacting to the result of the vote, Julia Reda, a German Pirate Party lawmaker, said it was "catastrophic" that the parliament voted in favor of the most controversial pieces of the legislation."Final vote for Parliament position on the copyright directive with #UploadFilters and #LinkTax adopted," she wrote in a tweet. "Parliament has failed to listen to citizens' and experts' concerns."TweetOpponents of the directive have been using the hashtag #SaveYourInternet on social media."The legislation is now better balanced, answering many of the concerns of journalists, publishers and musicians whose work was being shared freely online without stifling innovation or fundamentally changing the nature of the internet," Sajjad Karim, a British Conservative lawmaker, said in a statement following the vote."It also takes into account the rights of users, ensuring that materials used for teaching and research, and by cultural and heritage organizations, are not encumbered by unnecessary restrictions."What's next?Wednesday's vote won't be the last you've heard about the EU's copyright reforms.Lawmakers had initially voted to delay the vote, rejecting the version of the directive that had been agreed by a committee at that time.Now that politicians in Strasbourg have come to an agreement, the next stage for the law will be what's known as "trilogue," which consists of talks between European Parliament, EU executive body the European Commission, and a collective of the leaders of EU member states known as the European Council.And even once the directive goes through this process, it will still require each individual EU nation to decide on how they will implement the new rules.The EU copyright battle pits media companies and musicians against tech giants over the widespread availability of their content online. Supporters of the law argue that people and companies in the creative industries are being starved of revenues lost to the sharing of their intellectual property on digital platforms.It could particularly impact platforms like Facebook FB and Google's GOOGL YouTube, which rely on user-generated content. Google has been accused of lobbying aggressively to prevent the directive from being passed into law.The issue has drawn attention from notable figures in both the tech and media worlds, including internet pioneer Tim Berners-Lee, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, former Beatles star Paul McCartney and French DJ David Guetta .More From CNBC AT&T CEO calls Netflix the 'Walmart' of video streamingSnap shares tumble after BTIG's Greenfield cuts target to $5Apple will probably lower iPhone prices on Wednesday — here's whyReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextGold Faces A New Trade Conflict, Banks Accumulate The MetalFX EmpirePound Looks Placid in Brexit Break Before Parliament Meets AgainBloombergWhy Livestreaming TV Can't Break ThroughMotley FoolPanel to review approval of Boeing 737 Max flight controlsAssociated PressIntroducing Électricite de Strasbourg Société Anonyme (EPA:ELEC), The Stock That Dropped 18% In The Last YearSimply Wall St.Zookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatchWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosNetflix might have more Beyoncé specials planned after 'Homecoming'EngadgetAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance'American Ninja Warrior Junior': Get an exclusive sneak peek at the semi-finals!AOL.comWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley Fool

The company witnessed a tumultuous ride in recent months following the data breach report from Cambridge Analytica. In fact, the stock slipped into correction territory and erased about $50 billion in its market-cap value on the news in a week (read: 4 Tech ETFs That Tumbled Most on Facebook Data Scandal).Despite the slide, Facebook has been able to outperform the industry by a margin of 1.7% from a year-to-date look. The outperformance might continue given the positive earnings revision trend, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat, and attractive fundamentals though earnings surprise is difficult to predict at this time.Inside Our MethodologyFacebook has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of -0.47%, implying that a beat cannot be predicted this quarter. According to our surprise prediction methodology, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) when combined with a positive Earnings ESP makes us confident in predicting an earnings beat. A Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) is best avoided going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Although the stock saw negative earnings estimate revision of a couple of cents over the past 30 days for the first quarter, the earnings estimates have moved up by 12 cents over the past 90 days. Additionally, Facebook’s earnings surprise history is robust, with a positive earnings surprise of 15.78% on average over the past four quarters. It is expected to post solid earnings growth of 10.58% and revenue growth of 42.66% in Q1 (read: 5 Reason Why FANG ETFs Lost Their Charm in March).The stock has a top Growth Style Score of A but Value and Momentum Score of D and C, respectively, look ugly. According to the analysts polled by Zacks, Facebook has an average target price of $215.63 with 93% giving a Strong Buy or a Buy rating ahead of the company’s earnings. This represents 30% upside from the current price.What to Watch?After a data scandal, the social media giant is subject to increased regulatory pressure, and could have to spend more cash to examine content and protect data. This would amplify the already higher spending expectation for 2018. In the last earnings report, the company expects operating expenses to increase 45-60% this year, higher than 32% recorded in 2017. This would have a significant impact on the company's profitability.  ETFs in FocusGiven Facebook's attractive fundamentals, investors could focus on ETFs having the largest allocation to the social media giant. While there are several ETFs in the space having FB in their basket, we have highlighted five funds that have the social media giant in their top five holdings (see: all the Technology ETFs here):Global X Social Media Index ETF SOCL — The fund has delivered returns of 3.8% since the start of the year and carries a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a High risk outlook. Facebook takes the third spot with 8.8% allocation.First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index FDN — The fund has gained 14.1% in the same time frame and has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a High risk outlook.

But in today's testimony Mark Zuckerberg also mentioned a much higher estimate of "tens of thousands," though the confidence in this number would be also be much lower."In the IRA specifically, the ones we've pegged back to the IRA, we can identify 470 in the American elections, and the 270 that we went after in Russia last week," he began in response to Senator Feinstein (D-), who had asked about the numbers of accounts associated with this type of coordinated disinformation campaign.But then he continued:"There are many others that our systems catch which are more difficult to attribute specifically to Russian intelligence, but the number would be in the tens of thousands of fake accounts..."The tens of thousands number must be taken with a grain of salt, since clearly Facebook has not been able to definitively attribute more than the stated 740 or so to the IRA and Russian intel. But it is still significant; this is clearly different from the 30,000-odd accounts banned in relation to France's election. That was a specific number and also not mentioned in connection with Russia specifically, as this estimate was.It seems clear that Facebook is being conservative in its enumeration of Russian-linked accounts, and that very well may be the responsible thing to do.

Unfortunately, that prediction has come true more than once,” Cook said when asked about the Facebook data misuse by Cambridge Analytica. “I think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary.”Apple has emphasized security and privacy as an important selling point in its products. Unlike Google or Facebook, whose revenue is driven by ads, Apple mainly makes money by selling premium devices like iPads and iPhones. Cook finds the idea of collecting data and selling them to marketers unacceptable. “The ability of anyone to know what you’ve been browsing about for years, who your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life — from my own point of view it shouldn’t exist,” Cook said.Apple’s business model is differentUnlike other tech giants like Facebook and Google, Apple says it doesn’t profit from collecting user data. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola)MoreCook said he has been careful of inviting government regulations. Back in 2016, Apple had a well-known dispute with the FBI over obtaining access to an iPhone used by a shooter in the San Bernardino attack. Though the FBI ultimately broke into the phone without Apple’s help, Apple pledged it would go to court to protect user privacy. Last year, Sen. Al Franken raised privacy issues on the iPhone X’s Face ID authentication technology. Apple soon responded by clarifying the data would never be sent to Apple, nor is it included in device backups.It’s not the first time that Cook has critiqued peer tech companies. In an open letter in 2014, he emphasized that Apple doesn’t build profiles of its users from their email content or browsing habits “to sell to advertisers,” essentially calling out Google and Facebook. “Our business model is very straightforward: We sell great products,” he wrote. “We don’t build a profile based on your email content or web browsing habits to sell to advertisers. We don’t ‘monetize’ the information you store on your iPhone or in iCloud. And we don’t read your email or your messages to get information to market to you.”Krystal Hu covers technology and economy for Yahoo Finance.

Two web browsers now want to help you fight back in what's becoming an escalating privacy arms race.New protections in Apple's Safari and Mozilla's Firefox browsers aim to prevent companies from turning "cookie" data files used to store sign-in details and preferences into broader trackers that take note of what you read, watch and research on other sites.Lance Cottrell, creator of the privacy service Anonymizer, said Apple's effort was particularly significant, as it takes aim at a technique developed by tracking companies to override users' attempts to delete their cookies.Safari makes these protections automatic in updates coming Tuesday to iPhones and iPads and a week later to Mac computers. Firefox has similar protections on Apple mobile devices and is rolling out them out to personal computers in the coming months.To get the protections, you'll have to break your habit of using Google's Chrome browser, which by some estimates has more than half of the worldwide browser usage. Safari and Firefox have less than 20 percent combined.Even then, Safari and Firefox can't entirely stop tracking. For starters, they won't block tracking when you're using Facebook or Google itself. Nor can they help much when you use phone or tablet apps, unless the app happens to embed Safari, as Twitter's iPhone app does.But Will Strafach, a mobile security expert who is designing data security tools for phones, said imperfect protection is better than no protection. He notes that burglars can still break down a door, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't bother locking it.Cookies and other trackers can be used by companies to keep track of who you are as you move from website to website. The companies can build a digital profile as you, say, read about Democratic or Republican viewpoints, buy a particular brand of pet food or indulge in the entire season of "Keeping Up With The Kardashians."News, video and other third-party sites use Google and Facebook cookies to customize ads to your hobbies and interests, rather than hawking products you might never buy. That's why you might see an ad for shoes soon after searching for them elsewhere.Apple says its tests show that some popular websites are embedded with more than 70 such trackers. Many of these are from Facebook and Google, which are expected to command a combined 57 percent of the $107 billion U.S. digital advertising market this year, according to the research group eMarketer.Though general awareness of data collection has grown in the wake of Facebook's Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal , how trackers work behind the scenes remains a mystery to many people.Ghostery and other products have long offered tracking protection. The browsers are now trying to incorporate that directly so you don't have to go looking for browser add-ons.Safari will try to automatically distinguish cookies that are useful from ones that are there just to track you. Apple notes that cookies can appear in unexpected places, such as sites that embed "like" and "share" buttons. Now, those cookies will be blocked until you click on one of those buttons, in which case you'll be prompted for permission to allow the tracking. If you don't, your "like" won't register.Safari is also attacking a technique developed to circumvent cookie deletions. Through "fingerprinting," a company can identify you through your computer's characteristics, such as browser type and fonts installed. Your new cookie can then be tied to your old profile. Safari will now limit the technical details it sends.Firefox has an anti-tracking feature that also tries to distinguish tracking cookies from useful ones. It's on by default only on Apple's mobile devices. Mozilla is testing a broader rollout for personal computers, though its plans for Android are not yet known. For now, you need to turn it on or use a private-browsing mode, which gets more aggressive at killing cookies, including useful ones.For PCs, Firefox also has an optional add-on, called Facebook Container, to segregate your Facebook activity from everything else. Think of it as a wall that prevents Facebook from accessing its data cookie as you surf elsewhere. A version is available for other trackers, too, but requires configuration on your part.Story continuesNone of the Firefox tools, though, address fingerprinting.Unsurprisingly, advertisers aren't happy.In a statement, Interactive Advertising Bureau executive Dennis Buchheim said that even as browsers makers feel pressured to deliver privacy-centric features, they should consider the importance of advertising in enabling free services.The new Safari and Firefox tools don't block ads.

Google makes most of its money from selling ads.Facebook and Google declined comment on the Safari and Firefox tools.

Now, Cook and company are taking their own steps to jam up social media sites’ web-tracking tools by blocking them in both the upcoming macOS Mojave and iOS 12 versions of Apple’s Safari browser. In other words, the war of words between Facebook and Apple seems to have just gone hot.Blocking social tracking“In Safari, enhanced Intelligent Tracking Prevention helps block social media ‘Like’ or ‘Share’ buttons and comment widgets from tracking users without permission,” Apple said in a statement.The move won’t completely stop you from being able to use Like and Share buttons or make comments on sites using Facebook plugins on websites, but it will require you to take the extra step of confirming that you want to have Facebook share your data via a pop-up that warns of as much.If you don’t confirm you want to use the Like or Share buttons or leave a comment, they won’t be able to track your data at all. This is especially important for people who don’t have Facebook, but can still be tracked through these social features.Social tracking will be curtailed in macOS Mojave and iOS 12.MoreThat’s a big move on Apple’s part, and follows Cook’s comments that consumers’ data and privacy is a civil right and human right. When he was asked how he would handle Facebook’s data scandal during an interview with MSNBC, Cook he “wouldn’t be in this situation.”This isn’t the first time that Apple has hit out at social media sites and other platforms for trafficking in users’ data. Cook previously expressed how Apple could easily monetize user data to make an enormous sum of cash, but chooses not to on moral grounds.Of course, Apple has had issues of its own when it comes to how its iPhones are built.Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg hasn’t taken the criticism lying down, though. In an interview with Vox, he called Cook’s comments “extremely glib” and said that if you are going to build a service that connects people around the world, some of whom can’t afford to pay, an advertising-based model is the only way to go.Stopping fingerprintingApple isn’t just hitting back at social media sites — the company is also making it harder for advertiser networks to track users based on the kinds of devices they use. Called fingerprinting, this technique allows advertisers to track web users based on the machine they use, the kinds of fonts they use and legacy plug-ins they use.Apple says that these kinds of indicators can make it easy for advertisers to accurately track users across multiple sites and get a better picture of who you are.

Photograph: Greg Baker/AFP/Getty ImagesMoreApple has updated its rules to restrict app developers’ ability to harvest data from mobile phones, which could be bad news for a Facebook-owned data security app called Onavo Protect.Onavo ostensibly provides users with a free virtual private network (VPN) which, it claims, helps “keep you and your data safe when you browse and share information on the web”. What is not immediately obvious is that it feeds information to Facebook about what other apps you are using and how much you are using them back to the social networking giant.“The problem with Onavo is that it talks about being a VPN that keeps your data private, but behind the scenes it’s harvesting your data for Facebook,” said Ryan Dochuk, CEO of the paid-for VPN TunnelBear. “It goes against what people generally expect when they use a VPN.”Onavo has been a Trojan horse for Facebook (in the classical sense, not as malware), allowing it to gather intelligence on the apps people use on tens of millions of devices outside its empire. This real-time market research highlights which apps are becoming popular and which are struggling. Such competitive intelligence can inform acquisition targets and negotiations as well as identify popular features it could copy in rival apps.As first reported by Bloomberg, Apple’s new App Store rules explicitly ban the collection of “information about which other apps are installed on a user’s device for the purposes of analytics or advertising/marketing”, which appears to be intentionally worded to clamp down on apps like Onavo.“Apple has been very clear that it’s pro-privacy,” ,” said Joseph Jerome, a privacy specialist from the Center for Democracy and Technology, “and with every iteration of iOS [Apple’s mobile operating system] has been trying to restrain the ability of apps to know what’s going on on the device if a user hasn’t authorised it.”Onavo started life in Tel Aviv in 2010 as a startup that helped people reduce their wireless bills by compressing incoming data on an iPhone or Android device. It also highlighted which apps were using the most data. For mobile publishers, it provided analytics to help them keep track of how their apps were performing against competitors. In May 2013, it launched a VPN called Onavo Protect, which promised to protect people’s data when they were browsing the web from their phone on a public wifi network.Facebook bought the company in October 2013 for an undisclosed sum, estimated to be between $100m and $200m.Onavo provides information to Facebook about what other apps you are using and how much you are using them. Photograph: Christophe Morin/IP3/Getty ImagesMoreVPNs work by redirecting and encrypting all data leaving your computer, phone or tablet and sending it to another server in another location. They position themselves as tools for protecting people’s privacy and security, but that very much depends on who is running the VPN and how they make their money.“This server is in a really privileged position,” said Dochuk. “Essentially, it needs 100% of consumer trust because 100% of their data is going through that server.”This means whoever runs the VPN knows which apps are installed on your device and how much you use them; which websites you visit; and your device type and location.There are some VPNs, such as TunnelBear, that cover their server and bandwidth costs through paid subscriptions and others, like Hola and Onavo, that provide a free service to the end user, but extract value from the data they collect or by selling people’s unused bandwidth.Story continues“If you’re not paying with your money you are probably paying with your data,” said Will Strafach, a security specialist who has analysed the Onavo app.According to the Wall Street Journal, Facebook employees have put the Onavo data to good use by monitoring the performance of rival Snapchat, particularly after Facebook’s Instagram app launched similar features. Onavo’s data also reportedly helped guide Facebook’s decision to buy WhatsApp for $19bn in 2014 and to clone the popular group video chat app Houseparty.In written questions following CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s congressional testimony in April, lawmakers asked Facebook whether its use of data gleaned from Onavo violated the privacy consumers expect of a VPN.Facebook said that it explained what data it would receive when a user installed the app.“This helps us improve and operate the Onavo service by analysing your use of websites, apps and data,” Onavo Protect’s App Store messaging reads. “Because we’re part of Facebook, we also use this info to improve Facebook products and services, gain insights into the products and services people value, and build better experiences.”Users have to accept these terms before using the app.The company has acknowledged it uses Onavo to monitor competitors, but it insists this is not unusual: “Websites and apps have used market research services for years.”Facebook said it did not connect the app usage data collected through Onavo to the data collected from an individual’s Facebook account.Strafach said it would be easy for Facebook to connect the data if the person also had the Facebook app installed on their phone.“You just have to trust that they are not doing that,” he said.Given Facebook’s recent track record with data privacy, that trust may have slightly eroded.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatchWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley Fool3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Watch in AprilMotley FoolNOT REAL NEWS: A look at what didn't happen this weekAssociated PressMom's Post About Putting Kids in Timeout During Tantrums Goes ViralParentsZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadgetAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphTesla's board is about to get a lot smallerTechCrunchWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergThe Boeing 737 MAX Is 1 Step Closer to Flying Again -- but Don't Expect to See It SoonMotley FoolNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunch

The answer becomes crystal clear in a single world: FACEBOOK.The Wall Street Journal was first to report late last Friday that Facebook could file its initial paperwork as soon as this Wednesday. While this purported IPO registration may shed some light on the workings and financials of the world's most popular social media site, it will be far from definitive and could end up raising as many questions as it answers.Until the big reveal, we're left to speculate how big Facebook's IPO might be ($75-$100 billion), on how much revenue it might post for this year, and what exchange and ticker symbol it might use.

"The public wants to know, how can I get these shares? This isn't going to tell you that, but will tell you what's going on inside."Even if Facebook does file its S1 mid-week, history offers little guidance in terms of when we might expect an actual IPO, as market conditions could see it happening within a month or delays for over a year.Regardless, there is reason to be interested in investing in a website that does business with "1/7th of the planet" as Macke puts it, but ultimately the case for or against buying shares should be based on whether they can develop new ways to monetize its massive, non-paying user base.Legendary investor Jim Rogers is already on the record saying "no thanks" to Facebook, whereas bankers and 500 other accredited insiders are already in and are valuing their restricted shares at anywhere from $27 to $31.15 each."Facebook can't be 20-times sales forever," Macke points out.

Only a week ago Mark Zuckerberg and the company he founded seemed to be draped in teflon and en route to world domination, whereas today kevlar might be a more suitable garment as an angry mob grows on their doorstep."They've done a lot of reputational damage to their brand, and that matters," says my co-host Jeff Macke in the attached video. He argues that the Silicon Valley company, renowned for its "thumbs-up and chums and we're all friends," has alienated its fans in a big way.At the same time, with lawsuits literally mounting by the hour, it seems anyone within an arms reach of this deal is going to have some serious explaining to do. While shareholder suits are commonplace and often frivolous, the problem with this grievance is that it's grounded in populism, it's easy to understand, it will get wide mainstream coverage, and it's of interest to about one billion people.As I write, shareholder suits have already been filed in New York and California. The State of Massachusetts has subpoenaed Morgan Stanley (MS), following reports that it allegedly only told a few of its best clients that its analyst was cutting his revenue outlook for the company. The entire underwriting syndicate — (GS), (JPM), (BAC), (BCS) — is being sued, as is Facebook's newlywed CEO and several board members. In addition, the Nasdaq (NDAQ) has also been sued, and the SEC and FINRA are launching investigations. Congressional hearings and probes can't be far off.This is not how it was supposed to go. The long-awaited debut was supposed to be the fairytale ending (or beginning) to the great growth story of the modern era. Instead, it has become just one big mess that's not only an embarrassment to all parties involved but a huge distraction to a business when it is supposed to be focusing on ways to grow its revenue.What a mess.Do you think Facebook (FB) will end this year above or below its IPO price of $38 a share?

In the annals of IPO history, Facebook's (FB) hot-to-cold reversal of fortune happened extraordinarily fast. While it only took one day to confirm what many investors had unsuccessfully tried to argue for years—that Facebook was over-valued—the drama and battling over the social media giant has really only just begun. In fact, investor Barry Ritholtz of Fusion IQ says, in the attached video, that he thinks the problem started long before the shares officially came to market."This is a debacle across the board. There is no party involved in this left who are unscathed," he says, before lining up his suspects for an old fashioned whooping. While his own blog on the subject is full of FB's (that's F-Bombs), I tried to keep our discussion a tad more elevated. In no particular order Ritholtz slams, as only he can, the following culprits for their role in the Facebook kerfuffle. The Pre-IPO, Secondary Markets: "They allowed the price to run out of control," he says. "These private markets are garbage, and people who buy there are hoping to put one over on other participants." He goes on to call them "opaque, non-transparent, and non-disclosing," just to make certain we know how he really feels.Morgan Stanley (MS): The lead underwriter on this most-coveted of deals "screwed up" by increasing the size and price of the deal while their analyst was taking down his revenue estimates for the quarter and the year. "The private market teed this up for failure, and Morgan Stanley just went along."The Nasdaq (NDAQ): "Embarrassed themselves."Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg: "They were pigs about this," Ritholtz blasts. He argues that the ''28-year-old man-child Zuck" demanded a ridiculous $100 billion market cap and would "laugh out of the room" any banker who tried to suggest otherwise. Over-Eager Investors: To those shareholders who are now underwater and complaining that they accepted a last-minute increase in the allocation of what was expected to be a hot deal only to find out otherwise, Ritholtz says in jest, "What are you going to say, I thought it was a good deal at 100 times earnings. But this 150 times earnings? That's ridiculous."While Ritholtz won't speculate on possible legal outcomes, he won't rule it out either.

In the annals of IPO history, Facebook's (FB) hot-to-cold reversal of fortune happened extraordinarily fast. While it only took one day to confirm what many investors had unsuccessfully tried to argue for years—that Facebook was over-valued—the drama and battling over the social media giant has really only just begun. In fact, investor Barry Ritholtz of Fusion IQ says, in the attached video, that he thinks the problem started long before the shares officially came to market."This is a debacle across the board. There is no party involved in this left who are unscathed," he says, before lining up his suspects for an old fashioned whooping. While his own blog on the subject is full of FB's (that's F-Bombs), I tried to keep our discussion a tad more elevated. In no particular order Ritholtz slams, as only he can, the following culprits for their role in the Facebook kerfuffle. The Pre-IPO, Secondary Markets: "They allowed the price to run out of control," he says. "These private markets are garbage, and people who buy there are hoping to put one over on other participants." He goes on to call them "opaque, non-transparent, and non-disclosing," just to make certain we know how he really feels.Morgan Stanley (MS): The lead underwriter on this most-coveted of deals "screwed up" by increasing the size and price of the deal while their analyst was taking down his revenue estimates for the quarter and the year. "The private market teed this up for failure, and Morgan Stanley just went along."The Nasdaq (NDAQ): "Embarrassed themselves."Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg: "They were pigs about this," Ritholtz blasts. He argues that the ''28-year-old man-child Zuck" demanded a ridiculous $100 billion market cap and would "laugh out of the room" any banker who tried to suggest otherwise. Over-Eager Investors: To those shareholders who are now underwater and complaining that they accepted a last-minute increase in the allocation of what was expected to be a hot deal only to find out otherwise, Ritholtz says in jest, "What are you going to say, I thought it was a good deal at 100 times earnings. But this 150 times earnings? That's ridiculous."While Ritholtz won't speculate on possible legal outcomes, he won't rule it out either. Some trading firms, like Knight, are already looking to be made whole for losses they incurred as a result of choppy order flow and cancellations.Sure Facebook has a tremendous reach and user base, and lots of potential two or three years out—he thinks the newest stock in the land has yet to bottom out.

Unfortunately, a recent study actually refutes this).Sandberg's book has already stirred the pot.Many women have been offended by Sandberg's implication that they're responsible for their own relative lack of success. As a billionaire, they say, Sandberg is not in a position to speak for normal women.Many men, meanwhile, have reacted to Sandberg's message by lashing out at her. Sandberg, they say, doesn't deserve her own success and has no business telling other people how to act!Interestingly, Sandberg herself predicted this reaction.When explaining why she decided to write this book, Sandberg cites many facts that illustrate why and how women hinder their own progress in the workplace. One of these facts is a study showing that, when men get more successful, people like them more. But the more successful a woman is, the less people like her.That's a depressing fact. And, unfortunately, Sandberg's own experience would seem to confirm it.Sandberg has become one of the most successful and powerful women in the world. And now, after writing a book that does little more than urge women to believe in themselves and be more assertive in their careers, Sandberg is being pilloried for a litany of perceived sins.Related: How to Be a "Superachiever"For example, people have accused Sandberg of "just riding Mark Zuckerberg's coattails" at Facebook--as if her own hard work and success at Facebook, Google, the Treasury Department, McKinsey, the World Bank, and Harvard doesn't give her the authority to speak about how to succeed.People have dismissed Sandberg as too rich and elitist to speak on such matters--as if her own rise from a public school education and a middle-class upbringing isn't a perfect illustration of how talented and hard-working women can work their way to the top.And some people have dismissed Sandberg as uppity for even opening her mouth about these things--a woman who clearly doesn't know her place.That Sandberg knew she would be met by this reaction is a testament to her guts and passion: She decided to say it anyway.And if this reaction doesn't confirm that Sandberg's book desperately needed to be written, nothing will.Tell Us What You Think!Got a topic you’d like covered?

Finance to stream LIVE coverage of the Facebook IPO today starting at 10:45 am. WATCH IT LIVE HERE!In case you have not heard, Facebook (FB) goes public today and its initial public offering makes it the most valuable company at the time of its offering to ever go public. At $38 a share the company is valued at $104 billion.While demand to own a stake in the tech giant has been much greater than any would have expected, a new AP-CNBC poll shows that 50 percent of Facebook users believe the social media network may be just a passing fad."I don't think it is structured as a fad," says David Kirkpatrick, a technology journalist and author of the preeminent book on Facebook, The Facebook Effect. "I think it is structured as a piece of infrastructure [and] there is nothing that could faddishly come along and replace it any time soon that I can identify."Facebook currently has 901 million active users worldwide. In March, the site experienced an average of 526 million daily active users. There are 488 million monthly active users who use Facebook on mobile devices.In the accompany video, Kirkpatrick asks us all to ponder just how difficult it would be for all those people to move all their photos and all their relationships from Facebook to another platform."I think it is fundamentally changing the lives of hundreds of millions of people," says Kirkpatrick, who is also the founder of the Techonomy conference.Here are three big ways Facebook has changed our lives forever:Facebook's Impact: A Return to Neighborly Communication"The world historically was a world of villages and small towns," he says. "In a village you hear everybody's business."But in recent history, more people are now living in big urban cities and not in small towns, he notes."Isn't it interesting that at exactly that moment, the most popular software ever invented for communications is one that creates that 'over the backyard fence quality' of the small town?" Kirkpatrick says. "I think people are living in cities and they want to know about people and Facebook makes it easier."In 2010 Americans spent an average of 25 minutes a day on Facebook, according to comScore. More than 125 billion people had made connections on the social media site by the end of March 2012. In the first month of this year, users uploaded more than 300 million photos per day on Facebook."I think it has changed the way people relate to one another," Kirkpatrick says. "It has changed the visibility people have into one another's lives [and] you know everything your neighbors do."Facebook's Impact: A Driver for DemocracyWith roughly 80% of Facebook's monthly users located outside the U.S. and Canada, it is no huge surprise that Facebook is responsible for sparking the uprisings in the Middle East at the beginning of 2011, which started in Tunisia after a man selling fruits and vegetables set himself on fire in a market. He had been humiliated when police demanded him to hand over his cart for not having a permit.His personal revolt ignited protests in Tunisia which spread to Egypt, Libya, Syria and Yemen."Facebook was gigantic in the Arab Spring and in every other political uprising that we have heard of in Spain and the Occupy Movement because people do not think of it as a political act," say Kirkpatrick. "[Users] just update their status on Facebook" and "their friends see it and they are broadcasting without evening knowing it."In 2009, a video showing the death of a young female Iranian protester, named Neda, shot by a government gunman gripped the world. The video went viral with the help of Facebook and other social media networks.Facebook's Impact: Makes Sharing Media Content EasyFacebook has forever changed the way people share media content with their friends — almost every site today has a "like" button for users to share content."The media recognized that if they do not have the ability to make it easy for people to share their content on Facebook, they are going to be in trouble," says Kirkpatrick.An average of 3.2 billion "likes" and "comments" were generated every day in the first three months of the year.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatchWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley Fool3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Watch in AprilMotley Fool5 Ways The Smart Money is Playing the Billion Dollar Satellite Internet TrendInsider MonkeyFTC's Facebook investigation could focus on ZuckerbergEngadgetZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley Fool1 Big Reason Why Disney Stock Is Just Getting StartedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolTrump Watch: What We Learned From the Mueller Report + Jessie Liu's Office Prepares to Step InALM MediaNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergCoachella Weekend 2: What to Watch ForVarietyWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraph57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn Singleton Hospitalized After Suffering StrokeVarietyMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo Finance8 Happy Easter Images to Post on Facebook, Twitter and InstagramInvestorPlaceRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

This phone has a huge screen, much bigger than the iPhone's, and many early reviewers love it. The S3 will presumably be an even stronger competitor to the iPhone, and it will put more pressure on Apple to release a blockbuster new product when the iPhone 5 arrives later this year.Meanwhile, Facebook (FB) is poaching ex-Apple engineers to build a smartphone, Nick Bilton of the New York Times reports.This is the third iteration of Facebook's smartphone plans--from hardware to software and back to hardware again.If Facebook is serious about jumping into making smartphones with both feet this time, Facebook investors should be very afraid.Why?Several reasons:The move would clearly be defensive, not offensive. According to a Facebook employee quoted by Bilton, "Mark [Zuckerberg] is worried that if he doesn't create a mobile phone in the near future that Facebook will simply become an app on other mobile platforms." Translation: Facebook is doing this because it thinks it has to, not because it wants to.Hardware is an extraordinarily difficult, low-margin, commodity business. The only two companies that are doing well right now in hardware are Apple and Samsung. Both have been making and selling hardware for decades. Lots of other companies that have been making and selling hardware for decades are cratering, such as Research In Motion and Nokia. Palm already cratered.The smartphone "platform" business is already dominated by Apple and Google (Android), and there are already a whole lot of also-rans. Amazon has entered the platform game. Samsung may "fork" Android and enter the platform game. Microsoft is desperate to make its new Windows mobile product matter. RIM still has a piece. And so on. If Facebook really wants to build a brand new mobile platform, it will be starting from miles behind the leaders.Hardware distribution is critically important, and Facebook also faces vast, entrenched competition there. How is Facebook going to get shelf space at the carriers? By offering super-cheap phones? That won't do wonders for its margins. Is Facebook going to build a network of stores? Is it going to try to circumvent carriers? Google already tried that. Didn't work.Although Facebook might want to be a mobile platform, there's no obvious need for a Facebook phone. There are already a gazillion phones and Facebook is available on all of them as an app or via a browser. Why would anyone want a dedicated Facebook phone, especially if it didn't run all the apps that run on Apple and Android phones?A full-fledged hardware business would likely radically reduce Facebook's profit margins. One of the advantages of Facebook's current business is that it is extraordinarily profitable. The hardware business would likely make it a lot less profitable (per dollar of revenue).Facebook knows absolutely nothing about making, selling, or supporting hardware. Really--nothing. Yes, Facebook could use its billions to buy RIM or Nokia, and then it would know something about hardware. But RIM and Nokia are deeply troubled companies that are already cratering. Can you imagine how difficult it would be to buy, integrate, and FIX RIM or Nokia? (Google's about to give us a case study in how difficult it is with Motorola).That's just a start.Perhaps Facebook doesn't really have any intention of building a full-fledged phone--perhaps it just wants to partner with someone like HTC or Samsung. But even then, all the same challenges apply.Facebook already has an "operating system" for mobile--it's called the social graph.So instead of building a phone, which seems like a desperate move, Facebook should partner with every operating system and carrier and hardware maker it can to try to embed this social platform within every mobile platform. And it should build great apps to float on top of these systems. (And if Apple keeps giving it the brush-off, it should probably start by cozying up to Samsung, which is the only company giving Apple a run for its money).Yes, everyone wants to be Apple.But there's only one Apple right now.And Facebook's chance of becoming the next Apple seems even smaller than Apple's chance to become Apple was.The fact that Facebook is even thinking of going into the hardware business is a bad sign.

First the stock price tanked. Then its domestic user growth slowed. And of course privacy concerns and data security remain ongoing issues for the company as it expands globally.But for all the hype surrounding Facebook, the fact remains that it is an imperfect company with its fair share of internal and external struggles, like any firm. Consider these seven little-known facts about the world's largest social network.1. It has a problem with fake accounts According to a regulatory filing released earlier this week, Facebook itself estimates that as many as 8.7 percent of its 955 million worldwide active accounts are in fact duplicates or fakes, accounting for some 83 million "users." Of these, about 46 million are duplicate accounts (which anyone who has a "work" and a "personal" Facebook account can understand), 23 million are user-misclassified accounts (such as profiles assigned to pets or businesses) and about 14 million are pages set up for spamming or other untoward uses."These estimates are based on an internal review of a limited sample of accounts," the company said in its SEC filing, "and we apply significant judgment in making this determination, such as identifying names that appear to be fake or other behavior that appears inauthentic to the reviewers."2. Bots may be gaming its advertisingA startup called Limited Run has stopped advertising on Facebook and recently went public about its experiences with the company, saying that as many as 80 percent of the clicks it received on its Facebook ads appeared to be from "bots" (web robots) and not real people. The allegation implies that Facebook is juicing its click rate to overcharge its advertising clients and give the appearance of increased traffic.In response, Facebook told CNBC it is "currently investigating their claims."3. Its revenues aren't that greatDespite all outward appearances (the 955 million users, the splashy IPO, the globetrotting CEO), Facebook isn't exactly raking in the cash when compared to other Internet firms. In fact, PaidContent recently released a list of 10 Web companies that are doing better than Facebook in the revenue department.That's right -- Facebook dominates the business pages almost every day but is only the eleventh richest digital content site on the Web.Obviously Google leads the pack, but there are some surprising names on the PaidContent list, including Microsoft, Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters and, yes, even Yahoo!.4. Its stock price won't stop falling Facebook's IPO was priced at $38 a share on May 17 and has pretty much sunk like a stone ever since, recently slipping under $20 a share for the first time, a 45 percent drop. What happened? Everyone has a theory — maybe the IPO was mishandled, maybe there was too much hype, maybe Facebook was just overvalued from the start — but the fact remains that the social network has lost about $43 billion in market cap in the past two months (half of its original valuation) and is already one of the worst performing social media IPOs to date.Unfortunately for Facebook, the worst may be yet to come. Starting next month, nearly 1.7 billion more shares could start hitting the market as employees become freed up to start selling their holdings, which could more than quadruple the number of Facebook shares now trading.5. Executives are leavingAs happens just about any time a startup goes public -- early employees stick around through the IPO, cash out and then move on to new things. At Facebook, however, several high-profile recent defections have raised questions about the company's leadership and its prospects going forward.This week, both Katie Mitic, Facebook's former director of platform marketing, and Ethan Beard, the company's former director of platform partnerships, announced plans to leave the company, bringing the total number of executive departures since Facebook's IPO to three. Bret Taylor, the company's former CTO, left in June.Story continues6. Its reputation is sufferingIt seems like a lifetime ago that Facebook was the hot, new startup that engineers were begging to work at (even competing in coding competitions to earn coveted internship spots, if 2010 film "The Social Network" is to be believed). But that glitter has faded post-IPO and, although Facebook remains a force in Silicon Valley hiring, it is starting to run into opposition for the first time in its brief history.Case in point: App.net founder Dalton Caldwell stirred up controversy earlier this week after he effectively turned down an "acqui-hire" offer from Facebook, in which his startup would be purchased by the social network and then shut down as a way to bring his staff on board.Caldwell's very public "thanks, but no thanks" response set off a firestorm of discussion in Silicon Valley, where acqui-hiring is a common and generally accepted part of doing business. But, like his stance or not, the fact remains that there are now developers in California who do not want to work at Facebook, and that's a new reality for the company.7. Insiders are selling their stock More than a few Facebook insiders dumped their stock on the IPO, making millions in the process. That fact alone was not surprising; many of these folks had been waiting for years to cash in on their investments.But when an IPO goes as badly as Facebook's did, having a group of investors and senior executives sell their stock at or near the peak price does tend to discourage other buyers. Overall, Facebook's insiders sold $9.8 billion worth of stock at the IPO, accounting for some 241 million shares, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg taking home a cool $1.14 billion and early Facebook investors Accel Partners selling 57.7 million shares for $2.1 billion.Had these insiders waited until today to sell, their shares would now be worth less than half what they got, or about $4.8 billion in total. Zuckerberg himself lost $423 million on paper after yesterday's drop, knocking him out of the top 10 of the richest technology titans.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatchAfter just one day of trading, Zoom Video is the most highly valued tech stock by this metricMarketWatchTech Stocks This Week: 2 Soaring IPOs and Apple's Settlement With QualcommMotley FoolPinterest stock soars after IPO, with hopes pinned on overseas growthMarketWatchZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThomas Cook approached by potential bidders - Sky NewsReutersSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolTrump Watch: What We Learned From the Mueller Report + Jessie Liu's Office Prepares to Step InALM Media1 Big Reason Why Disney Stock Is Just Getting StartedMotley FoolWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraph57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley Fool8 Happy Easter Images to Post on Facebook, Twitter and InstagramInvestorPlace5 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy in 2019Motley FoolBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceTrump sours on Mueller report after initial upbeat viewAssociated PressWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceDon’t Miss Out on the Netflix of 5G StocksInvestorPlace

That fact alone was not surprising; many of these folks had been waiting for years to cash in on their investments.But when an IPO goes as badly as Facebook's did, having a group of investors and senior executives sell their stock at or near the peak price does tend to discourage other buyers. Overall, Facebook's insiders sold $9.8 billion worth of stock at the IPO, accounting for some 241 million shares, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg taking home a cool $1.14 billion and early Facebook investors Accel Partners selling 57.7 million shares for $2.1 billion.Had these insiders waited until today to sell, their shares would now be worth less than half what they got, or about $4.8 billion in total. Zuckerberg himself lost $423 million on paper after yesterday's drop, knocking him out of the top 10 of the richest technology titans.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatchAfter just one day of trading, Zoom Video is the most highly valued tech stock by this metricMarketWatchPinterest stock soars after IPO, with hopes pinned on overseas growthMarketWatch3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Watch in AprilMotley FoolWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceThomas Cook approached by potential bidders - Sky NewsReuters'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceTrump Watch: What We Learned From the Mueller Report + Jessie Liu's Office Prepares to Step InALM MediaTesla earnings: The big question is how big is the quarterly lossMarketWatchWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceHere's What Hedge Funds Think About NIO Inc.

He was the president of del.icio.us through the company's sale to Yahoo and has been a founder of five companies. Albert graduated from Harvard and holds a Ph.D. from MIT. You can find his smart writing daily on The Continuations Blog.A couple of days have passed since the news of the monster acquisition of WhatsApp by Facebook broke. More people have written about it already than I can possibly link to so I won’t even try. My immediate reaction just based on financial metrics was that Facebook massively overpaid but I wasn’t sure about the strategic side. Having had some time to think about that I am now convinced that this deal makes no sense.Why? Because phone number based messenger apps can bootstrap very rapidly off the graph that is contained in people’s address books. We are witnessing that now with the Telegram Messenger app which apparently signed up nearly 5 million users yesterday. The UIs of all of these apps are virtually identical and are also extremely similar to the basic SMS UI that everyone around the world knows and understands. The combination means there is virtually no enduser lock in at the messaging layer.So instead of paying $19 Billion, Facebook should and could have created its own version and promoted it via its massive network. I am quite convinced that they would have been able to get to half a billion users for a fraction of the amount of money! They could have promoted their version via Facebook itself and then spend a “cool” billion or two on advertising this globally and/or incentivizing installs. Let me repeat the key point: the switching cost for users on a phone number based messaging services is at or near zero (this is  different for identity based services and even more so if they are a platform that third parties can integrate with such as WeChat and Kik — the latter is a USV portfolio company).All the arguments being made about Facebook simply using its highly (over?) valued stock to buy a business don’t add up. If you buy something with sustainable revenue streams, then great and you should do that all day long (especially if your revenue / earnings multiple is higher than the target’s). But shelling out a lot of money for something that you will (likely) make free and on top of it paying close to or possibly above your own revenue multiple makes no sense. Neither does the argument that they were taking out a threat. How many times can you take out a threat at 10% of your market cap? And why would you pay that much to eliminate a threat, when you have a credible “build” alternative?I think Mark Zuckerberg blinked and the board didn’t push back hard (or maybe doesn’t even have the power to push back if they wanted to). And in fairness, Mark’s prior acquisition of Instagram was brilliant: great price and an amazing follower network that is based on identities that are separate from phone numbers (and has an obvious native mobile advertising model).The winners here are clear: the founders and employees of WhatsApp and the limited and general partners at Sequoia Capital. An additional winner is Google — apparently they tried to buy WhatsApp for $10B and possibly even match the Facebook offer. Who should be most upset? Shareholders and employees of Facebook. Followed by users of WhatsApp who are apparently voting with their feet (or thumbs, as it were) which is likely what is driving Telegram’s sign up rate. ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatch3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Watch in AprilMotley Fool5 Ways The Smart Money is Playing the Billion Dollar Satellite Internet TrendInsider MonkeyWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolNOT REAL NEWS: A look at what didn't happen this weekAssociated PressZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolWhy Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical Company Limited (HKG:338) Is A Financially Healthy CompanySimply Wall St.Samsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolTrump Watch: What We Learned From the Mueller Report + Jessie Liu's Office Prepares to Step InALM MediaMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergYou Might Like Tutor Perini Corporation (NYSE:TPC) But Do You Like Its Debt?Simply Wall St.'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraph57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolUber raised $1 billion for self-driving cars because it desperately needs the moneyQuartzBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo Finance8 Happy Easter Images to Post on Facebook, Twitter and InstagramInvestorPlaceTrump sours on Mueller report after initial upbeat viewAssociated PressWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo Finance

While Facebook is still working on taking down fake accounts and Pages aimed at stoking political tensions, both in the US and abroad, it's also focusing on spam so that its users can "trust the connections they make on Facebook." Of those removed today, Facebook said many used fake accounts or multiple accounts with the same name to post a large amount of content on various Groups and Pages, with the goal being to drive traffic to outside websites through which they could collect ad revenue.  "They post clickbait posts on these Pages to drive people to websites that are entirely separate from Facebook and seem legitimate, but are actually ad farms," Facebook said about those utilizing these sorts of strategies.Story continuesReblogShareTweetShareWhat to Read NextWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatch3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Watch in AprilMotley FoolReport: FTC considering oversight of Facebook's ZuckerbergAssociated PressNOT REAL NEWS: A look at what didn't happen this weekAssociated PressZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance1 Big Reason Why Disney Stock Is Just Getting StartedMotley FoolWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBC'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolZoom's CEO emigrated from China 22 years ago and spoke little English — now he's worth almost $3 billionCNBCBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadgetWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetNetflix might have more Beyoncé specials planned after 'Homecoming'Engadget

Facebook says hackers accessed data from 29 million accounts as part of the security breach disclosed two weeks ago. (AP Photo/Ben Margot, File)MoreNEW YORK (AP) — Could hackers have been able to see the last person you cyberstalked, or that party photo you were tagged in? According to Facebook, the unfortunate answer is "yes."On Friday, the social network said fewer users were affected in a security breach it disclosed two weeks ago than originally estimated — nearly 30 million, down from 50 million. In additional good news, the company said hackers weren't able to access more sensitive information like your password or financial information. And third-party apps weren't affected.Still, for users already uneasy about the privacy and security of their Facebook accounts after a year of tumult , the details that hackers did gain access to — gender, relationship status, hometown and other info — might be even more unsettling.Facebook has been quick to let users check exactly what was accessed. But beyond learning what information the attackers accessed, there's relatively little that users can do — beyond, that is, watching out for suspicious emails or texts. Facebook says the problem has been fixed.The company set up a website that its 2 billion global users can use to check if their accounts have been accessed, and if so, exactly what information was stolen. It will also provide guidance on how to spot and deal with suspicious emails or texts. Facebook will also send messages directly to those people affected by the hack.On that page, following some preliminary information about the investigation, the question "Is my Facebook account impacted by this security issue?" appears midway down. It will also provide information specific to your account if you're logged into Facebook.Facebook said the hackers accessed names, email addresses or phone numbers from these accounts. For 14 million of them, hackers got even more data — basically anything viewable on your account that any of your friends could see, and more. It's a pretty extensive list: user name, gender, locale or language, relationship status, religion, hometown, self-reported current city, birthdate, device types used to access Facebook, education, work, the last 10 places you checked into or were tagged in, your website, people or Pages you follow and your 15 most recent searches.An additional 1 million accounts were affected, but hackers didn't get any information from them.The company isn't giving a breakdown of where these users are, but says the breach was "fairly broad." It plans to send messages to people whose accounts were hacked.Facebook said the FBI is investigating, but asked the company not to discuss who may be behind the attack. The company said it hasn't ruled out the possibility of smaller-scale attacks that used the same vulnerability.The company said it has fixed the bugs and logged out affected users to reset those digital keys.Facebook Vice President Guy Rosen said in a Friday call with reporters that the company hasn't ruled out the possibility that other parties might have launched other, smaller scale efforts to exploit the same vulnerability before it was disabled.Patrick Moorhead, founder of Moor Insights & Strategy, said the breach appeared similar to identity theft breaches that have occurred at companies including Yahoo and Target in 2013."Those personal details could be very easily be used for identity theft to sign up for credit cards, get a loan, get your banking password, etc.," he said. "Facebook should provide all those customers free credit monitoring to make sure the damage is minimized."Thomas Rid, a professor at the Johns Hopkins University, also said the evidence, particularly the size of the breach, seems to point to a criminal motive rather than a sophisticated state operation, which usually targets fewer people."This doesn't sound very targeted at all," he said. "Usually when you're looking at a sophisticated government operation, then a couple of thousand people hacked is a lot, but they usually know who they're going after."ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatch3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Watch in AprilMotley FoolReport: FTC considering oversight of Facebook's ZuckerbergAssociated PressNOT REAL NEWS: A look at what didn't happen this weekAssociated PressZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance1 Big Reason Why Disney Stock Is Just Getting StartedMotley FoolWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBC'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolZoom's CEO emigrated from China 22 years ago and spoke little English — now he's worth almost $3 billionCNBCBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadgetWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetNetflix might have more Beyoncé specials planned after 'Homecoming'Engadget

She'd been coding since she was 6.A real life Powerpuff GirlAfter creating the board game, Mehta won the $2,500 second-place prize from Think Tank Learning's Pitchfest in 2016.This caught the notice of some marketeers for Cartoon Network who were looking to profile inspiring young girls as real life "Powerpuff Girls." She was featured in one of their videos, and things took off from there.Samaira Mehta at GoogleMoreSamaira MehtaMehta was featured on some newscasts and started selling her game on Amazon."We've sold 1,000 boxes, so over $35,000, and it's only been on the market for one year," the exuberant and adorable Mehta told Business Insider.It wasn't just happenstance promotion. When she launched the board game, she also came up with a killer marketing plan with the help of her proud father, Rakesh Mehta (an Intel engineer and Oracle and Sun Microsystems alum).Mehta uses the game to conduct coding workshops for school-age kids. And she thinks big.She launched an initiative called Yes, 1 Billion Kids Can Code that allows interested people to donate boxes of the game to schools. She then set up workshops to help kids at those schools learn how to master the game.At the start of this school year, 106 schools were using the game to teach kids to code, Mehta said."In the world there are over 1 billion kids," she said. "There are people who are willing to donate CoderBunnyz boxes to schools and to people in need all over the world who want to learn coding."Aadit MehtaMoreCoderMindzSales of the game have gone so well that Mehta has just launched a sequel: a game for kids that teaches them how to code using artificial intelligence.The new game is called CoderMindz and she's billing it as the first AI board game.With CoderMindz, kids can learn basic AI principals — concepts like training an AI model, inference, and adaptive learning. Eventually, they can use those skills to build robots.Story continuesShe developed it with the help of her brother, Aadit, who is 6, the age she was when her dad started teaching her to code.A young Valley star is bornAs the game took off, Mehta was booked with workshops. She's done over 60 of them in Silicon Valley with over 2,000 kids so far, she said.The workshops included a series held at Google headquarters in Mountain View, California. That's where she met Stacy Sullivan, Google's chief culture officer.Samaira MehtaMoreCoderBunnyz"After my back-to-back workshops at Google headquarters, we talked for an hour," Mehta said. "She told me I was doing great and once I get out of college, I can come work for Google."The plucky young coder told Sullivan that she didn't know if she would want to work for Google. She likes being an entrepreneur.Meanwhile, Sullivan and the folks at Google were so impressed with the kid coder that she was picked as the keynote speaker at a Diversity in Tech conference held in August hosted at Google Launchpad, the company's startup accelerator in San Francisco. But she's done a bunch of other speaking gigs, too, including one at Microsoft and at the Girls' Festival sponsored by World Wide Women earlier this month.Samaira MehtaMoreSamaira MehtaSince the debut of CoderBunnyz she's met a lot of big names. One of her proudest moments was receiving an encouraging letter from former first lady Michelle Obama.She also met Mark Zuckerberg on Halloween when she was trick-or-treating in his neighborhood, and took the opportunity to chat him up about her coding work.She said there was "a super long line" at his house."I finally got to meet him," she remembered. "He was handing out chocolates. I told him I was a young coder and he told me to keep going, you're doing great."She's now launched her own interview series on her CoderBunnyz website in which she talks with people in the robotics, game, and education sectors.CoderBunnyz workshopMoreCoderBunnyzWhile she's reinvesting all the money from her young business into manufacturing more CoderBunnyz games and creating the new AI game, she's already got a charity picked out for when she generates profits: PATH."It ends homelessness and helps people rebuild skills and I care about the homeless," she said.Until the day her company can make donations, she's putting her entrepreneurial know-how to work in other ways to raise money for it, including hosting a lemonade stand this summer that brought in $119.NOW WATCH: How a coding genius makes incredible 3D-graphics for major Hollywood moviesSee Also:Here's how Google's new $150 Home Hub compares to the Amazon Echo ShowBattle of the big phones: How Google's new Pixel 3 XL compares to the jumbo iPhone XS MaxDELETE YOUR ACCOUNT: How to wipe your personal information from Facebook, Amazon, Google, and other major websites and appsSEE ALSO: The extraordinary life of Microsoft's billionaire cofounder Paul Allen, who has died at the age of 65ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWhat to Expect When Alphabet Reports Later This MonthMotley FoolThe Morning After: The Weather Channel got hackedEngadgetCaterina Fake is known for her trend-spotting; here's some of what she's chasing nowTechCrunchConsole gaming is at a crossroadsEngadgetMueller's Reminder That Silicon Valley Isn't Ready for the Next ElectionBloombergZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceState defends South Dakota pipeline protest legislationAssociated Press'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolIn Ukrainian candidate's hometown, a cry for changeAssociated PressAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHere's What Hedge Funds Think About NIO Inc.

Absolutely unbelievable,” chef Ståle Johansen told Afterposten, according to an NBC News translation.  OL-leiren bestilte 1500 egg gjennom å oversette via Google Translate. Men det slo feil. 15.000 ble levert på døra. Vi ønsker lykke til og håper at de norske gullhåpene er glade – veldig glade – i egg: 😁pic.twitter.com/qaWVpq1Xgy— Trønder-Avisa (@tronderavisa) February 3, 2018 Johansen said they fortunately were able to return the extra 13,500 eggs to the store but said the chefs will still be whipping up plenty of egg dishes for the Norwegian competitors. He added that his culinary team will be preparing food “almost 24 hours a day” to keep their athletes well-nourished. Norway has thehighest all-time Winter Olympics medal count, with 329 medals amassed since the first Winter Games in 1924. The Scandinavian nation is expected to yet againbe one of the top countries to beatat this year’s games. Cooking for Olympic athletes is no small feat, as Megan Chacosky, a chef for the U.S. Winter Olympics team, explained to Mic.com in an interview last month. “I often joke that it’s likemaking Thanksgiving dinner twice a day,” said Chacosky, who will reportedly help prepare about 3,000 meals for the American teamwhile it’s in Pyeonchang.Chacosky told ABC News that most athletes at the Games, which kick off this Friday, will be consuming 3,000 to 4,000 calories per day.“The amount of travel these athletes do, in addition to their training, they’re putting their bodies to the max,” she said. “We try to get lots of fresh produce to get vitamins and minerals to help keep them healthy.”This article originally appeared on HuffPost.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceMagic Johnson joins Ice Cube's bid to buy sports networks from DisneyAmerican City Business Journals'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolAtlanta businessmen's horses to race in Kentucky DerbyAmerican City Business JournalsAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceInstagram test visualizes hiding 'Like' counts from viewersEngadgetWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphThe Quick Read About… Ukraine's Run-Off Presidential ElectionsTimeMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance內地熱門城市樓價回升星島日報57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolMLS Review: De Boer's Atlanta woes continue, Nani lifts Orlando CityGoal.comWhat's next for Trump following the Mueller Report?Yahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin Rivet3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley Fool

If you find it painful saving money, youâ€™re not alone. AÂ recent survey says 72% of Americans were stressed about money last month.In fact, according to the Federal Reserve, 60% of Americans between the ages of 18 to 40 saved absolutely nothing in 2013. Last year, adults under 35 had a savings rate of negative 2%.So why is this happening? Is it that hard to go to a bank and open an automatic savings or a CD account?â€œThe bank experience has too much friction and inertia that people are just not saving,â€ Ethan Bloch, founder of the personal finance app Digit, tells Business Insider.Bloch created Digit, an app that automatically saves money from your checking account without your even having to think about it. He got $2.5 million in seed funding from Baseline Ventures, Google Ventures, and a handful of other firms last December, and the app opens to the public Thursday.The way it works is simple. Once you connect your checking account to Digit, it will automatically transfer a small portion of your money that it knows you wonâ€™t be needing immediately to a separate Digit savings account. These are FDIC-insured, custodial accounts held by Digit at two of its partner banks, Wells Fargo and BofI Federal Bank, meaning that even if Digit or both those banks go bankrupt, you will be insured up to $250,000.The secret sauce is in Digitâ€™s algorithm, which monitors your income and spending patterns and calculates the exact amount of money you wonâ€™t be missing.It mainly looks at four things: the level of money in your checking account, upcoming salary, upcoming bills, and how youâ€™ve been spending lately (with some banks, Digit can pull three years of transaction data). So if you get fired one day and your paycheck stops, Digit will see that and readjust the transfer amount. Users can always manually set their savings amount, and, if needed, withdraw their savings anytime they want, too.But thereâ€™s a catch: Users do not earn any interest on their savings.Digit screenshotMoreDigitDigit doesn't charge users for its service, so all the transfer and operating costs are covered by the interest Digit earns by saving those usersâ€™ money at its partner banks.Â Eventually, it hopes to share some of that interest back with its users once it builds enough of a financial base. â€œOur goal is to share some of the interest with our customers as we grow our deposits, as long as we know we can cover our costs,â€ Bloch tells us.That sharing may happen sooner than later, as the company is growing pretty well. During its five-month pilot period, which ended in December, Digit saved a total of $600,000 for its members, and now itâ€™s saving members $1 million per month. And it hasn't even launched to the public until this week.If anyone can make this happen, Bloch seems to be the right guy.

So we asked a few Motley Fool contributors to name some businesses they think have potential that resembles that of the Google of yore. They came back with ADT Inc. (NYSE: ADT), Shopify (NYSE: SHOP), and Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX).Image of a tower viewer overlooking a mountain landscape.MoreImage source: Getty Images.You just can't ignore this e-commerce playNeha Chamaria (Shopify): Google was already profitable when it IPOed in 2004. But the numbers that stood out in its books quarter after quarter were on the top line: Its revenue was growing at a torrid pace. That, combined with Google's potential to become a tech juggernaut, caught investors' attention, and went on to make it one of the most successful stocks ever. I see similar potential in Shopify -- an e-commerce powerhouse in the making that's already turning heads with its differentiated product offerings and strong revenue growth.Unlike Amazon.com, which operates its own marketplace, Shopify offers a cloud-based e-commerce platform that makes it easy for small and medium-sized businesses to create and run their own online stores. Shopify earns monthly fees (subscription solutions revenue) from the merchants that use its platform, as well as a percentage of transactions made on its portal (merchant solutions revenue).Shopify generated a record $9.1 billion in gross merchandise volume in the last quarter even as its merchant base crossed 600,000. Its revenue surged 73% in 2017. One strong factor appears to be working for Shopify: Access to entrepreneurs and smaller businesses to its technologically advanced, e-commerce platform. Just to give you an idea about what Shopify is doing on the tech front, the company recently partnered with none other than Apple to bring augmented reality to its platform.While Shopify isn't profitable yet because it's spending heavily to grow and market its business, investors are likely to be richly rewarded in the long run given the profitable niche it's carving for itself in the e-commerce space.You can invest in this security leader againChuck Saletta (ADT): By the time it went public, Google was already recognized as an internet search leader. Home and business security company ADT is similarly a leader in its industry in the U.S. and Canada. After about two years as a privately held company, it rejoined the public market last month, and is actually trading below its IPO price. That gives investors the opportunity to buy in for less than those "lucky" enough to get a piece of its offering.Home and business security monitoring, like internet search, is a business where scale matters a great deal. With alarm systems, central monitoring sites handle the response and dispatch duties. The more customers a company has, the more widely it can spread its overhead costs. As the largest player in its industry, ADT is thus best able to cover the costs of providing its service.ADT's shares aren't just trading below their IPO price, they're downright reasonable compared to the company's prospects. They're valued at less than 15 times its expected forward earnings,  and the company is expected to be able to grow earnings at a healthy clip over the next five or so years.Story continuesIf there's one risk with ADT, it's that its balance sheet has been "levered up" by its former private equity owner:  Its debt-to-equity ratio is a rather high 3.9.  Given its scale and relatively asset-light operating model, it will likely be able to generate enough cash to comfortably service its debt. Still, that's something to watch, especially if its growth doesn't materialize to the expected degree.The streaming video giant Chris Neiger (NFLX): Netflix is a powerhouse in its niche of video streaming, just like Google was (and is) with Internet search. The two companies similarly focused their attentions on building amazing products, and neither has looked back since. But the difference is that Netflix is only beginning to tap its international market potential.Netflix ended 2017 with about 118 million total subscribers and more than 53% of them are international customers. It would therefore be logical to assume that the majority of its sales and earnings come from outside the U.S. -- but they don't. International subscribers generate about 49% of revenue and have a contribution margin (which is sales, minus variable costs) of just 8.7%, compared to a 34.4% margin for Netflix's domestic customers. What all of this means is that Netflix has a huge opportunity to raise rates for its international customers in the coming years, just as it has done in the U.S., and drastically increase its margins in other markets.Netflix had its first full year of international-contribution profits in 2017, and more than doubled its global operating income as well. Conservative estimates forecast its international subscriber numbers will exceed 100 million just two years from now, which would require about 60% growth. That doesn't even include domestic customer growth over that same time period. Even if Netflix rolls out price increases more slowly for its international customers than it has domestically, those customers will still add significantly to the company's profits.Strong subscription and sales growth both at home and abroad have, of course, pushed up the Netflix's share price and valuation. Shares are trading at 67 times forward earnings estimates right now. But Netflix isn't anywhere near finished growing -- and its international profits are just getting started.

However, not every off-the-beaten-path stock is worth buying. We asked some of our top Motley Fool investors to scour the market for underfollowed companies they think can be bought now. At the top of their list are Jounce Therapeutics (NASDAQ: JNCE), Snap-On (NYSE: SNA), and Baidu (NASDAQ: BIDU).Are these stocks right for your portfolio?Ignoring this biotech could be a mistakeTodd Campbell (Jounce Therapeutics): Clinical-stage biotech stocks are often overlooked by Wall Street until they report positive trial data. As a result, it could be a good time to buy Jounce Therapeutics ahead of midstage trial results for its lead product candidate, JTX-2011.A businessman looking through binoculars.MoreIMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.JTX-2011 is a cancer drug that's being evaluated as a monotherapy and in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb's multibillion-dollar PD-1 drug, Opdivo. It stimulates the immune system by activating the Inducible T cell CO-Stimulator (ICOS) protein that's found on certain T cells within tumors.Typically, cancer drugs are evaluated in trials enrolling patients with one type of cancer, such as lung cancer. However, that's not the case with JTX-2011. ICOS is expressed on effector cells across a number of cancer indications, so its trial is evaluating it in six different solid tumor indications, including lung cancer. JTX-2011 is additionally intriguing because it may help PD-1 drugs work in patients who wouldn't typically respond to them. PD-1 drugs are among the world's best-selling cancer drugs, so the potential for JTX-2011 to be used alongside them is significant.Assuming that JTX-2011's trial data is good, it's possible that regulators will consider giving it an accelerated or conditional OK, especially for use in advanced cancer patients with limited treatment options. If so, then JTX-2011 has a good shot at hitting the ground running because Jounce has inked a co-commercialization deal with the biotech Goliath Celgene (NASDAQ: CELG).Admittedly, there's no guarantee that JTX-2011's data will be good, and that makes this a high-risk stock. Nevertheless, if this trial pans out, I think there's potential for this company's shares to trade significantly higher. The cancer-treatment market is enormous, yet Jounce's market cap is just $844 million and only four analysts cover it, according to Yahoo! Finance. Since Jounce is underfollowed, its shares could rally if more analysts initiate coverage with a buy, following its JTX-2011 data.This stock could make growth a snapRich Duprey (Snap-On): Shares of automotive hand-tool maker Snap-On have risen 30% from their 52-week lows. With earnings on the table on Feb. 8, analysts are betting the company's going to miss consensus estimates. The bear case is that the company relies too much on financing its franchises, which now account for more than a quarter of operating profits compared to 4% from 2010, and collections on receivables are worsening.Management, however, says financing's contributions to the overall total are overblown when the situation is looked at as a whole, and slowdowns in sales last year were due more to adjustments in inventory than slack demand. It also doesn't expect charge-offs to worsen.Story continuesSnap-On has made several acquisitions over the last year or so, which gives it great opportunity to expand internationally. It continues to enhance its franchise network, while also expanding its relationship with repair-shop owners. And despite pockets of occasional weakness, Snap-On's main business segments all show solid growth prospects over the long haul.The economy is performing the best that it has in years, and car-rating service Edmunds.com says that, although values for 10- to 15-year old cars is stagnating a bit, they remain consistently higher for these cars, reflecting their demand. They represent just under 10% of all used-car sales, suggesting there will be a ready market for their repair, even if used-car sales, in general, are slowing.Snap-On pays a dividend of $3.28 per share that yields a modest 1.8% annually, but with Wall Street's bearish outlook, an upside surprise could send shares soaring.A red envelope filled with Chinese paper money with coins tied with red yarn resting on top of it.MoreIMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.The Google of ChinaDanny Vena (Baidu): Many investors tend to be U.S.-centric in their thinking. While that's easy to understand, it also can result in lost prospects. Expanding outside national borders provides a world of opportunities.Consider China, with its population of 1.37 billion consumers and 700 million internet users -- more than twice the number in the U.S. Even across hemispheres, the common thread among online users is search. That's why investors should check out Baidu, the "Google of China."Baidu dominates local search in the country, controlling more than 70% of the market. The company still generates 85% of its revenue from search, but has its sights set firmly on the future.The company realized early the trend toward mobile internet, allowing it to make the transition and maintain its leading position. Baidu was also among the first to see the potential for artificial intelligence (AI) and is the leader of AI in China, and has some of the top programs worldwide.Baidu is home to some of the foremost minds in AI, and this can be seen across the company's products and services. From improved search results to smart speakers to autonomous driving, AI is integrated into the company's operations.Baidu is also home to iQiyi, the leading streaming service in China, which has an estimated 442 million monthly active users and 33% of the coveted 25- to 30-year-old demographic. Baidu may spin off the streaming company in 2018.The company hasn't been without the occasional misstep. Its investments in the online-to-offline (O2O) market never gained significant momentum, and regulators took a particular interest in the advertising practices of questionable medical companies.In its most recent quarter, Baidu saw revenue that grew 29% year over year, and net income that soared 156% over the prior-year quarter.Wall Street is overlooking this stock -- don't make the same mistake.

By gathering information from mapping vehicles and anonymized snippets of route data from individual iPhones, Apple aims to provide users with a more comprehensive, current guide to the world—beginning this fall for iOS 12 users across northern California. That would be a decent start to redeeming Apple Maps from a legacy of errant routing. But if Apple wants to overcome the enormous lead of Google (GOOG, GOOGL), more accurate lines and dots can only be the start.Transit navigation in more placesSix years after Apple Maps launched without public transit information, it matches Google feature-for-feature in major cities like New York and Washington—it tells you which exit to take out of a subway station and even knows about single-purpose routes like the express bus from Metro to Dulles International Airport. But outside of such cities, Apple’s transit support remains woefully behind, leaving Google Maps unchallenged for bus guidance in smaller places like Burlington, Vermont, and Missoula, Montana.Beyond the U.S., Apple Maps is a joke for transit advice. It has no help for subways and buses in Bangkok, Barcelona, Brussels and Buenos Aires, and it’s just as bad across the rest of the alphabet of global cities. I don’t know what’s made adding transit navigation such a bespoke, artisanal process at Apple, but it has to stop. Because Google and, to a lesser extent, Microsoft (MSFT) have been able to incorporate transit agencies’ schedules and routes. In fact, there’s been a standard format for that since 2006—without the work looking like cartographic trench warfare.Not all lanes are the sameIf you drive to work, your commute can go by faster if you’re willing to pay—or if you have enough other passengers in the car. But both Apple and Google have been slow to recognize the advent of carpool lanes that charge single drivers a toll but let high-occupancy vehicles (typically, from two to three people per vehicle) roll by for free.Google is still way ahead of Apple’s mapping software.MoreGoogle’s Waze app added support for these surcharge-possible lanes at the end of November, in the form of a switch that lets people self-designate as “HOV” drivers to see the fastest, cheapest routes available.Apple Maps should follow suit. But first, it will need to mark out carpool lanes clearly—which it does not do on the Virginia side of the Capital Beltway, more than five years after the debut of those “Express Lanes.”Apple would also do well to roll out this feature worldwide faster than usual. Carolina Milanesi, an analyst with Creative Strategies, complained in an email that Apple took years to add lane-specific guidance on European highways. “It seems that California is their best implementation of Maps when it comes to the granularity of info,” she wrote.Safe walking directionsBoth Google and Apple could do better when guiding people on foot. I saw this firsthand last November at the Web Summit conference in Lisbon, when Google Maps suggested a seemingly optimum walking route from a restaurant back to my hotel. But it had found one of the least pedestrian-friendly routes in that walkable city, and sent me alongside a four-lane highway mostly absent of sidewalks. Google still offers the same defective routing, as does Apple Maps. And complaints of unsafe walking directions continue to pop up. This could be a chance for Apple to do better: The amount of data its vans collect (TechCrunch’s Panzarino counted eight cameras and four LiDAR sensors on one) should allow it better insight over what makes a safe path for a pedestrian. Story continuesBikes belong too—and so do scootersIf you get around on two wheels, Google Maps remains unchallenged eight years after Google added bicycling directions, even as bike-sharing services have revolutionized getting around cities.At a minimum, Apple should show cyclists the way as well as Google does—and it looks like Apple might do just that. In a Twitter thread following up on his story, Panzarino noted that Apple is already recording the speed at which people cross parks—an obvious indicator of cycling versus walking. But why not do better? To the extent that bike-sharing services allow public access to their availability data, a navigation app should be able to tell you which ones have bikes open near you—something third-party services like Transit Screen already do. The same goes for the electric bike and electric scooter sharing services that let people get a little farther across town without breaking a sweat.All-of-the-above routingBoth Apple and Google’s maps show their age when they list driving and transit as separate categories—but there’s no reason to do that when you can start a trip on a shared bike, take a train and then let Lyft or Uber complete your journey.“I’d like all apps including Google to do multimodal—like ‘take transit here and then hop on Capital Bikeshare from there’ or ‘Uber to transit’ or the like,” commented David Alpert, founder of the transit-and-development-policy site Greater Greater Washington. “Now it assumes you are using one mode.”An only-Apple situationLooking at all the things Apple Maps botches today, it can be tempting to tell people to stop waiting on Cupertino and use Google Maps already. But Apple doesn’t let iPhone users designate another map app as the default for navigation. If you use an Apple Watch, you can’t have Google call out turns on your wrist. And until iOS 12 ships, you can’t use Google Maps or Waze on the CarPlay screen of a suitably equipped vehicle.Apple has essentially said “I alone can fix this.” So it had better do that.More from Rob:Apple’s Safari has dropped the ball on securityHow self-driving cars will take to China’s roadsFacebook’s push to kill bad political ads is also hiding regular postsHow Europe’s proposed copyright laws could ruin your search enginesHere’s what it’s like to drive a hydrogen-powered car Email Rob at rob@robpegoraro.com; follow him on Twitter at @robpegoraro.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextFoxconn says it remains committed to Wisconsin investment projectReutersAt $1 Trillion, Apple is Bigger Than These ThingsInvestopediaWhat to Expect When Alphabet Reports Later This MonthMotley FoolDon't Miss Out on the Netflix of 5G StocksInvestorPlaceThe Morning After: The Weather Channel got hackedEngadgetZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business Videos57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphThe Boeing 737 MAX Is 1 Step Closer to Flying Again -- but Don't Expect to See It SoonMotley FoolBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadgetBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolTesla's board is about to get a lot smallerTechCrunchAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo Finance3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetInvesting in General Electric Is All About These 3 Key ThingsMotley Fool

Like the full-size Echo, it responds to your commands and questions from across the room—but it’s a tiny, sawed-off one that costs $50. The only difference is that because you don’t have the big cylinder, the sound quality is tinny. It makes a fantastic second Echo—say, for the upstairs.Well, now here’s Google (GOOG, GOOGL) with its own version of the Dot, called the Google Home Mini. Also puck-shaped, also $50. (Google will also be releasing the Google Home Max, a beefier version with better sound.)The new Google Home Mini (right) has clearly been inspired by the Amazon Echo Dot (left).MoreThe Dot and the Mini are 90% identical. They both work great. Each has a Microphone Off switch, so you can be sure that it’s not listening for its trigger word. Both can now distinguish who is making the request, so that it can respond to commands like “Play my party playlist” and “What’s next on my calendar?” with the right person’s music or info. Both now let you make free speakerphone calls to actual phone numbers (although the Google’s call quality is awful).There are, however, a few differences to note.In this corner: The Google Home Mini.The sound is much better. Neither assistant pod will be mistaken for a concert hall. But there’s no question that Google’s built-in speaker is richer than Amazon’s.It talks to Chromecasts and Android TVs. If you spring $35 for a Chromecast (a little receiver stick that plugs into a modern TV’s USB jack), or if you have a TV that runs Android TV, you can perform a nifty trick. You can say, “Ok Google, show me a video about how to remove contact lenses” or “Show me funny cat videos” or “Show me the trailer for the new Avengers movie,” and it appears on your TV instantly. As you can see in the video above, it’s quite magical.It will someday have a tap-to-talk feature. The top of the Mini is supposed to be touch sensitive. As designed, you could tap it to issue a command (instead of saying “OK Google”), or tap it to pause music. But just as the Home Mini was shipping, a reviewer discovered a bug in which that button thought that it was being pressed all the time, transmitting everything anyone said in the room to Google’s servers. So Google responded by shutting off that top button’s features altogether.Google will presumably restore the tap-the-top feature once they get their act together.MoreAnd now, in this corner: The Amazon Echo Dot.Works with more home-automation products, like internet-controlled thermostats, lights, security cameras, and so on. It’s a huge list. Google’s improving on this front, but Amazon’s had a several-year head start.It has an audio output jack. Lots of people love plugging in their nice speakers or sound systems to an Echo Dot, thanks to the standard miniplug on the side (the Google offers nothing similar). That makes it easy to control your music by voice—one of the most luxurious features ever.It’s much easier and more reliable to adjust the Echo Dot’s volume (left) by turning its ring instead of tapping the sides.MoreYou can see feedback across the room. The Dot’s LED ring glows in different colors and patterns to communicate different things—for example, it glows when it’s transmitting sound back to Amazon. You can see it from the side, and therefore from across the room. The Google’s four LEDs are visible only when you’re looking down on the device, which isn’t nearly as useful.You can order stuff. Of course, this is exactly what Amazon hopes you’ll do, but it’s still cool. “Alexa—order more paper towels.”If you’re a Google Play subscriber, maybe the convenience of speaking your desires for music tips the balance for you toward the Google Home Mini. (The argument about “Buy a Google Home if you keep your calendar in Google Calendar” doesn’t really hold water, since the Echo can consult or add events to the calendar systems of Google or Apple (AAPL) or Microsoft (MSFT).Otherwise, though, the Echo Dot is still the better micro-assistant. (Especially when it’s on sale for $40—for example, on the typical Black Friday, which is in a couple of weeks.)There will be a lot of people unwrapping these little guys this holiday season.MoreBoth of these devices are delicious enhancements to almost anyone’s home. Over time, you’ll find more and more ways that they’re useful—and for only 50 bucks!Correction: The originally posted version of this story referred to the volume ring of the Echo Dot. That was a feature of the first-generation Dot; the current second-generation Dot has volume buttons on the top instead of the ring.More from David Pogue:The Fitbit Ionic doesn’t quite deserve the term ‘smartwatch’Augmented reality?

While no server is completely secure, this could provide peace of mind to people who don't trust large tech companies to protect their data. It's not hard to get the impression that big tech companies can't effectively keep our data safe. Just in the past few weeks, Google disclosed a security bug that exposed hundreds of thousands of private accounts on the Google+ social network. Facebook admitted that 29 million users had private information stolen. It's easy to decide to quit using social media sites, but nearly everyone needs or uses an email service. Email is the backbone of every internet account — you almost can't get by in life these days without an email address. One solution is to run your own in-house email server, as plenty of companies and tech-savvy individuals do. This means that a private entity is in control of the email server and all of the information stored there. There's no need to place your trust in a tech company that has proven itself to be vulnerable to security bugs or breaches. But if you're not an IT pro, the idea of setting  up an email server can be pretty intimidating. That's where Helm comes in.Helm wants to make that a reality for the everyday email user — someone who probably wouldn't know how to set up an email server from scratch. Helm's $500 device is an in-home email server, meaning all of your data and emails are stored on the device right in your home. Helm doesn't collect much information about its users besides the necessary details like payment information and device diagnostics, and any communication or data are encrypted when they leave the Helm device. With traditional email services like Gmail or Yahoo, your data and emails are stored on a server controlled by the email provider. You don't have much control over what that company does with your data.Helm stores your emails and data in your home, but that doesn't mean it's completely safe. Any server can be attacked, regardless of where it's located. However, you're paying for the control over your emails and the ability to be free from a tech company storing your data. Helm also says it hires hackers to try to locate vulnerabilities in the device or its software, and it plans to release improvements and boost security through future software updates. You can choose to store a backup of your emails on Helm's servers, but those backups are encrypted and require your security key in order to be decrypted. Helm features a standard 120GB of storage, but that can be increased to up to 5TB with additional hardware. The device also comes with physical encryption keys for encrypting data locally on the machine and offline for a secure backup.

Simple, cheap and with long-lasting batteries, they have become a popular option for students and children.Devices made by Acer, HP Inc, Dell Inc and others, including Google itself, have taken nearly 60 percent of the U.S. grade-school market in the seven or so years since they appeared.The new Acer machines are part of the latest step in Google's long-term strategy to conquer the lucrative business market, where personal computers running Microsoft Corp's Windows operating system still account for 90 percent of the market.Google, a part of Alphabet Inc, is pushing Chromebooks because they help draw customers to its cloud computing services and G Suite workplace software bundle - a rival to Microsoft's Office - both of which are key to the company's efforts to diversify revenue.Chromebooks' difficulties running complex applications have so far limited their appeal to businesses, but that could change soon."Chromebook from the gate has been that just-good-enough for your grandma device," said Linn Huang, research director at technology advisory firm IDC. "They are still leaps and bounds behind, but this year and next year Google will make massive corrections to close the gap."Acer, which IDC estimates was the No. 2 Chromebook vendor in the United States last year, will outfit its new line with large, hardened screens, aluminium bodies and Intel Corp's top-flight 8th Generation processors, said Gregg Prendergast, president of Acer Pan America.He declined to specify prices, but said they would be higher than the typical $300 (£223) Chromebooks aimed at students.Google, which makes its own $1,000-and-up Pixelbook, is working with other hardware manufacturers to launch other top-tier Chromebooks this year. Since August, Google has charged businesses $50 per laptop per year for a management licence. Its education plan costs $30 annually.Chromebooks' adoption in schools has shown businesses that the devices are easy to secure and manage, according to Huang, but their "low horsepower" has limited use to fast-food outlets, shops, banks, health clinics and similar situations where a single lightweight and mobile device is shared by many employees.Google has upped the capabilities of its software and increased the number of its authorized sales partners by 25 percent over the last year in an attempt to persuade business users that Chromebooks can handle more complex tasks.Last year, more Chromebooks began supporting Google's Android apps, which provide offline functionality and enable companies to make specialised software more accessible.

She said that Fiber's pace of rollout has been paused until the company find a way to make the service "10x" better. Don't expect Google Fiber to start announcing new target cities any time soon.Alphabet's GOOGL once-ambitious plan to blanket the country with superfast internet service has been on hold of late, and it was up to Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat on Monday to field questions about the unit's future.At the Morgan Stanley Technology Conference, where Porat was speaking, an analyst asked about Fiber's change in strategy and the company's new milestones. Porat said that Fiber's rollout has been paused until the company finds a way to make the service 10 times better."As we were looking at our rollouts going back to 2015, 2016, our view was that we had not done enough," Porat said. She said that Fiber hadn't achieved its "10x moment," which is Google-speak for getting a 10-fold improvement over existing technology.It's been a tough couple of years for Fiber. Launched in 2010 with the promise of bringing fast and affordable internet service to municipalities across the country, the initiative has endured cost-cutting measures, layoffs and two CEO resignations since becoming part of the Alphabet unit Access.Porat said that Alphabet was holding off on pushing Fiber into new markets until it could find a better way to "bring technology to bear in a meaningful way." She said that the company won't start "accelerating the rollout" again until it can prove that it has a valuable new deployment and delivery method.Access acquired the home broadband company Webpass in 2016 to help it work on new delivery methods, but Webpass recently stopped accepting new customers in Boston .Access hired a new CEO earlier this month , a Time Warner Cable executive who Porat described as having a "really strong history in the industry."Fiber is one of only three "Other Bets" businesses consistently highlighted during Alphabet's earnings calls for bringing in any revenue, alongside health-care company Verily, and Nest , which just got rolled back into Google.Alphabet cut its Other Bets capital expenditures from $1.4 billion in 2016 to $507 million in 2017 because of a reduced investment in Fiber.The pause on Fiber has had other ramifications. Ahead of a potential rollout in Portland, Oregon, Google convinced the state to provide a tax exemption. Google "paused" its Fiber plans and the tax break went to Comcast CMCSA (owner of NBC Universal, the parent of CNBC) and Frontier, which may have cost local governments and school districts more than $17 million, according to a recent report in The Oregonian ."The one thing that has not changed [about Fiber's strategy] is our view that there is a real need for quality service," Porat said.It's just not clear if Alphabet will ever be the one providing it.Here is Porat's full response:The one thing that has not changed is our view that there is a real need for quality service. As we were looking at our roll-outs going back to 2015, 2016, our view was that we had not done enough — we were appropriately self-critical — to use technology to fundamentally change the implementation approach, whether on the deployment or delivery of service to the homes of users. There wasn't kind of that breakthrough, 10x moment. And as a result of that, we concluded that we would pause the pace of rollout. We're still implementing and executing in the cities that we announced, but we've slowed the pace of rollout so that we could spend time on how do we really bring technology to bear in a more meaningful way? And it's really specifically focused on deployment and delivery. When you ask about milestones, in our view, when we have something that is substantive enough of value to justify accelerating the roll-out again, that's how we're looking at it. We're delighted to have brought in a new CEO, Dinni Jain, who has a really strong history in the industry, so we are continuing to forge ahead.More From CNBC Apple is launching medical clinics for its employeesAlphabet details how Larry Page and Sundar Pichai split dutiesSalesforce field service lightning is fastest growing product in company historyReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

REUTERS/Mike Blake/File PhotoMoreBy Paresh Dave and Arjun PanchadarSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Google owner Alphabet Inc reported first-quarter sales and profit Monday that topped financial analysts' estimates due to strong ad sales and a change in accounting for investments in startups, sending its shares up about 1 percent after hours.The results eased concerns that investment in new ventures beyond its core search business was undermining Alphabet's outlook. There also were no immediate signs that rising global privacy concerns would affect profits."The strong economy has companies spending more on advertising and we have an ongoing migration from traditional types of media advertising to greater online and social media-based advertising," said analyst Ivan Feinseth from Tigress Financial Partners. "Google continues to dominate both mobile and desktop search," he added.Worldwide sales increased to $31.1 billion, above the average analysts' estimate of $30.3 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Still, operating income margins dropped to 22 percent from 27 percent a year ago.Alphabet's profit margins have fallen in recent quarters as it ramps up costly new projects in cloud computing and hardware at its core Google unit, and despite spending cuts on an unprofitable set of ancillary initiatives known as "other bets."Overall, quarterly profit of $9.4 billion, or $13.33 per share, exceeded estimates of $6.56 billion, or $9.28 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. About $3.40 of the earnings per share were attributable to a new accounting method for unrealized gains in Alphabet's investments in startups such as Uber Technologies Inc [UBER.UL].Excluding the investment-related gains and other items, adjusted earnings were $9.93 per share, topping the $9.28 per share consensus. Alphabet's effective tax rate dropped to 11 percent from 20 percent a year earlier.Revenue from ads sold by Google rose as advertisers pursued slots on its search engine, YouTube video service and millions of partner apps and websites.Investor appetite for Alphabet has been weakened by a combination of cost and regulatory concerns as officials across the world seek to force changes in Google's business practices, such as giving customers more control over privacy of their data. Shares had fallen nearly 3.5 percent this year until a swift pre-earnings rebound last week.U.S. lawmakers initially sought to question Google alongside rival Facebook Inc at a hearing this month on how British data analysis firm Cambridge Analytica was able to acquire data on unwitting Facebook users.Google was later excused. But analysts who follow the company have said Google may not escape European Union regulators, which plan to begin enforcing a new data privacy law next month. It could prompt more users to reject receiving personalized ads online, costing Google a few billion dollars in annual sales, said Brian Wieser, a senior analyst at Pivotal Research.Advertisers also may limit ad-buying this year while sorting out their own compliance with the new European policy, known as General Data Protection Regulation, he said.Still, any pullback would be temporary because of the effectiveness of Internet advertising compared with declining media such as print and broadcast, analysts say. Alphabet's first-quarter results again showed that advertisers' attraction to Google's powerful systems in particular is strong, which could help it rebound from any privacy setbacks.Google also revealed smart thermostat maker Nest generated about $726 million in revenue in 2017. Financial results for the Alphabet division had not been released since its acquisition in 2014, but they were provided to investors Monday as it integrates into the Google unit.UBS analyst Eric Sheridan estimated last week that Nest would contribute $490 million in revenue this year to Google.Revenue from Google's mobile app store and growth priorities such as cloud computing services and consumer devices was $4.4 billion in the first quarter.The operating income margin fall reflected the acquisition of 2,000 employees in Taiwan for $1.1 billion from HTC Corp.Google also saw cost increases from moving up when it awards equity to employees and acquiring streaming rights for its YouTube TV offering.Executives have said some costs will moderate this year.Alphabet’s non-operating income jumped in the first quarter compared with a year ago because of new accounting rules that require it to record estimates of the value of its investments in startups such as Uber and Airbnb Inc.

But “Android O”—which should get a dessert-based moniker when it ships later this summer—does have a set of features that Google (GOOG, GOOGL) pitched over the first day of its I/O developer conference here.As in earlier updates, Android O brings a grab-bag of features. Some address lingering pain points in this mobile operating system, while others borrow from features Apple (AAPL) added to iOS. Another represents an overdue remedy for a problem that’s afflicted Android since its debut almost nine years ago: the zombie-like persistence of obsolete versions. And of course, there’s better emoji support.Project Treble: easing updates, we can only hopeThe most important part of O—a rebuilding of Android’s foundation to remove an obstacle to timely software updates—barely got a mention in the almost-two-hour keynote from Google CEO Sundar Pichai and other Googlers that opened I/O at the Shoreline Amphitheatre Wednesday.But there’s no missing the reason for its existence in the embarrassing pie chart on Google’s Android-development site showing the versions of Android in use. As of May 2, the current Nougat release that debuted last August runs on 7.1% of all devices that had connected to the Play Store in the prior seven days. The most widely used Android release was the two-year-old Marshmallow, on 31.2% of devices. At Apple, meanwhile, 79% of iOS devices that visited the App Store on Feb. 20 ran the current iOS 10 release.Project Treble, announced in a blog post last week, aims to free chipset vendors from having to tweak the code that keeps their circuitry talking to the rest of Android. Treble will add a layer of translation code between that proprietary software and the rest of Android—the equivalent of putting a standard-size joint atop some intricate plumbing in the basement. A hardware vendor can write Treble-compliant, circuit-specific code once for a device and know that future versions of Android will understand it without further rewrites.That won’t end all Android-update holdups. As this post from Ron Amadeo at Ars Technica explains, Treble won’t stop phone vendors from shipping weird Android interfaces (hello, Samsung!) that demand their own revisions. But it’s an important step in an operating system that now runs on more than 2 billion active devices.Security and privacyThe afterlife of abandoned versions of Android remains the biggest problem in Android security, but many users worry instead that they’ll pick up malware in the Play Store. In reality, that’s a vanishingly small risk compared to the odds of getting hacked after downloading an app from elsewhere, thanks to a variety of malware scans that happen in the background.Android O will add more layers of security hardening but will also make these app-safety checks visible in a Google Play Protect feature showing their status. It’s literally security theatre. As Stephanie Saad Cuthbertson, product-management director for Android, said in the keynote, “Most Android users don’t know these services come built into Android devices with Play.” But if it gets people to trust the Play Store over less-secure sources, it’ll be a worthwhile production.This update will guard against a different device threat—a runaway app killing your battery life—by imposing limits on how often apps running in the background can ask for a device’s location or make other requests of the system. If that sounds like an overdue move… it probably is.In the area of privacy, Android O will randomly assign different device IDs to apps—a small but significant change that will make it harder for a developer of multiple apps to correlate your use among them. Notifications, picture-in-picture and other interface tweaksStory continuesAndroid O will require apps to group their notifications—the little nags that pop down from the top of the screen—into “channels” that you can turn on or off. It’s meant to stop apps from being too needy; in practice, having yet another option to set may not yield much difference. You’ll also be able to snooze notifications, which may help avoid losing sight of yet another message from a friend coming in on yet another messaging app. These changes should certainly help Android’s notifications experience stay ahead of the same in iOS, where you can’t even clear all notifications unless you use a device with Apple’s Touch ID pressure-sensitive control.App icons will be able to show a different sort of notice: colored “notification dots” at the top right corner of each that indicate something’s changed. That seems a pretty clear case of Google following Apple’s lead, not that there’s anything wrong with that.A picture-in-picture option will pick up on the examples of some Android vendors by letting you watch a video clip or chat in one corner while taking notes or checking your calendar.The interface change I’m most likely to appreciate: “Smart Text Selection,” in which Android will automatically select all of a street address, phone number or other significant block of text once you start trying to pick it up. This won’t work out of the box (as I saw in a demo phone), because Android will use “on-device intelligence” to build a phone-specific model of the kinds of data you often copy and paste. By not syncing this personal data to the cloud—as Cuthbertson boasted, “without any data leaving the device”—Google borrows yet again from its neighbors at Apple. The interface tweak everybody may notice first? A new “EmojiCompat” feature that should end the stigma of an iOS user sending a new emoji that doesn’t appear correctly on Android. Goodbye, blank boxes; hello, taco and unicorn emoji.More from Rob:How a wider laptop ban could threaten your safety and dataHow Gogo will transform your Wi-Fi experience in the skyThese are the tech industry’s 2 biggest concerns about TrumpWhy Hulu with Live TV and other streaming TV services are worth the moneyHow to get 4 billion unconnected people onlineTrump’s FCC chair issues attack on open internet rules  Email  Rob  at rob@robpegoraro.com; follow him on Twitter at  @robpegoraro . ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextFoxconn says it remains committed to Wisconsin investment projectReutersAt $1 Trillion, Apple is Bigger Than These ThingsInvestopediaWhat to Expect When Alphabet Reports Later This MonthMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolThe Boeing 737 MAX Is 1 Step Closer to Flying Again -- but Don't Expect to See It SoonMotley Fool8 Happy Easter Images to Post on Facebook, Twitter and InstagramInvestorPlaceTesla's board is about to get a lot smallerTechCrunchBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

Morgan Knutson, who worked at Google for eight months before resigning in May 2012, described a lack of vision for the service and wasted resources while detailing ways Vic Gundotra, the overall leader of Google+, wielded his massive power within the company.Knutson's narrative, written like a Twitter serial, sheds light on the troubled Google+, one of the company's most noteworthy and expensive failures.If you're interested in technology, then one of the most fascinating longer reads available about Silicon Valley culture is the Twitter serial posted last week by Morgan Knutson, a former Google+ web designer.Knutson wrote 149 tweets over a period of five days about his brief tenure at Google+, the long-troubled, now-defunct social network.Knutson began writing a day after The Wall Street Journal revealed that Google had not disclosed for seven months that a security lapse had enabled third-party developers to see private information belonging to as many as 500,000 Google+ users.A few hours after the story was published, Google announced it had shuttered Google+, which was created to challenge Facebook but never came close.Video: Google Shuts Down Google+ For ConsumersFor more news videos visit Yahoo View.   Apparently, the situation prompted Knutson to reveal information he had bottled up for six years.Now that Google+ has been shuttered, I should air my dirty laundry on how awful the project and exec team was.I'm still pissed about the bait and switch they pulled by telling me I'd be working on Chrome, then putting me on this god forsaken piece of shit on day one. Part of what makes Knutson's tweets so fascinating is the idea that a former Googler has anything bad to say about the company. Google has a reputation for being one of the most employee-friendly places in tech, chock full of perks and benefits. It's rare that a former staffer complains publicly.The other reason Knutson's story is so compelling is due to the titillating details about the dysfunction he said reigned at the Google+ of 2012.Knutson, who resigned for a job at Dropbox in 2012 after only eight months at Google, describes a service that lacked an overall vision, often wasted resources, and was propelled and shielded internally by Vic Gundotra, the powerful former Google executive who led the Google+ effort.He also said, contrary to his prior beliefs or the image that Google sells, that not all employees were at the top of their field.Thought this was the pros. Never would’ve imagined that I was joining a team of 50+ designers where a bunch of them had never designed before. And I was “evaluated” at *about* their level? These weren’t interns, these were designers in their very first roles ever...at Google. It's important to remember, as Knutson acknowledges, that he was one employee working on one project during a brief period.To say Knutson sounds disgruntled is an understatement. To his credit, he acknowledges that he chaffed at receiving criticism and disliked it when he believed he didn't get enough credit.He also had good things to say about some of his managers and about most of the people he came in contact with at Google.The common thread between 99.8% of the people that I interacted with at Google is that they were ethical, highly intelligent, and hard working. I had a lot of admiration and respect for many of them and wish more of them had stayed in touch. With all of Google's success and money as well as its sheer size (more than 80,000 employees now), it's easy to think of the company as something otherworldly.What Knutson does — with his descriptions of bruised egos, turf wars, and politically minded bosses — is remind us that Google isn't all that different from anywhere else humans are employed.Correction: This story incorrectly stated the number of tweets that Knutson posted to tell his story. The correct number is 149.NOW WATCH: What marijuana looks like under the microscopeSee Also:Your opinion matters.

Critics have dubbed this as an effective "link tax," but proponents say hyperlinks will be exempt.Meanwhile, Article 13 calls for "effective content recognition" technology to filter out copyright-protected content. Detractors hold that this part of the law could threaten social media users' ability to share anything from internet memes to snippets of music and film.Reacting to the result of the vote, Julia Reda, a German Pirate Party lawmaker, said it was "catastrophic" that the parliament voted in favor of the most controversial pieces of the legislation."Final vote for Parliament position on the copyright directive with #UploadFilters and #LinkTax adopted," she wrote in a tweet. "Parliament has failed to listen to citizens' and experts' concerns."TweetOpponents of the directive have been using the hashtag #SaveYourInternet on social media."The legislation is now better balanced, answering many of the concerns of journalists, publishers and musicians whose work was being shared freely online without stifling innovation or fundamentally changing the nature of the internet," Sajjad Karim, a British Conservative lawmaker, said in a statement following the vote."It also takes into account the rights of users, ensuring that materials used for teaching and research, and by cultural and heritage organizations, are not encumbered by unnecessary restrictions."What's next?Wednesday's vote won't be the last you've heard about the EU's copyright reforms.Lawmakers had initially voted to delay the vote, rejecting the version of the directive that had been agreed by a committee at that time.Now that politicians in Strasbourg have come to an agreement, the next stage for the law will be what's known as "trilogue," which consists of talks between European Parliament, EU executive body the European Commission, and a collective of the leaders of EU member states known as the European Council.And even once the directive goes through this process, it will still require each individual EU nation to decide on how they will implement the new rules.The EU copyright battle pits media companies and musicians against tech giants over the widespread availability of their content online. Supporters of the law argue that people and companies in the creative industries are being starved of revenues lost to the sharing of their intellectual property on digital platforms.It could particularly impact platforms like Facebook FB and Google's GOOGL YouTube, which rely on user-generated content. Google has been accused of lobbying aggressively to prevent the directive from being passed into law.The issue has drawn attention from notable figures in both the tech and media worlds, including internet pioneer Tim Berners-Lee, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, former Beatles star Paul McCartney and French DJ David Guetta .More From CNBC AT&T CEO calls Netflix the 'Walmart' of video streamingSnap shares tumble after BTIG's Greenfield cuts target to $5Apple will probably lower iPhone prices on Wednesday — here's whyReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextGold Faces A New Trade Conflict, Banks Accumulate The MetalFX EmpirePound Looks Placid in Brexit Break Before Parliament Meets AgainBloombergWhy Livestreaming TV Can't Break ThroughMotley FoolPanel to review approval of Boeing 737 Max flight controlsAssociated PressIntroducing Électricite de Strasbourg Société Anonyme (EPA:ELEC), The Stock That Dropped 18% In The Last YearSimply Wall St.Zookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatchWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosNetflix might have more Beyoncé specials planned after 'Homecoming'EngadgetAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance'American Ninja Warrior Junior': Get an exclusive sneak peek at the semi-finals!AOL.comWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley Fool

The new policies are designed to "provide more transparency" in the investigation process, Pichai wrote."We will make arbitration optional for individual sexual harassment and sexual assault claims," Pichai's memo reads. "Google has never required confidentiality in the arbitration process and arbitration still may be the best path for a number of reasons (e.g. personal privacy) but, we recognize that choice should be up to you."Read more:  One of Google's new sexual harassment policies could be the key to changing all of Silicon Valley's bro cultureAlmost 20,000 Google employees participated in a staged walkout earlier this month after details of the company's past sexual misconduct issues came to light. The New York Times reported in an explosive story that Google had provided a top executive accused of sexual misconduct with a $90 million exit package when he left the company, and then Pichai revealed in a memo that 48 employees had been fired in the past two years for sexual harassment.Just hours before Pichai's memo was published Thursday, the Google CEO was quoted in a sit-down interview with the Times acknowledging that the company "clearly got some things wrong."Read Thursday's memo in full below:  Hi everyone, At Google we try hard to build a workplace that supports our employees and empowers them to do their best work. As CEO, I take this responsibility very seriously and I’m committed to making the changes we need to improve. Over the past few weeks Google’s leaders and I have heard your feedback and have been moved by the stories you’ve shared. We recognize that we have not always gotten everything right in the past and we are sincerely sorry for that. It’s clear we need to make some changes. Going forward, we will provide more transparency on how we handle concerns. We’ll give better support and care to the people who raise them. And we will double down on our commitment to be a representative, equitable, and respectful workplace. Today, we’re announcing a comprehensive action plan to make progress. It’s detailed here and I encourage everyone to read it. Here are some of the key changes: We will make arbitration optional for individual sexual harassment and sexual assault claims. Google has never required confidentiality in the arbitration process and arbitration still may be the best path for a number of reasons (e.g. personal privacy) but, we recognize that choice should be up to you. We will provide more granularity around sexual harassment investigations and outcomes at the company as part of our Investigations Report. We’re revamping the way we handle and look into your concerns in three ways: We’re overhauling our reporting channels by bringing them together on one dedicated site and including live support. We will enhance the processes we use to handle concerns—including the ability for Googlers to be accompanied by a support person. And we will offer extra care and resources for Googlers during and after the process. This includes extended counseling and career support. We will update and expand our mandatory sexual harassment training. From now on if you don’t complete your training, you’ll receive a one-rating dock in Perf (editor's note: Perf is our performance review system). We will recommit to our company-wide OKR around diversity, equity and inclusion again in 2019, focused on improving representation—through hiring, progression and retention—and creating a more inclusive culture for everyone. Our Chief Diversity Officer will continue to provide monthly progress updates to me and my leadership team. I hope you’ll take the time to read the full range of actions we’re announcing today. Thank you all for the feedback you’ve shared with us. This is an area where we need to continually make progress and are committed to doing so. We often hear from Googlers that the best part of working here is other Googlers. Even in difficult times, we are encouraged by the commitment of our colleagues to create a better workplace. That’s come through very strongly over the past few weeks. -Sundar NOW WATCH: How to train the last days before a marathonSee Also:People are going wild for a handy new shortcut that will change the way you use Google DocsGoogle revamped its homepage for Election Day to show you where to voteGoogle is working on a fix for an issue causing apps on the Pixel 3 to randomly closeSEE ALSO: Amazon employees are reportedly gearing up to confront CEO Jeff Bezos at an all-staff meeting this week about selling facial recognition software to law enforcementReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWhat to Expect When Alphabet Reports Later This MonthMotley FoolInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Morning After: The Weather Channel got hackedEngadgetAt Coachella, One Group Is Taking On Sexual Assault and Harassment Prevention.

Ian Lopez back with the latest developments at the intersection of law and technology. This week, we take a look at a UCLA professor’s attempt to clarify some of the haze around crypto regulation.

Sign up here. Balancing Protections & Entrepreneurship in the Crypto Securities DebateReaders of this briefing are no strangers to the spate of recent activity in the cypto market. UCLA Law’s James Park tried synthesizing industry events in a recent academic paper to highlight just when an offering might fall within the purview of securities law.In a recent chat over all-things-crypto, he told me much of the regulatory woes spurred by the nascent marketplace arise from “the SEC responding to something that developed quickly and normalized,” while trying “not to be seen as stomping entrepreneurship.” That also raises the question of whether securities laws “quash innovation potential.”Here are a few notable snippets from my 1-1 with Park, edited for length and clarity:Q: Your paper digs into the SEC deeming Ether a security, then changing its status. What’s the ramifications of such a status change on other initial coin offerings?It at least raises the possibility that you could get to the point that you could start out as a security and evolve into something else. To some extent, I think that having a clear path towards that outcome could be sort of a plus for your ICO. If you could proceed in a way if you’re initially a security and you’re selling through private placement, methods where you don’t need registration, you could hopefully build it up to a point where you could distribute tokens more widely.Even with Ether, though, there’s still some questions with centralization. Etherium is actively working to make Ether better. And then the question becomes, well isn’t that centralized management in a sense and thus potentially a security?What thornier issues can arise from bouncing in and out of security status?One is maybe you fall out and back in to status. You could imagine a point where you are decentralized but people aren’t active on your community, so it might get to the point where you decide to become more centralized. The other is to what extent do you have to be functional. I think it has to be, you achieve some sort of use by individuals of your platforms not by the promise of speculative returns but because you’ve got a good idea. I think that’s what will distinguish projects that can evolve out of security status and those that fail.What do you make of the SEC’s pace of enforcement action?The Nov. 16 enforcement actions—if they had not brought those I’d say they weren’t moving fast enough. I think the fact they were working on this, it sort of signals they are treating the ICO registration requirements seriously. But I have two worries about the amount of time. Number one, if you don’t have a presence in enforcing the law, people don’t know what the law is and go forward with ICOs. Secondly, you’re getting more retail investors who are now potentially trading real dollars in these bitcoins when early on it was people who had invested in bitcoin when it was a dollar and are now reinvesting the proceeds. You’re getting someone who’s buying for $4,000 and reinvesting—I think those are the people we’re most worried about.You note that if a handful of working, viable projects ensue, the SEC should relax its regulation. How would they?I think they could expand the amount you could raise without registration through crowdfunding. Now, you could raise about $1 million. Maybe you could modestly raise some of those thresholds so you could more easily get substantial amounts without registering as a security. And so getting more options in reaching the general public, that might balance the need for investor protections with the needs of entrepreneurship. But the burden is really on the tech industry to show these are some projects that are good and work and are worthwhile.➤ Takeaway: Recent regulatory activity suggests a paced approach by the SEC in tackling crypto registration to both protect consumers and at least avoid looking like it’s hindering entrepreneurship.Story continues On the Radar: Three Things to Know➤ Tweet On. Social media, it’s the breeding ground of bad ideas. But apparently not in the opinion of Elon Musk. The embattled mastermind behind Tesla, whose tweets sparked an SEC probe, told “60 Minutes” viewers Sunday that the company’s ensuing settlement with the agency—which WSJ said calls for the company to get a grip on Musk’s handle—has done zilch to curb his social media use. But Musk didn’t stop there. Never one to mince words, he noted: “I want to be clear. I do not respect the SEC.”➤ SCOTUS Rule Curbs Crowd Funds. At least in the case of amicus briefs. As Law.com’s Tony Mauro reports, a “nascent trend” of deploying GoFundMe to collect costs for producing amicus briefs to bring before the Supreme Court may be coming to a halt. A U.S. Alcohol Policy Alliance lawyer withdrew her brief, funded in part by anonymous donors, after hearing form the court clerk’s office that amicus groups need to identify any contributor forking funds for such an effort. The reason? Rule 37.6, a 1997 rule that prevents a case’s parties from purchasing what Mauro writes amount to “a second or supplemental merits brief, disguised as an amicus brief, to get around word limits.” Interestingly, the brief in question isn’t the only on the case fueled by GoFundMe—an organization on the other side of the case has used the site to raise over $26,000.➤ Killing Cambridge Analytica litigation is what Facebook’s attorneys are trying to do in an ensuing MDL they deem “little more than a broadside against Facebook’s business model.” In a November motion to dismiss, Gibson Dunn’s Orin Snyder, repping the social media company, wrote that plaintiffs have been going on a limb to find a “viable cause of action against Facebook,” putting forth a 255 page complaint that includes “a kitchen sink-like lobbing of 50 claims—all in the hopes that something, anything, sticks.” A hearing for the dismissal motion is set for Jan. 23, and plaintiffs attorneys are charging ahead, writing in their opposition that Cambridge Analytica “represents only the tip of the iceberg with respect to Facebook’s willful pursuit of generating revenue at the expense of its users.”  Google CEO Sundar Pichai Congress Calls Google on Its Privacy ProblemSundar Pichai got an earful in a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee Tuesday that touched upon Google’s increasingly controversial practices around data collection, political bias, and the alleged launch of a censored search engine in China.Seem like a highlight of the company’s controversies from the past year? It essentially was, and Congress went a step further, probing Pichai over the company’s attempt to educate users on their privacy policy, which Rep. Martha Roby described as “20 pages long” and changing “multiple times a year.” And likely for a good reason, as Rep Bob Goodlatte put it: “Google is able to collect an amount of information about its users that would even make the NSA blush.”It’s interesting to consider how little consumers understand the data being collected on them. The NY Times recently found that “at least 75 companies receive anonymous, precise location data from apps whose users enable location services to get local news and weather or other information.” What’s more, Google is facing suits for surreptitious data collection practice.Whether Congress is taking a cue and brushing up on data collection 101, however, is a different question (Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King, FWIW, got on Pichai about problems with an iPhone). But, according to Caroline Spiezio, Law.com’s in-house reporter covering Congressional (and EU) hearings over tech companies behind-the scenes practices, the fact that hearings over data collection and use “keep happening” shows “it’s important, even if Congress doesn’t realize why it’s important.”Yet Congress seems to peg Pichai as evasive. When Rep.

Ian Lopez back with the latest developments at the intersection of law and technology. This week, we take a look at a UCLA professor’s attempt to clarify some of the haze around crypto regulation. Also up: crowdfunding SCOTUS briefs, Facebook’s move to knock out Cambridge Analytica lawsuits, and Google’s privacy grilling before congress.Anything you want to see before the holidays?

Sign up here. Balancing Protections & Entrepreneurship in the Crypto Securities DebateReaders of this briefing are no strangers to the spate of recent activity in the cypto market. UCLA Law’s James Park tried synthesizing industry events in a recent academic paper to highlight just when an offering might fall within the purview of securities law.In a recent chat over all-things-crypto, he told me much of the regulatory woes spurred by the nascent marketplace arise from “the SEC responding to something that developed quickly and normalized,” while trying “not to be seen as stomping entrepreneurship.” That also raises the question of whether securities laws “quash innovation potential.”Here are a few notable snippets from my 1-1 with Park, edited for length and clarity:Q: Your paper digs into the SEC deeming Ether a security, then changing its status. What’s the ramifications of such a status change on other initial coin offerings?It at least raises the possibility that you could get to the point that you could start out as a security and evolve into something else. To some extent, I think that having a clear path towards that outcome could be sort of a plus for your ICO. If you could proceed in a way if you’re initially a security and you’re selling through private placement, methods where you don’t need registration, you could hopefully build it up to a point where you could distribute tokens more widely.Even with Ether, though, there’s still some questions with centralization. Etherium is actively working to make Ether better. And then the question becomes, well isn’t that centralized management in a sense and thus potentially a security?What thornier issues can arise from bouncing in and out of security status?One is maybe you fall out and back in to status. You could imagine a point where you are decentralized but people aren’t active on your community, so it might get to the point where you decide to become more centralized. The other is to what extent do you have to be functional. I think it has to be, you achieve some sort of use by individuals of your platforms not by the promise of speculative returns but because you’ve got a good idea. I think that’s what will distinguish projects that can evolve out of security status and those that fail.What do you make of the SEC’s pace of enforcement action?The Nov. 16 enforcement actions—if they had not brought those I’d say they weren’t moving fast enough. I think the fact they were working on this, it sort of signals they are treating the ICO registration requirements seriously. But I have two worries about the amount of time. Number one, if you don’t have a presence in enforcing the law, people don’t know what the law is and go forward with ICOs. Secondly, you’re getting more retail investors who are now potentially trading real dollars in these bitcoins when early on it was people who had invested in bitcoin when it was a dollar and are now reinvesting the proceeds. You’re getting someone who’s buying for $4,000 and reinvesting—I think those are the people we’re most worried about.You note that if a handful of working, viable projects ensue, the SEC should relax its regulation. How would they?I think they could expand the amount you could raise without registration through crowdfunding. Now, you could raise about $1 million. Maybe you could modestly raise some of those thresholds so you could more easily get substantial amounts without registering as a security. And so getting more options in reaching the general public, that might balance the need for investor protections with the needs of entrepreneurship. But the burden is really on the tech industry to show these are some projects that are good and work and are worthwhile.➤ Takeaway: Recent regulatory activity suggests a paced approach by the SEC in tackling crypto registration to both protect consumers and at least avoid looking like it’s hindering entrepreneurship.Story continues On the Radar: Three Things to Know➤ Tweet On. Social media, it’s the breeding ground of bad ideas. But apparently not in the opinion of Elon Musk. The embattled mastermind behind Tesla, whose tweets sparked an SEC probe, told “60 Minutes” viewers Sunday that the company’s ensuing settlement with the agency—which WSJ said calls for the company to get a grip on Musk’s handle—has done zilch to curb his social media use. But Musk didn’t stop there. Never one to mince words, he noted: “I want to be clear. I do not respect the SEC.”➤ SCOTUS Rule Curbs Crowd Funds. At least in the case of amicus briefs. As Law.com’s Tony Mauro reports, a “nascent trend” of deploying GoFundMe to collect costs for producing amicus briefs to bring before the Supreme Court may be coming to a halt. A U.S. Alcohol Policy Alliance lawyer withdrew her brief, funded in part by anonymous donors, after hearing form the court clerk’s office that amicus groups need to identify any contributor forking funds for such an effort. The reason? Rule 37.6, a 1997 rule that prevents a case’s parties from purchasing what Mauro writes amount to “a second or supplemental merits brief, disguised as an amicus brief, to get around word limits.” Interestingly, the brief in question isn’t the only on the case fueled by GoFundMe—an organization on the other side of the case has used the site to raise over $26,000.➤ Killing Cambridge Analytica litigation is what Facebook’s attorneys are trying to do in an ensuing MDL they deem “little more than a broadside against Facebook’s business model.” In a November motion to dismiss, Gibson Dunn’s Orin Snyder, repping the social media company, wrote that plaintiffs have been going on a limb to find a “viable cause of action against Facebook,” putting forth a 255 page complaint that includes “a kitchen sink-like lobbing of 50 claims—all in the hopes that something, anything, sticks.” A hearing for the dismissal motion is set for Jan. 23, and plaintiffs attorneys are charging ahead, writing in their opposition that Cambridge Analytica “represents only the tip of the iceberg with respect to Facebook’s willful pursuit of generating revenue at the expense of its users.”  Google CEO Sundar Pichai Congress Calls Google on Its Privacy ProblemSundar Pichai got an earful in a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee Tuesday that touched upon Google’s increasingly controversial practices around data collection, political bias, and the alleged launch of a censored search engine in China.Seem like a highlight of the company’s controversies from the past year? It essentially was, and Congress went a step further, probing Pichai over the company’s attempt to educate users on their privacy policy, which Rep. Martha Roby described as “20 pages long” and changing “multiple times a year.” And likely for a good reason, as Rep Bob Goodlatte put it: “Google is able to collect an amount of information about its users that would even make the NSA blush.”It’s interesting to consider how little consumers understand the data being collected on them. The NY Times recently found that “at least 75 companies receive anonymous, precise location data from apps whose users enable location services to get local news and weather or other information.” What’s more, Google is facing suits for surreptitious data collection practice.Whether Congress is taking a cue and brushing up on data collection 101, however, is a different question (Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King, FWIW, got on Pichai about problems with an iPhone). But, according to Caroline Spiezio, Law.com’s in-house reporter covering Congressional (and EU) hearings over tech companies behind-the scenes practices, the fact that hearings over data collection and use “keep happening” shows “it’s important, even if Congress doesn’t realize why it’s important.”Yet Congress seems to peg Pichai as evasive. When Rep. Ted Poe asked if Google tracked his whereabouts via his phone when he crossed the room, the Google CEO wouldn’t give a yay or nay, the Times reported.“You make $100 million a year,” Poe said. “You should be able to answer that question… I’m shocked you don’t know. I think Google obviously does.”➤ Looking Ahead: It’s tough to say what sort of impact hearings will have on practices by companies like Google, though they do show that people are waking up to how their data is being used, or at least making clear they aren’t happy about it.Thanks for reading!

The deal is now complete, setting the stage for a new era in the search engine company's history, and for the technology industry in general.What Google didLast year, Google announced that it would be acquiring HTC's design team for $1.1 billion, and the deal is now complete. It nets Google about 2,000 new employees, including engineers and support staff, who will remain in Taiwan. The team is involved in device research and development and gained fame for producing Google's Pixel line of smartphones.HTC said it will maintain an in-house R&D team and will keep making its own line of smartphones. But the company has been on a downward trend in recent years, with increased competition chopping down its already small global market share into insignificance. The HTC transfer to Google reduces its workforce by about 20%.Google's hardware lineup, including two phones, a 2-in-1 laptop, smart home devices, earbuds, and a camera.MoreGoogle's lineup of hardware. Image source: Google.Why this move mattersGoogle's slice of the smartphone industry appears to be on the rise. Phones using the Android operating system are knocking on the door of 90% total global market share. The company doesn't provide specific numbers for its branded devices and its new Pixel lineup, but management did say it was a contributing factor to growth during its fourth quarter 2017 update.The segment that contains hardware sales, labeled "other revenues," grew 38% to cap 2017. The division also contains Google's cloud computing business and Google Play online store. Though its growth rate is outpacing the rest of the company's, it still represents only 15% of total revenue. That makes its foray into hardware a big potential payoff for investors. So far, so good, as management said "made by Google" device sales doubled during the last holiday shopping season.But why move the Pixel phone team in-house? It seems it's all about greater control. Devices licensed out bearing the Google badge are on the rise, and the company's strategy has been -- and still is -- to push much of that work to hardware developers. The idea behind the Pixel lineup, though, is to offer a higher-end product where the hardware and Google's software are more closely aligned. Think better integration with Google Assistant, Play store, and YouTube.That strategy of keeping the hardware and software package neat and operating together seamlessly has worked wonders for Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) over the years. Google's path seems to be putting it on a direct collision course with its other highfalutin rival, and Google intends to win. The new Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL start at $649 and $849, respectively. In contrast, the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X are $699, $799, and $999, respectively. Perhaps in light of the price undercut by rivals, Apple recently issued some cautious sales guidance during its fourth-quarter report.This battle extends beyond just smartphones, too.

A full-on technology platform war is upon us.Story continuesIn short, it looks as if Google and parent Alphabet weren't content with licensing out Google's up-and-coming hardware business anymore.

The company reported record revenue of $112 million, up 54% year over year, and adjusted earnings per share of $0.60, which climbed 15%. That was driven by triple-digit year-over-year growth in a number of the company's channels, including audio, mobile video, and mobile in-app, which all grew more than 100%. Connected TV growth soared, more than doubling sequentially -- on top of the more than 2,000% year-over-year growth it produced just last quarter.Investors got all the financial data they were looking for. But in the conference call to discuss the results with analysts, there was a wealth of additional information about the company's explosive growth and the expanding opportunity. The Trade Desk identified three significant developments that it sees as catalysts for future growth. Read on to see why management is excited about the changing television landscape, the launching of GDPR in the European Union, and consumer privacy changes at Google, a subsidiary of Alphabet.Two hands touching a digital rendering of a globe surrounded by icons representing various consumer advertising mediaMoreImage source: Getty Images.Big media marriagesOne of the biggest opportunities ahead for the company is the result of massive mergers that are happening in the television space. The Trade Desk founder and CEO Jeff Green specifically addressed Disney's acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox, and AT&T's recent coupling with Time Warner, as indicators of the opportunities ahead."The worldwide advertising market is currently at $700 billion and moving toward $1 trillion over the next 10 years," Green said. "The biggest part of that market is television, which ... is nearly $230 billion this year." He pointed to the "generational shift with the global convergence of the Internet and television."He also sees the combination of digitally delivered content from services like Hulu, skinny cable bundles like Sling TV, and direct relationships with providers like Discovery as opening up a wealth of additional opportunities for programmatic advertising.The GDPR phenomenonThe recent and far-reaching new data-privacy regulations that went into effect in the European Union -- known as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) -- address the privacy rights and data protections afforded to EU citizens. But the GDPR had an unforeseen consequence for advertisers. When the new rules went into effect in late May, many publishers found they were not in compliance.This provided a big opportunity for The Trade Desk. "Our engineering and partnerships team put in a huge effort working with publishers and their SSPs [supply-side platforms] who, in some cases, were not ready to ensure the technology was in place to secure the required consents." This helped deliver "record spend in all four of our European offices: the U.K., Spain, Germany, and France." Green said this was a result of the trust the company has fostered with its client base.Big changes at GoogleIn addition to the significant runway the company already had, recent changes at Google increased the prospects for The Trade Desk. Green detailed how "Google announced in April that they would stop sharing DoubleClick IDs with clients ... this makes comparative reporting go away, so this is a very big deal."Story continuesGreen said that this was likely related to the Cambridge Analytica scandal, and that Google is now reducing the risk that personally identifiable consumer data will be maliciously used. Since The Trade Desk doesn't collect any of this data, there's no chance it could be breached, giving the company a strategic advantage against Google in the programmatic advertising space. The Trade Desk "enables advertisers to compare every destination on their media plan to every other destination objectively."Group of people, shown only from the neck down, using mobile phonesMoreImage source: Getty Images.The big pictureThe common thread running through each of these discussions is the large and growing opportunity in the programmatic advertising realm. Green said, "Let me remind you that programmatic is growing at 21%, while our growth was nearly two and a half times that."He also said that programmatic was at "just over 2% of the entire advertising market ... Programmatic is the fastest-growing segment of advertising, and The Trade Desk is growing faster than anyone in programmatic."That sounds like the investment thesis in a nutshell.

Marcio Jose Sanchez/APMoreApple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) have made billions of dollars by charging developers to sell their apps on the tech giant’s respective app stores. But now some of those app developers and their parent companies are starting to push back against the so-called app-store tax, which is often up to 30% of the amount consumers pay.Epic Games, developer of the overwhelmingly successful “Fortnite”, has cut Google’s Play Store out of the app equation entirely by having Android users download the game to their phones from its own website. More recently, Netflix (NFLX) began testing a way to get around paying Apple a cut of its customer subscription fees by having users sign up for the service outside of the App Store in 33 countries, not including the U.S.The move follows a similar decision by Netflix to move its subscription sign-up process off of Google’s Play Store. Even Spotify (SPOT) has moved the subscription process away from Apple’s Store. However, these measures could backfire on app developers for one reason — Consumers are lazy.“Whenever you add a step, conversion declines,” explained Gene Munster of Loup Ventures, referring to a customer who’s being “converted” to a regular subscriber. “It could be one, or two, or three steps to leave the platform, get redirected and sign up. And that’s the experiment that these companies are doing. You are going to lose some conversion.”Why leave app storesAccording to a study by SensorTower, Apple earned $38.5 billion in revenue through the App Store in 2017, while Google pulled in $20.1 billion. Those would be enormous sums for standalone companies. But for Apple, this is just a portion of its total services revenue, which made up $9.5 billion of the company’s $53.3 billion in total revenue in Q3 2018.For every app purchase made through Apple’s App Store or Google’s Play Store, the companies take a 30% cut, leaving developers with 70% of the revenue from their own apps. For subscription services like Netflix, Apple and Google start off by taking 30% of the purchase for the first year, but cut that back to 15% after 12 months.For a company like Epic Games, which offers “Fortnite” for free but earns money on in-app purchases, each 30% taken by Apple or Google hits its bottom line. Apple makes it difficult for developers to offer their apps outside of the App Store, so Epic had to stay with Apple when it launched “Fortnite” for iOS. But Google’s Android lets users download and install apps from outside of the Play Store, which is why Epic can skirt that company’s storefront.Importantly, for companies like Netflix and, especially, Spotify, Apple and Google have become both distributors and direct competitors for their products. With Apple and Google poised to release even more of their own original content, the tech giants are homing in on Netflix’s business. Spotify has already had to deal with Google’s Play Music on Android phones, and now with Apple Music pre-installed on every iPhone sold the Swedish streaming service has even more competition in its space.So not only do such companies have to pay Apple and Google to host their apps, they also have to compete with them.The problem with leavingTo be clear, Netflix and Spotify aren’t taking their apps off of Apple’s or Google’s app stores. Instead, they are making customers who want to sign up for subscriptions, called conversions, move over to the services’ own websites. But consumers are fickle, and they’re less likely to sign up for a service if you throw more roadblocks in their path.According to Munster, consumers would rather simply sign up for and pay for their subscriptions through Apple and Google’s app stores, because it’s a faster, more seamless process.“My guess is that, they’d be giving up more than they’d be gaining, because of the increased hassle,” Munster said.“Some players, like Netflix, … may be a different animal, where they are so good people are willing to say, ‘That’s fine, I’m okay with jumping over this very low hurdle,’ but most people are lazy,” Munster explained.Apple and Google will be fine either wayWhile Netflix and Spotify could muscle consumers into signing up for their services because they are already so ubiquitous, other app developers and service providers are likely to have a much more difficult time.Story continues“I think the bottom line is that for most companies, it’s not worth giving up the incremental user to give up 15% [of app revenue],” Munster said. “It’s kind of like someone selling on Amazon. Amazon’s average take-rate is 12%, and as a seller you put up with it because you generate a lot of users from it.”Netflix says its move to test moving user subscriptions off the Apple App Store is one of many it does to improve the user experience for consumers, meaning it may never be fully implemented as a permanent solution.That’s not true for the Google Play Store, for which Netflix stopped supporting subscription sign ups back in May. If you already signed up, you’ll still be billed through Google. But if you’re a new user or try to re-subscribe, you’ll be directed offsite. Similarly, Spotify doesn’t allow for new subscribers to sign up through the Apple App Store.Despite that, the moves are unlikely to impact either tech company in such a way that they would eliminate such fees or reduce them by a significant amount. Both Apple and Google previously cut their fees for subscription services from the standard 30% to the current 15% after one year in 2016 and 2017, respectively. But that 30% still stands for one-time purchases.Munster says the chances of Apple and Google being impacted by a handful of app developers moving away from the App Store is low. In fact, he believes that over time, they will move back to the App Stores.“If I’m wrong and there ends up being a sea change where people just get comfortable to redirect to mobile [websites] to sign up … this is going to be a real stinger for Apple’s services growth. If I was going to put a probability on it, I would say a 5% chance, it’s a low probability,” Munster said.More from Dan:Facebook’s latest scandal will leave it unscathedNew technology could upend the video-game marketT-Mobile promises to make customer service less painful with Team of ExpertsGoogle is giving you more storage for your money with Google OneEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@oath.com; follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley. Follow Yahoo Finance on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextFoxconn says it remains committed to Wisconsin investment projectReutersAt $1 Trillion, Apple is Bigger Than These ThingsInvestopediaNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchWhat to Expect When Alphabet Reports Later This MonthMotley FoolNetflix might have more Beyoncé specials planned after 'Homecoming'EngadgetZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHere's What Hedge Funds Think About NIO Inc.

On Monday, hundreds of companies, including others like Microsoft, eBay, and Uber, — alongside a group of mayors and colleges — joined together as part of the "We Are Still In" campaign to reiterate their commitment to the principles of the climate agreement. "In the absence of leadership from Washington, states, cities, colleges and universities and businesses representing a sizeable percentage of the U.S. economy will pursue ambitious climate goals, working together to take forceful action and to ensure that the U.S. remains a global leader in reducing emissions," the campaign said in its press release.The move comes days after President Donald Trump announced on June 1 that the United States is pulling out of the Paris climate agreement, which was signed by 195 nations in December 2015. The Paris agreement was intended to slow climate change by setting limits on carbon emissions and has been widely embraced by the business community. The tech industry in particular has supported the Paris Agreement, and many of the big tech companies are currently transitioning their giant, energy-guzzling data centers to using completely renewable energy.The "We Are Still In" campaign launched with an open letter to to the world, acknowledging that the businesses and communities that signed will continue to work towards climate change. "It is imperative that the world know that in the U.S., the actors that will provide the leadership necessary to meet our Paris commitment are found in city halls, state capitals, colleges and universities, investors and businesses," the campaign wrote. "Together, we will remain actively engaged with the international community as part of the global effort to hold warming to well below 2°C and to accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy that will benefit our security, prosperity, and health."Here's a full list of all the companies that signed: 2 Point Perspective: Architecture2050 Partners, Inc.22 Designs23andMe3rd Rock Data, Inc.475 High Performance Building Supply7th Generation LabsAdidasAdmix, Inc.AdobeAdrian Dominican Sisters, Portfolio Advisory BoardAdventiveAdventureCORPS, Inc.Aegis Renewable EnergyAggie Writing ServicesAlameda Natural GroceryAleva StoresAllianz SEAlnical LLCAlphaGlider LLCAlpine Enterprises Inc.Alter EcoAlter Eco FoodsAmalgamated BankAmavida Coffee and Trading CompanyAmazonAmbata Capital, LLCAmbataliaAmeresco, Inc.American Outdoor Products, Inc.American Reading CompanyAmicus Green Building Center, LLCAmper MusicAmy's KitchenAngstrom Science Inc.Annie's, Inc.AnthemWildAnthesis GroupAnthropocene InstituteAntonelli's Cheese LLCAphra CommunicationsAppalachian Ski Mtn.

apple, google, samsung: who steals the most ideas?

Try insulting someone’s phone.Apparently, a lot of people hang their identities on what phones they carry. An iPhone person might feel personally affronted when a Samsung Galaxy gets a great review, and vice versa.These days, since all smartphones have pretty much the same features, it seems to be searingly important to remember which brand had those features first. Android must be better, because it had a quick-settings panel before Apple did! The iPhone must be better, because it had Find My Phone first! And so on.It seems very important to identify which phone had a feature first.MoreNow then. According to the law, you can’t copyright an idea, only the expression of that idea. Apple found that out the hard way when, in 1988, it filed a lawsuit accusing Microsoft of copying the Mac’s interface (mouse, windows, menus)—and lost. From that day onward, blatantly ripping off other companies’ ideas became part of doing business. Google steals. Samsung steals. Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon steal. And yes, Apple steals.On one hand, why should we care? What’s wrong with bringing great ideas to as many people as possible?On the other hand, I can understand the phone cultists’ pain. Seems like a company should get credit for inventing an idea. Instead, it gets only a few months of exclusivity before its rivals catch up.(The late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs certainly cared about idea theft. “Our lawsuit is saying, ‘Google, you f**king ripped off the iPhone, wholesale ripped us off,'” Jobs told biographer Walter Isaacson. “I’m going to destroy Android, because it’s a stolen product. I’m willing to go to thermonuclear war on this. They are scared to death, because they know they are guilty.”)So I thought: After all these decades of consumers pointing the finger, maybe we should settle this once and for all. Which company is the biggest copycat?What if someone with too much time on his hands were to dive into the hundreds of features that make a phone a phone, and track down which company first introduced each one?Yeah, that’d mean months of tedious effort. But think of the payoff! For the first time ever, we’d know. We’d see which company should hang its head in ripoff shame.You can probably see where this is going. That’s how I spent my spring.The methodologyFirst, I made up a list of every major feature that’s standard on smartphones today. Pinch-to-zoom. Auto-rotating screen. Slow-mo video. Word suggestions above the keyboard. A quick settings panel. Voice assistant. Voice calling. Private browsing. And on and on.Second, I hunted down the first appearance of every feature by poring through old user manuals, Wikipedia, tech reviews, and how-to books. With help from my assistant Jan Carpenter, we eventually filled in a spreadsheet, which you can see here.I turned the data over to David Foster, infographics lead for Oath Studios, who designed the timelines you see below. Each one shows clearly not just which company wins each horse race, but how long it took its rivals to copy each feature. The timeline bars also provide a fascinating look at how smartphones have evolved since the iPhone’s debut in 2007.Now, a few notes on this project’s limitations:I’ve restricted the game to three players: Apple, Samsung, and Google. Some features may have appeared first in phones by smaller companies, but most of the “you stole that!” accusations involve the Big Three. Especially when it comes to software features (Apple’s iOS vs. Google’s Android) and hardware features (Apple’s iPhone vs. Samsung’s Galaxy S series).Not all features get stolen. Nobody ever copied Apple’s Force Touch screen idea (detects how hard you’re pressing) or its Emergency SOS siren (to use when you’re being mugged). Similarly, to this day, only Android offers desktop widgets and multiple user accounts on the phone. And Samsung, through the years, has introduced dozens of features that nobody chose to imitate (built-in heart-rate sensor, auto-scrolling based on your head tilt). This story is about features that have become universal, so those features don’t appear here.Also not included: Features that existed before the smartphone era, like downloadable ringtones. They weren’t Apple’s, Samsung’s, or Google’s ideas in the first place.Even with all of this research and documentation, I’m sure there will be much to argue about. Does Samsung’s easily fooled face recognition get credit for being first, when Apple’s later implementation, which uses depth cameras that can’t be fooled by a photo, is far better? Should a company get credit for being the leader, when the feature it introduced seems obvious and inevitable (say, an on-screen keyboard)? Should a feature be listed if two companies introduced it more or less simultaneously?Story continuesIn all three cases, I’ve answered “yes” as I built this study. As long as it’s an even playing field—the same rules apply to all three companies—the sheer number of examples should average out any cases where one company gets the benefit of the doubt.All right, ready for the results? Scroll on.OS FeaturesApple invented the touchscreen phone as we know it. The original 2007 iPhone brought us multitouch (pinch to zoom), an on-screen keyboard, auto-rotate, lists that scroll as though with momentum, and the apps-on-a-Home-page design that we all use to this day.Not surprisingly, then, Apple wins this category, having introduced 13 ideas, compared to Android’s 10 (and Samsung’s 1).ScreenThe screen is the first thing you notice when you turn on a phone—how big, bright, and gorgeous it is.Samsung has spent years pushing the size envelope: Its screens were the first to reach 4 inches, then 5 inches, then 6 inches diagonal. Steve Jobs always favored tiny phones, but eventually, Apple had to admit that the public wanted bigger screens, even if it meant bigger phones. Samsung has led the way with OLED screens, too—Apple finally adopted this stunning screen technology in the iPhone X.Even so, Apple barely wins this category, 6 to 4.Text & VoiceSmartphones don’t have physical keyboards. So how can you quickly and accurately enter text?Over the years, Apple and Google have introduced one new feature after another to address this problem. That includes Apple’s introduction of Siri (even though Apple didn’t create Siri in-house), and Google’s introduction of a hands-free, voice-triggered assistant (“OK Google—what’s the weather?”).Google wins this one: Android 6, Apple 5.CameraWhy do we even call these things “phones?” Making calls is the last thing many people use them for. The first, of course, is taking photos and videos.Believe it or not, the first smartphones didn’t have a flash, didn’t have a front-facing camera, and couldn’t even record video. How did we live?This time, the innovation rate is nearly tied: Apple 6, Android 6, and Samsung 5.PhoneNo surprise that the rate of new ideas in phone calling has slowed down recently; for many of us, texting and even video calling are our comms of choice.The calling/texting score: a tie. Android 3, Apple 3.Hardware FeaturesThe first smartphones didn’t have stereo speakers, GPS chips, and wireless charging, and weren’t water resistant; all of that came later. Kudos to Samsung for figuring out how to waterproof its phones without losing the headphone jack.The score: Apple 2, Android 2, Samsung 1.InternetThese days, the internet is the whole point, isn’t it? We expect our phones to show us websites and emails exactly as they’d appear on our laptops and desktops, full of formatting, photos, and videos. All of the features listed here are standard on smartphones—but somebody originally dreamed each of them up.The winner: Apple, with 4 inventions. Android had 3. Security“Security” means protection for both the physical phone—when you leave it somewhere, or when it gets stolen—and for its contents. (Activation lock—the iOS feature that makes it impossible to erase a stolen phone without the owner’s Apple ID credentials—was single-handedly responsible for plummeting iPhone thefts around the world. Why bother stealing a phone if you can’t erase it and resell it?)The tally here: Apple brought forth three out of four of these breakthroughs. WirelessLittle by little, cables and cords are going away. Look at the list of things that once required cables and can now happen wirelessly: sending video playback from the phone to the TV, listening to headphones, printing, sending files to other phones and computers, paying at a cashier terminal, and, lately, even charging.Android and iOS tie for the greatest number of cable eliminations, with 3 apiece.The ResultsWhen the dust settles, who’s the winner? Who innovates the most phone ideas, and who steals the most?Apple leads the invention category, with 44 innovations, according to our calculations. Google’s Android comes in second, with 31. And Samsung brings up the rear with 12 innovations.Now, if you count the number of times each company is listed as a Follower in the spreadsheet, you discover that Apple also seems to have stolen the most ideas. In part, that’s because I’m pitting Apple against Google/Samsung (its phones use Google’s software). As a result, no feature ever lists Google and Samsung as innovator+follower, or vice versa; they’re always a single team.This setup gives Apple an advantage, because it has two companies to steal from—but also a disadvantage, since it’s two-on-one.Of course, in the end, none of this tabulation really matters. The real conclusion of this massive research exercise is this: whoever makes your favorite phone steals ideas. They all do—always have, always will. It’s how the business runs.I still hope that, each time some engineering team swipes a great idea from a competitor, they feel a hot little spike of shame. “Well, hey, they do it!” is not a satisfying reason for copying someone else’s idea.

Apple had ranked No. 2 as recently as 2016, according to the annual Harris Poll Reputation Quotient poll released on Tuesday.The poll, conducted since 1999, surveyed 25,800 U.S. adults from Dec. 11 to Jan. 12 on the reputations the "most visible" corporate brands.John Gerzema, CEO of the Harris Poll, told Reuters in an interview that the likely reason Apple and Google fell was that they have not introduced as many attention-grabbing products as they did in past years, such as when Google rolled out free offerings like its Google Docs word processor or Google Maps and Apple's then-CEO Steve Jobs introduced the iPod, iPhone and iPad."Google and Apple, at this moment, are sort of in valleys," Gerzema said. "We're not quite to self-driving cars yet. We're not yet seeing all the things in artificial intelligence they're going to do."Meanwhile, Amazon.com held on to the No. 1 spot, which it has held for five years with the exception of 2015, when it slipped to No. 2. Gerzema attributed Amazon's ranking to its expanding footprint in consumers' lives into areas like groceries via its Whole Foods acquisition.Elon Musk's Tesla climbed from No. 9 to No. 3 on the strength of sending Tesla Roadster into space aboard a SpaceX rocket - despite fleeting success delivering cars on time on earth, Gerzema said."He's a modern-day carnival barker - it's incredible," Gerzema said of Musk. "This 'The Right Stuff' attitude is able to capture the public's imagination when every news headline is incredibly negative. They're filling a void of optimism."For its part, Facebook Inc's (FB.O) reputation improved in the 2018 study, despite being the target of questions from U.S. lawmakers about the role of social media in Russia's efforts to influence the U.S. presidential election in 2016. Facebook ranked 51st, its best showing since 2014 when it ranked 38th, the highest the firm ever ranked in the poll.This year, film production company The Weinstein Co made its debut at 99th out of 100 on the list after more than 70 women accused co-founder Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct, including rape. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.Last place went to Japanese auto parts supplier Takata Corp (TKTDQ.PK), whose air bags can explode with too much force and have been linked to at least 22 deaths and hundreds of injuries, prompting the largest recall in automotive history and forcing Takata and its U.S. unit, TK Holdings Inc, into bankruptcy.1.

The speaker went on sale on Feb. 9.A number of other reviewers have praised the HomePods's sound quality compared with similar speakers like the Echo and the Google Home. Fortune's Don Reisinger noted in his review that the HomePod's sound was better than the Echo and Home, but he conceded that the "sound quality isn't something that can justify its lofty price tag."In announcing the HomePod in June, Apple highlighted its sound quality in its sales pitch. It was a different sales strategy than Apple’s rivals, which instead promoted how well their respective speakers work with voice-activated digital assistants like Amazon's Alexa. People use these digital assistants for things like changing the volume and to play specific songs.Now that the HomePod is finally for sale, newer versions of smart speakers sold by Google and Sonos are also offering better sound quality compared to older models, noted Consumer Reports. That puts increased pressure on Apple and its claim about the superiority of its HomePod’s sound.The Google Home Max, which costs $400, and the Sonos One, which costs $200, manages to slightly exceed the HomePod's sound quality, according to Consumer Reports."Overall the sound of the HomePod was a bit muddy compared with what the Sonos One and Google Home Max delivered," the review said. The review also noted that while the HomePod would "serve many music fans well," there were some "flaws" like the way it projects bass sounds, which were "a bit boomy and overemphasized."Last week, Sonos co-founder and former CEO John MacFarlane briefly reviewed the HomePod via Twitter, by praising the speaker and saying it "handily beats a Sonos One." However, he said two Sonos One speakers provide better sound than one Apple HomePod (of course, he’s hardly objective). Got my HomePod. First impressions…Good packaging, easy setup.Great sound. No clipping at volume.A little heavy on the bass (Jimmy Iovine effect). Handily beats a single Sonos One, at full, acoustically. Two Sonos Ones, in pair, do a superior job. Great start by Apple. — John MacFarlane (@JohnLMacFarlane) February 9, 2018  See original article on Fortune.comMore from Fortune.comGoogle Is Preparing for Apple iPhone X CopycatsReview: Apple's HomePod Sounds Nice But You Shouldn't Buy It--YetBitcoin and Bug Bounties on the Hill, Apple and Cisco's Cyber Deal, iPhone LeakApple HomePod Launches With Big Sound--and Even Bigger QuestionsApple TV App Gets Live News Broadcasts from CNN, Fox News, and CNBCReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextYes, You Need to Recycle Your Old BatteriesConsumer Reports10 Ways to Save Energy Doing LaundryConsumer ReportsWhere to Stream Movies FreeConsumer ReportsWhy You Should Never Give Your Social Security Number Over the PhoneReader's DigestBest Grocery Store Prices in AmericaConsumer ReportsZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolNatural Gas Price Prediction – Prices Tumble as Supplies IncreaseFX EmpireWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNCrude Oil Weekly Price Forecast – Crude oil running into resistanceFX Empire'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceThe Boeing 737 MAX Is 1 Step Closer to Flying Again -- but Don't Expect to See It SoonMotley Fool57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

CEO Tim Cook announced the device as the day’s “one last thing.”“We think we can do a lot,” Cook said, “to make the experience [of listening to music in your home] much better.”The speaker is 7 inches tall, covered in “acoustic” mesh, with a 4-inch woofer. Along the bottom: 6 microphones and a beam-forming tweeter. It runs $349, which is far more expensive than competing products.The Apple Homepod. Photo: AppleMoreLike Amazon’s (AMZN) $179 Echo, Apple’s HomePod is not just for music. It can tell you the weather, read you news and sports scores, and perform many other tasks, all beginning with the command, “Hey Siri.”Three years after Amazon launched the Echo and six months after Google (GOOG, GOOGL) launched its $109 Home, this is Apple’s first entry to the category. And like those products, the speaker is a gateway to other Apple products, and a showcase for Apple’s voice assistant, Siri. Amazon Echo is powered by Alexa, while Google Home is powered by Google Assistant. (Last month, Microsoft announced the Invoke, a smart speaker powered by its Cortana voice assistant, set to go on sale in the fall.) Of course, you could also count the Sonos, the Beats Pill, and the Jawbone Jambox as home speakers that will have to compete with Apple HomePod now.Google Home (L) vs. Amazon EchoMoreYou might wonder why it took Apple this long to launch a home speaker. Apple senior vice president Phil Schiller answered that very question. He reasoned that there are great speakers already out there, but they aren’t “smart,” and there are smart speakers, but they don’t always deliver great quality.In addition to its own new speaker, Apple revealed that its new iOS 11 can control all the speakers in your home from your iPhone, including any Airplay-compatible third-party speakers.Announcing the Siri speaker was just one of many Siri-related upgrades that came out of this year’s WWDC. Apple opened the event by showing off new “Siri faces” for the Apple Watch Series 2 that use the voice assistant to provide quick information on the go.Later in the event, Apple ran through upgrades to Siri, including an updated voice (female and male), ability to translate from other languages, and syncing Siri’s learning about you across all your devices.So, which smart home speaker should you buy—Amazon’s, Google’s, or Apple’s?

Google's (GOOG) Motorola division has a new phone called the Moto X. The widely rumored device got an official unveiling Thursday in New York, and it's as cool-looking and full-featured as any flagship model in the industry. It also comes in 18 colors.But the most important part of the announcement was just a 10-second aside at the glossy intro event: The phone will be available on the five major U.S. carriers in a few weeks for $199.Google has sold its Nexus line of Android phones for years, but they've never made a dent in the sales standings, despite carrying the pure Android software unsullied by carrier crapware. That's largely because consumers have to pay full price for the Nexus phones at Google's online Play store, wait to get the phone delivered, then go to a physical store to arrange for service.Straight for the mainstream marketThe Moto X is going straight for the mainstream market — subsidized phones sold directly to customers in carriers' stores when they pick a two-year service plan.That kind of simple and convenient marketing plan — sell phones to people where they most commonly buy them for the price they most often pay — could make the Moto X a bigger contender than prior Google efforts.The phone itself has a large screen – 4.7” – and a curved, lightweight plastic back. It’s noticeably taller and wider than Apple’s (AAPL) iPhone 5 and feels light in the hand, although it actually weighs more than the iPhone, at 130 grams vs. 112 grams.About those new features – they do look pretty cool.First is the customization. At a "MotoMaker" website, customers can choose from 18 colors for the back, seven "accent" colors for the buttons and bezel around the camera, plus a black or white front.Motorola is promising delivery in the U.S in four days or less. That's why, the company says, it's assembling the phones in Fort Worth, Texas, instead of an overseas factory with lower labor costs.Apple may be about to make a similar multicolored move with the iPhone, however. A new, low-cost iPhone rumored to be coming out later this year is – again, rumored – to include multicolored plastic backs.The Moto X’s camera also has some new innovations, including the easiest way yet to turn it on a phone. Pick up a Moto X and give it a few quick wrist twists and the phone turns on with the camera app open. Tap anywhere on the screen and take a picture; hold a finger down on the screen to snap multiple shots.The Moto x also tries to take voice control to the next level. By uttering the phrase "OK Google, Now," a Moto X user can control the phone – place a call, dictate a text or play a song – even if it's in a pocket or a cupholder in your car. At least that's how it worked in the demo.Even if all goes as planned and the phone is a big seller, Google still has a ways to go to earn back the $12.5 billion it spent buying Motorola in the first place. Actually, more like $7 billion – Motorola has $3 billion of cash from when it was acquired and Google sold off the set-top box division for $2.4 billion.And Google has to be careful that its move to directly compete with other Android phone makers such as Samsung (005930.KS) and HTC (2498.TW) doesn't prompt those vendors to jump ship or put more effort into selling phones running Windows.Can a phone from Google actually make a dent in the smartphone market? Based on the demos and distribution, it sounds like the Moto X definitely has a shot.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWhat to Expect When Alphabet Reports Later This MonthMotley FoolThe Morning After: The Weather Channel got hackedEngadgetConsole gaming is at a crossroadsEngadgetMental health apps are sharing data without proper disclosureEngadget6 Workouts That Will Shake Up Your Current RoutineBRIT + COZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolTrump Watch: What We Learned From the Mueller Report + Jessie Liu's Office Prepares to Step InALM MediaBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraph57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley Fool8 Happy Easter Images to Post on Facebook, Twitter and InstagramInvestorPlaceTesla's board is about to get a lot smallerTechCrunchBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

Vattenfall says the electricity will be provided from Dutch wind turbines.Separately, Google says it's signed a deal to buy 190 MW of energy from three wind power plants in Finland, to supply its data center in the Nordic nation.The search giant said it has purchased about 900 MW of renewable capacity across Europe to meet its growing electricity demand.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextTop Three Tesla ShareholdersInvestopediaDutch fans hope home hero copes with Amstel pressureAFPAston Martin's Next Vehicle for James Bond Will Be a $326,000 Electric CarArchitectural DigestSonar Anomaly Leads to Discovery of 500-Year-Old Shipwreck in North SeaLiveScience.comElectric Ford Bronco from Zero Labs enters the restomod frayAutoblogZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolThis startup seeks to identify water problems before they become crisesMarketWatchHong Kong is the world's most expensive place to buy a homeYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosZoom's CEO emigrated from China 22 years ago and spoke little English — now he's worth almost $3 billionCNBCFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphHoneywell, International Paper commit to $16.2M cleanup of contaminated site in NCAmerican City Business JournalsWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBC3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolCould CarGurus Be the Next Top Auto Stock?Motley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo Finance1 Big Reason Why Disney Stock Is Just Getting StartedMotley FoolStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley Fool

Ballmer, who succeeded co-founder Bill Gates as CEO in 2000, has largely been blamed for the tech giant’s poor long-term stock performance and the company’s dearth of innovative products and services.Related: Google Glass is Dead On Arrival – Here's WhyYet Ballmer’s “entry point made it impossible for anyone to really succeed,” says Yahoo! Finance Senior Columnist Mike Santoli. “It was at the very peak of the Internet bubble. Microsoft stock was destined to be a terrible investment at the moment.”Microsoft certainly has had its share of stumbles – the portable music player Zune and most recently its new Surface tablet – but it has also been able to weather the aftermath of the tech crash better than its competitors, namely Cisco (CSCO) and Intel (INTC). Ballmer may have been too focused on defending Microsoft’s turf than creating world-altering devices, but criticism of Ballmer’s tenure has been “a little too convenient and simplistic,” argues Santoli.Related: Do Not Buy the Ballmer Bounce: FahmyAs CEO, Ballmer has grown cash flow and developed successful products like Windows XP and the Xbox 360. He led the charge to buy Internet phone service provider Skype for $8.5 billion in 2011. With less than a year on the job remaining, Ballmer’s main priority will likely be finding his replacement, not an easy task for a company as big and as closely watched by investors and the tech industry. Many insiders would love to see Gates return as CEO but the billionaire has already publicly squashed that idea. The best person for Microsoft may be an outsider, someone who can pivot the company away from PCs, says Santoli.

Microsoft researchers are trying to solve that problem via a tool kit for Unity VR developers to help players with low vision.  Since vision problems vary by individual, the research team at Microsoft decided on a tool kit approach so players can customize their experience.SmarterAnalyst•2 days agoMicrosoft (MSFT) Stock’s Big Rally Should ContinueMicrosoft (NASDSAQ:MSFT) has been on a winning streak given its diversified business portfolio and ability to deliver growth and financial results in a timely manner. Analysts continue to rally around the stock heading into its earnings announcement on April 24, which makes sense given the momentum on the charts, and sustained interest for a variety of Microsoft’s products both for consumers, and within the enterprise as well.The growth narrative tied to Azure Cloud drives much of the upside commentary among analysts despite the growth rate from Azure is expected to decelerate over the next couple-years. MSFT still trades at a fairly reasonable valuation at 31.35x earnings. The company’s current market capitalization is $934 Billion, with psychological resistance at $1 Trillion, or $130.37. Chances are Microsoft can reach $130 within the next couple months, assuming the stock market rally continues, and investors chase stocks at higher valuations.Despite multiple expansion adding to the recent stock price gains, software companies tend to trade at a bit a premium multiple given the defensiveness plus recurring revenue of the business model. Just look at Adobe for example, which trades at 49x earnings right now, despite EPS growth expectations of 20%. Microsoft trades at 30x earnings with consensus expecting 14.1% earnings for FY’19. So, there’s definitely some room for Microsoft to trade at a higher when compared to other software companies in the segment.UBS analyst Jennifer Swanson Lowe remains optimistic on Microsoft heading into Q2’19:> Microsoft shares had a slow start to the year as concerns about slower hardware purchasing from hyperscale providers and tough compares in the transactional portions of the company's weighed on sentiment. However, our checks point to sustained demand for Azure and ongoing Windows upgrade activity as Win7 end of life looms, while a reset in expectations post Q2 should improve the setup into Q3. Stock performance has perked up in recent weeks, but valuation at ~21x EV/CY19 FCF still looks defensive, and MSFT remains one of our favorite names for CY19, offering a balance of top-line growth, margin expansion, and FCF-based valuation support.The analyst has maintained her $125 price target on MSFT, and anticipates commercial cloud revenue growth of 39% in the next quarter:> We forecast Commercial Cloud rev. growth of 39% YoY to $9.6B on the back of 66% growth in Azure and 26% rev growth in Office 365 Commercial. Our checks continue to highlight strong demand for Azure as the platform underpinning digital transformation (growth is partially impacted by relatively mature per-user business while consumption-based business continues to remain healthy. We expect Commercial Cloud gross margin to improve 100 basis points quarter-on-quarter at 63%, based on improvements in Azure partially offset by lower-margin consumption-based services.The stock clearly wants to trend higher, and Microsoft does have a fairly solid track-record of meeting or beating consensus expectations. While Microsoft is a mature growth stock, the current consensus still anticipates the stock to trade at $129 currently, which implies that the stock could reach $1T in market valuation over the next 12-months.Microsoft will need to deliver some pretty solid results and raise financial outlook to get the stock trending up to $130. It seems doable given the stock’s momentum, and the valuation comparisons to some of its other software peers. Despite the catalysts tied to earnings, the summer months should also be interesting, as there’s a number of game software companies riding on this summer’s E3 conference like Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard.At this year’s E3 2019 Conference, Microsoft is expected to announce the Xbox 2, which will launch next year, but the preview announcement could add some excitement to the stock, as it looks to renew interest in its gaming franchise. Microsoft’s gaming business produced $10.35B revenue in FY’18 making it a big enough of a business, for Microsoft to start pouring resources into it. With the opportunity to refresh its console line-up, it would be a big opportunity for Microsoft to announce more exclusive titles developed in-house to regain momentum versus Sony, and also build a larger installed base of Xbox Live subscribers from 57 million, which has grown fairly stagnant in the past four quarters.Bottom Line:Improvements in gaming related announcements along with the announcement of earnings on April 24th will add some positive sentiment to the stock. Analysts seem relatively optimistic on the company and it’s hard to mess up on the announcement of a next-generation console this year, so the buzz generating commentary will keep Microsoft relevant in the minds of consumers this year.

Shares of Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), one of the largest U.S.-based video game makers, are up 24% year-to-date, but the industry also has some laggards. Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), one of EA's most direct competitors, sees its shares lower by 2% this year.Globally, the video game industry is a $140 billion business and it is growing."Video game revenue in 2018 reached a new peak of $43.8 billion, up 18 percent from the previous years, surpassing the projected total global box office for the film industry, according to new data released by the Entertainment Software Association and The NPD Group," reports TechCrunch.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe video game industry, while expansive, is also highly fragmented. So while there are a growing number of thematic exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the market today, the number of video game ETFs, as readers will see here, is quite low. In fact, there are just two funds resembling dedicated video game ETFs.  * 10 Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever With that in mind, let's look at some of the funds, including some stretches, that have credibility as video game ETFs. ETFMG Video Game Tech ETF (GAMR)Expense Ratio: 0.75%, or $75 annually per $10,000 investedThe ETFMG Video Game Tech ETF (NYSEARCA:GAMR) turned three years old last month and is the first dedicated video game ETF to list in the U.S. For an ETF focused on a somewhat narrow niche, GAMR has been relatively successful as highlighted by the fund's $100 million in assets under management. Home to almost 80 stocks, this video game ETF tracks the EEFund Video Game Tech Index.GAMR is reflective of the global nature of the video game industry as the fund provides exposure to 14 countries. The video game ETF's largest geographic weights will not surprise seasoned gamers. The U.S., Japan, South Korea and China combine for almost 78% of the fund's weight. GAMR provides exposure to several compelling video game themes, including mobile gaming and digital downloads."The percentage of digitally downloaded video games rose from 31% in 2010 to 74% in 2016," according to ETFMG. "This is expected to climb to nearly 93% by 2021."This video game ETF is up nearly 17% year-to-date. VanEck Vectors Video Gaming and eSports ETF (ESPO)Expense Ratio: 0.55%In the video game ETF realm, the VanEck Vectors Video Gaming and eSports ETF (NYSEARCA:ESPO) is the most direct competitor to the aforementioned GAMR. ESPO, which debuted last October, is not just a video game ETF. The fund is one of the best avenues for exposure to the booming e-sports market.ESPO tracks the Global Video Gaming and esports Index. Many of the dedicated esports companies are not yet publicly traded, so ESPO's 25 holdings run the gamut of video game makers, such as Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts, semiconductor makers and console makers. ESPO's components must derive at least half their sales from video games or esports to be included in the fund.Up 20.28% this year, this video game ETF has recently been hitting new highs, reflecting investors' expectations for the growing esports market.  * 6 Cheap Stocks That Cost Less Than $10 "Competitive video gaming audience expected to reach 454 million people globally in 2019," according to VanEck. "Esports revenue growth has increased almost 40% yearly since 2015, supported by a young, affluent audience." iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)Expense Ratio: 0.47%No, the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) is not a video game ETF, but remember, there are not many video game ETFs and some semiconductor makers are heavily involved in the video game and competitive gaming markets. That includes Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the largest holding in SOXX.Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is also making inroads in the video game space, having recently reported that its chips will power Google's online gaming platform known as Stadia. Shares of Nvidia and AMD combine for about 13% of SOXX's weight.While that is not enough to make this chip fund a video game ETF, it is enough to make SOXX an appropriate option for investors looking for indirect video game exposure via the ETF wrapper. SOXX is higher by 29% this year. First Trust Cloud Computing ETF (SKYY)Expense Ratio: 0.60%Some of the largest companies in the U.S., such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), have significant video game exposure, but because video games are not the primary drivers of those companies' revenue, they do not reside in video game ETFs.While it is not a proper video game ETF, the First Trust Cloud Computing ETF (NASDSAQ:SKYY) has some legitimated video game credibility. Mobile game maker Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) is SKYY's largest holding at a weight of 6.18%. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), a platform for social gaming, represents nearly 5% of SKYY's weight while Amazon and Microsoft combine for nearly 7% of the fund's weight. Additionally, there are myriad cloud applications in the video game universe.  * 10 Dividend Growth Stocks You Can't Miss "On trend with community gaming, the increasing preference for multiplayer gaming is pushing momentum in the cloud gaming industry," according to ETMG. "Cloud gaming allows gamers access to supercomputers that can render high-end games, exceeding the processing power that normal hardware players are capable of." iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV)Expense Ratio: 0.47%As its name implies, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (CBOE:IGV) is a software fund, not a dedicated video game ETF. However, IGV does have ample video game exposure because many companies in this space are software makers.Microsoft is IGV's largest holding at a weight of just over 8% … a relevant point because the company is the maker of the Xbox console. Additionally, a point that gets overlooked because of Microsoft's sprawling businesses, including business software and the cloud, is that the company is actually the fourth-largest video game company in the U.S.Video game makers Activision, Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive Software (NASDAQ:TTWO) combine for nearly 7% of IGV's weight. Global X Social Media ETF (SOCL) Expense Ratio: 0.65%The Global X Social Media ETF (NASDAQ:SOCL) is a valid alternative for a traditional video game ETF for several reasons. China's Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) is SOCL's largest holding at a weight of nearly 13% and that company is a significant footprint in China's growing video game market. In fact, China is the world's largest video game market.Bolstering the case for video game growth in China is that the government there approved nearly 800 games in the first quarter, most of which were not traditional poker or gambling-related board games. SOCL's video game ETF status is boosted by exposure to Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook and Zynga, among others.With so many gamers turning to multi-player games and using these games to interact with friends and make new acquaintances, the intersections of social media and gaming are potentially limitless and highly lucrative for advertisers and game makers. Simply put, SOCL is a social media fund, but its video game ETF credentials have the potential to exponentially grow in the years ahead. Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (XLC)Expense Ratio: 0.13%The Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLC) is the first ETF dedicated to the communication services sector, which debuted last year. As such, this fund features massive exposure to Facebook and the two share classes of Alphabet. Those stocks combine for almost 43% of XLC's weight, giving this fund video game ETF viability.Activision Blizzard is also a top 10 holding in XLC and Electronic Arts and Take-Two also reside in this fund. XLC would see its video game ETF credentials increase if Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), which combine for 10.26% of the fund's weight, bolster their video game exposure.Ultimately, XLC has some video game exposure, but the average market value of its 26 components is $358.69 billion, meaning many of these companies' bottom lines are not going to be materially altered by video game exposure over the near to medium term.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Owing to its operational stability, lack of any prominent headwinds, and robust exposure to secular growth tailwinds in the cloud market, MSFT stock was largely insulated from the late 2018 market sell-off.Until December. Then, markets fell off a cliff. So did MSFT stock. In just a few weeks, it spiraled from $112 to $94.Since then, it's been nothing but up, up and away for MSFT stock. The shares rebounded back above $100 by the end of the year. They cruised past $110 by February and by April, sailed above $120. All together, MSFT stock has rebounded 30% over the past few months to trade at fresh all-time highs today.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Q3 Numbers Will Be Gut CheckThis rally is about to get a gut check. Microsoft reports third quarter numbers next week. Considering how far and how fast Microsoft stock has come over the past few months, the company needs these numbers to be good in order for the stock to hold onto its year-to-date gains.Will the numbers be good? I think so. Everything I'm looking at suggests that Microsoft's cloud business has been on fire over the past few months. Ultimately, that should lead to headline beating numbers which will keep the rally in MSFT stock alive.Bigger picture, continued cloud strength will keep MSFT stock on a longer-term winning trajectory. Until that cloud strength cools, MSFT stock will keep making new highs. Investors Brushed Off Earlier DisappointmentBroadly speaking, Microsoft's upcoming third quarter earnings report is critical because it has the power to either confirm or negate the big year-to-date rally in MSFT stock.  * 10 S&P 500 Stocks to Weather the Earnings Storm To be sure, this isn't the first time we've heard numbers from Microsoft in 2019. Back in late January, the company delivered Q2 numbers that were largely underwhelming. The big negative? Slowing growth. Revenue growth slowed from 18% in Q1 to 12% in Q2, while operating profit lost its mojo, with growth sliding from 28% to 18%. The culprit behind slower top- and bottom-line growth? Slowing cloud expansion, and that wasn't a bullish sign, since the Microsoft growth narrative goes as its cloud businesses go.But, investors largely brushed off those slowing growth concerns, and MSFT stock has rallied ever since. Why? Because investors chalked-up slowing Q2 cloud growth to broadly deteriorating global economic conditions. Those global conditions have meaningfully improved since late 2018, and as such, investors are thinking that maybe the Q2 cloud slowdown at Microsoft was just a blip on the radar. They reason that Q3 numbers should be much better.From this perspective, Microsoft needs to report a solid Q3 in order to satisfy bulls and keep MSFT stock in rally mode. Earnings Will Be GoodFortunately, I think Microsoft will deliver solid third-quarter numbers.Over the past several months, Exxon (NYSE:XOM) has tapped Microsoft as its cloud service provider in what is reportedly the largest cloud computing partnership in the oil industry. Volkswagen struck a similar large cloud deal. Meanwhile, Microsoft has teamed up with Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), VMWare (NYSE:VMW), and Slack in separate landmark partnerships, all of which have only broadened the utility and use cases of Microsoft's enterprise cloud solutions. Microsoft has also been named as one of the finalist for the Pentagon's huge JEDI contract, with the other being Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).In other words, it appears that over the past several months, Microsoft's cloud businesses have re-gained momentum that was lost in late 2018. This momentum will show up through improved Q3 growth rates, which will excite bulls and keep the stock in rally mode.  * 7 High-Risk Stocks With Big Potential Rewards Longer term, this trend should continue to play out in favor of MSFT stock. The global cloud growth narrative is still in its first few innings, and Microsoft has established itself as an entrenched and dominant player in that industry. Thus, as cloud becomes a bigger and bigger piece of the total Microsoft pie, overall growth rates and margins will continue to improve. That will lead to healthy profit growth, which will ultimately keep MSFT stock on a winning trajectory. Bottom Line on MSFT StockThe big picture here is very easy to digest. Cloud is a huge growth industry, and Microsoft is right at the heart of all that growth. Thanks to the company's dominant position in the secular growth cloud industry, MSFT stock has secured a bright future for itself.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long ADBE and AMZN.

Analysts continue to rally around the stock heading into its earnings announcement on April 24, which makes sense given the momentum on the charts, and sustained interest for a variety of Microsoft’s products both for consumers, and within the enterprise as well.The growth narrative tied to Azure Cloud drives much of the upside commentary among analysts despite the growth rate from Azure is expected to decelerate over the next couple-years. MSFT still trades at a fairly reasonable valuation at 31.35x earnings. The company’s current market capitalization is $934 Billion, with psychological resistance at $1 Trillion, or $130.37. Chances are Microsoft can reach $130 within the next couple months, assuming the stock market rally continues, and investors chase stocks at higher valuations.Despite multiple expansion adding to the recent stock price gains, software companies tend to trade at a bit a premium multiple given the defensiveness plus recurring revenue of the business model. Just look at Adobe for example, which trades at 49x earnings right now, despite EPS growth expectations of 20%. Microsoft trades at 30x earnings with consensus expecting 14.1% earnings for FY’19. So, there’s definitely some room for Microsoft to trade at a higher when compared to other software companies in the segment.UBS analyst Jennifer Swanson Lowe remains optimistic on Microsoft heading into Q2’19:> Microsoft shares had a slow start to the year as concerns about slower hardware purchasing from hyperscale providers and tough compares in the transactional portions of the company's weighed on sentiment. However, our checks point to sustained demand for Azure and ongoing Windows upgrade activity as Win7 end of life looms, while a reset in expectations post Q2 should improve the setup into Q3. Stock performance has perked up in recent weeks, but valuation at ~21x EV/CY19 FCF still looks defensive, and MSFT remains one of our favorite names for CY19, offering a balance of top-line growth, margin expansion, and FCF-based valuation support.The analyst has maintained her $125 price target on MSFT, and anticipates commercial cloud revenue growth of 39% in the next quarter:> We forecast Commercial Cloud rev. growth of 39% YoY to $9.6B on the back of 66% growth in Azure and 26% rev growth in Office 365 Commercial. Our checks continue to highlight strong demand for Azure as the platform underpinning digital transformation (growth is partially impacted by relatively mature per-user business while consumption-based business continues to remain healthy. We expect Commercial Cloud gross margin to improve 100 basis points quarter-on-quarter at 63%, based on improvements in Azure partially offset by lower-margin consumption-based services.The stock clearly wants to trend higher, and Microsoft does have a fairly solid track-record of meeting or beating consensus expectations. While Microsoft is a mature growth stock, the current consensus still anticipates the stock to trade at $129 currently, which implies that the stock could reach $1T in market valuation over the next 12-months.Microsoft will need to deliver some pretty solid results and raise financial outlook to get the stock trending up to $130. It seems doable given the stock’s momentum, and the valuation comparisons to some of its other software peers. Despite the catalysts tied to earnings, the summer months should also be interesting, as there’s a number of game software companies riding on this summer’s E3 conference like Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard.At this year’s E3 2019 Conference, Microsoft is expected to announce the Xbox 2, which will launch next year, but the preview announcement could add some excitement to the stock, as it looks to renew interest in its gaming franchise. Microsoft’s gaming business produced $10.35B revenue in FY’18 making it a big enough of a business, for Microsoft to start pouring resources into it. With the opportunity to refresh its console line-up, it would be a big opportunity for Microsoft to announce more exclusive titles developed in-house to regain momentum versus Sony, and also build a larger installed base of Xbox Live subscribers from 57 million, which has grown fairly stagnant in the past four quarters.Bottom Line:Improvements in gaming related announcements along with the announcement of earnings on April 24th will add some positive sentiment to the stock. Analysts seem relatively optimistic on the company and it’s hard to mess up on the announcement of a next-generation console this year, so the buzz generating commentary will keep Microsoft relevant in the minds of consumers this year.

ETFMG Video Game Tech ETF (GAMR)Expense Ratio: 0.75%, or $75 annually per $10,000 investedThe ETFMG Video Game Tech ETF (NYSEARCA:GAMR) turned three years old last month and is the first dedicated video game ETF to list in the U.S. For an ETF focused on a somewhat narrow niche, GAMR has been relatively successful as highlighted by the fund's $100 million in assets under management. Home to almost 80 stocks, this video game ETF tracks the EEFund Video Game Tech Index.GAMR is reflective of the global nature of the video game industry as the fund provides exposure to 14 countries. The video game ETF's largest geographic weights will not surprise seasoned gamers. The U.S., Japan, South Korea and China combine for almost 78% of the fund's weight. GAMR provides exposure to several compelling video game themes, including mobile gaming and digital downloads."The percentage of digitally downloaded video games rose from 31% in 2010 to 74% in 2016," according to ETFMG. "This is expected to climb to nearly 93% by 2021."This video game ETF is up nearly 17% year-to-date. VanEck Vectors Video Gaming and eSports ETF (ESPO)Expense Ratio: 0.55%In the video game ETF realm, the VanEck Vectors Video Gaming and eSports ETF (NYSEARCA:ESPO) is the most direct competitor to the aforementioned GAMR. ESPO, which debuted last October, is not just a video game ETF. The fund is one of the best avenues for exposure to the booming e-sports market.ESPO tracks the Global Video Gaming and esports Index. Many of the dedicated esports companies are not yet publicly traded, so ESPO's 25 holdings run the gamut of video game makers, such as Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts, semiconductor makers and console makers. ESPO's components must derive at least half their sales from video games or esports to be included in the fund.Up 20.28% this year, this video game ETF has recently been hitting new highs, reflecting investors' expectations for the growing esports market.  * 6 Cheap Stocks That Cost Less Than $10 "Competitive video gaming audience expected to reach 454 million people globally in 2019," according to VanEck. "Esports revenue growth has increased almost 40% yearly since 2015, supported by a young, affluent audience." iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (SOXX)Expense Ratio: 0.47%No, the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX) is not a video game ETF, but remember, there are not many video game ETFs and some semiconductor makers are heavily involved in the video game and competitive gaming markets. That includes Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the largest holding in SOXX.Nvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is also making inroads in the video game space, having recently reported that its chips will power Google's online gaming platform known as Stadia. Shares of Nvidia and AMD combine for about 13% of SOXX's weight.While that is not enough to make this chip fund a video game ETF, it is enough to make SOXX an appropriate option for investors looking for indirect video game exposure via the ETF wrapper. SOXX is higher by 29% this year. First Trust Cloud Computing ETF (SKYY)Expense Ratio: 0.60%Some of the largest companies in the U.S., such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), have significant video game exposure, but because video games are not the primary drivers of those companies' revenue, they do not reside in video game ETFs.While it is not a proper video game ETF, the First Trust Cloud Computing ETF (NASDSAQ:SKYY) has some legitimated video game credibility. Mobile game maker Zynga (NASDAQ:ZNGA) is SKYY's largest holding at a weight of 6.18%. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), a platform for social gaming, represents nearly 5% of SKYY's weight while Amazon and Microsoft combine for nearly 7% of the fund's weight. Additionally, there are myriad cloud applications in the video game universe.  * 10 Dividend Growth Stocks You Can't Miss "On trend with community gaming, the increasing preference for multiplayer gaming is pushing momentum in the cloud gaming industry," according to ETMG. "Cloud gaming allows gamers access to supercomputers that can render high-end games, exceeding the processing power that normal hardware players are capable of." iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV)Expense Ratio: 0.47%As its name implies, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (CBOE:IGV) is a software fund, not a dedicated video game ETF. However, IGV does have ample video game exposure because many companies in this space are software makers.Microsoft is IGV's largest holding at a weight of just over 8% … a relevant point because the company is the maker of the Xbox console. Additionally, a point that gets overlooked because of Microsoft's sprawling businesses, including business software and the cloud, is that the company is actually the fourth-largest video game company in the U.S.Video game makers Activision, Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive Software (NASDAQ:TTWO) combine for nearly 7% of IGV's weight. Global X Social Media ETF (SOCL) Expense Ratio: 0.65%The Global X Social Media ETF (NASDAQ:SOCL) is a valid alternative for a traditional video game ETF for several reasons. China's Tencent Holdings (OTC:TCEHY) is SOCL's largest holding at a weight of nearly 13% and that company is a significant footprint in China's growing video game market. In fact, China is the world's largest video game market.Bolstering the case for video game growth in China is that the government there approved nearly 800 games in the first quarter, most of which were not traditional poker or gambling-related board games. SOCL's video game ETF status is boosted by exposure to Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook and Zynga, among others.With so many gamers turning to multi-player games and using these games to interact with friends and make new acquaintances, the intersections of social media and gaming are potentially limitless and highly lucrative for advertisers and game makers. Simply put, SOCL is a social media fund, but its video game ETF credentials have the potential to exponentially grow in the years ahead. Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (XLC)Expense Ratio: 0.13%The Communication Services Select Sector SPDR (NYSEARCA:XLC) is the first ETF dedicated to the communication services sector, which debuted last year. As such, this fund features massive exposure to Facebook and the two share classes of Alphabet. Those stocks combine for almost 43% of XLC's weight, giving this fund video game ETF viability.Activision Blizzard is also a top 10 holding in XLC and Electronic Arts and Take-Two also reside in this fund. XLC would see its video game ETF credentials increase if Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), which combine for 10.26% of the fund's weight, bolster their video game exposure.Ultimately, XLC has some video game exposure, but the average market value of its 26 components is $358.69 billion, meaning many of these companies' bottom lines are not going to be materially altered by video game exposure over the near to medium term.As of this writing, Todd Shriber did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

Owing to its operational stability, lack of any prominent headwinds, and robust exposure to secular growth tailwinds in the cloud market, MSFT stock was largely insulated from the late 2018 market sell-off.Until December. Then, markets fell off a cliff. So did MSFT stock. In just a few weeks, it spiraled from $112 to $94.Since then, it's been nothing but up, up and away for MSFT stock. The shares rebounded back above $100 by the end of the year. They cruised past $110 by February and by April, sailed above $120. All together, MSFT stock has rebounded 30% over the past few months to trade at fresh all-time highs today.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Q3 Numbers Will Be Gut CheckThis rally is about to get a gut check. Microsoft reports third quarter numbers next week. Considering how far and how fast Microsoft stock has come over the past few months, the company needs these numbers to be good in order for the stock to hold onto its year-to-date gains.Will the numbers be good? I think so. Everything I'm looking at suggests that Microsoft's cloud business has been on fire over the past few months. Ultimately, that should lead to headline beating numbers which will keep the rally in MSFT stock alive.Bigger picture, continued cloud strength will keep MSFT stock on a longer-term winning trajectory. Until that cloud strength cools, MSFT stock will keep making new highs. Investors Brushed Off Earlier DisappointmentBroadly speaking, Microsoft's upcoming third quarter earnings report is critical because it has the power to either confirm or negate the big year-to-date rally in MSFT stock.  * 10 S&P 500 Stocks to Weather the Earnings Storm To be sure, this isn't the first time we've heard numbers from Microsoft in 2019. Back in late January, the company delivered Q2 numbers that were largely underwhelming. The big negative? Slowing growth. Revenue growth slowed from 18% in Q1 to 12% in Q2, while operating profit lost its mojo, with growth sliding from 28% to 18%. The culprit behind slower top- and bottom-line growth? Slowing cloud expansion, and that wasn't a bullish sign, since the Microsoft growth narrative goes as its cloud businesses go.But, investors largely brushed off those slowing growth concerns, and MSFT stock has rallied ever since. Why? Because investors chalked-up slowing Q2 cloud growth to broadly deteriorating global economic conditions. Those global conditions have meaningfully improved since late 2018, and as such, investors are thinking that maybe the Q2 cloud slowdown at Microsoft was just a blip on the radar. They reason that Q3 numbers should be much better.From this perspective, Microsoft needs to report a solid Q3 in order to satisfy bulls and keep MSFT stock in rally mode. Earnings Will Be GoodFortunately, I think Microsoft will deliver solid third-quarter numbers.Over the past several months, Exxon (NYSE:XOM) has tapped Microsoft as its cloud service provider in what is reportedly the largest cloud computing partnership in the oil industry. Volkswagen struck a similar large cloud deal. Meanwhile, Microsoft has teamed up with Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), VMWare (NYSE:VMW), and Slack in separate landmark partnerships, all of which have only broadened the utility and use cases of Microsoft's enterprise cloud solutions. Microsoft has also been named as one of the finalist for the Pentagon's huge JEDI contract, with the other being Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).In other words, it appears that over the past several months, Microsoft's cloud businesses have re-gained momentum that was lost in late 2018. This momentum will show up through improved Q3 growth rates, which will excite bulls and keep the stock in rally mode.  * 7 High-Risk Stocks With Big Potential Rewards Longer term, this trend should continue to play out in favor of MSFT stock. The global cloud growth narrative is still in its first few innings, and Microsoft has established itself as an entrenched and dominant player in that industry. Thus, as cloud becomes a bigger and bigger piece of the total Microsoft pie, overall growth rates and margins will continue to improve. That will lead to healthy profit growth, which will ultimately keep MSFT stock on a winning trajectory. Bottom Line on MSFT StockThe big picture here is very easy to digest. Cloud is a huge growth industry, and Microsoft is right at the heart of all that growth. Thanks to the company's dominant position in the secular growth cloud industry, MSFT stock has secured a bright future for itself.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long ADBE and AMZN.

Analysts continue to rally around the stock heading into its earnings announcement on April 24, which makes sense given the momentum on the charts, and sustained interest for a variety of Microsoft’s products both for consumers, and within the enterprise as well.The growth narrative tied to Azure Cloud drives much of the upside commentary among analysts despite the growth rate from Azure is expected to decelerate over the next couple-years. MSFT still trades at a fairly reasonable valuation at 31.35x earnings. The company’s current market capitalization is $934 Billion, with psychological resistance at $1 Trillion, or $130.37. Chances are Microsoft can reach $130 within the next couple months, assuming the stock market rally continues, and investors chase stocks at higher valuations.Despite multiple expansion adding to the recent stock price gains, software companies tend to trade at a bit a premium multiple given the defensiveness plus recurring revenue of the business model. Just look at Adobe for example, which trades at 49x earnings right now, despite EPS growth expectations of 20%. Microsoft trades at 30x earnings with consensus expecting 14.1% earnings for FY’19. So, there’s definitely some room for Microsoft to trade at a higher when compared to other software companies in the segment.UBS analyst Jennifer Swanson Lowe remains optimistic on Microsoft heading into Q2’19:> Microsoft shares had a slow start to the year as concerns about slower hardware purchasing from hyperscale providers and tough compares in the transactional portions of the company's weighed on sentiment. However, our checks point to sustained demand for Azure and ongoing Windows upgrade activity as Win7 end of life looms, while a reset in expectations post Q2 should improve the setup into Q3. Stock performance has perked up in recent weeks, but valuation at ~21x EV/CY19 FCF still looks defensive, and MSFT remains one of our favorite names for CY19, offering a balance of top-line growth, margin expansion, and FCF-based valuation support.The analyst has maintained her $125 price target on MSFT, and anticipates commercial cloud revenue growth of 39% in the next quarter:> We forecast Commercial Cloud rev. growth of 39% YoY to $9.6B on the back of 66% growth in Azure and 26% rev growth in Office 365 Commercial. Our checks continue to highlight strong demand for Azure as the platform underpinning digital transformation (growth is partially impacted by relatively mature per-user business while consumption-based business continues to remain healthy. We expect Commercial Cloud gross margin to improve 100 basis points quarter-on-quarter at 63%, based on improvements in Azure partially offset by lower-margin consumption-based services.The stock clearly wants to trend higher, and Microsoft does have a fairly solid track-record of meeting or beating consensus expectations. While Microsoft is a mature growth stock, the current consensus still anticipates the stock to trade at $129 currently, which implies that the stock could reach $1T in market valuation over the next 12-months.Microsoft will need to deliver some pretty solid results and raise financial outlook to get the stock trending up to $130. It seems doable given the stock’s momentum, and the valuation comparisons to some of its other software peers. Despite the catalysts tied to earnings, the summer months should also be interesting, as there’s a number of game software companies riding on this summer’s E3 conference like Electronic Arts and Activision Blizzard.At this year’s E3 2019 Conference, Microsoft is expected to announce the Xbox 2, which will launch next year, but the preview announcement could add some excitement to the stock, as it looks to renew interest in its gaming franchise. Microsoft’s gaming business produced $10.35B revenue in FY’18 making it a big enough of a business, for Microsoft to start pouring resources into it. With the opportunity to refresh its console line-up, it would be a big opportunity for Microsoft to announce more exclusive titles developed in-house to regain momentum versus Sony, and also build a larger installed base of Xbox Live subscribers from 57 million, which has grown fairly stagnant in the past four quarters.Bottom Line:Improvements in gaming related announcements along with the announcement of earnings on April 24th will add some positive sentiment to the stock. Analysts seem relatively optimistic on the company and it’s hard to mess up on the announcement of a next-generation console this year, so the buzz generating commentary will keep Microsoft relevant in the minds of consumers this year.

Owing to its operational stability, lack of any prominent headwinds, and robust exposure to secular growth tailwinds in the cloud market, MSFT stock was largely insulated from the late 2018 market sell-off.Until December. Then, markets fell off a cliff. So did MSFT stock. In just a few weeks, it spiraled from $112 to $94.Since then, it's been nothing but up, up and away for MSFT stock. The shares rebounded back above $100 by the end of the year. They cruised past $110 by February and by April, sailed above $120. All together, MSFT stock has rebounded 30% over the past few months to trade at fresh all-time highs today.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Q3 Numbers Will Be Gut CheckThis rally is about to get a gut check. Microsoft reports third quarter numbers next week. Considering how far and how fast Microsoft stock has come over the past few months, the company needs these numbers to be good in order for the stock to hold onto its year-to-date gains.Will the numbers be good? I think so. Everything I'm looking at suggests that Microsoft's cloud business has been on fire over the past few months. Ultimately, that should lead to headline beating numbers which will keep the rally in MSFT stock alive.Bigger picture, continued cloud strength will keep MSFT stock on a longer-term winning trajectory. Until that cloud strength cools, MSFT stock will keep making new highs. Investors Brushed Off Earlier DisappointmentBroadly speaking, Microsoft's upcoming third quarter earnings report is critical because it has the power to either confirm or negate the big year-to-date rally in MSFT stock.  * 10 S&P 500 Stocks to Weather the Earnings Storm To be sure, this isn't the first time we've heard numbers from Microsoft in 2019. Back in late January, the company delivered Q2 numbers that were largely underwhelming. The big negative? Slowing growth. Revenue growth slowed from 18% in Q1 to 12% in Q2, while operating profit lost its mojo, with growth sliding from 28% to 18%. The culprit behind slower top- and bottom-line growth? Slowing cloud expansion, and that wasn't a bullish sign, since the Microsoft growth narrative goes as its cloud businesses go.But, investors largely brushed off those slowing growth concerns, and MSFT stock has rallied ever since. Why? Because investors chalked-up slowing Q2 cloud growth to broadly deteriorating global economic conditions. Those global conditions have meaningfully improved since late 2018, and as such, investors are thinking that maybe the Q2 cloud slowdown at Microsoft was just a blip on the radar. They reason that Q3 numbers should be much better.From this perspective, Microsoft needs to report a solid Q3 in order to satisfy bulls and keep MSFT stock in rally mode. Earnings Will Be GoodFortunately, I think Microsoft will deliver solid third-quarter numbers.Over the past several months, Exxon (NYSE:XOM) has tapped Microsoft as its cloud service provider in what is reportedly the largest cloud computing partnership in the oil industry. Volkswagen struck a similar large cloud deal. Meanwhile, Microsoft has teamed up with Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), VMWare (NYSE:VMW), and Slack in separate landmark partnerships, all of which have only broadened the utility and use cases of Microsoft's enterprise cloud solutions. Microsoft has also been named as one of the finalist for the Pentagon's huge JEDI contract, with the other being Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).In other words, it appears that over the past several months, Microsoft's cloud businesses have re-gained momentum that was lost in late 2018. This momentum will show up through improved Q3 growth rates, which will excite bulls and keep the stock in rally mode.  * 7 High-Risk Stocks With Big Potential Rewards Longer term, this trend should continue to play out in favor of MSFT stock. The global cloud growth narrative is still in its first few innings, and Microsoft has established itself as an entrenched and dominant player in that industry. Thus, as cloud becomes a bigger and bigger piece of the total Microsoft pie, overall growth rates and margins will continue to improve. That will lead to healthy profit growth, which will ultimately keep MSFT stock on a winning trajectory. Bottom Line on MSFT StockThe big picture here is very easy to digest. Cloud is a huge growth industry, and Microsoft is right at the heart of all that growth. Thanks to the company's dominant position in the secular growth cloud industry, MSFT stock has secured a bright future for itself.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long ADBE and AMZN.

During this time, some stocks have thrived while others have struggled.GOBankingRates researched historical prices to see what $1,000 invested in your favorite companies in 2008 would be worth 10 years later, as well as what the compound annual growth rate is to give you a sense of what the yearly return for each has been over time.Keep reading to learn about the fastest growing stocks since 2000, and see which companies have produced impressive growth rates during the past decade.SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY): $1,923.47Share Price May 1, 2008: $138.39 Share Price May 1, 2018: $266.24 Compound annual growth rate: 6.76 percentPerhaps the easiest route to investing in stocks is to simply invest in ETFs that track major indices. If you can’t beat the market, and almost everyone can’t, why not join it?In this case, the S&P 500 ETF from SPDR is among the most popular options for ETFs that track the S&P 500, which is generally considered the benchmark by which the performance of most stocks are judged.So, the roughly $2,000 that your $1,000 investment 10 years ago would be worth now is one of the best ways to gauge just how well some of these companies have performed.Apple (AAPL): $7,407.06Share price May 1, 2008: $24.99 Share price May 1, 2018: $185.16 Compound annual growth rate: 22.17 percentApple is one of the most iconic and well-known brands in the world, thanks in part to a few key reinventions and rebranding strategies. A decade ago, Apple was a tech firm less than one year into its release of the iPhone. Today, it’s a consumer goods giant that has ridden the smartphone revolution to its status as the most valuable company in the world, closing in on a valuation of $1 trillion.Netflix (NFLX): $74,394.38Share price May 1, 2008: $4.52 Share price May 1, 2018: $326.26 Compound annual growth rate: 53.87 percentNetflix shares have been prone to large gains and losses as it has grown into a dominant media company. But like Apple, Netflix wasn’t exactly the company it is today 10 years ago. In May of 2008, Netflix was primarily a mail-order DVD rental company that had just rolled out a streaming service that was capped at 10 hours of free viewing a month for the base membership.If you predicted that streaming was the wave of the future — like CEO Reed Hastings did — every $1,000 you invested in Netflix would be worth almost $75,000 today.Alphabet (GOOGL): $3,626.72Share price May 1, 2008: $292.13 Share price May 1, 2018: $1,059.46 Compound annual growth rate: 13.75 percentAlphabet is the holding company for technology giant Google. Over the years, the company has expanded into many different businesses. These range from office productivity products to phones, virtual assistants and entertainment services.Walt Disney Co. (DIS): $3,158.94Share price May 1, 2008: $32.45 Share price May 1, 2018: $102.48 Compound annual growth rate: 12.19 percentWith its TV shows, networks, movies and theme parks, Disney has evolved into a massive media conglomerate. Its share price stagnated in 2016 and 2017, in part due to poor subscriber numbers at subsidiary ESPN. However, plans to launch its own streaming service might help Disney stock recapture its mojo.Coca-Cola Company (KO): $1,438.09Share price May 1, 2008: $29.31 Share price May 1, 2018: $42.14 Compound annual growth rate: 3.70 percentCoke is an iconic brand and one of Warren Buffett’s favorite investments. However, the declining popularity of sugary soda drinks might be eating into the company’s profitability in the long run.Walmart (WMT): $1,468.90Share price May 1, 2008: $58.20 Share price May 1, 2018: $85.47 Compound annual growth rate: 3.92 percentWalmart is the world’s biggest retailer but it suffered a scare from competitors like Amazon in 2015, which, along with internal factors, correlated with a decline in stock value. That put a real damper on its returns for this time period, making this the first stock listed here that underperformed the S&P 500 over the last decade. So, one of the things to avoid at Walmart might actually be its stock.Story continuesTransocean Ltd. (RIG): $83.36Share Price May 1, 2008: $146.95 Share Price May 1, 2018: $12.25 Compound annual growth rate: -22.00 percentIt turns out being associated with one of the most catastrophic oil spills in history can have a negative effect on your shares. Transocean stock was riding high through the first half of 2008, but it went into a free fall when markets crashed later that year. The hits kept coming when, in 2010, the Deepwater Horizon accident occurred. If you failed to pull your $1,000 out of Transocean stock at any point in the last decade, you would be left with less than $100 today.Trex Company, Inc. (TREX): $23,582.58Share Price May 1, 2008: $4.50 Share Price May 1, 2018: $106.14 Compound annual growth rate: 37.17 percentTrex Company makes wood/plastic composites used in making outdoor decks — which, apparently, is a pretty great business to be in as the company has been growing at over 35 percent a year in the last decade. Although growth has been mostly consistent, 2017 was the biggest year for Trex stock: It gained roughly 70 percent last year.Microsoft (MSFT): $3,376.59Share price May 1, 2008: $28.50 Share price May 1, 2018: $96.22 Compound annual growth rate: 12.94 percentMicrosoft’s stock has performed well over the past few years, but it pales in contrast to its performance during the 1990s, when it helped create a number of “Microsoft millionaires.” These days, it’s still considered one of the safest stocks to invest in — especially for first-time investors.Nike (NKE): $4,152.34Share price May 1, 2008: $16.70 Share price May 1, 2018: $69.34 Compound annual growth rate: 15.30 percentNike continues to be an innovator and leader in the sports apparel and equipment industry. By sponsoring a number of high-profile athletes and teams, the Nike symbol is one of the most recognizable around. However, in 2016 the stock hit some headwinds and took a hard tumble that it didn’t fully recover from until the end of 2017.General Electric (GE): $428.76Share price May 1, 2008: $32.80 Share price May 1, 2018: $14.07 Compound annual growth rate: -8.12 percentLike much of the overall market, General Electric’s stock plummeted during the 2008-2009 financial crisis. For GE, the culprit was mainly its financial division, GE Capital. The stock recovered nicely coming out of that period, but major missteps in 2014 and 2017 have turned it into a long-term underperformer. In fact, General Electric stock was even more efficient at losing you money over the last ten years than the S&P 500 was at making it.Don’t Miss: The Classic Brands You Love Are in TroubleAmazon (AMZN): $20,406.42Share price May 1, 2008: $78.40 Share price May 1, 2018: $1,600.14 Compound annual growth rate: 35.20 percentA $1,000 investment in Amazon would have provided a substantial return for the long-term investor. A leader in e-commerce, Amazon consistently adds new products and services for consumer and business customers. This might be the reason many experts say this is one stock you’ll want to hold onto for a very long time.Pfizer (PFE): $1,732.59Share price May 1, 2008: $20.17 Share price May 1, 2018: $34.93 Compound annual growth rate: 5.65 percentThinking about investing in the healthcare sector? Pfizer is a good stock for beginners to try. The company is a major biopharmaceutical company whose stock provides consistent growth. On the downside, it has lagged the performance of both its industry group and the S&P 500 index over multi-year periods.McDonald’s (MCD): $2,771.11Share price May 1, 2008: $59.54 Share price May 1, 2018: $165.00 Compound annual growth rate: 10.73 percentMcDonald’s is in an industry where it must regularly reinvent itself. Faced with changing consumer trends and an onslaught of competitors, the company has responded by retooling its menu, adding all-day breakfast and changing to fresh beef in some of its burgers. Investors are probably hoping it works; McDonald’s stock has beaten the S&P 500 consistently since 2005.Starbucks (SBUX): $7,197.57Share price May 1, 2008: $7.98 Share price May 1, 2018: $57.45 Compound annual growth rate: 21.82 percentStarbucks has taken the way we drink coffee and turned it into a lifestyle, both domestically and internationally. After being hit hard during the financial crisis, the stock rebounded nicely the following years. Starbucks ran into trouble recently, though, after two African-American men were arrested at a Philadelphia location, prompting a wave of negative publicity.Find Out: How to Cut Your Annual Starbucks Bill Without Giving Up Your CoffeeChesapeake Energy Corporation (CHK): $62.70Share Price May 1, 2008: $49.22 Share Price May 1, 2018: $3.13 Compound annual growth rate: -24.19 percentBetween the financial crisis and then the massive drop in oil prices in late 2014, it really hasn’t been a good decade for investors in Oklahoma City-based oil and gas producer Chesapeake Energy Corporation. Chesapeake Energy stock used to trade for nearly $50 a share. Today, you can get a single share for just over $3, leaving you with a paltry $62.70 from a $1,000 investment in May of 2008.FedEx (FDX): $2,542.33Share price May 1, 2008: $95.59 Share price May 1, 2018: $243.12 Compound annual growth rate: 9.78 percentFedEx and other shipping competitors have benefited from the boom in e-commerce retailers such as Amazon, but the company has been hot since well before the rise of Amazon and others. FedEx stock has outperformed the S&P 500 since the start of 2001.Learn: How to Know When to Sell StocksOracle (ORCL): $2,193.15Share Price May 1, 2008: $21.01 Share Price May 1, 2018: $46.07 Compound annual growth rate: 8.17 percentOracle’s returns aren’t terribly impressive when weighed against the S&P 500, but they are still ahead of the index. What’s more, it hit a major milestone in late June of last year when it finally surpassed its all-time high from 2000 prior to a steep sell-off in the midst of the tech bubble bursting, having traded below that level for over 15 years.The Boeing Company (BA): $4,010.52Share Price May 1, 2008: $84.86 Share Price May 1, 2018: $340.43 Compound annual growth rate: 14.90 percentBoeing stock has been one of the stronger performers in the Dow Jones for some time, but much of those gains have been since the start of 2017. The stock has almost doubled since the start of last year.The Mosaic Company (MOS): $228.61Share Price May 1, 2008: $120.56 Share Price May 1, 2018: $27.56 Compound annual growth rate: -13.72 percentThe Mosaic Company is a basic materials company that produces concentrated phosphate and potash fertilizers. Of course, in the last decade, Mosaic Company stock has just been producing a lot of disappointed investors as it dropped to under a fifth of its May 2008 value. Maybe they could take pictures of everyone who lost money and piece them together into one big collage of sorts.Activision Blizzard, Inc. (ATVI): $5,194.05Share Price May 1, 2008: $13.55 Share Price May 1, 2018: $70.37 Compound annual growth rate: 17.91 percentFrom the start of 2010 to the start of 2013, Activision Blizzard stock held painfully steady. The stock opened 2010 at $11.23 a pop and ended 2013 at $18.29 a share. That makes the massive gain over the 10-year period all the more impressive, considering it essentially broke even on the first half of that period. Since the start of 2013, the stock is up a whopping 530 percent.Use These: 6 Best Long-Term InvestmentsEstee Lauder Companies, Inc. (EL): $5,864.41Share Price May 1, 2008: $22.81 Share Price May 1, 2018: $133.79 Compound annual growth rate: 19.35 percentThere’s no need to slap makeup on results like these, Estee Lauder’s nearly 20 percent annual return over the last decade might have investors blushing at how well they’ve done. The company grew at a rapid rate after the 2008 crash, had one hiccup in 2016, only to roar back in 2017, nearly doubling its value from the start of 2017 to March 2018.Salesforce.com, Inc. (CRM): $7,547.69Share Price May 1, 2008: $16.82 Share Price May 1, 2018: $126.97 Compound annual growth rate: 22.40 percentSalesforce.com has been extremely consistent with its impressive growth over the last decade. Aside from losses in 2008, 2011 and 2016, Salesforce stock made gains in every other full year since it went public in 2004.EnviroStar, Inc.

She'd been coding since she was 6.A real life Powerpuff GirlAfter creating the board game, Mehta won the $2,500 second-place prize from Think Tank Learning's Pitchfest in 2016.This caught the notice of some marketeers for Cartoon Network who were looking to profile inspiring young girls as real life "Powerpuff Girls." She was featured in one of their videos, and things took off from there.Samaira Mehta at GoogleMoreSamaira MehtaMehta was featured on some newscasts and started selling her game on Amazon."We've sold 1,000 boxes, so over $35,000, and it's only been on the market for one year," the exuberant and adorable Mehta told Business Insider.It wasn't just happenstance promotion. When she launched the board game, she also came up with a killer marketing plan with the help of her proud father, Rakesh Mehta (an Intel engineer and Oracle and Sun Microsystems alum).Mehta uses the game to conduct coding workshops for school-age kids. And she thinks big.She launched an initiative called Yes, 1 Billion Kids Can Code that allows interested people to donate boxes of the game to schools. She then set up workshops to help kids at those schools learn how to master the game.At the start of this school year, 106 schools were using the game to teach kids to code, Mehta said."In the world there are over 1 billion kids," she said. "There are people who are willing to donate CoderBunnyz boxes to schools and to people in need all over the world who want to learn coding."Aadit MehtaMoreCoderMindzSales of the game have gone so well that Mehta has just launched a sequel: a game for kids that teaches them how to code using artificial intelligence.The new game is called CoderMindz and she's billing it as the first AI board game.With CoderMindz, kids can learn basic AI principals — concepts like training an AI model, inference, and adaptive learning. Eventually, they can use those skills to build robots.Story continuesShe developed it with the help of her brother, Aadit, who is 6, the age she was when her dad started teaching her to code.A young Valley star is bornAs the game took off, Mehta was booked with workshops. She's done over 60 of them in Silicon Valley with over 2,000 kids so far, she said.The workshops included a series held at Google headquarters in Mountain View, California. That's where she met Stacy Sullivan, Google's chief culture officer.Samaira MehtaMoreCoderBunnyz"After my back-to-back workshops at Google headquarters, we talked for an hour," Mehta said. "She told me I was doing great and once I get out of college, I can come work for Google."The plucky young coder told Sullivan that she didn't know if she would want to work for Google. She likes being an entrepreneur.Meanwhile, Sullivan and the folks at Google were so impressed with the kid coder that she was picked as the keynote speaker at a Diversity in Tech conference held in August hosted at Google Launchpad, the company's startup accelerator in San Francisco. But she's done a bunch of other speaking gigs, too, including one at Microsoft and at the Girls' Festival sponsored by World Wide Women earlier this month.Samaira MehtaMoreSamaira MehtaSince the debut of CoderBunnyz she's met a lot of big names. One of her proudest moments was receiving an encouraging letter from former first lady Michelle Obama.She also met Mark Zuckerberg on Halloween when she was trick-or-treating in his neighborhood, and took the opportunity to chat him up about her coding work.She said there was "a super long line" at his house."I finally got to meet him," she remembered. "He was handing out chocolates. I told him I was a young coder and he told me to keep going, you're doing great."She's now launched her own interview series on her CoderBunnyz website in which she talks with people in the robotics, game, and education sectors.CoderBunnyz workshopMoreCoderBunnyzWhile she's reinvesting all the money from her young business into manufacturing more CoderBunnyz games and creating the new AI game, she's already got a charity picked out for when she generates profits: PATH."It ends homelessness and helps people rebuild skills and I care about the homeless," she said.Until the day her company can make donations, she's putting her entrepreneurial know-how to work in other ways to raise money for it, including hosting a lemonade stand this summer that brought in $119.NOW WATCH: How a coding genius makes incredible 3D-graphics for major Hollywood moviesSee Also:Here's how Google's new $150 Home Hub compares to the Amazon Echo ShowBattle of the big phones: How Google's new Pixel 3 XL compares to the jumbo iPhone XS MaxDELETE YOUR ACCOUNT: How to wipe your personal information from Facebook, Amazon, Google, and other major websites and appsSEE ALSO: The extraordinary life of Microsoft's billionaire cofounder Paul Allen, who has died at the age of 65ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWhat to Expect When Alphabet Reports Later This MonthMotley FoolThe Morning After: The Weather Channel got hackedEngadgetCaterina Fake is known for her trend-spotting; here's some of what she's chasing nowTechCrunchConsole gaming is at a crossroadsEngadgetMueller's Reminder That Silicon Valley Isn't Ready for the Next ElectionBloombergZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceState defends South Dakota pipeline protest legislationAssociated Press'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolIn Ukrainian candidate's hometown, a cry for changeAssociated PressAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHere's What Hedge Funds Think About NIO Inc.

When you buy a stock, your total return comes from two places - price appreciation and dividends. For the longest time tech stocks were never mentioned hand-in-hand with dividend stocks. Pick up Amazon.com (AMZN) for $300, sell half at a thousand bucks a few years later, and you're sitting on free shares worth $1,600 each a year after that. That's the blueprint!Many tech stocks used to offer share splits as their prices rocketed higher. However many technology companies are maturing, and with breakneck growth in the rear-view mirror, and they need a different way to draw investors. The answer, for many, has been to start delivering dividends, paying investors for owning their shares.To be clear, tech stocks that pay dividends aren't done growing. The increased presence of technology in all aspects of human life means that there's still plenty of upside, even for Wall Street's biggest tech companies. To wit, old-guard blue chip Microsoft (MSFT) has surpassed Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook (FB) in market value this year, and it's neck-and-neck with Amazon.Here are 10 tech stocks that offer an ideal combination of dividends and growth potential. They might not be the flashiest names in the sector, but they deserve attention nonetheless.SEE ALSO: 101 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2019 and BeyondAppleGetty ImagesMarket value: $985 billionDividend yield: 1.3%Everybody loves Apple (AAPL, $207.48). Warren Buffett loves Apple. President Donald Trump loves Apple. And a lot of investors made Apple - founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne - America's first $1 trillion company based on market capitalization.However, Apple recently has fallen into a significant funk and given up that $1 trillion price tag. It suffered its worst performance in more than four years on Friday, Nov. 2, in response to a quarterly earnings report that beat expectations, but included disappointing guidance and a revelation that Apple will no longer report unit sales in any of its products.That sparked immediate panic because the assumption is Apple expects less-than-impressive iPhone and other product sales going forward, even if margins continue to improve. That fear was further fueled by flat iPhone sales for the quarter.That said, there are reasons for optimism. For one, it appears Apple will shift its focus on its Services division (iTunes, Apple Pay, etc.), which has been a shining bright spot for the company over the past couple years. And some analysts believe this change in disclosure, while painful in the short-term, will benefit Apple over the long run.Also don't forget that Apple remains a cash-generating machine that, earlier this year, promised to buy back $100 billion stock and tacked on another 16% increase to the dividend. The payout has jumped about 92% since the company resumed regular dividends in 2012. While Apple's current yield is a mere 1.3%, investors who bought in around the time of Apple's first dividend now are earning a 5%-plus yield on their shares.SEE ALSO: The 100 Most Popular Funds for Your 401(k) Retirement SavingsCisco SystemsStory continuesGetty ImagesMarket value: $207.9 billionDividend yield: 2.9%Cisco Systems (CSCO, $45.48), whose networking gear helped build the Internet, is now trying to reinvent itself as a subscription company as its networking technology itself slowly evolves into software.Along the way, Cisco has become a solid dividend stock. Its 33-cent quarterly payout is almost double the 17 cents it delivered in early 2014. The stock has roughly doubled over the same time frame.One primary focus of CEO Chuck Robbins has been computer security. Cisco now has a suite of such products, available by subscription, like other cloud-based software. The company continually adds to it, too, most recently by adding Duo, which offers "two-factor security" that calls users when they try to sign-in to verify their identity. Other security acquisitions made in the last two years include Observable Networks and Skyport Systems.Cisco reported a huge jump in fiscal fourth-quarter earnings in August, from 48 cents per share to 81 cents, translating into a mere 41% dividend payout ratio.Small wonder that most of the 30 analysts following Cisco currently have it on their buy lists.SEE ALSO: The 25 Biggest U.S. IPOs of All TimeEquinixGetty ImagesMarket value: $31.5 billionDividend yield: 2.4%The cloud is one of the biggest tech trends of our time. Cloud computing, delivered by "hyperscale" data centers, have been making investors rich since the combination of cheap hardware, open-source software and virtual operating systems were developed last decade.But connecting clouds can be as profitable as running them. Data centers where the fiber lines of clouds often connect are mostly owned by real estate investment trusts (REITs) - a business structure for property owners/operators that requires most profits to be redistributed as dividends.One of the best-run such REITs is Equinix (EQIX, $392.43). Equinix has more than 190 data centers across 24 countries and is the world's largest colocation data center by market share. But it doesn't just offer infrastructure - it also provides data services, information protection and other solutions that make Equinix more than just a rent collector.Equinix, like Apple, doesn't deliver a particularly high yield, at just 2.4%. But again, like Apple, it's important to consider the company's ability to increase the payout over time. EQIX's payout has grown 35% since 2015, when it reorganized as a REIT, so investors should be encouraged on that front.In its most recent quarter, Equinix grew revenues by 18% year-over-year to 1.26 billion, and its guidance of $1.596-$1.636 billion in adjusted funds from operations (AFFO, an important measure of REIT profitability) would represent roughly 12% improvement from 2017.SEE ALSO: The "Accelerators": 13 Dividend Stocks With Rapidly Growing PayoutsGarminGetty ImagesMarket value: $12.5 billionDividend yield: 3.2%Garmin (GRMN, $66.15) is the house that the Global Positioning System (GPS) built. GPS can tell you where you are, to within a few feet - and Garmin has been utilizing that technology since 1989.Garmin was co-founded by American businessman Gary Burrell, who remains chairman emeritus, and Taiwan-born engineer Min H. Kao, now executive chairman. The company is known for GPS receivers, and moved its incorporation to Switzerland in 2010, although its main office remains outside Kansas City.Garmin only has a float of about 188 million shares, 34% of which are held by corporate insiders. Kao and his family retain the largest single stake in the company, but they have been steadily selling shares in a planned way for tax purposes. This plan minimizes disruption for other shareholders.While you might think a company based around GPS might be dead in the water considering every phone has access to things such as Google Maps, Garmin's still going strong thanks to a renewed focus on wearables (smartwatches and activity trackers), often ruggedized and with satellite phone capability for use in the wilderness.The company raised its earnings guidance in June, expecting to earn $3.30 per share on revenue of $3.3 billion. Garmin made a good stride toward that in its third-quarter results, when it reported profits of $1 per share, up 33% YoY, that were a quarter better than expected. Also encouraging: GRMN snapped years of dividend stagnation this year with a small hike to the June dividend.SEE ALSO: The 25 Best Low-Fee Mutual Funds You Can BuyIntelGetty ImagesMarket value: $215.0 billionDividend yield: 2.6%Intel (INTC, $47.11) looked like it was going to be left behind at one point as the PC industry it had a stranglehold on deteriorated, and as it failed to latch on to the mobile trend. But it has reinvented itself this decade as a supplier of chips and software to cloud data centers.Intel is the home of "Moore's Law," described in a 1965 article by co-founder and (later) President Gordon Moore as the idea that integrated circuits double their density, at the same price, every year. It is this concept, which Intel has made a reality, that created the modern technology world. Everything else - PCs, the Internet, devices and clouds - grew out of this central idea.Intel, once a major growth play, has emerged as a solid dividend stock. It has more than doubled over the past decade to its current 30 cents per share.But INTC isn't exactly done growing, either. The company reported a monster earnings beat for its third quarter - $1.40 per share versus $1.15 per share expected - and topped expectations for Q4 guidance. Things were so good that it upgraded its full-year guidance, too. The growth no longer comes from PCs, but from newer streams such as supplying data centers.All this is happening despite the resignation of CEO Brian Krzanich in June and the fact that Intel has yet to hire a permanent replacement.SEE ALSO: The Kip ETF 20: The 20 Best Cheap ETFs You Can BuyMicrosoftGetty ImagesMarket value: $815.7 billionDividend yield: 1.7%Microsoft (MSFT, $106.26) was nicknamed "Mr. Softee" because of its dominance of PC software in the 1990s and 2000s. But under CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft could easily be called "Mr. Cloud" today, as its Azure cloud (and applications built on it) has become one of the most stable profit centers around.Microsoft pays out $1.84 per share in annual dividends - only good for a yield of 1.7%, but the payout has more than tripled since 2010. It costs Microsoft $13 billion annually to service that dividend at its current rate, which isn't a small thing. But MSFT can easily foot the bill; its net income in 2017 was more than $21 billion, nearly double what it was in 2015.Long-term debt of $76 billion could be paid off at a stroke with $133 billion in cash and long-term investments. Even its capital budget of over $10 billion is manageable.Again, this financial heft is made possible because Nadella shoved Microsoft into the modern era by taking the focus off Windows and Word and instead emphasizing cloud services, big data and other pivotal technological trends.Best of all, Microsoft is once again a growth company. It had revenue of nearly $97 billion for fiscal 2017 and $110 billion for the year ending in June, a growth rate of 14%.SEE ALSO: 49 Companies Amazon Could Destroy (And 1 It Already Has)OracleGetty ImagesMarket value: $185.0 billionDividend yield: 1.6%Oracle (ORCL, $48.83) came into its own as the dominant provider of database management software in the 1990s, and has transformed itself since acquiring Sun Microsystems in 2010, most recently by becoming a cloud player.The tech company also became a dividend stock over the past decade, starting at 5 cents per share, quarterly, in 2009, then escalating that payout to 19 cents quarterly as of this year.Oracle's initial resistance to the cloud, followed by a late conversion, has left it with a lot of catching up to do. Founder and chairman Larry Ellison now says the company's future now hinges on its success in cloud applications and its autonomous cloud database.Oracle's acquisition strategy has also shifted from database applications to cloud services, such as Vocado, which works in financial aid, and Iridize, which helps bring people on to cloud applications. Over the last two years it also brought ZenEdge, a security provider, and Wercker, a middleware company, into its suite of services.Analysts were disappointed by Oracle's cloud revenue in the most recent quarter, but earnings of 59 cents per share were still three times greater than the dividend. Co-CEO Mark Hurd insists it can dramatically grow that revenue with applications. Oracle's dividend growth should buy the stock a little patience.QualcommGetty ImagesMarket value: $93.0 billionDividend yield: 3.9%Qualcomm (QCOM, $63.33) controls the technology in your mobile phone, and the dividend's yield of nearly 3.8% makes it seem like a bargain. But know the full story before you jump in.Qualcomm has been engaged in a multiyear battle with Apple over the patent royalties it demands from phone makers. Apple wanted a discount, given its size, and Qualcomm wants a 5% cut of all iPhone revenue. Now the two companies are engaged in court battle as Apple seeks new suppliers, including Intel. Until the case ends, Apple will not be paying royalties to Qualcomm, which has hit the latter hard. A QCOM lawyer recently said that Apple was $7 billion behind on patent royalties.So, why Qualcomm? Because QCOM is among the stocks that should shine with the arrival of 5G technology. The fifth-generation mobile network will offer far more capacity than what's currently available, as well as higher speeds, and will "redefine a broad range of industries with connected services," to put it in Qualcomm's words. And Qualcomm is one of the companies building the technology that will power this 5G revolution, giving it a realistic shot at a comeback bid.Moreover, QCOM boasts a solid balance sheet of nearly $36 billion in cash and short-term investments versus a little more than $15 billion in long-term debt. And despite its issues with Apple, Qualcomm still saw fit to boost its quarterly payout 9% earlier this year.SEE ALSO: 25 Dividend Stocks That Analysts Love the MostTexas InstrumentsGetty ImagesMarket value: $91.3 billionDividend yield: 3.2%Intel didn't invent the integrated circuit. Texas Instruments (TXN, $95.06) did, along with a company called Fairchild Semiconductor, from which Intel eventually emerged.TI, as it's called, decided to focus on digital signal processors (DSPs), which turn analog inputs, sound and pictures, into digital bit streams computers can process, in the 1980s. Today it may be best known as a leader in adding intelligence to ordinary objects, the so-called Internet of Things.Personal finance expert Matthew Ure, a vice president at Anthony Capital in San Antonio, says, "It is hard to imagine a world wherein Texas Instruments will not become more and more relevant."Texas Instruments also is an incredibly relevant dividend stock. The company's shares have gained more than 120% over the past five years, but in fact have been outpaced by the dividend, which has grown 157% to its current quarterly payout of 77 cents per share. Financial planner Joseph Inskeep says the company's "historic" dividend growth means TXN "should be on everyone's buy list."The company should have no problem affording that dividend going forward. Analysts predict 13% annual profit growth over the next five years.SEE ALSO: 15 Consumer Stocks That Deliver Dividend Growth Like ClockworkWestern DigitalGetty ImagesMarket value: $13.9 billionDividend yield: 4.2%Western Digital (WDC, $47.77) is a maker of hard drives, which are in the process of being replaced by increasingly cost-effective chip memory. How long the replacement process lasts, and how long Western Digital can prosper in that market and pay shareholders for their investments, is the question.Western Digital has tried to get ahead of market changes by packaging drives as "MyCloud" units, turning old PCs into virtual servers. It has also gotten into the chip memory business, buying SanDisk in 2016 and recently committing to invest $4.7 billion over three years to refresh its joint venture with Toshiba, which will keep the chips flowing.But most analysts following the stock still consider it a buy. They point to $2.3 billion in operating cash flow earned in the first six months of fiscal 2018, and over $3.4 billion in fiscal 2017, sustaining about $600 million in dividend payments. The company's third-quarter earnings declined year-over-year and missed expectations, but the resulting handful of analyst downgrades following that put most of the blame on an oversupply in NAND memory that could keep prices low.Western Digital itself remains a good dividend payer whose annual $2 dole is just more than a quarter of this year's expected profits. While that payout isn't rising, it is safe.SEE ALSO: Millionaires in America: All 50 States RankedEDITOR'S PICKS101 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2019 and Beyond25 Dividend Stocks That Analysts Love the MostBest Vanguard Funds for 401(k) Retirement SaversCopyright 2018-2019 The Kiplinger Washington EditorsReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextFoxconn says it remains committed to Wisconsin investment projectReutersAt $1 Trillion, Apple is Bigger Than These ThingsInvestopediaMarijuana Stocks: Let the Writedowns BeginMotley Fool2 Top Stocks You Can Buy on SaleMotley Fool2 Stocks You Can Buy and Hold ForeverMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo Finance5 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy in 2019Motley FoolWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadgetMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance內地熱門城市樓價回升星島日報57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolHere's What Hedge Funds Think About NIO Inc.

Everything else - PCs, the Internet, devices and clouds - grew out of this central idea.Intel, once a major growth play, has emerged as a solid dividend stock. It has more than doubled over the past decade to its current 30 cents per share.But INTC isn't exactly done growing, either. The company reported a monster earnings beat for its third quarter - $1.40 per share versus $1.15 per share expected - and topped expectations for Q4 guidance. Things were so good that it upgraded its full-year guidance, too. The growth no longer comes from PCs, but from newer streams such as supplying data centers.All this is happening despite the resignation of CEO Brian Krzanich in June and the fact that Intel has yet to hire a permanent replacement.SEE ALSO: The Kip ETF 20: The 20 Best Cheap ETFs You Can BuyMicrosoftGetty ImagesMarket value: $815.7 billionDividend yield: 1.7%Microsoft (MSFT, $106.26) was nicknamed "Mr. Softee" because of its dominance of PC software in the 1990s and 2000s. But under CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft could easily be called "Mr. Cloud" today, as its Azure cloud (and applications built on it) has become one of the most stable profit centers around.Microsoft pays out $1.84 per share in annual dividends - only good for a yield of 1.7%, but the payout has more than tripled since 2010. It costs Microsoft $13 billion annually to service that dividend at its current rate, which isn't a small thing. But MSFT can easily foot the bill; its net income in 2017 was more than $21 billion, nearly double what it was in 2015.Long-term debt of $76 billion could be paid off at a stroke with $133 billion in cash and long-term investments. Even its capital budget of over $10 billion is manageable.Again, this financial heft is made possible because Nadella shoved Microsoft into the modern era by taking the focus off Windows and Word and instead emphasizing cloud services, big data and other pivotal technological trends.Best of all, Microsoft is once again a growth company. It had revenue of nearly $97 billion for fiscal 2017 and $110 billion for the year ending in June, a growth rate of 14%.SEE ALSO: 49 Companies Amazon Could Destroy (And 1 It Already Has)OracleGetty ImagesMarket value: $185.0 billionDividend yield: 1.6%Oracle (ORCL, $48.83) came into its own as the dominant provider of database management software in the 1990s, and has transformed itself since acquiring Sun Microsystems in 2010, most recently by becoming a cloud player.The tech company also became a dividend stock over the past decade, starting at 5 cents per share, quarterly, in 2009, then escalating that payout to 19 cents quarterly as of this year.Oracle's initial resistance to the cloud, followed by a late conversion, has left it with a lot of catching up to do. Founder and chairman Larry Ellison now says the company's future now hinges on its success in cloud applications and its autonomous cloud database.Oracle's acquisition strategy has also shifted from database applications to cloud services, such as Vocado, which works in financial aid, and Iridize, which helps bring people on to cloud applications. Over the last two years it also brought ZenEdge, a security provider, and Wercker, a middleware company, into its suite of services.Analysts were disappointed by Oracle's cloud revenue in the most recent quarter, but earnings of 59 cents per share were still three times greater than the dividend. Co-CEO Mark Hurd insists it can dramatically grow that revenue with applications. Oracle's dividend growth should buy the stock a little patience.QualcommGetty ImagesMarket value: $93.0 billionDividend yield: 3.9%Qualcomm (QCOM, $63.33) controls the technology in your mobile phone, and the dividend's yield of nearly 3.8% makes it seem like a bargain. But know the full story before you jump in.Qualcomm has been engaged in a multiyear battle with Apple over the patent royalties it demands from phone makers. Apple wanted a discount, given its size, and Qualcomm wants a 5% cut of all iPhone revenue. Now the two companies are engaged in court battle as Apple seeks new suppliers, including Intel. Until the case ends, Apple will not be paying royalties to Qualcomm, which has hit the latter hard. A QCOM lawyer recently said that Apple was $7 billion behind on patent royalties.So, why Qualcomm? Because QCOM is among the stocks that should shine with the arrival of 5G technology. The fifth-generation mobile network will offer far more capacity than what's currently available, as well as higher speeds, and will "redefine a broad range of industries with connected services," to put it in Qualcomm's words. And Qualcomm is one of the companies building the technology that will power this 5G revolution, giving it a realistic shot at a comeback bid.Moreover, QCOM boasts a solid balance sheet of nearly $36 billion in cash and short-term investments versus a little more than $15 billion in long-term debt. And despite its issues with Apple, Qualcomm still saw fit to boost its quarterly payout 9% earlier this year.SEE ALSO: 25 Dividend Stocks That Analysts Love the MostTexas InstrumentsGetty ImagesMarket value: $91.3 billionDividend yield: 3.2%Intel didn't invent the integrated circuit. Texas Instruments (TXN, $95.06) did, along with a company called Fairchild Semiconductor, from which Intel eventually emerged.TI, as it's called, decided to focus on digital signal processors (DSPs), which turn analog inputs, sound and pictures, into digital bit streams computers can process, in the 1980s. Today it may be best known as a leader in adding intelligence to ordinary objects, the so-called Internet of Things.Personal finance expert Matthew Ure, a vice president at Anthony Capital in San Antonio, says, "It is hard to imagine a world wherein Texas Instruments will not become more and more relevant."Texas Instruments also is an incredibly relevant dividend stock. The company's shares have gained more than 120% over the past five years, but in fact have been outpaced by the dividend, which has grown 157% to its current quarterly payout of 77 cents per share. Financial planner Joseph Inskeep says the company's "historic" dividend growth means TXN "should be on everyone's buy list."The company should have no problem affording that dividend going forward. Analysts predict 13% annual profit growth over the next five years.SEE ALSO: 15 Consumer Stocks That Deliver Dividend Growth Like ClockworkWestern DigitalGetty ImagesMarket value: $13.9 billionDividend yield: 4.2%Western Digital (WDC, $47.77) is a maker of hard drives, which are in the process of being replaced by increasingly cost-effective chip memory. How long the replacement process lasts, and how long Western Digital can prosper in that market and pay shareholders for their investments, is the question.Western Digital has tried to get ahead of market changes by packaging drives as "MyCloud" units, turning old PCs into virtual servers. It has also gotten into the chip memory business, buying SanDisk in 2016 and recently committing to invest $4.7 billion over three years to refresh its joint venture with Toshiba, which will keep the chips flowing.But most analysts following the stock still consider it a buy. They point to $2.3 billion in operating cash flow earned in the first six months of fiscal 2018, and over $3.4 billion in fiscal 2017, sustaining about $600 million in dividend payments. The company's third-quarter earnings declined year-over-year and missed expectations, but the resulting handful of analyst downgrades following that put most of the blame on an oversupply in NAND memory that could keep prices low.Western Digital itself remains a good dividend payer whose annual $2 dole is just more than a quarter of this year's expected profits. While that payout isn't rising, it is safe.SEE ALSO: Millionaires in America: All 50 States RankedEDITOR'S PICKS101 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2019 and Beyond25 Dividend Stocks That Analysts Love the MostBest Vanguard Funds for 401(k) Retirement SaversCopyright 2018-2019 The Kiplinger Washington EditorsReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextFoxconn says it remains committed to Wisconsin investment projectReutersAt $1 Trillion, Apple is Bigger Than These ThingsInvestopediaMarijuana Stocks: Let the Writedowns BeginMotley Fool2 Top Stocks You Can Buy on SaleMotley Fool2 Stocks You Can Buy and Hold ForeverMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo Finance5 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy in 2019Motley FoolWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadgetMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance內地熱門城市樓價回升星島日報57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolHere's What Hedge Funds Think About NIO Inc.

Besides, as volatile and unpredictable as the sector can be, technology still is technology - it remains the best growth opportunity that investors will find for the indefinite future.With that as the backdrop, here are a dozen of the best tech stocks to buy for 2019. These companies all should perform better in the new year than they did in 2018. And in a few cases, a solid dividend and strong track record of payout increases bolsters the bullish case.SEE ALSO: 19 Best Stocks to Buy for 2019 (And 5 to Sell)NvidiaGetty ImagesMarket value: $70.4 billionDividend yield: 0.5%Nvidia (NVDA, $115.40) has taken investors on a roughly three-year roller coaster ride. After gaining nearly 800% between the beginning of 2016 and the high hit in October 2018, NVDA shares have been cut nearly in half.The meltdown of the cryptocurrency market was a contributing factor, sure. But investors likely also realized the stock had gotten more than a little ahead of the company's profits.That said, the selloff from the early October peak is just as overdone as the preceding runup was. That translates into opportunity.The average investor largely misunderstands Nvidia's product mix, and therefore its revenue mix. As frenzied as crypto-mania was at its pinnacle, it was never a breadwinner for the organization. For example, during the first quarter of 2018 - shortly after Bitcoin prices reached record highs - Nvidia sold only $289 million worth of graphics processors to crypto-miners. That was less than a tenth of Nvidia's revenue for the quarter, when sales of GPUs to miners were apt to be their strongest.Most of Nvidia's business comes from video gamers looking to upgrade their experiences; they accounted for more than half of the company's third-quarter top line. Its next-best market is datacenters, which includes artificial intelligence applications; that makes up about one-fourth of Nvidia's business. Those two markets aren't going to fade away like cryptocurrency mining did, and both are much bigger.SEE ALSO: 101 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2019 and BeyondWorkdayMarket value: $35.1 billionDividend yield: N/AWorkday (WDAY, $159.56) is anything but a household name, though odds are good that at least one person in most U.S. households is impacted by Workday. The software company has developed cloud-based apps for a variety of human resources and financial industry needs.The organization isn't yet profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, but it does operate in the black. More important, it's growing its top and non-GAAP bottom lines at an impressive clip. Revenue is on pace to improve more than 30% in the current fiscal year, and Wall Street analysts expect 25% sales growth next year. Per-share operating profits, which rolled in at $1.03 last year, are projected to reach $1.27 this year and rise to $1.61 in the coming fiscal year. That's also a reasonably dependable outcome; you can't say that of all technology companies.Story continuesThe key to Workday's consistency is how its software is sold. Its customers subscribe to its cloud-based platform rather than make a one-time purchase of it. This drives reliable recurring revenue, and Workday's customers love the financially flexible arrangement.The previous quarter's subscription revenue of $324 million was nearly a 35% year-over-year improvement, and the subscription revenue backlog now stands at a whopping $5.9 billion. That's 31% better than where it was at this time a year ago.SEE ALSO: 10 Best Value Stocks to Buy NowMicrosoftGetty ImagesMarket value: $770.6 billionDividend yield: 1.8%Workday is hardly the only outfit getting on the recurring revenue bandwagon. Even prolific names such as Microsoft (MSFT, $100.39) are now hyper-focused on selling cloud-based access to applications such as its Office productivity suite and Azure cloud-management platform.And the iconic company has only scratched the surface of the cloud opportunity ahead.Joel Kulina, Wedbush Securities Senior Vice President of Tech, Media and Telecom, says he's "bullish into 2019 as Azure's cloud momentum is still in its early days of playing out with the company's massive installed base." The analyst also feels that Office 365, the cloud-based version of Office, will experience growth tailwinds for the next 12 to 18 months at least. Kulina adds that Microsoft's "unparalleled enterprise customer base" leaves the organization "very well positioned to the transformational cloud trend set to play out over the coming years" in what he refers to as a "cloud arms race."His only concern is a faster-than-expected deceleration in Azure's revenue for fiscal 2019. But this tech stock's lethargy seen during the final quarter of calendar 2018 may have been the market's adjustment for that information.SEE ALSO: 20 Top Stock Picks the Analysts Love for 2019RokuCourtesy Intel Free Press via Wikimedia CommonsMarket value: $3.3 billionDividend yield: N/AMost newly public stocks hand out lots of volatility, and Roku (ROKU, $30.16) has been no exception since its September 2017 IPO. While the big swings have been more up than down, they've nonetheless made some shareholders nauseous and frightened other investors away altogether.The dust is starting to settle, however. And while Roku hasn't yet reached its full potential, it appears to be on its way.Roku is the name behind the popular internet-television tuner of the same name. It stood up against titans such as Apple, Google and Amazon, and beat them all to become the market-share leader within the standalone digital TV-tuner market.That's not the key to its future, however, nor its projected swing to a 2020 profit. Roku has figured out there's also money to be made in licensing its name to television manufacturers who want to build the company's technology into TV sets. Roku also has embraced the idea of selling ads on the main screens seen by users as they navigate their device's menu. This so-called "platform revenue" increased by 74% year-over-year in the company's most recently reported quarter, which, as impressive as the growth rate was, still fell short of analyst estimates.The relative disappointment was the basis for much of Roku's recent weakness. But the formulation of more reasonable expectations in 2019 should make Roku one of the best tech stocks to buy for 2019.SEE ALSO: The 9 Best Stocks of America's Last Bear MarketQualcommGetty ImagesMarket value: $68.9 billionDividend yield: 4.4%As incredible is it may sound, shares of Qualcomm (QCOM, $56.81) haven't made any net progress since mid-2012. Between ongoing legal battles with Apple and revenue that's been waning since 2014, shareholders have simply had little to celebrate.But 2019 could be a turnaround year for this telecom technology maker.Wireless service Verizon will roll out its first 5G service in early 2019, and Samsung will make the industry's first smartphones capable of using this ultra-high-speed connectivity, which is up to 20 times as fast as 4G connections in use now. That device's 5G modem will be made by none other than Qualcomm.Qualcomm has more growth opportunities than 5G modems, however. The company's newest microprocessor, the Snapdragon 855, has been designed from the ground up to make the most of the massive amounts of data 5G connections will be able to handle. The Snapdragon 855 will offer up to three times as much artificial intelligence power as anything available now, and is expected to handle augmented reality and other data-intensive applications with ease. This catalyst might just shake QCOM shares out of their multiyear rut.SEE ALSO: The 25 Best Blue-Chip Stocks for 2019 (According to Hedge Funds)SplunkGetty ImagesMarket value: $15.2 billionDividend yield: N/AThe term "big data" didn't really seem to be in existence until 2005, when O'Reilly Media's Roger Mougalas is credited with its first use. Corporations have been looking for ways to gather massive amounts of data for decades, of course, but it has only been a relatively efficient endeavor since the 1990s, when personal computers became a common business that could manage all that information.But even if an organization has lots of data, that doesn't mean that organization can do something constructive with it. Tools that turn data into actionable information has only recently become an industry in and of itself.Cornelio Ash, Equity Analyst with William O'Neil + Co., believes a company called Splunk (SPLK, $102.79) is one of the best picks within the business."Splunk is a primary beneficiary of the artificial intelligence tailwind, which is impacting and changing virtually every industry," Ash says. "Over the next two years SPLK's revenue and (earnings per share) is expected to increase at a compound average growth rate of 25% and 53%, respectively."The analyst highlights the fact that Splunk is widening its market to serve not just artificial intelligence outfits, but to meet the needs of cybersecurity, Internet of Things and IT operations organizations.SEE ALSO: 19 Best Retirement Stocks to Buy in 2019FireEyeGetty ImagesMarket value: $3.2 billionDividend yield: N/AJust when it looks like computer hacking and cyber-sabotage are under control, another bigger and more damaging data breach surfaces. The problem is never going to go away. Indeed, Gartner estimates that information-security spending will grow 9% in 2019, to $124 billion.Enter FireEye (FEYE, $16.09).FireEye is a relatively young company, founded in 2004 - a time during which cyberthreats were starting to become an inevitable, permanent part of the future. The company didn't go public until 2013, however, and though investors' hopes were high at the time, FireEye wasn't quite the performer early shareholders expected. The cybersecurity outfit spent heavily on acquisitions, leading to increasingly large losses. The stock currently is well below its post-IPO peak.FEYE stock still is trending higher from its early 2017 low, however, as its revenue grows and its losses start to shrink, with profits finally in sight. The company will see its first full-year operating profit with 2018's results, and should be GAAP-profitable sometime around 2021 or 2022.The turning point was the launch of a cloud-based product called Helix, which offers customers subscription-based access to a suite of cybersecurity tools. Morningstar analyst Mark Cash writes, "As FireEye embraces a subscription-based business model, we expect the product subscription business to grow the fastest, more than offsetting long-term declines in the legacy products and support and maintenance divisions. We believe this shift, coupled with new product launches, will allow for material top-line and margin expansion."SEE ALSO: 10 Potential Investing Land Mines to Avoid in 2019TwitterGetty ImagesMarket value: $21.6 billionDividend yield: N/AIt only has a fraction of the size and reach of competing social media site Facebook, and is not nearly as exciting as newcomer Snap (SNAP). But in some regards, being a bit smaller and more off-the-radar than its rivals has quietly let Twitter (TWTR, $28.43) finds its groove and become the growth machine it should have become long ago.Better late than never.Twitter isn't bulletproof, to be clear. One valid criticism is its waning headcount. "The knock on Twitter is that the daily average user growth has been slowing for the last few quarters," says Strategic Wealth Partners president and founder Mark Tepper. He counters, however, by pointing out "that they're really focused on shutting down fake accounts, so I think a number like that is really important for Facebook where people might only log in once a day, but with Twitter it's more about the user engagement."Proof of better user engagement is in the numbers. While the number of active monthly users actually fell by 9 million during Q3, its third-quarter top line was up 29% year-over-year. More of the same is projected for 2019.More important, Twitter has already proven it can turn a profit doing what it's now doing. By providing specific reasons for users to plug into the microblogging platform and giving them specific topics to discuss, the organization has booked a little more than $1 billion worth of net income over the past four quarters.SEE ALSO: The 27 Best Mutual Funds in 401(k) Retirement PlansKeysight TechnologiesGetty ImagesMarket value: $11.3 billionDividend yield: N/AAlthough Verizon (VZ) will be the first wireless telecom name to commercialize 5G connectivity, and Samsung - with the help of Qualcomm - will be the first manufacturer to mainstream 5G smartphones, those organizations wouldn't be able to do what they're about to do had a relatively small company called Keysight Technologies (KEYS, $60.13) not helped pave the way.Keysight makes and markets technological testing equipment. Specifically, it offers solutions for network security developers, connected car designers, cloud-computing solutions providers and more. Most recently it has been leaned on to provide 5G engineers with testing equipment that ensures all the complexity of 5G connections is properly addressed. In fact, both Qualcomm and Samsung have acknowledged they relied on Keysight Technologies in helping make 5G a reality. The company's 5G toolset was even the first to be approved for 5G device-certification purposes. In other words, its wares will serve as the yardstick used to test other 5G technologies.The advent of 5G has already proven to be a boon for Keysight, though the best may be yet to come. Moderate but reliable sales growth is expected to drive per-share profits of $3.78 for all of 2018, up from 2017's $3.24, then lead to income of $4.25 per share in 2019. That's 12% earnings growth for a stock priced at less than 15 times 2019's projected earnings, and from a company that has gotten in the habit of topping earnings estimates.SEE ALSO: 10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy for 2019 and BeyondCisco SystemsGetty ImagesMarket value: $192.3 billionDividend yield: 3.1%In the late 1990s, when the internet was new and changing the way the world worked, Cisco Systems (CSCO, $42.77) was unstoppable. Organizations and even individuals were thrilled with the advantages of networked computers, and Cisco was the go-to name for routers and switches. Few could compete with the king of the networking world.Much has changed in the meantime. Namely, newcomers like Juniper Networks (JNPR), Arista Networks (ANET) and Aruba are supplying real competition, while more established names such as HP (HPQ) and Dell have quietly tiptoed onto some of Cisco's turf.The pros aren't exactly stoked. Nomura recently downgraded CSCO from a "Buy" to "Neutral," suggesting the stock already is overvalued at a time IT spending may well slow down.Cisco has a couple of aces up its sleeve, however, that the pros and amateurs alike are underestimating. One of them is the company's $42.6 billion worth of cash and near-cash assets - versus a market cap of $206 billion - which allows the organization lots of flexibility. What Cisco can't develop to be competitive, it can acquire.The other matter working in Cisco's favor is the relatively recent realization that recurring revenue is the ticket to thriving in the future. Subscription revenue now makes up roughly a third of the company's sales, and a little more than half of its software revenue. That figure is growing, and has plenty more room to grow while Cisco gears up for the coming explosion of 5G.SEE ALSO: The Best Vanguard Funds for 401(k) Retirement SaversSalesforce.comCourtesy Salesforce.comMarket value: $103.0 billionDividend yield: N/ASalesforce.com (CRM, $134.68) won't win any value awards based on backwards-looking or forward-looking results. The stock is priced at nearly 50 times 2019's expected earnings - a hefty cost. But Wedbush Securities' Joel Kulina believes Salesforce.com is "well-positioned to benefit from the continuing secular shift to the cloud" and a worldwide "increased focus on digital transformation."Salesforce provides a suite of cloud-based customer relationship management tools. Although the barriers to entry within the market are low, CRM is able to leverage its well-established name, and enjoys a wide lead on those would-be competitors.Its edge lies in its ability to remain at the forefront of new applications of new technologies. For instance, the company has designed a way to use data created by IoT platforms by automating its delivery to employees that may be working in the field rather than at a centralized data hub. And what it can't develop, it can buy. It acquired MuleSoft in March, giving the company the ability to meld older and newer databases that would otherwise be tough to merge.Kulina adds that with a potential market size in excess of more than $200 billion, Salesforce.com as a "long runway ahead" that could extend well beyond 2019.SEE ALSO: 10 Stocks Warren Buffett Is Buying (And 6 He's Selling)AdobeGetty ImagesMarket value: $108.9 billionDividend yield: N/AContrary to what many investors might believe, Adobe (ADBE, $223.13) is so much more than PDFs and Photoshop. The software giant has built an entire suite of business-building applications, and organizations are falling in love with them.It's called Experience Cloud, and it can do just about anything a company needs to do with digital data. From advertising to customer profiling to content management, Adobe's Experience Cloud empowers its users to do things with data, online and offline, that were inconceivable just a few years ago. The company's Creative Cloud gives users online access to tools such as Photoshop, Illustrator and more. Subscribers enjoy that software updates are automatically applied, fuss-free.Arguably the most compelling aspect of these cloud-based platforms is, however, the recurring revenue they generate. As of the end of the third quarter, Adobe was producing annualized subscription-based revenue of $6.83 billion, and the company is looking for steady growth of that figure. For perspective, the company's trailing 12-month revenue totals $9.06 billion.The stock plunged following its recent fourth-quarter earnings miss, for the record. Profit projections of $1.88 per share were better than the $1.83 the company managed to produce. But with revenue of $2.46 billion topping estimates of $2.43 billion and a revenue outlook of $11.1 billion for the coming year thanks to the impending purchase of B2B marketing outfit Marketo, that post-earnings weakness may be a buying opportunity.James Brumley was long CSCO and FEYE as of this writing.SEE ALSO: Best Online Brokers, 2018EDITOR'S PICKS19 Best Stocks to Buy for 2019 (And 5 to Sell)7 Low-Volatility ETFs for This Roller-Coaster MarketThe 25 Best Low-Fee Mutual Funds You Can BuyCopyright 2018-2019 The Kiplinger Washington EditorsReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextMarijuana Stocks: Let the Writedowns BeginMotley Fool2 Stocks You Can Buy and Hold ForeverMotley Fool2 Top Stocks You Can Buy on SaleMotley FoolInterested In Walliser Kantonalbank (VTX:WKBN)'s Upcoming CHF3.35 Dividend?

Buying Mojang (makers of Minecraft) makes a ton of sense for Microsoft, despite the possibly inflated price tag. It might end up being one of the smartest and boldest moves Microsoft has ever made.Read more: A Parent’s Guide to Minecraft: 5 Reasons to Stop Worrying and Learn to Love the CubesAll of the following comes with the standard caveat: As Long As Microsoft Doesn’t Screw It Up (ALAMDSIU). But here are a dozen reasons why this is a really smart move:1. Microsoft desperately needs younger users.Few self-respecting adults boast about how awesome their Windows phones are. (Though they actually are kind of awesome.) But kids are fickle and will switch brands in a heartbeat. Like Princess Leia and Obi-Wan Kenobi, the youth market is Windows Phone's only hope.Princess Leia GIFMoreThe smartest thing Microsoft has ever done is make Xbox part of Windows Phone so it would be more appealing to the youth market. (Second smartest thing? Retiring Microsoft Bob.)Sony is trying desperately to copy that with its latest Xperia Z3. Good luck with that, guys.2. Windows Phone has an apps problem.The dumbest thing Microsoft has done: Failing to build compelling apps that would give iPhone fanboys and Android phandroids a reason to consider Windows Phone. “Hey, we have Instagram, too” isn’t gonna cut it. Guess what extremely popular game isn’t on the Windows Phone — yet? We expect that to change in a hurry.3. Minecraft is everywhere (except Windows Phone).Buying Minecraft instantly puts a high-profile Microsoft property on the Sony PlayStation,  Wii,  Mac, and iOS devices. That’s assuming a) the other platforms continue to support Minecraft (most likely) and b) Microsoft doesn’t try to make future versions exclusive to Windows platforms (see ALAMDSIU).Minecraft pirate shipMoreStory continuesMinecraft pirate ship — avast, ye mateys. (JimmyJett/Flickr)4. Minecraft is massively popular. The $7 Pocket Edition is currently the second most popular paid app in the iTunes Store. Overall, Minecraft has clocked more than 50 million downloads in total, including the PC/Mac versions (15 million), Xbox (12 million), and Pocket (21 million). Microsoft, for its part, says the number exceeds 100 million on the PC alone. Whatever. It’s a crapload of fans.5. Minecraft is a rite of passage that never ends. Don’t believe me? Ask an 8-year-old. It’s like The Little Mermaid for gamers, only many of them keep playing long after they’ve outgrown Ariel. There are also Minecraft servers that cater exclusively to adults.6. Minecraft’s fans are insanely passionate. Minecraft’s user base approaches Apple’s for scary, rabid passion. No other Microsoft property, even the Xbox, generates that kind of loyalty. And when kids aren’t playing Minecraft, they’re watching videos of other kids playing Minecraft.7. Minecraft is more of a lifestyle than a game. Unlike with Angry Birds, Draw Something, or other flavor-of-the-month games, Minecraft users make a serious investment of time, building more and more sophisticated landscapes. This is not something they drop after three or six months; it’s a commitment.Minecraft castleMoreAn ancient Babylonian castle rendered in Minecraft. (swiftsampson/Imgur)8. Schools love Minecraft. Apple thoroughly kicked Microsoft’s heinie in the education market by offering schools deep discounts starting in the ’80s. Now Google is going after that market aggressively with Google Apps and Chromebooks. Teachers who “get” Minecraft are over the moon about it. It finally gives Microsoft a chance to get its Keds inside the classroom door.9. Parents also love Minecraft. Once they understand that Minecraft is more about building cool stuff than blowing things up, many parents don’t mind when their kids spend all night on it. Some have set up Minecraft servers for their kids so they can control whom their kids interact with during the game. When’s the last time you heard a parent say they love it when their kids play Halo or Call of Duty?10. Microsoft doesn’t need to turn a profit on Minecraft to be successful. The company has sold more than 100 million Xboxes and has yet to make a dime on any of them. (The same is true for Sony and its PlayStation, FYI.) They do make coin on the games, though. And the company projects that Minecraft will start to break even in 2015. Tweet from Markus “Notch” PerssonMoreMinecraft creator Markus “Notch” Persson said “Show me the money” — and Microsoft did. (Twitter)11. Microsoft has buckets of money to lose. Microsoft currently has about $85 billion in cash reserves, or enough to buy another 34 Minecrafts (or 40 copies of the L.A. Clippers). Even if it’s never a money maker, it’s worth it as an investment in mindshare (not to mention Mineshare).12. Two words: LEGO + Minecraft. The LEGO Minecraft co-build project combines the real and virtual worlds of blocky creativity. Who wouldn’t want a piece of that awesomeness?Editor's note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified Microsoft's mobile platform as Windows Mobile, not Windows Phone.

2 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks That Pay a DividendYahooSearchNo matching results for ''Tip: Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsGive feedback on the new search experienceCancelSign inMailFinanceWatchlistsMy PortfolioScreenersMarketsIndustriesVideosNewsPersonal FinanceTechU.S. Markets closedS&P 5002,905.03+4.58(+0.16%)Dow 3026,559.54+110.00(+0.42%)Nasdaq7,998.06+1.98(+0.02%)Russell 20001,565.75-1.85(-0.12%)Crude Oil64.000.00(0.00%)Gold1,277.90+1.90(+0.15%)Silver14.97+0.01(+0.07%)EUR/USD1.12470.0000(-0.0000%)2 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks That Pay a DividendHarsh Chauhan, The Motley FoolMotley FoolJanuary 8, 2019ReblogShareTweetShareArtificial intelligence (AI) couldn't save the tech sector from taking a hit in 2018. Popular AI stocks such as NVIDIA, Alphabet, and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) struggled, but investors shouldn't forget that AI is an emerging opportunity. AI-related revenue is predicted to jump from an estimated $7.35 billion in 2018 to nearly $90 billion in 2025 thanks to the growth of self-driving cars, smart devices, and other verticals.AI stocks that pay a dividend will reward investors with regular payouts while investors wait for the AI opportunity to gain traction. Intel and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) are two dividend-paying AI stocks that investors might want to consider.A businessman holds a tablet projecting a circuit map in the shape of a brainMoreImage source: Getty Images.Intel's big chip opportunityIntel's forward dividend yield of nearly 2.60%, a conservative payout ratio of 36%, and a long dividend payment history make it one of the best dividend stocks in the tech sector. The company has been paying a regular dividend for more than 25 years, and it has consistently increased year after year.Looking ahead, Intel's foray into AI should act as a catalyst for dividend growth. The company sold $1 billion worth of AI chips last year, and is confident of generating $10 billion in AI chip sales by 2022. That shouldn't be a big deal for Chipzilla, as it pegs its AI-related total available market (TAM) in 2022 at $200 billion.So Intel needs to corner just 5% of the TAM to realize its ambition. That doesn't look like a big deal, given its strategy of going after lucrative AI-centric markets such as data centers and self-driving cars.For instance, Intel has made solid advances in the self-driving car space since the Mobileye acquisition. The company is already supplying chips to Alphabet's self-driving subsidiary, Waymo, which is great news as Waymo has begun commercializing its autonomous ride-sharing service in the U.S. What's more, Intel plans to launch a commercial self-driving taxi service in Israel this year, in association with Volkswagen.Intel will retrofit its self-driving solutions into existing Volkswagen cars to deliver Level 4 or 5 autonomy. Success on this front would encourage Intel to equip carmakers across the globe with its self-driving solutions, so they can attack lucrative markets such as self-driving taxis. That's a big AI-driven opportunity for Intel, as the demand for autonomous taxis is expected to go through the roof.TechNavio predicts that the global self-driving taxi market will clock a compound annual growth rate of 167% through 2022, paving the way for Intel to sell more autonomous-driving chips and solutions.An additional $10 billion in AI-related chip revenue by 2022 would increase Intel's top line by a percentage in the mid-teens, given its trailing-12-month revenue of $69 billion. That would eventually help the company boost its bottom line and increase its dividend.In the end, Intel is a solid bet for investors looking for a mix of AI-driven growth, dividend, and value -- it trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 10.Microsoft's cloud playMicrosoft is looking to make AI more accessible through cloud computing. That's a smart thing to do, as AI in the cloud is expected to grow at an annual pace of 50% through 2025, rising from a 1% share of the global cloud computing space (as per the Asia Cloud Computing Association) to 10%.Story continuesThe good news: Microsoft is making the most of this lucrative opportunity through its Azure cloud service. The company's Azure cloud revenue shot up 76% in the last reported quarter, pushing the company's overall commercial cloud business up by 47% to $8.5 billion.Looking ahead, Microsoft's cloud business should gain more traction, as the company is packing more AI-related tools into Azure. The software giant recently added a machine learning service to the Azure cloud that can be used by enterprises to simplify AI deployments, allowing them to reduce the time taken to get AI models functioning. Microsoft customers are already using Azure Machine Learning Service to improve assurance (an agreement in which an insurer covers a certain event, such as death) and predict energy demand.Microsoft's cloud infrastructure is also being tapped by companies developing self-driving cars. This is another big opening for the chipmaker, as the number of cars connecting to the internet will continue to grow.What's more, Azure is driving Microsoft's profitability, pushing up the margin of its commercial cloud business by 4 percentage points last quarter. With the acceleration of its cloud computing business, Microsoft's bottom-line growth should accelerate. That's probably why analysts expect the company to clock stronger earnings growth, which will help it boost the dividend.Microsoft carries a decent forward dividend yield of 1.82%, though its payout ratio is high at nearly 70%. But then, the company has increased its dividend for 14 consecutive years, and it should be able to sustain this growth thanks to the catalysts discussed above.Investors should not forget that AI tech is still young, and it will eventually disrupt our lives in a positive way. That's why betting on the likes of Microsoft and Intel, two companies that have already made a lot of headway in this space and that also pay a dividend, looks like a smart move.

The average fell almost 1,400 points, or nearly 6%.Yet even though the Dow lost ground for the first time in a long while, some of its components posted solid gains. Below, we'll take a look at Merck (NYSE: MRK), Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) to see why they were the best stocks in the Dow in 2018.MRK ChartMoreMRK data by YCharts.Good times for healthcareMerck's and Pfizer's big gains show that healthcare was a key sector for the stock market during 2018. Even though the returns from the two pharmaceutical giants weren't enough to keep the Dow from losing ground for the year, their gains of 36% and 21%, respectively, played their part in minimizing the average's overall losses.For Merck, the big success lately has been Keytruda, a cancer drug that has demonstrated an ability to reduce risks of death when combined with chemotherapy treatments. Sales of the drug doubled during the first three quarters of 2018, and some analysts believe that Keytruda's annual revenue could clear the $10 billion mark within the next few years. Even with potential competition, Merck is optimistic that the drug's future is bright. Moreover, with other key treatments like its Januvia type 2 diabetes drug still generating plenty of sales, Merck has the cash flow to sustain a dividend yielding nearly 3% while also growing its business organically.Person looking at a pill held in a glove, with dozens of other pills on a glass table.MoreImage source: Getty Images.Meanwhile, Pfizer has seen gains stemming largely from decisions to restructure itself internally. The drug giant said in July that it expects to create three business segments, one for innovative medicines, one for established medicines, and the last for consumer healthcare products. Moreover, with Pfizer deciding within the last couple of weeks to work with rival GlaxoSmithKline to combine their consumer healthcare units into a single joint venture, it's possible that shareholders will receive shares of that business in a spinoff transaction. That would make Pfizer's stock a purer play on pharmaceuticals, which has been the higher-growth business for quite a while. A 3.4% dividend yield has also been a positive for Pfizer, especially among defensive investors looking for income to offset the risks of capital losses from their investments.Story continuesMicrosoft keeps moving higherMicrosoft comes in third in this year's list of Dow stocks, but what's particularly impressive about the software giant's appearance on the list is that it also did extremely well in 2017, rising 38%. That puts this year's 19% gain into a different perspective, and the extent to which the stock has held onto its positive returns despite recent market turbulence is encouraging for shareholders.Moreover, Microsoft has been vying for the leadership position in terms of overall market capitalization, upending some of its tech rivals in the process and finishing the year in the top spot for the first time since 2002. The way it's achieved those heights is by reinventing itself as a subscription-based software provider, offering key platforms like its Office productivity software suite to users on a monthly basis rather than solely selling one-time licenses that required users to upgrade at later dates in order to get updated features. Millions of customers have decided that having the latest access to the newest software features is worth what turns out to be higher costs than simply buying a one-time license and hanging onto the software for a long time, and that's sent Microsoft profits soaring. Moreover, by offering key software to users of operating systems other than Windows -- especially iOS -- Microsoft has tapped into a much larger customer base and reaped the rewards accordingly.What's ahead for the Dow in 2019?Among these three stocks, Microsoft has the greatest potential for fast future growth in 2019. Even as some positive trends in the technology industry start to slow down and reverse course, Microsoft has the benefit of providing needed services to enterprise customers and individual consumers. Efforts to move into high-growth areas like cloud computing have also borne fruit and should continue to gain importance for the company.For Merck and Pfizer, a lot depends on regulatory threats that could have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. Many defensive investors turn to healthcare as a stalwart industry during economically troubled times, but these two stocks could give up ground if they can't find new and innovative treatments to keep their pipelines full of candidates likely to become tomorrow's blockbusters.Investors want the Dow to rebound in 2019, and these stocks have a role to play. If the market bounces back, it might well be because these leaders continue to move higher over the next year.

Friday’s 3.43% gain from the S&P 500 was a tough act to follow, but Monday’s 0.7% advance was respectable in its own right.Even more impressive is that the market was able to do it without the help of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and without much help from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). The consumer-tech giant’s shares balked again as investors continue to wonder if the company’s glory days are behind it. Meanwhile, Facebook shares essentially broke even, with traders unable to shrug off doubts about a bright future for the social networking giant.The heavy lifting was done by, amazingly enough, General Electric (NYSE:GE). GE shares gained another 6.3% on the heels of news that it may be close to selling its aircraft-leasing business. Investors are also increasingly believing that Larry Culp may be just the CEO the company needs to dig itself out of trouble.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe proverbial dust is settling, with most stocks starting to do their own thing rather than fall in line with the market’s wild moves. To that end, stock charts of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) and Intercontinental Exchange (NYSE:ICE) are of the most interest after Monday’s action sets up the beginning of Tuesday’s trading.Medtronic (MDT)3 Big Stock Charts for Tuesday: Microsoft (MSFT), Medtronic (MDT) and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)MoreLast week, Medtronic was named something of a problem child, having slipped back under its critical 200-day moving average line for a second time in just a few weeks after several bearish crosses of moving average lines were put on the books. Though it wasn’t a straight-line move, Monday’s 6.5% setback is the end result of that red flag.  9 A-Rated Safety Stocks for a Grossly Oversold Market  The good news is, the sheer strength of the selling may have set up a nice rebound move. Click to Enlarge • Though a rough ride, Monday’s meltdown took shape on huge volume. This high-volume flushout is often seen at major bottoms.• The good news is, the steep dive was so large and rapid, it took the weekly chart into an oversold condition. It also dragged MDT shares within striking distance of a major support line that has tagged the major lows going back to early 2017.• Though ripe for a rebound, this is a setup that requires a couple of bullish days to confirm the bulls are willing to buy (in earnest) on this dip.Microsoft (MSFT)3 Big Stock Charts for Tuesday: Microsoft (MSFT), Medtronic (MDT) and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)MoreJust because a stock didn’t keep up with the broad market’s rally on one particular day doesn’t necessarily mean that stock is doomed. But, when that stock is a well-loved Microsoft, it certainly raises concerns.Bolstering those concerns is the hesitation buyers demonstrated when the stock approached a couple of crucial moving average lines.Story continues Click to Enlarge• Yes, MSFT shares are fighting to bounce back from late-December lows, as most stocks are. But, Monday’s brush of the blue 20-day moving average line as well as the near-brush of the white 200-day moving average line sent the stock to end the day nearer its low than its high.• Underscoring the bullish case is the fact that trading under the 200-day line is a big deal. Microsoft hasn’t been below that level since the middle of 2016.• Quietly, the biggest red flag of all is the fact that Friday’s and Monday’s volume was anemic. Traders aren’t firm believers.Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)3 Big Stock Charts for Tuesday: Microsoft (MSFT), Medtronic (MDT) and Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)MoreFinally, had Nasdaq (NASDAQ:NDAQ) not also fallen so much on the heels of news that Wall Street firms were planning to create a competitor to established exchanges, than the similar setback suffered by shares of Intercontinental Exchange — which owns the NYSE — would have been dismissible.

If you had invested $1,000 in Microsoft on the day of its March 13, 1986 initial public offering, settled in for the long haul, and reinvested your dividends, your stock would be worth roughly $1.5 million today.MSFT Total Return Price ChartMoreMSFT Total Return Price. Data source: YCharts.That's an incredible performance and one few companies will ever come close to replicating -- but three Motley Fool investors have identified stocks with the potential to go on runs that could be reminiscent of Microsoft's. Read on to see why they think that Albermarle (NYSE: ALB), Control4 (NASDAQ: CTRL), and iQiyi (NASDAQ: IQ) could be poised for huge growth. An arrow moving up and to the right as it traces increases in a bar graph.MoreImage source: Getty Images.Ride entertainment momentum in ChinaKeith Noonan (iQiyi): Like Microsoft was in 1986, iQiyi is fresh to the market as a publicly traded company. The streaming-video provider, which had its IPO at the end of March, has sometimes been called "the Netflix of China," though in truth its model is currently closer to Hulu's. The stock has been volatile in its first couple months, but I'm bullish on the long-term prospects.In some ways, iQiyi looks more mature as a company than Microsoft did roughly three decades ago. The streaming-video company operates in a market that has established models to success, generated roughly $2.7 billion in sales last year and counts more than 420 million people as viewers, and was spun off from Chinese search giant Baidu -- meaning it's pretty far removed from scrappy, upstart status. However, while the streaming video service industry is more well defined than the computer business was in 1986, I still think iQiyi has paths to explosive growth and thus I purchased shares shortly after the company's market debut. iQiyi is growing sales at a fast clip, with overall sales up 57% year over year in its March-ended quarter and added-service revenue up 67% compared to the prior-year period. That's plenty impressive, and I think that iQiyi can continue to better monetize and expand the reach of its services.Roughly 40% of China's population has yet to connect to the internet, suggesting that there's still a lot of potential for the company to grow its viewer base. iQiyi is also making progress on getting members on board with premium service offerings, and will likely see continued success on that front as the Chinese middle class undergoes rapid increases in size purchasing power. Story continuesI'm a fan of companies that deal in creating and delivering content, and as tech ramps up and consolidation continues to reshape industries, iQiyi looks to be a promising business at the intersection of trends that can deliver big growth. Grabbing market share in an expanding marketMaxx Chatsko (Albemarle): The world's top lithium producer got rocked when analysts at Morgan Stanley projected that by 2025 the global market would be grossly oversupplied. Albemarle responded with a record first quarter for its lithium segment -- and market projections of its own.For context, Morgan Stanley said the lithium market would be oversupplied by 2025 considering producers are expected to churn out 715,000 metric tons (MT) that year. To balance out the supply with demand, electric vehicles would need to hit an absurd 31% of all passenger vehicles sold that year, according to the investment bank. Albemarle countered by saying the total lithium market would be 800,000 MT by 2025, but that only 12.3% of passenger vehicles would need to wield even a moderate-sized battery to make the numbers work.The wide discrepancy in projections could demonstrate that few really know where the lithium market will be by the middle of the next decade. Or it could show that the world's largest lithium producer has more insight into the market from the customers it supplies than Wall Street analysts.Either way, Albemarle is ramping up its lithium output in two waves. After producing 65,000 MT in 2017, it wants to expand to 165,000 MT by 2021, then to 265,000 MT after that. That's rather impressive. Considering it accounted for 29% of the global market last year, producing 265,000 MT by 2025 would account for 33% of the global market, should it reach the company's projected volume. With selling prices high, sales volumes increasing, and a leading position in an important 21st century market, the astonishing growth could just be getting started for this stock.Profiting from smart homesDaniel Miller (Control4): If finding stocks about to go on the wild ride like Microsoft did over the past decades were that easy, we'd all be rich and retired by now. To find stocks similar to Microsoft, you'll have to look for stocks about to ride a long-term trend, and Control4 has a chance to do just that.For those unaware of the company, Control4 is a leading global provider of automation and networking systems for homes and businesses -- basically it sells systems to run a slew of smart home devices seamlessly. These systems can control up to hundreds of devices and can cost between $1,000 to $50,000, and even more, to install professionally.Currently, Control4 estimates its penetration in the U.S. to be 1.5%, but one upcoming strategy could help the company boost that number. Management unveiled certified showrooms in 140 locations worldwide. The showrooms are designed to usher homeowners and designers in the market for smart home solutions to the right products and install partner. The company believes the showrooms are "WOW-ing" homeowners with interactive storytelling, impressive displays, and hands-on demonstrations.Time will tell if the showrooms dramatically improve sales leads and revenue, but there's no doubt business is already good. During the first-quarter Control4 recorded 17% growth in revenue, compared to the prior year, with its adjusted net income up 53%. It has $77 million in cash and no debt on the balance sheet, and boasts six successful acquisitions. Business is good, and Control4 has the potential to ride a long-term smart home trend that could prove very lucrative for investors.

At the time, the company had just publicly released Windows 1.0, and the billionaire-making juggernaut we know today was nowhere in sight. But early investors could have cashed in some magnificent returns over the years: Microsoft shares have gained a staggering 93,500% so far, and would have returned 141,000% if you reinvested your dividends.Those extreme gains are in the rear view mirror now, but the next Microsoft is surely out there, somewhere. So we asked a handful of your fellow investors here at The Motley Fool to point us toward some less-known companies that could be similar giant winners over the long run.Read on to see why Canopy Growth Corp. (NASDAQOTH: TWMJF) (TSX: WEED), Universal Display (NASDAQ: OLED), and Square (NYSE: SQ) remind our panelists of Microsoft in its early days.A single beam of sunlight enters a dark cave, illuminating a treasure chest brimming with gold and jewelry.MoreImage source: Getty Images.Already one step ahead of RedmondAnders Bylund (Universal Display): In 1986, Microsoft had been around for more than a decade, but Windows was a brand-new product and the company's graphical user interface was playing catch-up to Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) Macintosh. The glory days of game-changing success still lay far ahead, and annual sales came up just short of $200 million.I would argue that Universal Display is better positioned today than Microsoft was then.The display technology researcher was founded way back in 1994, entered the stock market in 1996, and reports annual sales of $294 million today. Universal Display is a solidly profitable cash-generator, and has established long-term contracts with every high-definition screen maker that matters. You can find its patented organic light-emitting diode technology in every major brand of smartphone, including best-sellers like the iPhone X and the Samsung (NASDAQOTH: SSNLF) Galaxy S8.Its next major growth market lies in big-screen television sets, where street prices are coming down to mainstream levels in a hurry. After that, OLED elements should start making their way into everyday lighting equipment as manufacturing capacities ramp up and product costs come crashing down.Come back in 30 years, and we expect you'll see that Universal Display invested the windfalls from those early successes into next-generation technologies. No longer a small fish in the huge technology market, you'll be looking at a familiar name whose products are found in every household, every business, every public space.There are no guarantees of course, but Universal Display is poised to follow right in Microsoft's storied footsteps. It's just that the target market looks a little bit different.Get your portfolio higherJeremy Bowman (Canopy Growth Corp.): In 1986, Microsoft had just IPO'ed, and the world was on the cusp of the personal computing revolution. Thanks to some clever maneuvering and a partnership with IBM, MS-DOS had become the leading operating system at the time, and Microsoft would parlay its advantage into a PC empire that included the Windows operating system and its suite of office software. Today, one industry that reminds me of PC's in the 1980s is marijuana. Though it's not a tech product, legal marijuana has the potential to revolutionize broad swaths of American society and culture the way technology has, and some estimates say it could be worth $50 billion by 2026. By comparison, the alcoholic beverage market is worth more than $200 billion. While it's still a controversial political issue, marijuana's eventual legalization seems likely as even a majority of Republican voters now favor it.Story continuesThere are a number of competitors angling for position, but one that has a head start is Canopy Growth Corporation. Based in Canada, it's primed to take advantage of the expected boom when marijuana becomes legal in that country in July. Canopy owns Tweed, the most recognized marijuana production brand in the world that's targeted at the recreational market, as well as medical-grade and international medical brands Bedrocan and Spectrum.  The company has forged a strategic partnership with Constellation Brands (NYSE: STZ), the U.S. importer of Corona and other Modelo beers, which includes exchanging knowledge and potentially developing cannabis-based beverages together. Constellation took a 9.9% stake in Canopy.With a market cap now at more than $5 billion, Canopy's valuation is premised on it gaining a significant piece of the marijuana market, but if it executes effectively, the stock will be worth several times what it is today.The 21st-century payment platformTravis Hoium (Square): Microsoft's success in the 1980s and 1990s was driven in large part by the fact that it was a platform businesses used to improve productivity. Once customers got used to using Microsoft products at work, they brought them home, creating a network effect that drove growth and profitability. Square is doing something similar with its products for small businesses. Square isn't just a payment processor: It provides services like appointment handling, payroll, scheduling, and more. This makes the platform valuable for those who are building a business, and those entrepreneurs have been adopting Square at a rapid rate. SQ Revenue (TTM) ChartMoreSQ Revenue (TTM) data by YChartsYou can see that Square isn't highly profitable, which Microsoft was in 1986, but its margins are beginning to improve as it grows. Look for that to continue as the operating expenses it incurred to build out the platform start to pay off and Square leverages a higher revenue base. What makes me really excited about Square is its Square Cash app, which could act as a money exchange system without the credit card and banking fees that eat away at Square's bottom line. If Square can expand its platform for business, and get more consumers to use the Square Cash app, the company could have Microsoft-like potential for investors.  More From The Motley Fool   3 Growth Stocks at Deep-Value Prices    5 Expected Social Security Changes in 2018    6 Years Later, 6 Charts That Show How Far Apple, Inc.

And that's because cash provides optionality. Companies with large cash (and cash-equivalent) piles can more easily invest in research and development, or give back this money to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks.Therefore, it's preferable investors look for companies with large and growing cash piles on their balance sheets. First, as a shareholder, you're entitled to a pro-rata portion of the company's cash. Second, while not an official generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) figure, free cash flow -- a metric that measures how much cash a company generates in each period -- is more important than traditional earnings metrics. A recent research report in the CFA Institute's Financial Analysts Journal found cash flow is a better indicator of stock returns than net income.Chess pieces and cash on a chess board with king on top of cash.MoreImage Source: Getty ImagesPay attention to how cash is generatedFor investors, it's key to do more than simply find companies with large cash hoards on their balance sheets. There are a variety of ways a company can boost its cash pile. The easiest path is to take out debt.On the balance sheet, an entry would be made to increase cash, an asset, while recording a corresponding increase in bonds payable, a liability. No economic value (equity) is created, and future operations will need to support the debt's interest obligation.Another way to grow cash quickly is to convert an asset via a sale. In this circumstance, the sold asset would be removed from the balance sheet and cash would increase. While there may be an increase in cash greater or less than the asset's value on the balance sheet, increasing the cash pile via issuing debt, or by asset sales, are considered unsustainable. In the long run, cash must be generated through business operations.Too much cash is not always a good thingHaving a large cash pile is not always considered a positive by investors. While it beats the alternative -- not having cash on the balance sheet, especially if a company has obligations -- growing cash piles can signify a potentially lower-growth future. Growth investors sometimes interpret excessive cash piles as an indication management no longer has viable value-creating projects to enter into. Finally, excessive cash can indicate a company has failed to invest in other parts of the business, e.g. research and development (R&D), technology, and employees.A secondary issue of too much cash on the balance sheet is often that large cash piles lead to suboptimal managerial actions, like stock buybacks when the company is overvalued, failed mergers and acquisitions, or spending huge sums on entering into new businesses when an incremental approach would have been preferable. Two major studies confirmed the curse of too much cash. One from Revelation Investment Research found companies with a large amount of cash foreshadowed poor stock returns the following year. Another study from the University of Toronto found that companies with high levels of excess cash underperformed the market in downturns.The key is finding companies with large cash piles, adequate investments in the company, and strong management, which are generating substantial cash from operations.Story continuesTop three companies by cash holdings  Company Cash (in Billions)      Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) $268.90   Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) $138.50   Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) $100.10  Data taken from each company's latest quarterly annual report.Apple's cash pile will continue to growApple's cash pile is the stuff of legends. Currently sitting at $269 billion, the company's cash holdings have shot up tenfold in the past decade as it redefined the smartphone. Critics counter that the company has also grown its combined debt -- long and short term -- from nothing to approximately $116 billion, as the company has returned approximately $234 billion in cash back to investors in the form of share buybacks and dividends.However, it would be folly to assume the company will not continue to grow its cash pile. Apple generated $51 billion in free cash flow in the last fiscal year, more than enough to pay for dividends and other cash usage. In fact, a large reason for Apple's debt spree is due to arcane taxation rules that prohibit the company from repatriating cash without generating hefty taxes.Also, Apple's growing cash pile is not at the expense of research and development. Last fiscal year, the company poured $11.6 billion into R&D;. And it's paying off, as colleague Adam Levine-Weinberg notes that the company's recently released iPhone X -- with its next-gen FaceID technology. As my colleague Evan Niu wrote, Apple would be the biggest beneficiary of the GOP tax bill and will save up to $47 billion in taxes. Although the company's iPhone accounts for the majority of its revenue, Apple's path forward is to focus on growing stickier, subscription-based services to diversify its top-line. Last quarter the company reported year-on-year growth of 34% in its services division. Apple has an ambitious goal of doubling services-based revenue by 2020. If so, this highly scalable, high-margin revenue source should allow the company to continue to grow its cash pile for years to come. Ballpoint pen and financial statementMoreImage Source: Getty ImagesMicrosoft's cloud will lead the company forwardMicrosoft has experienced a resurgence under CEO Satya Nadella. Prior CEO Steve Ballmer wanted to expand Microsoft's presence in hardware, a tough business for anybody not named Apple. Instead, Satya has transitioned the company to next-generation technology, like cloud computing, and expanded the Microsoft Office 365 offering, which brings in sticky subscription-based revenue.One thing Microsoft has always been strong at is generating cash. Software is a high-margin and scalable business, two factors that are great for cash generation. Like Apple, Microsoft generates considerable cash through operations: Over the last 12 months, the company has produced $32.3 million in free cash flow, more than enough to pay its dividend, buy back significant shares, and still grow its cash pile.There are a few red flags with Microsoft's growing cash pile -- the software maker has also grown its debt, with long- and short-term debt totaling more than $86.1 billion combined. Twenty billion dollars of this debt was added to pay for the LinkedIn acquisition. Under Ballmer, Microsoft could have been a case study for poor acquisitions, with aQuantive and Nokia Mobility.Microsoft investors should look to the cloud-computing for future growth, and the company is showing amazing top-line growth throughout the enterprise cloud stack. Last quarter the company reported 90% year-on-year growth for Microsoft's Azure, its infrastructure-as-a-service and platform-as-a-service product, while Dynamics 365, the enterprise-focused customer relationship management software-as-a-service product produced year-on-year growth of 69%. Expect both to continue: In November, Nadella announced the company would triple its cloud-related capacity in China in an attempt to compete with Amazon Web Services and Alibaba's cloud in the country. The opportunity is large in the Middle Kingdom. Morgan Stanley expects the Chinese cloud market to grow from $2 billion this year to $8 billion in 2020, giving Microsoft considerable tailwinds to continue to grow its cash pile. AlphabetIn a recurring theme, the company with the third-largest cash pile is also a tech company: Alphabet. The company's enviable search dominance on both desktop and mobile have led to strong cash flow. Additionally, the company boasts the lion's share of smartphone OS market share, which will continue to pay dividends (figurative) in the years and decades to come.Alphabet's been more selfish with its cash as compared to its counterparts. In the last decade, Alphabet has returned $9 billion in buybacks, but nothing in dividends. As a point of comparison, Apple and Microsoft have paid out $$45.7 billion and $22 billion, respectively, in the last 12 months. The company has also been more judicious with debt, holding less than $4 billion total on its books. Instead, Alphabet has focused on R&D; to create new products. The company has been criticized for its "moonshots" -- long-odds bets that should handsomely reward investors.While these moonshots may add to Alphabet's cash pile in the years to come, so far they have not. Instead, it's the company's Google division that adds to its cash pile. In the short and mid-term, look for that to continue. Advertising market research firm eMarketer expects Alphabet alone will take 42% of total U.S. digital advertising revenue in 2017 with an estimated $35 billion haul. The combination of increased market share and increased digital ad spending will push Alphabet's digital ad revenue to $45.7 billion by 2019, good for 14.3% annualized growth. Cash rules everything around usCash is an important asset, but it's more important for investors to focus on how the company generated the cash and, more importantly, its ability to continue to generate these enviable cash piles. On its own, large cash holding can be a poor reason to invest in a company. However, companies that are growing their cash piles through strong, dependable business operations warrant further investigation from investors. As shown above, Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet have grown their cash through superior business models. Investors looking for companies with large cash piles should start by evaluating these three companies.  More From The Motley Fool   3 Growth Stocks at Deep-Value Prices    5 Expected Social Security Changes in 2018    6 Years Later, 6 Charts That Show How Far Apple, Inc.

Recent volatility notwithstanding, big stock buybacks are a trend that's expected to continue."For the second half of 2018, indications are strong for increased corporate expenditures in both buybacks and dividends, with annual records for both," wrote Howard Silverblatt, Senior Index Analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices, in a report summing up buyback activity through the first half of the year. "Buybacks appear to be on a roll, supporting stock price via more purchases and increasing earnings per share through lower share counts."Lower corporate tax rates and companies repatriating cash held overseas are helping fuel an acceleration in share repurchase programs, which were already going strong. Indeed, over the past five years, companies in Standard & Poor's 500-stock index bought back a stunning $2.82 trillion of their own stock, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.Although it takes more than share repurchases to support stock prices, they sure do help - and investors generally love them. When it comes to returning cash to shareholders through stock buybacks, these are the most generous companies over the past half-decade.SEE ALSO: The Kiplinger Dividend 15: Our Favorite Dividend-Paying Stocks7. Citigroup Getty ImagesMarket value: $167.3 billionDividend yield: 2.6%Stock buybacks, past five years: $38 billionCitigroup (C, $68.26) has been a major purchaser of its own shares over the past five years as it endeavored to recover from lingering wounds from the financial crisis. Now that the bank is healthy once more, you could say its share repurchases are just getting started.In a nod to the bank's strong capital position, the Federal Reserve in June gave Citigroup a green light to buy back up to another $17.6 billion of its own stock during the four quarters starting in the third quarter of 2018. That would represent a major acceleration in returning cash to shareholders. After all, it took Citigroup five years to buy roughly half the amount of stock the bank expects to pick up over the next year.SEE ALSO: 101 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy for 2019 and Beyond6. Cisco SystemsStory continuesGetty ImagesMarket value: $218.0 billionDividend yield: 2.8%Stock buybacks, past five years: $41.7 billionCisco Systems (CSCO, $47.90) was generous with share repurchases even before corporate tax cuts. Once the federal government made it less expensive to repatriate earnings held overseas, the technology giant opened up the floodgates.In February, the company said it would accelerate its share repurchases, fueled with its more than $70 billion in cash held offshore. Cisco announced a $25 billion increase to its existing program in February. For its full fiscal year ended July 28, Cisco returned $23.6 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends.Cisco has a total authorization of $31 billion in stock buybacks, so investors can expect the repurchases to keep coming.SEE ALSO: 10 Best Value Stocks to Buy Now5. Oracle Getty ImagesMarket value: $190.0 billionDividend yield: 1.5%Stock buybacks, past five years: $44.1 billionOracle (ORCL, $50.26) is another Silicon Valley technology giant that accelerated its share repurchases in response to changes to the corporate tax code. Of the $44.1 billion Oracle has spent on buying back its own stock, nearly $10 billion of that came during the three months ended Aug. 31.There's more to come. In September, Oracle's board of directors raised the company's stock buyback program by $12 billion. The massive returns of cash to shareholders have helped undergird ORCL stock despite U.S. sales not always living up to Wall Street's expectations. The software maker's stock was up 7.8% for the year-to-date ended Nov. 7. The Dow was up 5.5% over the same time frame. SEE ALSO: 10 "Strong Buy" Stock Picks You Shouldn't Overlook4. JPMorgan ChaseGetty ImagesMarket value: $374.7 billionDividend yield: 2.9%Stock buybacks, past five years: $45.5 billionJPMorgan Chase (JPM, $111.48), the nation's largest bank by assets, also has been one of the biggest buyers of its own stock. Like Citigroup, in some ways the financial firm is just getting started.A clean financial bill of health from the Fed allowed JPMorgan in June to announce a windfall of cash returns to shareholders. The bank hiked its quarterly dividend by 43% to 80 cents a share from 56 share. As for stock buybacks, the board authorized repurchases of up to $20.7 billion by June 30, 2019. That would represent a jaw-dropping increase over the $45.5 billion in buybacks that the bank has conducted over the past five years.SEE ALSO: The 7 Best Bank ETFs for American Bulls3. Wells Fargo & Co.Getty ImagesMarket value: $251.3 billionDividend yield: 3.2%Stock buybacks, past five years: $46.8 billionWells Fargo & Co. (WFC, $53.58) has suffered a series of setbacks over the past two years stemming from its phony accounts scandal and other black eyes. If there's a silver lining for shareholders, it's that WFC has been an aggressive buyer of its own stock - presumably at a discount.Wells Fargo repurchased nearly $47 billion of its own stock over the past half-decade, and it's revved up to buy more. With the Fed's blessing, Wells Fargo announced a 10% dividend hike in June and unveiled a stock buyback plan of up to $24.5 billion, to be executed over the four quarters ending June 2019.SEE ALSO: 7 Growth Stocks That Will Pay You Cash, Too2. Microsoft Getty ImagesMarket value: $859.4 billionDividend yield: 1.6%Stock buybacks, past five years: $60.2 billionMicrosoft (MSFT, $111.96) has been a total-return machine over the past five years. The stock is up 196% on a price basis, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. Add in the dividend, and the total return to shareholders comes to 235%.MSFT has delivered average annual earnings-per-share growth of 12% over the past five years, according to data from Thomson Reuters, helped by more than $60 billion in stock buybacks. For the three months ended Sept. 30 alone, Microsoft returned $6.1 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, up 27% year-over-year.SEE ALSO: The Best Vanguard Funds for 401(k) Retirement Savers1. AppleGetty ImagesMarket value: $987.8 billionDividend yield: 1.4%Stock buybacks, past five years: $208.6 billionIt should come as no surprise that the runaway buyback champion is Apple (AAPL, $209.95). The iPhone maker has spent a stunning $208.6 billion on its own stock over the past five years, and it's still going strong. In the quarter ended Sept. 29 alone, Apple returned more than $23 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Heck, in the past five years, Apple has bought back more of its own stock than Microsoft, Wells Fargo, JPMorgan and Oracle combined. The company said in May that it would buy back another $100 billion in stock, funded by bringing back home much of the $252 billion held overseas.SEE ALSO: The Best T.

For investors’ notice, the companies will now aim at extending Allscripts’ cloud-based electronic health record (EHR) platforms with new technologies.Since the announcement of the collaboration, this Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) company witnessed a 5.5% increase in its share price to close at $11.02 yesterday.Microsoft Signs MoU With Allscripts’ VeradigmIn a bid to develop an integrated research model through point-of-care technology platforms, Allscripts’ Veradigm has signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Microsoft. Notably, Veradigm is the company’s payer and life sciences-focused business unit. Per the deal, both the companies are likely to conduct pilot programs for developing the compliance framework necessary to support research performed within this new operating model.This latest collaboration will enable Allscripts to leverage on Microsoft’s exclusive solutions that are powered by Microsoft Azure and AI. Per management, this will help biopharmaceutical and clinical research organizations better conduct research.More About VeradigmLast November, Allscripts announced Veradigm as the new branding for Allscripts’ Payer & Life Sciences division. Veradigm is an integrated data systems and services business that combines data-driven clinical insights with actionable tools for clinical workflow, research, analytics and media.Since the introduction of Veradigm, share prices of Allscripts increased 11.3% till date. However, the stock has lost 26.9% compared with the industry's 19.4% decline and S&P 500's 7% decrease in a year’s time. A Sneak Peek at Allscripts Flagship EHRsWe believe that the Sunrise and Paragon EHR platforms are Allscripts’ major growth drivers.

Meanwhile, Paragon is an integrated EHR and financial/administrative solution for smaller hospitals serving a single IDN and community facilities. The company’s EHR diagnostic tools, including dbMotion, EPSi, FollowMyHealth and 2bPrecise, have been experiencing an increasing list of clients outside the company’s EHR base.In the third quarter of 2018, Allscripts witnessed a number of contract extensions across both the Sunrise and Paragon customers. For example, the company signed a seven-year extension for Sunrise Clinicals, including the addition of Sunrise Registration and Scheduling modules at the Hospital for Special Care in New Britain, CT.

As The Verge saw in the state's disclosure records, the three giants contributed a significant amount of money to a campaign pushing back against the initiative: Amazon and Microsoft donated $195,000 each, while Uber pitched in a smaller-but-still-noteworthy donation worth $50,000. Google, AT&T, Facebook and Verizon -- four of the first corporations that backed the fight against the initiative -- all plunked down $200,000. Facebook and Verizon eventually withdrew their support, however, with the former doing so after Mark Zuckerberg was hauled in front of Congress to answer questions about the Cambridge Analytica scandal.The California Consumer Privacy Act aims to give California residents the right to know what kind of data companies have on them and to tell those companies not to sell their personal info. Tech companies believe that it could ruin the way they develop their products and do business. A spokesperson for Amazon told The Verge, for instance: "While we share the initiative's overarching goal of protecting consumer privacy, we are concerned by unworkable requirements that would hinder our ability to innovate on behalf of our customers."Committee to Protect California Jobs spokesperson Steven Maviglio echoed that in a statement to Govtech. He said that bill author Alastair Mactaggart didn't consider the "workability" of his proposal and that it's nigh impossible for tech giants to comply with it. "[A]nyone who orders anything from Amazon can request where their information went, and that can not only overwhelm a large company like Amazon but also smaller ones too," the spokesperson explained. Microsoft also released a statement that pretty much said the same thing: "We believe the California measure could have unintended consequences for both businesses and consumers and that there is a better way to give consumers the privacy rights they deserve."So far, the Californians for Consumer Privacy Act has already collected 637,000 signatures. Authorities have to be able to verify 402,468 signatures for the proposal to make it to the November ballot -- we'll know for sure after the California Secretary of State announces the result on June 25th. Even if it does make its way to the ballot, the opposition now has a lot of money to spend on campaigns to fight its approval. The Committee to Protect California Jobs, for one, plans to make sure citizens know about the potential impact it may have on jobs in the state if companies choose to up and leave for another HQ.The Verge, California Secretary of StateThis article originally appeared on Engadget.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextDocuments confirm what Microsoft is building in GoodyearAmerican City Business JournalsWhat to Expect When Alphabet Reports Later This MonthMotley FoolHemp companies are raising capital at a fast clip and cannabis retailers can expect 4/20 sales spikeMarketWatchZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceState defends South Dakota pipeline protest legislationAssociated PressSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBC'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceIn Ukrainian candidate's hometown, a cry for changeAssociated PressAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadgetMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley Fool

The partnership means  Amazon customers can use Alexa  to access Cortana's exclusive features such as accessing work calendars, while Microsoft customers can use Cortana to ask Alexa to order products from Amazon or control their smart home devices."Ensuring Cortana is available for our customers everywhere and across any device is a key priority for us," said Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, in a press release Wednesday."Bringing Cortana's knowledge, Office 365 integration, commitments, and reminders to Alexa is a great step toward that goal."Amazon's personal assistant Alexa was first announced in November 2014 alongside the Echo, Amazon's smart speaker. Meanwhile, Cortana was announced by Microsoft in May 2015 and released for its Windows Phone product."There are going to be multiple successful intelligent agents, each with access to different sets of data and with different specialized skill areas. Together, their strengths will complement each other and provide customers with a richer and even more helpful experience," Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon, said in a press release."It's great for Echo owners to get easy access to Cortana."More From CNBC A bitcoin rival that has quietly surged nearly 1,400% this yearBurger King has launched its own version of bitcoin in Russia called ‘WhopperCoin’Samsung launches huge 6.3-inch Note 8 smartphone and hopes to price it under $1,000ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextDocuments confirm what Microsoft is building in GoodyearAmerican City Business JournalsCan Microsoft (MSFT) Keep the Earnings Surprise Streak Alive?ZacksConsole gaming is at a crossroadsEngadgetData Sheet—Why We Should Stop Haranguing Our Kids to Put Down Their PhonesFortuneMicrosoft introduces tools to better VR experience for users with low visionAFP Relax NewsZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceTesla's board is about to get a lot smallerTechCrunchAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergApple may bring Siri Shortcuts and Screen Time to macOSEngadget

Bill Gates Remembers the Moment Co-Founder Paul Allen Created MicrosoftGlenn FleishmanFortuneOctober 16, 2018ReblogShareTweetShareIn a blog entry published Tuesday celebrating his friendship with his co-founder, Paul Allen, who died on Oct. 15 at age 65, Bill Gates remembered the moment Microsoft leapt into being.The memory dates back to 1975. The two men thought they’d already missed the microcomputer revolution, and in fact, they didn’t realize until later how ahead they had been. Gates credits Allen with understanding that far better and far earlier than he did.Allen and Gates both lived in the Boston area, Allen working as a programmer for Honeywell after dropping out of Washington State University, and Gates attending Harvard. Gates recalls Allen finding him and taking him urgently to a newsstand to show him the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics.The cover depicted the Altair 8800, an unimpressive box covered with switches to modern eyes, but which sparked the PC revolution. Gates recalled that Allen said, “This is happening without us!” Neat piece of history: Here's the cover of Popular Electronics that Paul Allen and Bill Gates were geeking out about in Boston, that inspired the founding of Microsoft.https://t.co/ob8ALnEgEE pic.twitter.com/o2VSg3tHQP— John Patrick Pullen (@jppullen) October 16, 2018 Despite the cover calling it a “minicomputer,” the Altair had a powerful microprocessor in it. An editorial inside trumpeted, “The Home Computer Is Here!” For $400 ($1,900 in 2018 dollars), you could purchase and assemble a kit that gave you a shocking amount of computational power—especially when the next fastest device available to consumers and hobbyists was a scientific calculator. Beyond that, only businesses and colleges had minicomputers or mainframes, both expensive, with restricted access, and shared with many other users.On the basis of that magazine cover and Allen’s enthusiasm, Gates left college. The next year the two founded Micro-Soft. (It later lost the hyphen.)Gates’ remembrance of Allen concludes with strong emotion: “Paul deserved more time in life. He would have made the most of it. I will miss him tremendously.”ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read Next3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolDocuments confirm what Microsoft is building in GoodyearAmerican City Business JournalsMicrosoft staff are openly questioning the value of diversityQuartzCan Microsoft (MSFT) Keep the Earnings Surprise Streak Alive?ZacksConsole gaming is at a crossroadsEngadgetZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolNatural Gas Price Prediction – Prices Tumble as Supplies IncreaseFX EmpireSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrude Oil Weekly Price Forecast – Crude oil running into resistanceFX EmpireWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolThe Boeing 737 MAX Is 1 Step Closer to Flying Again -- but Don't Expect to See It SoonMotley Fool8 Happy Easter Images to Post on Facebook, Twitter and InstagramInvestorPlaceRead This Before You Buy AT&T Inc.

With no major news to speak of, let's see why Microsoft stock looks like a strong buy at the moment, especially as the likes of Facebook (FB) and Alphabet's (GOOGL) Google face heightened scrutiny in Washington.Microsoft MSFT saw its stock price pop over 1% Tuesday morning as it inches toward its all-time high. With no major news to speak of, let’s see why Microsoft stock looks like a strong buy at the moment, especially as the likes of Facebook FB and Alphabet’s GOOGL Google face heightened scrutiny in Washington.Recent NewsMicrosoft announced a few weeks back that it will introduce a subscription service for Xbox that mimics how Apple AAPL treats some of its high-priced iPhones. The software and hardware powerhouse will let consumers bundle an Xbox, an Xbox Live Gold subscription—which allows users to play multiplayer games online and access free games—and the Xbox Game Pass for one monthly cost.Microsoft’s idea here is pretty simple: to create more brand loyalty and more consistent revenue streams. At the end of the two-year period, Microsoft will theoretically be able to offer upgrades on newer models in what MSFT likely hopes is a somewhat limitless cycle. The move also highlights the growing popularity and strength of subscription services, from Netflix NFLX to Spotify SPOT.  Meanwhile, Microsoft has continued to jump deeper into artificial intelligence, IoT, and cloud computing. Microsoft, which grabbed 14% of the cloud market last quarter, is currently the second-largest cloud provider behind Amazon’s AMZN 34%. The firm also comes in well ahead of IBM’s IBM 8%, Google’s 6%, and Alibaba’s BABA 4%.The company has also bolstered its business through acquisitions as well, which includes its June purchase of open source software powerhouse GitHub. Microsoft also announced in July a five-year deal with Walmart WMT that will see the retail giant use MSFT’s cloud and AI tech.Stock Price Shares of Microsoft have climbed roughly 30% since the start of the year, which outpaces its industry’s 11% and the S&P 500’s 8% jump. MSFT stock continued to top the index and its industry over the last six months, even though it has slowed down recently. Investors will also notice that Microsoft stock has been on an impressive run over the last two years. This helps MSFT stock sit right near its new 52-week and all-time high of $112.78 per share. ValuationMoving on, investors need to understand Microsoft’s current valuation picture. MSFT stock is trading at 25.2X forward 12-month Zacks Consensus EPS estimates, which represents a significant discount compared to its industry’s 32.8X average. It is worth pointing out that Microsoft has traded as low as 22.2X over the last year with a one-year median of 24.4X.Investors will also clearly see that MSFT’s current valuation picture appears stretched compared to where it has traded over the last five years. However, the entire computer software-services industry has climbed steadily as well, and MSFT has always traded at a discount.Story continues OutlookLooking ahead, our current Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for Microsoft’s fiscal Q1 revenues to climb by nearly 13.4% to hit $27.83 billion. MSFT’s fiscal 2019 revenues are expected to reach $122.36 billion, which would mark a roughly 11% jump.At the other end of the income statement, Microsoft’s adjusted quarterly earnings are projected to climb by over 14% to hit $0.96 per share, while its full-year EPS figure is expected to expand by over 9.5%.Plus, the firm has earned 10 quarterly earnings estimate revision over the last 60 days, against zero downward changes. MSFT has also earned 15 full-year upward earnings estimate revisions, with 100% agreement to the upside during this same time period.Bottom LineMicrosoft’s impressive earnings estimate revision trends help the company earn a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Coupled with the firm’s growing strength in cloud computing, along with its overall top and bottom-line outlook, MSFT stock appears to be one that investors should think about buying at the moment.5 Medical Stocks to Buy NowZacks names 5 companies poised to ride a medical breakthrough that is targeting cures for leukemia, AIDS, muscular dystrophy, hemophilia, and other conditions.New products in this field are already generating substantial revenue and even more wondrous treatments are in the pipeline.

(AAPL) sold its first iPod. By September, 10 million songs had been downloaded from the iTunes store, and by the beginning of 2004 the company's stock had lost about 1% of its value. At roughly the same time, Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) launched Windows Server 2003, and by the beginning of 2004 the company's stock had risen nearly 8%.Since then the stock price charts look very different. Apple's share price is up nearly 5,000% since January of 2004, while Microsoft's stock is up less than 40%. But in the past 12 months, Microsoft stock has gained 35% while Apple's stock is down nearly 9%. Where should investors be looking for the most value?ALSO READ: Eight Big Dividend Hikes Expected Before 2013 EndsMicrosoft has seen its shares rise 40% so far in 2013. The company's Xbox One becomes available for sale Friday, the first new gaming console from Redmond in nearly eight years. The stock closed at $37.40 on Thursday, and the consensus analyst price target of around $36.00 implies that the stock is at least fully valued, if not overbought. Shares have traded in a range of $26.26 to $38.22 over the past year. With a fiscal year 2015 earnings per share estimate of $2.92, it is valued at nearly 13 times next year's expected earnings.ALSO READ: Ten Brands That Will Disappear in 2014Apple shares are down about 2% so far in 2013. The shares have gotten a boost since the early October introduction of the iPhone 5S and 5C, but that boost did not last very long. The share price has bounced around in a narrow range between about $515 and $530 since mid-October. The stock closed at $521.14 Thursday, and the consensus analyst price target is around $580, which implies an upside of 11.3%. Shares have traded in a range of $385.10 to $594.59 over the past year. With a 2015 earnings per share estimate of $47.65, it is valued at about 11 times next year's expected earnings.ALSO READ: Seven Stores Remaining Closed on ThanksgivingFor the 2014 fiscal year that ends in June for Microsoft and in September for Apple, the companies are expected to post earnings per share of $2.66 and $43.42, respectively. In Microsoft's case, earnings are flat, while Apple's earnings per share are estimated to rise a little more than 9%.Microsoft will name a new chief executive officer sometime in the next few months, and it will close its $7.4 billion acquisition of the mobile phone business of Nokia Corp. (NOK). If the Xbox One is the hit that everyone thinks it will be, the company's stock could be in for another boost.ALSO READ: Famous Restaurant Chains That Are Hard to FindJust on the numbers we have, Apple's stock looks like the better value going into the new year. But after the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad, everyone expects Apple to unveil the next big thing every 12 months, and the company does not try very hard to manage expectations. Face it, there is unlikely to be a next big thing in 2014. But all things considered, more analysts believe Apple is the better choice for a value investment.Related ArticlesTop 10 Cars with the Best Resale ValueThe Nine Best Deals on Black FridayTen Companies Paying Americans the LeastReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextDid You Miss Williams Companies's (NYSE:WMB) 48% Share Price Gain?Simply Wall St.Should Incyte (NASDAQ:INCY) Be Disappointed With Their 56% Profit?Simply Wall St.Documents confirm what Microsoft is building in GoodyearAmerican City Business JournalsDo You Like The Travelers Companies, Inc.

It was the fourth consecutive quarter of declining year-over-year sales and much worse than the 7.7% decline IDC had expected. In slightly better news, competing technology consultancy Gartner group said the number of PCs shipped for the quarter was the lowest since the second quarter of 2009.Some of the blame is being laid at the feet of Microsoft's (MSFT) widely anticipated then quickly forgotten Windows 8 release. Others say the quarter was a result of the long decline in PC sales in favor of Apple (AAPL) software and tablets. Whatever it is driving the slowdown, Jon Najarian, co-founder of OptionMonster.com, says Microsoft is going to be fine.Noting the truly horrible numbers out of Dell (DELL) and Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), which both lost dramatic share to China-based hardware leader Lenovo, Najarian puts forward the notion that the Windows indifference is being overstated."Maybe people are buying some Windows 8 even if it's just Lenovo selling it," he suggests. Windows came to the tablet market late, barely getting a toe-hold into the market stealing the most share from desktops and laptops.Najarian thinks Microsoft stock is a buy into the heart of downgrades last Thursday. Citing the high yield and unlikelihood of a major downside shock sending shares much lower, Najarian's strategy is staying long the common and selling premium. That way he gets MSFT's 3% yield and another 7% or so from selling call insurance.Hope springs eternal regarding what was once the world's most valuable company. "I don't think it's the end for Microsoft," Najarian says.

And, during the earnings conference call, Twitter will take live questions from Tweets.Microsoft (MSFT) made it official yesterday, naming Satya Nadella its new CEO.

This new plan will replace last year's authorized $7.5 billion buyback plan, which it never completed. 3M only spent $5.2 billion on stock buybacks last year.

Bezos invested in Twitter (TWTR), Workday (WDAY), and DOMO (DOMO) in 2008, 2011, and 2013, respectively. These are only three of many companies that he has chosen to invest in. He also founded his own aerospace firm, Blue Origin, “to make space tourism more affordable.” In addition, in 2013, Bezos made headlines after he bought the popular media outlet, The Washington Post, in a deal worth $250 million.## Uber and Airbnb investmentsAccording to the data compiled by crunchbase.com, Bezos invested about $37 million in the American ride-hailing service provider Uber in 2011. While Uber has not been listed yet, investors still await its IPO, expected in 2019, to take a position in the company. In December 2018, Uber made a confidential filing with the regulator for its IPO. Nearly at the same time, its rival Lyft also filed for an IPO. According to a Reuters report, “Uber’s valuation in its most recent private financing was $76 billion, and it could be worth $120 billion in an IPO.”Similarly, Airbnb, the online hospitality service company, is also expected to file for its IPO in 2019. Airbnb received about $112 million of funds from Jeff Bezos in 2011.Jeff Bezos’s investments are well diversified in sectors including healthcare, financials, industrials, and technology. While these investments reflect Bezos’s active interest in small companies with huge future growth potential, Amazon continues to be responsible for most of his wealth.In 2018, Amazon managed to rise by about 28.4% despite 6.2% and 3.9% drops in the S&P 500 benchmark (SPY) and the NASDAQ composite index. Last year, Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Qualcomm (QCOM), Alphabet (GOOG), and Facebook (FB) lost 6.8%, 31.0%, 11.1%, 0.8%, and 25.7%, respectively. Other tech companies including Microsoft (MSFT), Intel (INTC), and Netflix (NFLX) lost 18.7%, 1.7%, and 39.4%, respectively.Browse this series on Market Realist:  * Part 1 - Jeff Bezos Owns These Five Key Public Stocks  * Part 2 - Bezos Invested in Twitter about Ten Years Ago: Should You Now?  * Part 3 - How Jeff Bezos’s Workday and Domo Investments Fared in 2018Story continuesReblogShareTweetShareWhat to Read NextUber's self-driving car unit raises $1B from Toyota, Denso and Vision Fund ahead of spin-outTechCrunchToyota, SoftBank fund, Denso invest $1 billion in UberAssociated PressUber's self-driving unit gets its own CEO and a $1 billion investmentEngadget20-year-old college student says Uber driver left her on side of the road when he found out she was getting an abortionYahoo LifestyleFrom Uber to the Altar!

(NASDAQ: CELG) to portfolios. Why? An overreaction to trial data could mean Spark's shares are on sale, Esperion Therapeutics has big news fast approaching, and Celgene may be one of biotech's best bargain-bin buys.Here's why these biotech stocks may be right for you.Perfection is the enemy of the good enoughChuck Saletta (Spark Therapeutics): Spark Therapeutics recently saw its shares take a nosedive on news that its candidate for hemophilia A treatment worked, but not flawlessly. Patients involved in its clinical trial saw a substantial reduction in the bleeding associated with hemophilia, but there was one serious adverse reaction to the treatment that resulted in hospitalization.A person points at a buy button on a screen displaying an ascending stock price chart.MoreIMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES.The clinical results were strong enough that the company is planning to advance to a phase 3 clinical trial later this year, but the side effects were enough to spook investors. With strong efficacy to the treatment seen in the earlier trial, there's reason to believe Spark will see successes in its phase 3 trial. Still, it needs to understand the causes of the adverse reactions and address them to better assure that its compound will get the green light to ultimately be approved for regular treatment.With no fatalities in the earlier clinical trial and the adverse reactions appearing to have been treatable, there's good reason to believe that Spark Therapeutics can ultimately find a path to approval. It may need to limit its patient population based on some still-to-be-determined clinical factor and include adverse reaction monitoring in its treatment protocol. Still, if the end game is effectively a cure for hemophilia A, patients will likely flock to the treatment despite the short-term adverse reaction risks.With its shares down substantially on word of the adverse reactions in the clinical trial, the market may be seriously discounting whether there's any value in Spark's treatment in the future. An investor buying now may be getting an opportunity to get in while the news is bad -- with upside potential if the treatment eventually wins approval. Nothing is certain when investing in biotech, but if the news improves, chances are that this opportunity may be fleeting.Closing in on key dataTodd Campbell (Esperion Therapeutics): There are 78 million Americans with elevated bad-cholesterol levels, including 13 million people with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) who could benefit from new medications that further lower their bad-cholesterol levels.Currently, oral statins are commonly used to combat high cholesterol, but millions of people still fail to reach their cholesterol targets, and many people can't tolerate statins because of side effects, such as muscle weakness. In cases where statins inadequately control bad cholesterol levels, add-on therapies can be used, including Zetia, a blockbuster oral drug, or PCSK9 inhibitors, which are costly, injected therapies.Soon, Esperion Therapeutics will report results from its two remaining phase 3 trials for bempedoic acid, an oral drug that reduces cholesterol production upstream of statins. So far, bempedoic acid's trials show it can reduce bad cholesterol by an additional 20% when it's used alongside statins.Story continuesData from one of the two remaining trials will show if it's safe and effective when its combined in a single-pill formulation with Zetia. Results from that trial are expected later this month. The second trial is evaluating its use in ASCVD patients on maximally tolerated statin therapy. Results from that trial are expected in September.Assuming the results from these trials confirm what's been reported so far, Esperion Therapeutics plans to file for FDA and EU OK in Q1 2019 and Q2 2019, respectively. If it's eventually approved, it could provide a low-cost, oral alternative to PCSK9 inhibitors. The Zetia combination pill data is particularly important because a win could position it as the go-to second-line treatment for people with stubbornly high cholesterol. Prior to losing patent protection, Zetia was a $4 billion drug, so there could be a significant market opportunity for bempedoic acid in the second-line setting.Granted, there's no guarantee its trials will pan out, or that regulators will approve it, or that doctors will prescribe it. Nevertheless, the addressable patient population is massive, and that could make it a smart move to add Esperion Therapeutics to portfolios before it releases its data.Irrational underexuberanceKeith Speights (Celgene): Former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan famously referred to what he perceived as the overvaluation of technology stocks during the heady dot.com days as "irrational exuberance." I think investors currently have "irrational underexuberance" for Celgene.The biotech's share price has crumbled over the last 12 months, although there's been a bit of a rebound since early July. But Celgene still trades at a measly 8.7 times expected earnings. Its price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is a ridiculously low 0.54.There are a few legitimate reasons for investors' pessimism. Celgene botched its regulatory filing for potential blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug ozanimod earlier this year. It experienced a painful late-stage clinical failure in 2017. The company continues to be heavily dependent on Revlimid, a blood cancer drug that will face generic competition by 2022.However, Celgene is on track to file again for approval of ozanimod in early 2019. Market research firm EvaluatePharma ranked the biotech's pipeline as the third-best in the industry, with promising candidates like fedratinib, luspatercept, and liso-cel potentially on the way. Celgene also claims blockbuster drugs Pomalyst and Otezla in its lineup, which continue to generate solid growth. I think the combination of these current winners and several great pipeline candidates should reduce Celgene's reliance on Revlimid.Sure, Celgene has some pipeline risks. But its pipeline is getting increasingly less risky, in my view. I think a little more exuberance is in order for this big biotech stock.

(OTC PINK: ALYI) today announced the company has seen an increased interest from prospective strategic investors since Uber announced a shift away from cars to electric bikes and scooters for short trips. Alternet Systems introduced a strategy last year to commercialize advanced energy storage technologies by integrating the technologies into specific products and services. Alternet's leading project is housed in a subsidiary recently launched by the Company called ReVolt Electric Motorbikes. Alternet's ReVolt has its first electric motorcycle in pilot production now. Uber has recognized the trend toward electric bike and scooter transportation within inner cities after Alternet had already launched a business strategy to deliver electric vehicles for this market with a special emphasis in Africa. Uber currently has 2 million regular users in Africa and 29,000 registered drivers. Alternet management reports that the company is receiving an increased number of emails and calls from investors interested in learning more about the ReVolt subsidiary. Management is optimistic that Uber's move will result in an opportunity for Alternet to realize accelerated growth.Alternet recently published its Q2 2018 financial report with a statement from management on the company's latest progress and developments. The company has established its first contracts and is generating early stage revenue. After its first year of operations, the company is adapting its technology strategy in response to lessons learned. The company is planning a communications strategy updated starting with a new website expected to launch next week.Learn more on the company's website: www.lithiumip.com.Learn more about ReVolt Electric Motorbikes: www.revoltmotorbikes.com.Disclaimer/Safe Harbor: This news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Litigation Reform Act.

Alexander blames Whetstone for his firing from Uber in June 2017, claiming her "grossly misleading statements" both internally at Uber and to the media, "destroyed his reputation." He claims she "harbored deep seated personal animosity" against him, was jealous of his close relationship with then-CEO Travis Kalanick  and frequently made racist comments about several minority groups during her tenure.  Whetstone, well-known in Silicon Valley for her comms prowess, also left Uber in 2017 and has since gone on to lead PR efforts at Facebook and now Netflix.Story continuesReblogShareTweetShareWhat to Read NextZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadgetAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosZoom's CEO emigrated from China 22 years ago and spoke little English — now he's worth almost $3 billionCNBCJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNTesla's board is about to get a lot smallerTechCrunchWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance Video3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo Finance
