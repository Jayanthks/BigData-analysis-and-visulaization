agoMicrosoft MSFT Stocks Big Rally Should ContinueMicrosoft NASDSAQMSFT has been on a winning streak given its diversified business portfolio and ability to deliver growth and financial results in a timely manner Analysts continue to rally around the stock heading into its earnings announcement on April  which makes sense given the momentum on the charts and sustained interest for a variety of Microsofts products both for consumers and within the enterprise as wellThe growth narrative tied to Azure Cloud drives much of the upside commentary among analysts despite the growth rate from Azure is expected to decelerate over the next coupleyears MSFT still trades at a fairly reasonable valuation at x earnings The companys current market capitalization is  Billion with psychological resistance at  Trillion or  Chances are Microsoft can reach  within the next couple months assuming the stock market rally continues and investors chase stocks at higher valuationsDespite multiple expansion adding to the recent stock price gains software companies tend to trade at a bit a premium multiple given the defensiveness plus recurring revenue of the business model Just look at Adobe for example which trades at x earnings right now despite EPS growth expectations of  Microsoft trades at x earnings with consensus expecting  earnings for FY So theres definitely some room for Microsoft to trade at a higher when compared to other software companies in the segmentUBS analyst Jennifer Swanson Lowe remains optimistic on Microsoft heading into Q Microsoft shares had a slow start to the year as concerns about slower hardware purchasing from hyperscale providers and tough compares in the transactional portions of the companys weighed on sentiment However our checks point to sustained demand for Azure and ongoing Windows upgrade activity as Win end of life looms while a reset in expectations post Q should improve the setup into Q Stock performance has perked up in recent weeks but valuation at x EVCY FCF still looks defensive and MSFT remains one of our favorite names for CY offering a balance of topline growth margin expansion and FCFbased valuation supportThe analyst has maintained her  price target on MSFT and anticipates commercial cloud revenue growth of  in the next quarter We forecast Commercial Cloud rev growth of  YoY to B on the back of  growth in Azure and  rev growth in Office  Commercial Our checks continue to highlight strong demand for Azure as the platform underpinning digital transformation growth is partially impacted by relatively mature peruser business while consumptionbased business continues to remain healthy We expect Commercial Cloud gross margin to improve  basis points quarteronquarter at  based on improvements in Azure partially offset by lowermargin consumptionbased servicesThe stock clearly wants to trend higher and Microsoft does have a fairly solid trackrecord of meeting or beating consensus expectations While Microsoft is a mature growth stock the current consensus still anticipates the stock to trade at  currently which implies that the stock could reach T in market valuation over the next monthsMicrosoft will need to deliver some pretty solid results and raise financial outlook to get the stock trending up to  It seems doable given the stocks momentum and the valuation comparisons to some of its other software peers Despite the catalysts tied to earnings the summer months should also be interesting as theres a number of game software companies riding on this summers E conference like Electronic Arts and Activision BlizzardAt this years E  Conference Microsoft is expected to announce the Xbox  which will launch next year but the preview announcement could add some excitement to the stock as it looks to renew interest in its gaming franchise Microsofts gaming business produced B revenue in FY making it a big enough of a business for Microsoft to start pouring resources into it With the opportunity to refresh its console lineup it would be a big opportunity for Microsoft to announce more exclusive titles developed inhouse to regain momentum versus Sony and also build a larger installed base of Xbox Live subscribers from  million which has grown fairly stagnant in the past four quartersBottom LineImprovements in gaming related announcements along with the announcement of earnings on April th will add some positive sentiment to the stock Analysts seem relatively optimistic on the company and its hard to mess up on the announcement of a nextgeneration console this year

while expansive is also highly fragmented So while there are a growing number of thematic exchangetraded funds ETFs on the market today the number of video game ETFs as readers will see here is quite low In fact there are just two funds resembling dedicated video game ETFs    Best Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever With that in mind lets look at some of the funds including some stretches that have credibility as video game ETFs ETFMG Video Game Tech ETF GAMRExpense Ratio  or  annually per  investedThe ETFMG Video Game Tech ETF NYSEARCAGAMR turned three years old last month and is the first dedicated video game ETF to list in the US For an ETF focused on a somewhat narrow niche GAMR has been relatively successful as highlighted by the funds  million in assets under management Home to almost  stocks this video game ETF tracks the EEFund Video Game Tech IndexGAMR is reflective of the global nature of the video game industry as the fund provides exposure to  countries The video game ETFs largest geographic weights will not surprise seasoned gamers The US Japan South Korea and China combine for almost  of the funds weight GAMR provides exposure to several compelling video game themes including mobile gaming and digital downloadsThe percentage of digitally downloaded video games rose from  in  to  in  according to ETFMG This is expected to climb to nearly  by This video game ETF is up nearly  yeartodate VanEck Vectors Video Gaming and eSports ETF ESPOExpense Ratio In the video game ETF realm the VanEck Vectors Video Gaming and eSports ETF NYSEARCAESPO is the most direct competitor to the aforementioned GAMR ESPO which debuted last October is not just a video game ETF The fund is one of the best avenues for exposure to the booming esports marketESPO tracks the Global Video Gaming and esports Index Many of the dedicated esports companies are not yet publicly traded so ESPOs  holdings run the gamut of video game makers such as Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts semiconductor makers and console makers ESPOs components must derive at least half their sales from video games or esports to be included in the fundUp  this year this video game ETF has recently been hitting new highs reflecting investors expectations for the growing esports market    Cheap Stocks That Cost Less Than  Competitive video gaming audience expected to reach  million people globally in  according to VanEck Esports revenue growth has increased almost  yearly since  supported by a young affluent audience iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF SOXXExpense Ratio No the iShares PHLX Semiconductor ETF NASDAQSOXX is not a video game ETF but remember there are not many video game ETFs and some semiconductor makers are heavily involved in the video game and competitive gaming markets That includes Nvidia NASDAQNVDA the largest holding in SOXXNvidia rival Advanced Micro Devices NASDAQAMD is also making inroads in the video game space having recently reported that its chips will power Googles online gaming platform known as Stadia Shares of Nvidia and AMD combine for about  of SOXXs weightWhile that is not enough to make this chip fund a video game ETF it is enough to make SOXX an appropriate option for investors looking for indirect video game exposure via the ETF wrapper SOXX is higher by  this year First Trust Cloud Computing ETF SKYYExpense Ratio Some of the largest companies in the US such as Microsoft NASDAQMSFT and Amazon NASDAQAMZN have significant video game exposure but because video games are not the primary drivers of those companies revenue they do not reside in video game ETFsWhile it is not a proper video game ETF the First Trust Cloud Computing ETF NASDSAQSKYY has some legitimated video game credibility Mobile game maker Zynga NASDAQZNGA is SKYYs

the cloud gaming industry according to ETMG Cloud gaming allows gamers access to supercomputers that can render highend games exceeding the processing power that normal hardware players are capable of iShares Expanded TechSoftware Sector ETF IGVExpense Ratio As its name implies the iShares Expanded TechSoftware Sector ETF CBOEIGV is a software fund not a dedicated video game ETF However IGV does have ample video game exposure because many companies in this space are software makersMicrosoft is IGVs largest holding at a weight of just over   a relevant point because the company is the maker of the Xbox console Additionally a point that gets overlooked because of Microsofts sprawling businesses including business software and the cloud is that the company is actually the fourthlargest video game company in the USVideo game makers Activision Electronic Arts and TakeTwo Interactive Software NASDAQTTWO combine for nearly  of IGVs weight Global X Social Media ETF SOCL Expense Ratio The Global X Social Media ETF NASDAQSOCL is a valid alternative for a traditional video game ETF for several reasons Chinas Tencent Holdings OTCTCEHY is SOCLs largest holding at a weight of nearly  and that company is a significant footprint in Chinas growing video game market In fact China is the worlds largest video game marketBolstering the case for video game growth in China is that the government there approved nearly  games in the first quarter most of which were not traditional poker or gamblingrelated board games SOCLs video game ETF status is boosted by exposure to Alphabet NASDAQGOOG NASDAQGOOGL Facebook and Zynga among othersWith so many gamers turning to multiplayer games and using these games to interact with friends and make new acquaintances the intersections of social media and gaming are potentially limitless and highly lucrative for advertisers and game makers Simply put SOCL is a social media fund but its video game ETF credentials have the potential to exponentially grow in the years ahead Communication Services Select Sector SPDR XLCExpense Ratio The Communication Services Select Sector SPDR NYSEARCAXLC is the first ETF dedicated to the communication services sector which debuted last year As such this fund features massive exposure to Facebook and the two share classes of Alphabet Those stocks combine for almost  of XLCs weight giving this fund video game ETF viabilityActivision Blizzard is also a top  holding in XLC and Electronic Arts and TakeTwo also reside in this fund XLC would see its video game ETF credentials increase if Netflix NASDAQNFLX and Walt Disney NYSEDIS which combine for  of the funds weight bolster their video game exposureUltimately XLC has some video game exposure but the average market value

financial markets have rebounded in  so have shares of nowcloud giant Microsoft NASDAQMSFT Owing to its operational stability lack of any prominent headwinds and robust exposure to secular growth tailwinds in the cloud market MSFT stock was largely insulated from the late  market selloffUntil December Then markets fell off a cliff So did MSFT stock In just a few weeks it spiraled from  to Since then its been nothing but up up and away for MSFT stock The shares rebounded back above  by the end of the year They cruised past  by February and by April sailed above  All together MSFT stock has rebounded  over the past few months to trade at fresh alltime highs todayInvestorPlace  Stock Market News Stock Advice  Trading Tips Q Numbers Will Be Gut CheckThis rally is about to get a gut check Microsoft reports third quarter numbers next week Considering how far and how fast Microsoft stock has come over the past few months the company needs these numbers to be good in order for the stock to hold onto its yeartodate gainsWill the numbers be good I think so Everything Im looking at suggests that Microsofts cloud business has been on fire over the past few months Ultimately that should lead to headline beating numbers which will keep the rally in MSFT stock aliveBigger picture continued cloud strength will keep MSFT stock on a longerterm winning trajectory Until that cloud strength cools MSFT stock will keep making new highs Investors Brushed Off Earlier DisappointmentBroadly speaking Microsofts upcoming third quarter earnings report is critical because it has the power to either confirm or negate the big yeartodate rally in MSFT stock    SP  Stocks to Weather the Earnings Storm To be sure this isnt the first time weve heard numbers from Microsoft in  Back in late January the company delivered Q numbers that were largely underwhelming The big negative Slowing growth Revenue growth slowed from  in Q to  in Q while operating profit lost its mojo with growth sliding from  to  The culprit behind slower top and bottomline growth Slowing cloud expansion and that wasnt a bullish sign since the Microsoft growth narrative goes as its cloud businesses goBut investors largely brushed off those slowing growth concerns and MSFT stock has rallied ever since Why Because investors chalkedup slowing Q cloud growth to broadly deteriorating global economic conditions Those global conditions have meaningfully improved since late  and as such investors are thinking that maybe the Q cloud slowdown at Microsoft was just a blip on the radar They reason that Q numbers should be much betterFrom this perspective Microsoft needs to report a solid Q in order to satisfy bulls and keep MSFT stock in rally mode Earnings Will Be GoodFortunately I think Microsoft will deliver solid thirdquarter numbersOver the past several months Exxon NYSEXOM has tapped Microsoft as its cloud service provider in what is reportedly the largest cloud computing partnership in the oil industry Volkswagen struck a similar large cloud deal Meanwhile Microsoft has teamed up with Adobe NASDAQADBE VMWare NYSEVMW and Slack in separate landmark partnerships all of which have only broadened the utility and use cases of Microsofts enterprise cloud solutions Microsoft has also been named as one of the finalist for the Pentagons huge JEDI contract with the other being Amazon NASDAQAMZNIn other words it appears that over the past several months Microsofts cloud businesses have regained momentum that was lost in late  This momentum will show up through improved Q growth rates which will excite bulls and keep the stock in rally mode    HighRisk Stocks With Big Potential Rewards Longer term this trend should continue to play out in favor of MSFT stock The global cloud growth narrative is still in its first few innings and Microsoft has established itself as an entrenched and dominant player in that industry Thus as cloud becomes a bigger and bigger piece of the total Microsoft pie overall growth rates and margins will continue to improve That will lead to healthy profit growth which will ultimately keep MSFT stock on a winning trajectory Bottom Line on MSFT StockThe big picture here is very easy to digest Cloud is a huge growth industry and Microsoft is right at the heart of all that growth Thanks to the companys dominant position in the secular growth

NASDSAQMSFT has been on a winning streak given its diversified business portfolio and ability to deliver growth and financial results in a timely manner Analysts continue to rally around the stock heading into its earnings announcement on April  which makes sense given the momentum on the charts and sustained interest for a variety of Microsofts products both for consumers and within the enterprise as wellThe growth narrative tied to Azure Cloud drives much of the upside commentary among analysts despite the growth rate from Azure is expected to decelerate over the next coupleyears MSFT still trades at a fairly reasonable valuation at x earnings The companys current market capitalization is  Billion with psychological resistance at  Trillion or  Chances are Microsoft can reach

companies tend to trade at a bit a premium multiple given the defensiveness plus recurring revenue of the business model Just look at Adobe for example which trades at x earnings right now despite EPS growth expectations of  Microsoft trades at x earnings with consensus expecting  earnings for FY So theres definitely some room for Microsoft to trade at a higher when compared to other software companies in the segmentUBS analyst Jennifer Swanson Lowe remains optimistic on Microsoft heading into Q Microsoft shares had a slow start to the year as concerns about slower hardware purchasing from

clearly wants to trend higher and Microsoft does have a fairly solid trackrecord of meeting or beating consensus expectations While Microsoft is a mature growth stock the current consensus still

financial outlook to get the stock trending up to  It seems doable given the stocks momentum and the valuation comparisons to some of its other software peers Despite the catalysts tied to earnings the summer months should also be interesting as theres a number of game software companies riding on this summers E conference like Electronic Arts and Activision BlizzardAt this years E  Conference Microsoft is expected to announce the Xbox  which will launch next year but the preview announcement could add some excitement to the stock as it looks to renew interest in its gaming franchise Microsofts gaming business produced B revenue in FY making it a big enough of a business for Microsoft to start pouring resources into it With the opportunity to refresh its console lineup it would be a big opportunity for Microsoft to announce more exclusive titles developed inhouse to regain momentum versus Sony and also build a larger installed base of Xbox Live subscribers from  million which has grown fairly stagnant in the past four quartersBottom LineImprovements in gaming related announcements along with the announcement of earnings on April th will add some positive sentiment to the stock Analysts seem relatively optimistic on the company and its hard to mess up on the announcement of a nextgeneration console this year so the buzz generating commentary will keep Microsoft

VanEck Vectors Video Gaming and eSports ETF ESPOExpense Ratio In the video game ETF realm the VanEck Vectors Video Gaming and eSports ETF NYSEARCAESPO is the most direct competitor to the aforementioned GAMR ESPO which debuted last October is not just a video game ETF The fund is one of the best avenues for exposure to the booming esports marketESPO tracks the Global Video Gaming and esports Index Many of the dedicated esports companies are not yet publicly traded so ESPOs  holdings run the gamut of video game makers such as Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts semiconductor

appropriate option for investors looking for indirect video game exposure via the ETF wrapper SOXX is higher by  this year First Trust Cloud Computing ETF SKYYExpense Ratio Some of the largest

have ample video game exposure because many companies in this space are software makersMicrosoft is IGVs largest holding at a weight of just over   a relevant point because the company is the maker of

that company is a significant footprint in Chinas growing video game market In fact China is the worlds largest video game marketBolstering the case for video game growth in China is that the government there approved nearly  games in the first quarter most of which were not traditional poker or gamblingrelated board games SOCLs video game ETF status is boosted by exposure to Alphabet NASDAQGOOG NASDAQGOOGL Facebook and Zynga among othersWith so many gamers turning to multiplayer games and using these games to interact with friends and make new acquaintances the intersections of social media and gaming are potentially limitless and highly lucrative for advertisers and game makers Simply put SOCL is a social media fund but its video game ETF credentials have the potential to

financial markets have rebounded in  so have shares of nowcloud giant Microsoft NASDAQMSFT Owing to its operational stability lack of any prominent headwinds and robust exposure to secular growth tailwinds in the cloud market MSFT stock was largely insulated from the late  market selloffUntil December Then markets fell off a cliff So did MSFT stock In just a few weeks it spiraled from  to Since then its been nothing but up up and away for MSFT stock The shares rebounded back above  by the end of the year They cruised past  by February and by April sailed above  All together MSFT stock has rebounded  over the past few months to trade at fresh alltime highs todayInvestorPlace  Stock Market News Stock Advice  Trading Tips Q Numbers Will Be Gut CheckThis rally is about to get a gut check Microsoft reports third quarter numbers next week Considering how far and how fast Microsoft stock has come over the past few months the company needs these numbers to be good in order for the stock to hold onto its yeartodate gainsWill the numbers be good I think so Everything Im looking at suggests that Microsofts cloud business has been on fire over the past few months Ultimately that should lead to headline beating numbers which will keep the rally in MSFT stock aliveBigger picture continued cloud strength will keep MSFT stock on a longerterm winning trajectory Until that cloud strength cools MSFT stock will keep making new highs Investors Brushed Off Earlier DisappointmentBroadly speaking Microsofts upcoming third quarter earnings report is critical because it has the power to either confirm or negate the big yeartodate rally in MSFT stock    SP  Stocks to Weather the Earnings Storm To be sure this isnt the first time weve heard numbers from Microsoft in  Back in late January the company delivered Q numbers that were largely underwhelming The big negative Slowing growth Revenue growth slowed from  in Q to  in Q while operating profit lost its mojo with growth sliding from  to  The culprit behind slower top and bottomline growth Slowing cloud expansion and that wasnt a bullish sign since the Microsoft growth narrative goes as its cloud businesses goBut investors largely brushed off those slowing growth concerns and MSFT stock has rallied ever since Why Because investors chalkedup slowing Q cloud growth to broadly deteriorating global economic conditions Those global conditions have meaningfully improved since late  and as such investors are thinking that maybe the Q cloud slowdown at Microsoft was just a blip on the radar They reason that Q numbers should be much betterFrom this perspective Microsoft needs to report a solid Q in order to satisfy bulls and keep MSFT stock in rally mode Earnings Will Be GoodFortunately I think Microsoft will deliver solid thirdquarter numbersOver the past several months Exxon NYSEXOM has tapped Microsoft as its cloud service provider in what is reportedly the largest cloud computing partnership in the oil industry Volkswagen struck a similar large cloud deal Meanwhile Microsoft has teamed up with Adobe NASDAQADBE VMWare NYSEVMW and Slack in separate landmark partnerships all of which have only broadened the utility and use cases of Microsofts enterprise cloud solutions Microsoft has also been named as one of the finalist for the Pentagons huge JEDI contract with the other being Amazon NASDAQAMZNIn other words it appears that over the past several months Microsofts cloud businesses have regained momentum that was lost in late  This momentum will show up through improved Q growth rates which will excite bulls and keep the stock in rally mode    HighRisk Stocks With Big Potential Rewards Longer term this trend should continue to play out in favor of MSFT stock The global cloud growth narrative is still in its first few innings and Microsoft has established itself as an entrenched and dominant player in that industry Thus as cloud becomes a bigger and bigger piece of the total Microsoft pie overall growth rates and margins will continue to improve That will lead to healthy profit growth which will ultimately keep MSFT stock on a winning trajectory Bottom Line on MSFT StockThe big picture here is very easy to digest Cloud is a huge growth industry and Microsoft is right at the heart of all that growth Thanks to the companys dominant position in the secular growth

financial markets have rebounded in  so have shares of nowcloud giant Microsoft NASDAQMSFT Owing to its operational stability lack of any prominent headwinds and robust exposure to secular growth tailwinds in the cloud market MSFT stock was largely insulated from the late  market selloffUntil December Then markets fell off a cliff So did MSFT stock In just a few weeks it spiraled from  to Since then its been nothing but up up and away for MSFT stock The shares rebounded back above  by the end of the year They cruised past  by February and by April sailed above  All together MSFT stock has rebounded  over the past few months to trade at fresh alltime highs todayInvestorPlace  Stock Market News Stock Advice  Trading Tips Q Numbers Will Be Gut CheckThis rally is about to get a gut check Microsoft reports third quarter numbers next week Considering how far and how fast Microsoft stock has come over the past few months the company needs these numbers to be good in order for the stock to hold onto its yeartodate gainsWill the numbers be good I think so Everything Im looking at suggests that Microsofts cloud business has been on fire over the past few months Ultimately that should lead to headline beating numbers which will keep the rally in MSFT stock aliveBigger picture continued cloud strength will keep MSFT stock on a longerterm winning trajectory Until that cloud strength cools MSFT stock will keep making new highs Investors Brushed Off Earlier DisappointmentBroadly speaking Microsofts upcoming third quarter earnings report is critical because it has the power to either confirm or negate the big yeartodate rally in MSFT stock    SP  Stocks to Weather the Earnings Storm To be sure this isnt the first time weve heard numbers from Microsoft in  Back in late January the company delivered Q numbers that were largely underwhelming The big negative Slowing growth Revenue growth slowed from  in Q to  in Q while operating profit lost its mojo with growth sliding from  to  The culprit behind slower top and bottomline growth Slowing cloud expansion and that wasnt a bullish sign since the Microsoft growth narrative goes as its cloud businesses goBut investors largely brushed off those slowing growth concerns and MSFT stock has rallied ever since Why Because investors chalkedup slowing Q cloud growth to broadly deteriorating global economic conditions Those global conditions have meaningfully improved since late  and as such investors are thinking that maybe the Q cloud slowdown at Microsoft was just a blip on the radar They reason that Q numbers should be much betterFrom this perspective Microsoft needs to report a solid Q in order to satisfy bulls and keep MSFT stock in rally mode Earnings Will Be GoodFortunately I think Microsoft will deliver solid thirdquarter numbersOver the past several months Exxon NYSEXOM has tapped Microsoft as its cloud service provider in what is reportedly the largest cloud computing partnership in the oil industry Volkswagen struck a similar large cloud deal Meanwhile Microsoft has teamed up with Adobe NASDAQADBE VMWare NYSEVMW and Slack in separate landmark partnerships all of which have only broadened the utility and use cases of Microsofts enterprise cloud solutions Microsoft has also been named as one of the finalist for the Pentagons huge JEDI contract with the other being Amazon NASDAQAMZNIn other words it appears that over the past several months Microsofts cloud businesses have regained momentum that was lost in late  This momentum will show up through improved Q growth rates which will excite bulls and keep the stock in rally mode    HighRisk Stocks With Big Potential Rewards Longer term this trend should continue to play out in favor of MSFT stock The global cloud growth narrative is still in its first few innings and Microsoft has established itself as an entrenched and dominant player in that industry Thus as cloud becomes a bigger and bigger piece of the total Microsoft pie overall growth rates and margins will continue to improve That will lead to healthy profit growth which will ultimately keep MSFT stock on a winning trajectory Bottom Line on MSFT StockThe big picture here is very easy to digest Cloud is a huge growth industry and Microsoft is right at the heart of all that growth Thanks to the companys dominant position in the secular growth cloud industry MSFT stock has secured a bright future for itselfAs of this writing Luke Lango was long ADBE and AMZN  More From InvestorPlace    Toxic Pot Stocks You Should Avoid     Stocks to Buy for

dividend stocks in the tech sector The company has been paying a regular dividend for more than  years and it has consistently increased year after yearLooking ahead Intels foray into AI should act as a catalyst for dividend growth The company sold  billion worth of AI chips last year and is confident of generating  billion in AI chip sales by  That shouldnt be a big deal for Chipzilla as it pegs its AIrelated total available market TAM in  at  billionSo Intel needs to corner just  of the TAM to realize its ambition That doesnt look like a big deal given its strategy of going after lucrative AIcentric markets such as data centers and selfdriving carsFor instance Intel has made solid advances in the selfdriving car space since the Mobileye acquisition The company is already supplying chips to Alphabets selfdriving subsidiary Waymo which is great news as Waymo has begun commercializing its autonomous ridesharing service in the US Whats more Intel plans to launch a commercial selfdriving taxi service in Israel this year in association with VolkswagenIntel will retrofit its selfdriving solutions into existing Volkswagen cars to deliver Level  or  autonomy Success on this front would

of this lucrative opportunity through its Azure cloud service The companys Azure cloud revenue shot up  in the last reported quarter pushing the companys overall commercial cloud business up by  to

Azure cloud that can be used by enterprises to simplify AI deployments allowing them to reduce the time taken to get AI models functioning Microsoft customers are already using Azure Machine Learning Service to improve assurance an agreement in which an insurer covers a certain event such as death and predict energy demandMicrosofts cloud infrastructure is also being tapped by companies developing selfdriving cars This is another big opening for the chipmaker as the number of cars connecting to the internet will continue to growWhats more Azure is driving Microsofts profitability pushing up the margin of its commercial cloud business by  percentage points last quarter With the acceleration of its cloud computing business Microsofts bottomline growth should accelerate Thats probably why

even though the Dow lost ground for the first time in a long while some of its components posted solid gains Below well take a look at Merck NYSE MRK Pfizer NYSE PFE and Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT to see why they were the best stocks in the Dow in MRK ChartMoreMRK data by YChartsGood times for healthcareMercks and Pfizers big gains show that healthcare was a key sector for the stock market during  Even though the returns from the two pharmaceutical giants werent enough to keep the Dow from losing ground for the year their gains of  and  respectively played their part in minimizing the averages overall lossesFor Merck the big success lately has been Keytruda a cancer drug that has demonstrated an ability to reduce risks of death when combined with chemotherapy treatments Sales of the drug doubled during the first three quarters of  and some analysts believe that Keytrudas annual revenue could clear the  billion mark within the next few years Even with potential competition Merck is optimistic that the drugs future is bright Moreover with other key treatments like its Januvia type  diabetes drug still generating plenty of sales Merck has the cash flow to sustain a dividend yielding nearly  while also growing its business organicallyPerson looking at a pill held in a glove with dozens of other pills on a glass tableMoreImage source Getty ImagesMeanwhile Pfizer has seen gains stemming largely from decisions to restructure itself internally The drug giant said in July that it expects to create three business segments one for innovative medicines one for established medicines and the last for consumer healthcare products Moreover with Pfizer deciding within the last couple of weeks to work with rival GlaxoSmithKlineto combine their consumer healthcare units into a single joint venture its possible that shareholders will receive shares of that business in a spinoff transaction That would make Pfizers stock a purer play on pharmaceuticals which has been the highergrowth business for quite a while A  dividend yield has also been a positive for Pfizer especially among defensive investors looking for income to offset the risks of capital losses from their investmentsStory continuesMicrosoft keeps moving higherMicrosoft comes in third in this years list of Dow stocks but whats particularly impressive about the software giants appearance on the list is that it also did extremely well in  rising  That puts this years  gain into a different perspective and the extent to which the stock has held onto its positive returns despite recent market turbulence is encouraging for shareholdersMoreover Microsoft has been vying for the leadership position in terms of overall market capitalization upending some of its tech rivals in the process and finishing the year in the top spot for the first time since  The way its achieved those heights is by reinventing itself as a subscriptionbased software provider offering key platforms like its Office productivity software suite to users on a monthly basis rather than solely selling onetime licenses that required users to upgrade at later dates in order to get updated features Millions of customers have decided that having the latest access to the newest software features is worth what turns out to be higher costs than simply buying a onetime license and hanging onto the software for a long time and thats sent Microsoft profits soaring Moreover by offering key software to users of operating systems other than Windows  especially iOS  Microsoft has tapped into a much larger customer base and reaped the rewards accordinglyWhats ahead for the Dow in Among these three stocks Microsoft has the greatest potential for fast future growth in  Even as some positive trends in the technology industry start to slow down and reverse course Microsoft has the benefit of providing needed services to enterprise customers and individual consumers Efforts to move into highgrowth areas like cloud computing have also borne fruit and should continue to gain importance for the companyFor Merck and Pfizer a lot depends on regulatory threats that could have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry Many defensive investors turn to healthcare as a stalwart industry during economically troubled times but these two stocks could give up ground if they cant find new and innovative treatments to keep their pipelines full of candidates likely to become tomorrows blockbustersInvestors want the Dow to rebound in  and these stocks have a role to play If the market bounces back it might well be because these leaders continue to move higher over the next year More From The Motley Fool    Best Stocks to Buy Today  Teresa Kersten an employee of LinkedIn a Microsoft

Microsoft was in  iQiyi is fresh to the market as a publicly traded company The streamingvideo provider which had its IPO at the end of March has sometimes been called the Netflix of China though in truth its model is currently closer to Hulus The stock has been volatile in its first couple months but Im bullish on the longterm prospectsIn some ways iQiyi looks more mature as a company than Microsoft did roughly three decades ago The streamingvideo companyoperates in a market that has established models to success generated roughly  billion in sales last year and counts more than  million people as viewers and was spun off from Chinese search giant Baidu meaning its pretty far removed from scrappy upstart status However while the streaming video service industry is more well defined than the computer business was in  I still think iQiyi has paths to explosive growth and thus I purchased shares shortly after the companys market debutiQiyi is growing sales at a fast clip with overall sales up  year over year in its Marchended quarter and addedservice revenue up  compared to the prioryear period Thats plenty impressive and I think that iQiyi can continue to better monetize and expand the reach of its servicesRoughly  of Chinas population has yet to connect to the internet suggesting that theres still a lot of potential for the company to grow its viewer base iQiyi is also making progress on getting members on board with premium service offerings and will likely see continued success on that front as the Chinese middle class undergoes rapid increases in size purchasing powerStory continuesIm a fan of companies that deal in creating and delivering content and as tech ramps up and consolidation continues to reshape industries iQiyi looks to be a

at Morgan Stanley projected that by  the global market would be grossly oversupplied Albemarle responded with a record first quarter for its lithium segment  and market projections of its ownFor context Morgan Stanley said the lithium market would be oversupplied by  considering producers are expected to churn out  metric tons MT that year To balance out the supply with demand electric vehicles would need to hit an absurd  of all passenger vehicles sold that year according to the investment bank Albemarle countered by saying the total lithium market would be  MT by  but that only  of passenger vehicles would need to wield even a moderatesized battery to make the numbers workThe wide discrepancy in projections could demonstrate that few really know where the lithium market will be by the middle of the next decade Or it could show that the worlds largest lithium producer has more insight into the market from the customers it supplies than Wall Street analystsEither way Albemarle is ramping up its lithium output in two waves After producing  MT in  it wants to expand to  MT by  then to  MT after that Thats rather impressive Considering it accounted for  of the global market last year producing  MT by  would account for  of the global market should it reach the companys projected volume With selling prices high sales volumes increasing and a leading position in an important st century market the astonishing growth could just be getting started for this stockProfiting from smart homesDaniel Miller Control If finding stocks about to go on the wild ride like

had just publicly released Windows  and the billionairemaking juggernaut we know today was nowhere in sight But early investors could have cashed in some magnificent returns over the years Microsoft shares have gained a staggering  so far and would have returned  if you reinvested your dividendsThose extreme gains are in the rear view mirror now but thenext Microsoft is surely out there somewhere So we asked a handful of your fellow investors here at The Motley Fool to point us toward some lessknown companies that could be similar giant winners over the long runRead on to see why Canopy Growth

brimming with gold and jewelryMoreImage source Getty ImagesAlready one step ahead of RedmondAnders Bylund Universal Display In  Microsoft had been around for more than a decade but Windows was a brandnew product and the companys graphical user interface was playing catchup to Apples NASDAQ AAPL Macintosh The glory days of gamechanging success still lay far ahead and annual sales came up just short of  millionI would argue that Universal Display is better positioned today than Microsoft was thenThe display technology researcher was founded way back in  entered the stock market in  and reports annual sales of  million today Universal Display is a solidly profitable cashgenerator and has established longterm contracts with every highdefinition screen maker that matters You can find its patented organic lightemitting diode technology in every major brand of smartphone including bestsellers like the iPhone X and the Samsung NASDAQOTH SSNLF Galaxy SIts next major growth market lies in bigscreen television sets where street prices are coming down to mainstream levels in a hurry After that OLED elements should start making their way into everyday lighting equipment as manufacturing capacities ramp up and product costs come crashing downCome back in  years and we expect youll see that Universal Display invested the windfalls from those early successes into nextgeneration technologies No longer a small fish in the huge technology market youll be looking at a familiar name whose products are found in every household every business every public spaceThere are no guarantees of course but Universal Display is poised to follow right in Microsofts storied footsteps Its just that the target market looks a little bit differentGet your portfolio higherJeremy Bowman Canopy Growth CorpIn  Microsoft had just IPOed and the world was on the cusp of the personal computing revolution Thanks to some clever maneuvering and a partnership with IBM MSDOS had become the leading operating system at the time and Microsoft would parlay its advantage into a PC empire that included the Windows operating system and its suite of office softwareToday one industry that reminds me of PCs in the s is marijuana Though its not a tech product legal marijuana has the potential to revolutionize broad swaths of American society and culture the way technology has and some estimates say it could be worth  billion by  By comparison the alcoholic beverage market is worth more than  billion While its still a controversial political issue marijuanas eventual legalization seems likely as even a majority of Republican voters now favor itStory continuesThere are a number of competitors angling for position but one that has a head start isCanopy Growth Corporation Based in Canada its primed to take advantage of the expected boom when marijuana becomes legal in that country in July Canopy owns Tweed the most recognized marijuana production brand in the world thats targeted at the recreational market as well as medicalgrade and international medical brands Bedrocan and SpectrumThe company has forged a strategic partnership withConstellation BrandsNYSE STZ the US importer of Corona and other Modelo beers which includes exchanging knowledge and potentially developing cannabisbased beverages together Constellation took a  stake in CanopyWith a market cap now at more than  billion Canopys valuation is premised on it gaining a significant piece of the marijuana market but if it executes effectively the stock will be worth several times what it is todayThe stcentury payment platformTravis Hoium Square Microsofts success in the s and s was driven in large part by the fact that it was a platform businesses used to improve productivity Once customers got used to using Microsoft products at work they brought them home creating a network effect that drove growth and profitability Square is doing something similar with its products for small businessesSquare isnt just a payment processor It provides services like appointment handling payroll scheduling and more This makes the platform valuable for those who are building a business and those entrepreneurs have been adopting Square at a rapid rateSQ Revenue TTM ChartMoreSQ Revenue TTM data by YChartsYou can see that Square isnt highly profitable which Microsoft was in  but its margins are beginning to improve as it grows Look for that to continue as the operating expenses it incurred to build out the platform start to pay off and Square leverages a higher revenue baseWhat makes me really excited about Square is its Square Cash app which could act as a money exchange system without the credit card and banking fees that eat away at Squares bottom line If Square can

 Top CashRich Stocks to BuyYahooSearchNo matching results for Tip Try a valid symbol or a specific company name for relevant resultsGive feedback on the new search experienceCancelSign inMailFinanceWatchlistsMy PortfolioScreenersMarketsIndustriesVideosNewsPersonal FinanceTechUS Markets closedSP Dow NasdaqRussell Crude OilGoldSilverEURUSD Top CashRich Stocks to BuyJamal Carnette CFA The Motley FoolMotley FoolDecember  ReblogShareTweetShareOne of the first rules of business is the maxim Cash is king And thats because cash provides optionality Companies with large cash and cashequivalent piles can more easily invest in research and development or give back this money to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacksTherefore its preferable investors look for companies with large and growing cash piles on their balance sheets First as a shareholder youre entitled to a prorata portion of the companys cash Second while not an official generally accepted accounting principlesGAAP figure free cash flow  a metric that measures how much cash a company generates in each period  is more important than traditional earnings metrics A recent research report in the CFA InstitutesFinancial Analysts Journal found cash flow is a better indicator of stock returns than net incomeChess pieces and cash on a chess board with king on top of cashMoreImage Source Getty ImagesPay attention to how cash is generatedFor investors its key to do more than simply find companies with large cash hoards on their balance sheets There are a variety of ways a company can boost its cash pile The easiest path is to take out debtOn the balance sheet an entry would be made to increase cash an asset while recording a corresponding increase in bonds payable a liability No economic value equity is created and future operations will need to support the debts interest obligationAnother way to grow cash quickly is to convert an asset via a sale In this circumstance the sold asset would be removed from the balance sheet and cash would increase While there may be an increase in cash greater or less than the assets value on the balance sheet increasing the cash pile via issuing debt or by asset sales are considered unsustainable In the long run cash must be generated through business operationsToo much cash is not always a good thingHaving a large cash pile is not always considered a positive by investors While it beats the alternative  not having cash on the balance sheet especially if a company has obligations  growing cash piles can signify a potentially lowergrowth future Growth investors sometimes interpret excessive cash piles as an indication management no longer has viable valuecreating projects to enter into Finally excessive cash can indicate a company has failed to invest in other parts of the business eg research and development RD technology and employeesA secondary issue of too much cash on the balance sheet is often that large cash piles lead to suboptimal managerial actions like stock buybacks when the company is overvalued failed mergers and acquisitions or spending huge sums on entering into new businesses when an incremental approach would have been preferable Two major studies confirmed the curse of too much cash One from Revelation Investment Research found companies with a large amount of cash foreshadowed poor stock returns the following year Another study from the University of Toronto found that companies with high levels of excess cash underperformed the market in downturnsThe key is finding companies with large cash piles adequate investments in the company and strong management which are generating substantial cash from operationsStory continuesTop three companies by cash holdings  Company Cash in Billions     Apple NASDAQ AAPL    Microsoft NASDAQ MSFT    Alphabet NASDAQ GOOG NASDAQ GOOGL   Data taken from each companys latest quarterly annual reportApples cash pile will continue to growApples cash pile is the stuff of legends Currently sitting at  billion the companys cash holdings have shot up tenfold in the past decade as it redefined the smartphone Critics counter that the company has also grown its combined debt  long and short term  from nothing to approximately  billion as the company has returned approximately  billion in cash back to investors in the form of share buybacks and dividendsHowever it would be folly to assume the company will not continue to grow its cash pile Apple generated  billion in free cash flow in the last fiscal year more than enough to pay for dividends and other cash usage In fact a large reason for Apples debt spree is due to arcane taxation rules that prohibit the company from repatriating cash without generating hefty taxesAlso Apples growing cash pile is not at the expense of research and development Last fiscal year the company poured  billion into RD And its paying off as colleague Adam LevineWeinberg notesthat the companys recently released iPhone X  with its nextgen FaceID technology As my colleague Evan Niu wrote Apple would bethe biggest beneficiary of the GOP tax bill and will save up to  billion in taxesAlthough the companys iPhone accounts for the majority of its revenue Apples path forward is to focus on growing stickier subscriptionbased services to diversify its topline Last quarter the company reported

continue to grow its cash pile for years to comeBallpoint pen and financial statementMoreImage Source Getty ImagesMicrosofts cloud will lead the company forwardMicrosoft has experienced a resurgence under CEO Satya Nadella Prior CEO Steve Ballmer wanted to expand Microsofts presence in hardware a tough business for anybody not named Apple Instead Satya has transitioned the company to nextgeneration technology like cloud computing and expanded the Microsoft Office  offering which brings in sticky subscriptionbased revenueOne thing Microsoft has always been strong at is generating cash Software is a highmargin and scalable business two factors that are great for cash generation Like Apple Microsoft generates considerable cash through operations Over the last  months the company has produced  million in free cash flow more than enough to pay its dividend buy back significant shares and still grow its cash pileThere are a few red flags with Microsofts growing cash pile  the software maker has also grown its debt with long and shortterm debt totaling more than  billion combined Twenty billion dollars of this debt was added to pay for the LinkedIn acquisition Under Ballmer Microsoft could have been a case study for poor acquisitions with aQuantive and Nokia MobilityMicrosoft investors should look to the cloudcomputing for future growth and the company is showing amazing

cloud market to grow from  billion this year to  billion in  giving Microsoft considerable tailwinds to continue to grow its cash pileAlphabetIn a recurring theme the company with the thirdlargest

has returned  billion in buybacks but nothing in dividends As a point of comparison Apple and Microsoft have paid out  billion and  billion respectively in the last  months The company has also been more judicious with debt holding less than  billion total on its books Instead Alphabet has focused on RD to create new products The company has been criticized for its moonshots  longodds bets that should handsomely reward investorsWhile these moonshots may add to Alphabets cash pile in the years to come so far they have not Instead its the companys Google division that adds to its cash pile In the short and midterm look for that to continue Advertising market research firm eMarketer expects Alphabet alone will take  of total US digital advertising revenue in  with an estimated  billion haul The combination of increased market share and increased digital ad spending will push Alphabets digital ad revenue to  billion by  good for  annualized growthCash rules everything around usCash is an important asset but its more important for investors to focus on how the company generated the cash and more importantly its ability to continue to generate these enviable cash piles On its own large cash holding can be a poor reason to invest in a company However companies that are growing their cash piles through strong dependable business operations warrant further investigation from investors

even Uber have joined Google and other tech titans in actively opposing the California Consumer Privacy Act As The Verge saw in the states disclosure records the three giants contributed a significant amount of money to a campaign pushing back against the initiative Amazon and Microsoft donated  each while Uber pitched in a smallerbutstillnoteworthy donation worth  Google ATT Facebook and Verizon  four of the first corporations that backed the fight against the initiative  all plunked down  Facebook and Verizon eventually withdrew their support however with the former doing so after Mark Zuckerberg was hauled in front of Congress to answer questions about the Cambridge Analytica scandalThe California Consumer Privacy Act aims to give California residents the right to know what kind of data companies have on them and to tell those companies not to sell their personal info Tech companies believe that it could ruin the way they develop their products and do business A spokesperson for Amazon told The Verge for instance While we share the initiatives overarching goal of protecting consumer privacy we are concerned by unworkable requirements that would hinder our ability to innovate on behalf of our customersCommittee to Protect California Jobs spokesperson Steven Maviglio echoed that in a statement to Govtech He said that bill author Alastair Mactaggart didnt consider the workability of his proposal and that its nigh impossible for tech giants to comply with it Anyone who orders anything from Amazon can request where their information went and that can not only overwhelm a large company like Amazon but also smaller ones too the spokesperson explained Microsoft also released a statement that pretty much said the same thing We believe the California measure could have unintended consequences for both businesses and consumers and that there is a better way to give consumers the privacy rights they deserveSo far the Californians for Consumer Privacy Act has already collected  signatures Authorities have to be able to verify  signatures for the proposal to make it to the November ballot  well know for sure after the California Secretary of State announces the result on June th Even if it does make its way to the ballot the opposition now has a lot of money to spend on campaigns to fight its approval The Committee to Protect California Jobs

Will Microsoft ruling affect campaign contributions

June   
Web posted at   PM EDT  GMT


By Ian Christopher McCaleb

WASHINGTON CNN  Some Democratic lawmakers situated in Washington  most specifically current Vice President and presidential aspirant Al Gore  shouldnt expect too much in the way of campaign contributions from Microsoft following Wednesdays federal court ruling that the company be split into two separate entities





Microsoft officials including company cofounder and Chairman Bill Gates are none too pleased with the administration of President Bill Clinton and Vice President Gore which they hold at least partly responsible for the judges final ruling


In April Gates told a closeddoor meeting of the House Republican Conference that the company believed a different administration would likely have treated Microsoft more favorably than did the ClintonGore Administration


This despite an appearance at the White House by Gates during that very same trip to Washington for the administrations highprofile New Economy summit


On the afternoon of Wednesday April  Gates participated in a discussion panel at the conference He sat next to the president and the two appeared to get on well sharing the occasional private word as others spoke  belying the bitterness expressed by Gates to Republican majority lawmakers in the House


Sources on both sides  administration and Microsoft respectively  said at the time that the antitrust case against Microsoft was not discussed at that White House event


Just a day prior to the beginning of the New Economy summit a Microsoft source told CNN that Gates would accept Clintons invitation to attend saying he would do so to send a signal that the sprawling firm remained an economic powerhouse despite the contentious court proceedings


The White Houses invitation to Gates the source said tells us that the White House agrees


Gates who until very recently was not known as someone who wore his political leanings on his sleeve has attempted to match wits with the corporate adversaries whose complaints led to Judge Thomas Penfield Jacksons antitrust ruling against the company earlier this year with Judge Jackson himself and with the Clinton Justice Department by using the court system to his companys full advantage and by becoming more politically active


And what better way to engage in corporate activity than to crack open a few wallets  including his own

Cash decline for the Dems expected boosts for the Republicans

According to the Center for Responsive Politics Microsoft has contributed  million dollars in soft money to both major political parties this cycle   to the Democrats and  to Republicans


The software giant gave another  to individual candidates  and it is those numbers that tell the story behind the companys newfound political activism


The Center for Responsive Politics looked at how much Microsoft employees gave to the two presidential candidates  Gore and Republican Texas Gov George W Bush


According to the nonpartisan political contribution watchdogs database Gore received  in contributions from Microsoft employees from Jan   to Jan   while Bush received just a shade under  in the same time period


The watchdogs latest archived donation information was first made available by the Federal Election Commission on March 


Granted Gore received his money months before Jackson issued his premier antitrust ruling against Microsoft in April of this year and his popularity with Microsoft insiders is difficult to gauge based on numbers this old


But consider this In the same time period former New Jersey Sen Bill Bradley Gores Democratic rival during the primary season who posted no victories before withdrawing in March received  in donations from Microsoft employees


Since that time Microsofts lobbying operations have kicked into gear in Washington and their hardest work appears to center on Bushs campaign efforts


Gore says the nations antimonopoly laws are critical to fostering competition  something Gates and company may not want to hear in the long run


But Bush has taken a position that appears to be more sympathetic to Microsoft
                                              
You know the fundamental question is is Microsoft an innovative entity that is providing jobs are they disrupting an economy that is changing so rapidly I think the great fear is that Microsoft will be broken up Bush said recently
                                        
The Texas governor wont talk about the Microsoft case  now  at least until it is resolved But if it is still in the appeals court by the Clinton administrations end the next president might well be able to influence its outcome
                                        
If the case is in play then the next administration if it wanted to could try to settle with Microsoft on more generous terms than what this administration has pursued speculated Bob Litan of the Brookings Institute


A spokesman for Microsoft says Gates and the company are not even looking for a political solution  that it is a legal matter and theyll fight it in court


But their money is talking all the same


In May Microsoft participated in a highprofile Washington fundraiser for Bush Lobbyists for the firm sat on the member host committee for the event which at  a head aimed to raise some  to 


Indications are that Microsofts giving will continue and the next donation numbers released by the Federal Election Commission will be telling


Republican lawmakers are beginning to fall in behind Microsoft  Following Wednesdays ruling Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles ROklahoma said Today may be a good day for the Clinton administration legislationbylitigation agenda but it is a sad day for the American consumer


It is important to note that the Redmond Washingtonbased firm hasnt turned Republican just because of the efforts of the Clinton administrations Justice Department


Microsoft realizes there are many friendly Democrats out there and donated some  to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in the first three months of this year

Will Microsoft ruling affect campaign contributions

June   
Web posted at   PM EDT  GMT


By Ian Christopher McCaleb

WASHINGTON CNN  Some Democratic lawmakers situated in Washington  most specifically current Vice President and presidential aspirant Al Gore  shouldnt expect too much in the way of campaign contributions from Microsoft following Wednesdays federal court ruling that the company be split into two separate entities





Microsoft officials including company cofounder and Chairman Bill Gates are none too pleased with the administration of President Bill Clinton and Vice President Gore which they hold at least partly responsible for the judges final ruling


In April Gates told a closeddoor meeting of the House Republican Conference that the company believed a different administration would likely have treated Microsoft more favorably than did the ClintonGore Administration


This despite an appearance at the White House by Gates during that very same trip to Washington for the administrations highprofile New Economy summit


On the afternoon of Wednesday April  Gates participated in a discussion panel at the conference He sat next to the president and the two appeared to get on well sharing the occasional private word as others spoke  belying the bitterness expressed by Gates to Republican majority lawmakers in the House


Sources on both sides  administration and Microsoft respectively  said at the time that the antitrust case against Microsoft was not discussed at that White House event


Just a day prior to the beginning of the New Economy summit a Microsoft source told CNN that Gates would accept Clintons invitation to attend saying he would do so to send a signal that the sprawling firm remained an economic powerhouse despite the contentious court proceedings


The White Houses invitation to Gates the source said tells us that the White House agrees


Gates who until very recently was not known as someone who wore his political leanings on his sleeve has attempted to match wits with the corporate adversaries whose complaints led to Judge Thomas Penfield Jacksons antitrust ruling against the company earlier this year with Judge Jackson himself and with the Clinton Justice Department by using the court system to his companys full advantage and by becoming more politically active


And what better way to engage in corporate activity than to crack open a few wallets  including his own

Cash decline for the Dems expected boosts for the Republicans

According to the Center for Responsive Politics Microsoft has contributed  million dollars in soft money to both major political parties this cycle   to the Democrats and  to Republicans


The software giant gave another  to individual candidates  and it is those numbers that tell the story behind the companys newfound political activism


The Center for Responsive Politics looked at how much Microsoft employees gave to the two presidential candidates  Gore and Republican Texas Gov George W Bush


According to the nonpartisan political contribution watchdogs database Gore received  in contributions from Microsoft employees from Jan   to Jan   while Bush received just a shade under  in the same time period


The watchdogs latest archived donation information was first made available by the Federal Election Commission on March 


Granted Gore received his money months before Jackson issued his premier antitrust ruling against Microsoft in April of this year and his popularity with Microsoft insiders is difficult to gauge based on numbers this old


But consider this In the same time period former New Jersey Sen Bill Bradley Gores Democratic rival during the primary season who posted no victories before withdrawing in March received  in donations from Microsoft employees


Since that time Microsofts lobbying operations have kicked into gear in Washington and their hardest work appears to center on Bushs campaign efforts


Gore says the nations antimonopoly laws are critical to fostering competition  something Gates and company may not want to hear in the long run


But Bush has taken a position that appears to be more sympathetic to Microsoft
                                              
You know the fundamental question is is Microsoft an innovative entity that is providing jobs are they disrupting an economy that is changing so rapidly I think the great fear is that Microsoft will be broken up Bush said recently
                                        
The Texas governor wont talk about the Microsoft case  now  at least until it is resolved But if it is still in the appeals court by the Clinton administrations end the next president might well be able to influence its outcome
                                        
If the case is in play then the next administration if it wanted to could try to settle with Microsoft on more generous terms than what this administration has pursued speculated Bob Litan of the Brookings Institute


A spokesman for Microsoft says Gates and the company are not even looking for a political solution  that it is a legal matter and theyll fight it in court


But their money is talking all the same


In May Microsoft participated in a highprofile Washington fundraiser for Bush Lobbyists for the firm sat on the member host committee for the event which at  a head aimed to raise some  to 


Indications are that Microsofts giving will continue and the next donation numbers released by the Federal Election Commission will be telling


Republican lawmakers are beginning to fall in behind Microsoft  Following Wednesdays ruling Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles ROklahoma said Today may be a good day for the Clinton administration legislationbylitigation agenda but it is a sad day for the American consumer


It is important to note that the Redmond Washingtonbased firm hasnt turned Republican just because of the efforts of the Clinton administrations Justice Department


Microsoft realizes there are many friendly Democrats out there and donated some  to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in the first three months of this year

Microsoft to offer Linux software

SEATTLE Washington Reuters  In a major strategy shift Microsoft Corp will introduce software based on the Linux  open source operating system in  for Web services and server software market researcher META Group predicted on Monday


Microsoft which denied that it had any plans to develop software for Linux is facing a growing threat from the open source software standard as it gains share in the corporate server market used to manage networks and data


META Group predicted that Linux will be used on nearly half of new servers by  up from its current share of  to  percent making it difficult for Microsoft to ignore Linux as a platform for its database Web hosting and email server applications


We believe that beginning in late  Microsoft and its partners will begin moving some of its todate proprietary application enablers eg Net components to the Linux environment this will gradually include the major Microsoft backoffice products such as SQL Server IIS and Exchange META Group said

Group Microsoft will lower prices

In a further shift META Group said that Microsoft will also reprice or separate its Windows server operating system so that it can be favorably compared against free Linux


Im unaware of any efforts at this time to move any products onto Linux said Peter Houston senior director at Microsofts server group adding that there were no plans to detach or reprice its Windows server operating system


We have made a bet on Windows and we believe that customers are getting value from the bet we made said Houston and were going to continue doing what weve been doing for customers


Linux advocates argue that Linux offers better security flexibility and innovation because its underlying code or blueprint for programs remains open to evaluation and scrutiny


Microsoft which has grown into the worlds largest software maker by selling proprietary software that cannot be copied or modified freely said it is not opposed to opensource software and points out that its source code is available to approved partners and educational institutions on a limited basis


Microsoft faced a similar situation a decade ago when its nascent server software was competing headtohead with market leader Sun Microsystems Inc  but Microsoft did not choose at the time to write software for Suns proprietary version of Unix

Linux use grows

Now Linux essentially a free version of Unix is eating away at Suns share of the business server market


Sun a hardware and software maker is now selling computers running Linux a strategy that was also embraced by International Business Machines Corp


Redmond Washingtonbased Microsoft has toned down its criticism of Linux recently after an internal strategy document said that some of its arguments against open source software has backfired


Instead Microsoft has stressed that its software is more affordable when considering the total cost of using Linux including ongoing personnel and administration costs

Microsoft fights back

A recent Microsoftsponsored study by researcher IDC concluded that servers based on Microsofts Windows  were cheaper to own and operate when used for networking storing and sharing files printing and security while Linux servers were cheaper to operate when used for Web hosting


The IDC study shows that the upfront cost is a small part of the total cost to the customer said Microsofts Houston


META Groups report also came to the same conclusion saying that Linuxs total costs of ownership were likely to be higher for mainstream server applications


IT organizations must evaluate platform costs from a totalcostofownership perspective META Groups report said

After scanning a system with the tool users receive a security report card that lists all the holes and vulnerabilities found during the scan The MBSA does not actually download and install fixes but provides instructions how to do so
It can be installed on Windows  desktop and server operating systems as well as the Home and Professional Editions of Windows XP Microsoft said Users must also have version  or higher of Internet Explorer
The MBSA can also be used to scan for security holes on the following software Windows NT  Windows  Windows XP Internet Information Server  and  SQL Server  and  Internet Explorer  and later and Office  and XP

Developed with the help of Shavlik Technologies in St Paul Minnesota Microsoft first detailed the tool at the RSA Security Conference in February

 CNET  Microsoft has made some stumbles in the mobile world but a strategy shift made more than a year ago will soon pay dividends the companys top Windows Mobile executive said in an interview with CNET News 
Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer discusses his Windows Mobile offerings earlier this month at CES in Las Vegas 
 Andy Lees the executive brought over from the server unit a year ago said that Microsofts efforts to make sure that its mobile software could run on a wide range of phones resulted in an operating system that failed to take advantage of advances in hardware We aimed to go for a lower common denominator Lees said Microsoft was also limited by the origins of Windows Mobile which was developed to power handheld computers that neither connected to a network nor handled voice We started out when we were in PDAs personal digital assistants and then a phone got strapped to the back of the PDA Lees said The company also failed to recognize that phoneseven those that were used for businesswere still as much personal as they were professional Meanwhile Apple and Google have joined the fray with operating systems designed from the ground up to take advantage of the latest in phone technology But Lees said that Microsoft embarked on a new strategy some time ago that will come to fruition over the next  months The first steps in that strategy he said will be announced at the Mobile World Congress conference that takes place in Barcelona in the middle of next month

 CNET  Microsoft is gearing up to take on rival Apple in the smartphone market 
Microsoft and CEO Steve Ballmer will launch an online store for smartphone applications a report says 
 The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that Microsoft is getting ready to launch an online marketplace akin to Apples App Store Microsoft is also readying a more sophisticated version of its mobile operating system called Windows Mobile  the Journal reported Smartphones are sophisticated mobile phones that offer users access to the Web and email as well as provide phone calling and all kinds of other messaging options This category of device is the hottest thing going in the mobile market and is seen as the biggest growth engine for mobile devices over the next few years Microsoft which only makes the operating software for these devices holds third place in terms of worldwide market share according to research firm IDC Symbian which powers Nokias smartphones is by far the leader followed by Research In Motion with its BlackBerry devices  Even though Apple seems to be the most talked about smartphone on the market these days its only in fifth place in terms of overall market share for  IDC said But Apple is quickly gobbling up market share and has become a serious threat to Microsoft and every other company competing in the smartphone market With the release of the iPhone G last summer Apple has tripled its market share from  percent in  to  percent in  according to IDC

 Meanwhile Microsoft only grew from  percent market share in  to  percent in  Microsoft is facing several challenges as it tries to catch Apples growth rate For one the companys business model is based primarily on licensing software to hardware vendors While this business model worked fine just a couple of years ago its difficult to justify now given that device makers can get free software from Symbian Google Android and Linux The second problem that Microsoft faces is that the company has been almost exclusively focused on business customers Over the past year smartphone users have gravitated toward more consumer applications In addition to their work email they want multimedia functionality and socialnetworking applications on their phones Microsoft is in a really tough spot said Ryan Reith an analyst with IDC It has to change its value proposition And a big part of that is refreshing its user interface and making the device more consumerfriendly Reith believes this is why its critical for Microsoft to develop an application marketplace that can compete with Apples App Store The App Store went live last summer and offers thousands of applications for the iPhone and iPod Touch music player The store has been very successful with users downloading thousands of free and feebased applications Microsoft already has a developer community creating applications for Windows Mobile devices But the problem is that many of these applications have been geared toward business users And there is not a single destination that makes it easy for users to discover and download different applications Clearly smartphones are not just for business users anymore Reith said Microsoft needs to work with the developer community to get more consumer applications out there Microsofts executives have gotten the message that consumer functionality is hot And Andy Lees head of Microsofts mobile business unit told the Journal that the company is about to put more emphasis on multimedia and other consumer functions like music and photos Microsoft is expected to unveil its new offerings next week at the Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona Spain Chief Executive Steve Ballmer will be delivering a keynote speech there on February  I will be there next week covering the news from the show as will my CNET Reviews colleagues Bonnie Cha and Kent German But even with these enhancements Microsoft has a tough road ahead of it Competition in the smartphone market is increasing And several competitors including Android and RIM are launching their own version of an application store On the handset and operating system side new devices are coming to market that could provide stiff competition for Windows Mobile devices For example smartphone pioneer Palm is coming out with new mobile software and a device called Pre later this year And even though critics have been writing the companys obituary for the last year the new device which was unveiled last month at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas has been getting a lot of buzz But Microsoft thinks it has the right enhancements lined up to take on these competitors especially Apple The Journal also reported that Microsoft is talking about a new synchronized data storage service called My Phone This new service is supposed to make it easier for people to back up their mobile contacts calendar appointments photos and text messages to a Web site The service is similar to a service that Apple calls MobileMe The biggest difference will be that Microsoft will offer My Phone for free whereas Apple charges  a year for MobileMe Its too soon to know how Microsofts new software and application store will stack up against Apples offering But one thing is certain Apple isnt sitting still either And if Microsoft or any other competitors want to hasten Apples rise in this market theyll have to leapfrog Apple with something truly revolutionary

  SEATTLE Washington CNN   Software giant Microsoft apologized Wednesday for the apparent bad judgment that led to the head of a black model being swapped for that of a white model in an online advertisement 
A black man in an online Microsoft ad was replaced with a white man bottom on the companys Polish Web site 
 The ad  which showed three business people one Asian one white and one black  was altered on Microsofts Web site for Poland to place the head of a white man on a black mans body We apologized fixed the error and we are looking into how it happened said Lou Gellos a Microsoft spokesman  He said that because the company was still reviewing how the swap occurred he could not comment further   On Microsofts official page on the social network site Twitter a posting calls the swap a marketing mistake and offers sincere apologies The episode drew widespread criticism on the Internet after Engadget an influential tech blog published news of the gaffe Tuesday   The business Web site CNETcom wrote that the change in models may have been made with the racially homogeneous Polish market in mind CNET is a CNNcom content partner

  Microsoft Google expand searchengine toolsStory Highlights Microsoft and Google released new search products this week  Microsoft Bings visual search features images instead of text  Googles Fast Flip aims to replicate the magazine reading experience online  Products are evidence that searchengine market is diversifying Next Article in Technology   Read VIDEO  By  John D Sutter and Brandon Griggs CNN 



 


 

  CNN  Say youre buying a dog You know the breed you want you can picture it in your head But what was the name A bull terrier A pit bull A bull mastiff 

Bings visual search and Googles Fast Flip produce search results as images 


 Or what if youre in the market for a new camera You saw a friend with a creditcardthin model at a party last weekend But was that a Canon A Nikon A brand youve never heard of If youre like many people youd turn to the Internet for answers But you type in dog breeds or digital cameras into Google and punch enter and a big list of blue links comes up You dont see the dog you want You dont find the camera either  at least not quickly    Such quandaries are the driving force behind Bings new visual search function which lets Web users troll through image catalogues instead of Web pages when they know what something looks like but cant put their finger on the name The examples are also evidence that the search engine market once dominated by simple rectangular search bars and the lists of Web pages that follow is diversifying People who once were happy with a onesearchfitsall model are finding exceptions and a number of niche search products are trying to respond to these increasingly diverse needs   Also this week Google introduced a test product called Fast Flip which takes a retro look at Web design by making online news look like something magazine readers will find familiar

 The company has other news products  namely Google Reader and Google News  but is looking for ways to make news content more visual and to share some of the revenue The new products come as Microsofts Bing continues to elbow for more room in an online search market that Google has dominated for years In June  percent of all Internet searchers were done through Google sites according to comScore Microsoft caught only  percent of searchers in the same period Fast Flip an experimental feature of Google Labs is a Web application that allows users to scan news articles from  print and online publishers including The New York Times Newsweek TechCrunch and Us magazine Users can flip through a horizontal stream of screen grabs of articles as they appear on the partners Web sites with layout design and images intact You can click once on a story to enlarge the page a second click takes you to the partners site Users also can browse popular topics the economy Taylor Swift or search for others of their choosing Google says the idea behind the new service is to make online newsbrowsing faster and replicate the reading experience of flipping through a magazine or newspaper  Unlike Google News which emphasizes breaking news articles from the past  hours Fast Flip is more for stories with a longer shelf life Google spokesman Chris Gaither said We think theres a lot of room for innovation in how people consume news articles on the Web Gaither said The easier it is for people to browse articles quickly the more theyll read   Loren Baker editor of Search Engine Journal says that increases in bandwidth make visual search functions more successful today than in previous years when images would load more slowly Baker believes that Google Fast Flip could make it easier for people to scan news articles on their netbooks tablets or even smartphones I dont have to sift through my bookmarks I dont even have to leave Google he said Its almost like a virtual newsstand on my handheld But not everyone is excited about Googles new product   If this is the future of news I think news is kind of screwed said Frederic Lardinois a writer at ReadWriteWeb a technology blog Lardinois said the interface is backwardthinking and is hard to use Fast Flip is in a test phase and will incorporate feedback from users Gaither said Google also is seeking to expand the roster of Fast Flip partners he said Some tech observers say Bings hypervisual search function gives it a new leg up on Google in terms of functionality  Nova Spivack a search expert and founder of Twine said the most important thing about Bings visual search is that users can sort the images into categories  By creating different kinds of searches and making them sortable Bing is catering to highend Internet users  which soon will be everyone he said I think Bing has realized that everybody is becoming a search geek he said  On the dogbreed search example users can filter the images to include only terriers or hypoallergenic dogs or toy dogs or dogs that need a medium level of exercise so they dont have to scroll through hundreds of photos to find the dog theyre searching for   Mary Jo Foley editor of the All About Microsoft blog at ZDNet said she personally finds Bings visual search useless because shes not a visually minded person But she said its an example of search engines diversifying and thats a good thing for everyone I think the idea for Microsoft and Google and Yahoo is to present things in new ways and say What if you could do this Would you want to do it this way  She added Not all people search in the same way and not all people want to get their results in the same way There are about  galleries of images in the new Bing visual search bin but more will be added and eventually the idea will be integrated into the main search site said Stefan Weitz director of Bing Right now users have to go to a separate page to find the visual searches 





 David Coursey a blogger at PCWorldcom said the search works like a visual dictionary I think Bing is onto something he said And if they can figure out how to extend Bings visual search it could be very helpful for people who know what something looks like but dont know what to call it

   K Microsoft bounty to catch worm creatorStory Highlights Software giant Microsoft offers  bounty to catch Conficker author  Industry analysts say is one of the most serious infections they have ever seen  The worm exploits a bug in Microsofts ubiquitous Windows software  Virus could allow its creators to hijack entire networks Next Article in Technology    By  Barry Neild  CNN 



 


 

  CNN  Software giant Microsoft is offering a  reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of hackers behind a powerful computer virus that could lead to millions of PCs being hijacked 
Experts say a single infected laptop could expose an entire network to the worm 
 Experts have so far been baffled by the true purpose of the Conficker or Downadup virus but have described its spread as one of the most serious infections ever seen The worm exploits a bug in Microsoft Windows to infect mainly corporate networks then  although it has yet to cause any harm  it opens a link back to its point of origin meaning it can receive further orders to wreak havoc   Microsoft has issued a patch to fix the bug however if a single machine is infected in a large network it will spread unchecked  often reinfecting machines that have been disinfected The threat from the virus prompted Microsoft in collaboration with other technology industry names to this week announce a  reward for information to track down those behind Conficker

Virus exposes PCs to hijack


 As part of Microsofts ongoing security efforts we constantly look for ways to use a diverse set of tools and develop methodologies to protect our customers said George Stathakopoulos of Microsofts Trustworthy Computing Group Mikko Hypponen chief research officer at antivirus firm FSecure says the true scope of the virus is not known but in the past  hours his company monitored Conficker signals from two million Internet protocol addresses Thats a lot he told CNN And one IP address here does not mean one infected computer it means at least one infected computer  Many of those IP addresses are obviously company proxies or firewalls hiding hundreds of more infections behind it Unfortunately this also makes it impossible to estimate the total count of infected systems  So its still big Very big  Microsoft has previously paid out similar rewards to informants who helped identify the creator of Sasser another notorious worm let loose in  The perpetrator was tracked to Germany where he was sentenced a year later

 Atlanta Georgia CNN  In Chris Harrisons ideal world mobile phones would be the size of matchbooks Theyd have fullsize keyboards Theyd browse the Web Theyd play videos And most importantly youd never have to touch them Sound like too much to ask Maybe not  Harrison a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University and a former intern at Microsoft Research has developed a working prototype of a system called Skinput that does just that essentially by turning a persons hand and forearm into a keyboard and screen People dont love the iPhone keyboard They use them But they dont love them Harrison said in a interview at the recent ComputerHuman Interaction conference If you could make the iPhone keyboard as big as an arm  that would be huge Using Skinput a person could tap their thumb and middle finger together to answer a call touch their forearm to go to the next track on a music player or flick the center of their palm to select a menu item All of these signlanguagelike movements which are customizable would control a gadget in a persons pocket through a Bluetooth connection When fitted with a picoprojector the Skinput system could display an image of a digital keyboard on a persons forearm So using Skinput someone could send text messages by tapping his or her arm in certain places  without pulling the phone out of a pocket or purse  You could pretty much do a lot of what you do on your iPhone said Harrison who says Skinput is like having your iPhone on your palm  The system which has been under development for eight months wont be commercially available for two to seven years said Dan Morris a Microsoft researcher who is working with Harrison on Skinput Before that can happen Skinputs sensors need to get more accurate he said In a person trial in Seattle Washington Skinput was found to be  percent accurate But that test only used five buttons The system would have to improve for people to make use of a full keyboard which would be the holy grail Morris said The accuracy is good but its not quite consumerlevel yet he said Skinput is one of a number of prototypes ideas and nearproducts aiming to make computing more natural  These devices seek to move beyond the mouse and physical keyboard letting people communicate with their gadgets by gesturing using sign language or in the case of Skinput tapping on their hands fingers and forearms The arm as an instrument Understanding how Skinput works makes it seem all the more futuristic The system turns a persons arm and hand into a wiggling pulsating instrument full of vibrations that can be picked up and translated Skinput users wear an armband  the prototype version is made of an elbow brace  thats lined with  sensors These sensors look like tiny diving boards with dumbbells on one end and they pick up inaudible sounds that range in frequency from  to  hertz  When a Skinput user taps a thumb and middle finger together the impact sends ripples down the skin and through the bones in the persons arm They sort of start resonating  like guitar strings Harrison said The divingboard receivers read the sound waves to figure out what gesture the person made and then relay that information to a phone Skinput can tell whether a person tapped a middle finger or an index finger because the two moves sound slightly different to the springy receivers The system takes one or two minutes to learn the sounds of a particular persons arm Morris said and then it can be used however the user likes Trial and error When they started working on Skinput Morris and Harrison werent sure if it would be possible to turn the human arm into a virtual keypad The pair tried clipping sensors to the ends of peoples fingers and other strange configurations that made users feel like cyborgs We spent a lot of nights in the lab tapping on our arms and wondering if this would ever happen Harrison said But the most profound achievement of Skinput is proving that the human body can be used as a sensor he said Morris believes Skinput will make computing accessible to people in a way that never would have been possible before With Skinput literally computing is always available he said A person might walk toward their home Harrison said tap their palm to unlock the door and then tap some virtual buttons on their arms to turn on the TV and start flipping through channels Its almost like magic he said

 Microsoft revamps Hotmail takes on Google and YahooBy  Doug Gross CNN    The updates to Hotmail are expected to roll out in the next few weeks STORY HIGHLIGHTS Hotmail service will get a major overhaul Microsoft announces  The service is worlds most popular email but it has lagged in innovation  The update eliminates clutter lets users easily choose which messages to look at  It also will let people use programs like PowerPoint without ever leaving email

 CNN  Hotmail the worlds most widely used email service is getting a major overhaul from Microsoft in a bid to fend off competitors like Googles Gmail Microsoft says the planned update to Windows Live Hotmail is designed to remove clutter and let users interact with other sites and applications while checking their mail In the blog post Microsoft program manager Dick Craddock said the company studied email usage for a year while considering the changes People made it clear to us that the No  thing they wanted their email service to address  whether it was Hotmail or any other email service  was to help them manage the clutter in their inbox not just the spam but all the mail they get thats clogging their inboxes he wrote A key feature to the new Hotmail which will be rolled out over the next few weeks will be a sweep feature that allows users to clean out their inbox in one fell swoop The singleclick feature lets the user select a single email sender or multiple senders and automatically delete every message from that sender Another single click will let users decide which emails they want to look at  from people on their contacts list from their social networking sites or otherwise Microsofts study showed that only about  percent of email people get is from members of their contacts list The rest tends to be business related from social networks tracking of purchases theyve made online and spam the post says Despite the growing popularity of social networks like Facebook as a way to communicate Craddock wrote that people are getting more email than ever While it remains on top of the global email market with roughly  million users the decadeandahalf old Hotmail has been a largely stagnant service compared to thirdplace Gmail which has been steadily picking up users Yahoo is also more widely used in the United States than Hotmail Gmail has always offered ways to link up with Googles expansive list of internet offerings most recently its foray into the world of social networking Google Buzz By comparison Hotmail and Yahoo have offered morebasic mail to their users Hotmails proposed changes follow some of what Gmail has done For example with the new Hotmail people will be able to open and edit PowerPoint documents in their email accounts whether they have PowerPoint installed on their computer or not Hotmail Active View will give people an automatic preview of their incoming mail including a look at photos theyve received  both attachments and links to photo sites like Flickr Theyll be able to watch YouTube videos check social networks and perform other outside tasks without ever leaving email Gmail has similar features The proposed changes got mostly positive feedback early Tuesday from the tech community  where Hotmails vanilla setup hadnt garnered many fans before Itll be hard to steal users away from Gmail  which still has dozens of minor features that Hotmail doesnt just check the Labs  but Hotmail will most likely be a worthy competitor after the new version is launched this summer Stan Schroeder of social media blog Mashable wrote on Tuesday Harry McCracken of PC World wrote that the new Hotmail could be preferable to Gmail in some ways and pick up new users particularly from flailing AOL Hotmail also feels less densely packaged with stuff he wrote I could see some folks preferring it to Gmail which is beginning to flirt with bloat

Editors Note CNN partners with TED to feature a talk with added content on CNNcom every Tuesday  Oxford England CNN  This talk is a little bit insane confided Peter Molyneux the head of the European games division of Microsoft as he prepared to demo a game called Milo at the TED Global conference in Oxford on Tuesday  He asked audience members to cross their fingers as they waited to see if the live demo would work Milo is a storytelling game about a little boy whos unhappy because his family has moved from London to New England and his parents are too busy to listen to whats on his mind Molyneux said his goal with the game which is still under development is to recreate the feeling he had as a yearold child when his father told him a story about a robot The idea he said is to create a real living boy in a computer Most of it is just a trick but a trick that works he said and the demo seemed to work as well The Kinect camera which Molyneux said Microsoft is going to introduce in November is a device somewhat like Wii but which controls a game relying on the movement of the players body with no controller In the demo a player on stage interacted with Milo showing him where to find snails in his backyard suggesting that he squash a snail skimming stones in a lake and cleaning up the boys room Molyneux is the founder of Lionhead Studios which made the roleplaying game Fable and which was taken over by Microsoft in   TED Global is a conference run by the nonprofit TED which is devoted to Ideas Worth Spreading It began as a conference focusing on three subjects  technology entertainment and design  but has expanded its scope and now makes more than  talks from its conferences available at tedcom  Molyneux said Milo will get smarter as millions of people play the game As a game developer the only relationship I have with you is through your thumbs he said and thats pretty limiting  Milo aims to help change that relationship

 First impressions Microsofts Kinect gaming systemBy Larry Frum Special to CNN  Filed under Gaming  Gadgets   Microsofts new controller for the Xbox  uses physical movements from the players to control action on the screen STORY HIGHLIGHTS Kinect introduces a gaming system where there is nothing to hold and no buttons to push  Three camera sensors and four mics help Kinect recognize who is standing in front of it  Microsoft says  North American retailers will have Kinect available on Thursday CNN  With Kinect the new controllerfree system for its Xbox  gaming console Microsoft isnt just trying to revolutionize video gaming The company wants to change how people interact with all their entertainment choices Kinect which goes on sale Thursday allows players physical movements to control action on the screen Unlike the similar Nintendo Wii or Sony Move there is nothing to hold and no buttons to push  Three camera sensors and four microphones help Kinect recognize who is standing in front of it The system recognizes voice commands and reads a players full range of movements  not just swings of the arm  translating them into an avatars actions within a game Alex Kipman director of incubation for Kinect said Microsoft is trying to break down technological barriers and make game interaction more natural We wanted to transform entertainment where technology understands you Kipman said during a Kinect demo in Washington It was our goal to merge really amazing tech with a really amazing experience 



XBOX Kinect unleashed


Kipman explained that the specific components used to create Kinect have been around for years He said the real breakthrough was in the proprietary software used to make it all work together Cloud profiles featuring information accessed from the Web on an asneeded basis instead of from a local hard drive help the Kinect and Xbox  learn about users and what types of entertainment they might be interested in Kinect also will help livestream music movies and more in real time

The muchanticipated system first unveiled more than a year ago is Microsofts entry in the growing era of motioncontrolled gaming pioneered by the Wii in  Sony launched Move a motionsensing game controller for its PlayStation  console in September A Microsoft spokesperson said  North American retailers would have Kinect available Thursday with  of those planning to open at midnight She would not say how many units would be available on launch day The system will launch with at least  games I spent four days testing out Kinect which should appeal to casual gamers and families more than hardcore action gamers Here are my impressions Getting started Out of the box the Kinect sensor is  inches long and  inches high including the motorized stand it sits on Connecting to the Xbox is easy For the new Xbox  Slim consoles it is plugandplay  no additional wires To use on the original Xbox  consoles you will need a power source for the device After some software downloads the Kinect calibrates itself to the room automatically It is actuated by specific gestures waving your hand at the Kinect or by using a specific key word for voice commands Xbox It is technology that understands you Kipman said Kinect looks at  points on the body to figure out what it should do It always knows who is in charge The Kinect should go at or as near eye level as possible so it can read all your movements Also it requires a clear space to play so nothing impedes its view of the player and nothing gets bumped or knocked over Someone playing alone will need to be at least  feet back while two players should be about eight feet from the screen Kinect comes bundled with Kinect Adventures an introductory game that teaches you how to use the device Hovering your hand over game menu options activates those choices Five different adventures require the player to move and react to different scenarios Rallyball will get you reacting to things being thrown at you River Rush and Reflex Ridge get you dodging and steering Space Pop requires using your arms to propel you in a weightless situation  Leaks will stretch you out as you try to stop water from rushing in through cracked glass All of these adventures teach players how to use their movements to control the action on the screen The gestures will come in handy for other Kinect games Fun with wild animals Kinectimals was demonstrated at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles in June where it received high marks for its cuteness factor  and lower marks for being well a little bizarre In the game players get to adopt a virtual pet Among the  choices are a Bengal tiger lion panther cheetah or leopard cub By using voice commands and body gestures kids can teach their cub to do tricks feed and brush their baby animal or just play games with it It is definitely a game geared toward younger players I play a lot of firstperson shooter games but Ill admit there is something neat to rubbing a tiger cub on its belly  even if it is virtual Fullbody sports Kinect Sports cranks up the action with six different games at four different skill levels From the outdoors to the table top different sports challenge players to really get involved with the action Full body movements mimic those that would be needed to really play the sport Want to score a goal in soccer Kick the ball Want to knock out your opponent in boxing Throw a punch The only skill you need is life skill Kipman said If you know how to bowl you can bowl in our game The action and movements are lifelike and will get players moving For example while you wont actually have a javelin in your hand you will need to run in place up to the line and throw The escalating skill levels make it easy for players to learn what to do and master those actions before moving up to more challenging opponents Wheelfree racing Kinect Joy Ride offers different game modes that let you race cars do stunts or even crash into objects  and each other But it doesnt feel quite right because with Kinect there is nothing to feel You control your car by grabbing an imaginary steering wheel There is no accelerator or brake the game does that for you automatically Turning your hands left or right steers the car but there is no tactile feedback to give you the sensation of running off the road or colliding with a light pole This isnt a Grand Turismo title by any stretch of the imagination But a racing game should have a feel to it  this one just leaves you grasping for air Get your body moving Two other initial titles Your Shape Fitness Evolved and Dance Central are where Kinect really shines Your Shape Fitness Evolved features workouts created by Mens Health and Womens Health magazines Players are scored on how well they match the movements of instructors who demonstrate exercises  There are Zen exercises for relaxation or cardio boxing if you want to blow off steam in a different way There are also personalized exercise plans to help lose weight tone the body or get more energy The game offers a good workout Kinect helps correct postures and actions so users can get the most benefits out of the exercises being done In this way it really does work well Dance Central made by the creators of Rock Band aims to get you moving to the beat but realizes we all arent ready to strut our stuff on the dance floor The game combines todays dance hits performed by pop stars with moves that seem clunky at first but get more involved and intense as the difficulty ratchets up Like Guitar Hero you have to match your movements to those on the screen to get a perfect score Beyond games Because it has cameras Kinect also offers the ability to connect via video with other Kinect users  or those who use Microsofts Live Messenger program on their PCs It also works with the other entertainment features for the Xbox  such as ondemand ESPN music from Zunecom and movies from Netflix It is all about your choice your content when you want it Kipman said The bottom line I didnt get to test out the  other games that Microsoft says will use the new controller But my experience with the initial six titles shows where Kinect will shine and where it will stumble Games that feature fullbody movement make best use of what Kinect can offer Syncing up your movements with the movements on the screen is a lot easier and more natural with Kinect than with a normal controller Its also hard to compare the Kinect to Sonys Move  the two systems are like apples and oranges I was pleasantly surprised and amused by Kinects ability to record video while you are playing While I was doing hurdles in Kinect Sports track and field my kitten decided to join the fun and began jumping as I jumped Needless to say the resulting video of us provided many laughs after the game But games that would be better enhanced with a physical device in hand feel flat On Kinect theyre just not up to the demands that players make from those types of games You will probably not enjoy racing games and firstperson shooter games as much with Kinect that you do with regular controllers Right now the Kinect can understand languages from the United States United Kingdom Mexico Japan and Canada  with more to roll out in the near future Kipman said they will be constantly refining voicerecognition software to help the system recognize dialects in each language Prices range from  for a GB Xbox  Kinect bundle to  for the GB bundle and  for the Kinect box by itself without the console Is it worth it That may depend on whether you have kids  and what kind of gamer you are

 Mashablecom  Microsoft is announcing today that it has integrated Facebook and Windows Live Messenger into Outlook bringing the streams of millions of Facebook users into inboxes across the world Last year Microsoft launched Outlook Social Connector a plugin that syncs social networking feeds with your Outlook contacts giving you immediate data on what they are doing and thinking It started last year with LinkedIn integration but soon the company announced MySpace and Facebook were coming Today Outlook completes the cycle with not only Facebook integration but support for Windows Live Messenger as well Not only that but the company is releasing the plugin for Outlook  and  users as well bringing Facebook MySpace LinkedIn and Windows Live Messenger to millions of business and personal inboxes worldwide Last week we got a sneak peek at the new Outlook at Microsofts headquarters in Redmond Washington Heres what you can expect from the new Facebook integration as well some features that you can expect in the near future Facebook  Outlook  Realtime Contact Data Facebook and Microsoft worked together to get the launch of Facebooks integration in Outlook Social Connector right Facebooks Strategic Partner Manager Rick Armbrust told us that they worked closely with the Office team to make the experience more social One of the things he immediately highlighted was the pulling of Facebook profile pictures into Outlook The entire experience is a step above the OutlookLinkedIn integration which itself was pretty strong Not only does it pull Facebook profile photos so that you can associate a name to a face but it pulls the news feeds of your contacts into your inbox When youre looking at someones email youll also get a glance at their status updates picture uploads and wall posts among other activities When you combine that with LinkedIn MySpace Windows Live Messenger and Outlook data you get a very detailed history of your interaction with your contacts as well as an ataglance look at their activities and interests Knowing that a potential client just returned from a trip to Hawaii can be all that you need to have the upper hand against your competition Microsoft Group Product Manager Paco Contreras told us that theres another new feature to the Facebook integration realtime updates Thanks to a new update to the social connector platform also being released today updates from your contacts will automatically be pushed to your inbox Theres no need to refresh anything new Facebook status updates will pop up in realtime within Outlook The Facebook integration does have limitations though except for friend requests Outlook can only pull data from Facebook There is no liking posts or updating your status via Outlook at least right now Microsoft says that the next step is to provide a richer social experience by integrating the ability to push data to other social networks improving the look and feel of Outlook Social Connector and adding other social networks from other regions The Social Inbox Microsoft has known for a while that social technologies are going to dominate the web That was made evident by its  million stake in Facebook and its many partnerships and attempts at social media some of which have bombed However Outlook Social Connector has always felt like one of the companys smarter social media plays Facebooks Rich Armbrust probably put it best Whats unique is that its bringing social elements and context from Facebook form your colleagues and your friends into the Outlook experience which is pretty unique given that there are so many that use Outlook as their primary communiction tool Email isnt inherently a social experience its not a onetomany platform and attempts at integrating social into the inbox think Google Buzz have mostly fallen flat However social data can be incredibly useful in the business world especially when you need to understand what your client or colleague is thinking or doing right now While wed still love to see Twitter integration in Outlook Facebook is far larger and in most cases has far more useful information Microsofts also learned a few lessons from the privacy fiascos Facebook and Google have undergone in recent months Outlook will only pull data from emails connected to Facebook accounts If your business email isnt linked to your Facebook your data stream wont appear in Outlook Social Connector It gives users a choice although most people do choose to add their work emails to Facebook in order to join their companys Facebook network If you want to learn more about the announcement Microsoft has also released a short video articulating Outlooks new features  MASHABLEcom All rights reserved

Windows  is an operating system that is so critical for the overall success of Microsoft that it is hard to state it strongly enough said Daniel Kusnetzky a program director with research firm International Data Corp IDC in Framingham Mass echoing an opinion expressed by several analysts Since it launched Windows NT  in  Microsoft has bulldozed aside competitors in the departmental server business  most notably Novell and IBM  to help it report financial results that have wowed investors and sent its stock price soaring The software vendor shipped more than  million copies of Windows NT in  up almost  from  to give it the lions share of new server OS unit shipments according to recent figures from IDC  But its rate of growth in the server OS market while still strong is tapering out analysts said Because Microsoft already owns such a large slice of the market for file print and other lowend types of server achieving the giant percentage gains it has enjoyed in previous years has become almost impossible  Microsoft has gotten to a size where its almost impossible to outgrow the market Kusnetzky said The surprising  to  percent growth period is over Microsoft could reverse that trend by selling its new OS in the type of midrange servers used to manage thousands of PC clients run massive databases and serve up busy ecommerce Web sites Currently dominated by Unix vendors like Sun Microsystems and HewlettPackard the midrange market promises higher returns on sales and is one that Microsoft has long coveted Issues of scalability however not to mention highlypublicized concerns over the stability of Windows NT have kept the software vendor for the most part locked out With Windows  Microsoft hopes to change that The company claims that the millions of dollars and years of work hours it has invested in the product have produced an OS that is reliable scalable manageable and secure enough for demanding enterprise applications It points to success stories like Dell  a close ally of Microsoft  which uses Windows NT to conduct millions of dollars worth of business through its online store as proof that its software is reliable Microsoft is already using Windows  on  servers that run its heavily trafficked Web site as are a few early adopters like Barnes  Noble Analysts said feedback from Windows  beta testers has been favorable once they became accustomed to its differences from NT Windows  brings a lot of technology to the table It looks a lot more stable and reliable than Windows NT and thats the biggest thing Microsoft has going for it said Al Gillen a research manager with IDC After six years of development it ought to be ready by now said Laura DiDio a senior analyst with Giga Information Group The experiences of beta testers may tell only part of the story however Winning in the data center will require Microsoft to create software that performs at its best heterogeneous environments and that means high levels of interoperability  something the company hasnt exactly excelled at analysts said And where Windows software dominated many LAN environments Microsoft will need to accept a diminished role if it wants to play in the enterprise computing room  Their challenge is to become a good corporate citizen which means not always being the star of the show but being a supporting player IDCs Kusnetzky said That might mean sometimes standing under the spotlight at other times it means taking a seat in the orchestra pit Delivering products in a timely fashion will be another factor Microsoft originally said it would deliver Windows  formerly called Windows NT  back in  The version of Windows  aimed at higherperformance servers called Windows  DataCenter isnt due to ship until midyear This month three versions of the OS will debut Windows  Professional the desktop client Windows  Server and Windows  Advanced Server The company has hyped its operating system so much that expectations are sky high and after numerous delays Microsoft may get only one chance to prove itself analysts said IT managers responsible for choosing the critical server environments that keep their businesses up and running wont look kindly on teething problems and a string of early publicized failures could cause a major setback Unless Microsoft can prove that Windows  is all of those things  highly interoperable consistent and reliable  they can damage themselves and lock themselves out of the computer room for the next decade Kusnetzky said Continuing Microsofts financial success isnt the only thing that makes Windows  a vital release for the company In a computing environment that has changed rapidly since the release of NT in which the Internet electronic commerce and Webbased services look set to predominate Windows  will be key to helping Microsoft expand its sphere of influence and remain a dominant player in IT computing analysts said  Microsoft last month unveiled an initiative called Next Generation Windows Services Along with Windows DNA  NGWS aims to provide software and tools that allow companies to build new types of services for ecommerce and accessing information and services over the Web Microsoft hasnt provided specifics about NGWS but technologies in Windows  are likely to be wedded closely to the new initiative said Larry Perlstein a research director with Dataquest in San Jose Calif  New members in Microsofts BackOffice family due later this year including SQL Server  and Exchange  are also closely tied to features in Windows  in particular a new directory services feature called Active Directory Such close ties between Windows  and other products in the pipeline intensify the pressure to make Windows  a success said Carl Howe a senior analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge Mass who sees Windows  as the future of the company Microsoft could have picked a quieter year to release its new OS It will face several distractions over the next  months including its ongoing Java lawsuit with Sun not to mention any fallout it may incur from the US governments antitrust action At the same time while it tries to break new ground at the high end of the market it faces a potential rival at the low end in the form of Linux Analysts interviewed for this story were unanimous that Microsofts position isnt likely to be eroded in the near term While customers wont jump to its new operating system overnight many expect to upgrade their desktop and server NT environments quickly starting at the end of the year and demand for the companys software at the departmental level will continue to grow at a healthy clip Gigas DiDio said The anticipation and the pent up demand for this product is tremendous she said The jury is still out however on its ambitions at the high end of the market and its efforts to become a leader in providing software and services for new types of Webbased applications Microsoft has deep pockets and a giant pool of programming talent and has shown a deft ability in the past for identifying new markets and moving into them Dataquests Perlstein noted IDCs Kusnetzky was more cautious Microsoft has presented a grand vision that is so allencompassing it will be very hard for any software product to live up to it he said Its going to be a significant challenge

Report Microsoft hack a US security risk


 From






by Dan Verton 

IDG  Although Microsoft Corp has denied that the hacker who penetrated its network in October gained access to any of the companys source code a recent report by a Washingtonbased think tank is warning that the compromise may hold grave national security implications 


In a report released this month titled Cyber Threats and Information Security Meeting the st Century Challenge the Center for Strategic and International Studies CSIS concluded that the government and the private sector should be concerned about the trustworthiness of future Microsoft products in the aftermath of the hack into the companys network Former Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre a longtime cybersecurity proponent in the defense and intelligence communities heads the CSIS

It is doubtful that the millions sometimes billions of lines of code required to power Microsofts products could readily be sanitized the CSIS report states With most military and government systems powered by Microsoft software and more generally reliant on commercial offtheshelf systems this recent development can pose grave nationalsecurityrelated concerns the page report concludes 


Microsoft however strongly disagrees with the analysis

The CSIS quote sensationalizes the incident and misstates the facts in a number of important ways a Microsoft spokesman said Most important Microsoft has repeatedly stated that after tracking the intruders and investigating their activities there is no evidence and no basis to believe that they had any access at all to Windows or Office source code That is we have no reason to believe that the intruders were able to see Windows or Office source code much less modify it Microsofts current and future products remain intact and secure and customers can use them with confidence


Microsoft security personnel discovered the hack in October when they noticed that passwords were being remotely sent to an email account in Russia The hackers then posed as Microsoft employees working offsite rather than at the companys Redmond Wash headquarters to gain access to sensitive areas within Microsofts internal network see Microsoft stung by hack attack link below


Government systems arent the only ones at risk according to CSIS Whoever stole proprietary secrets at the heart of the ubiquitous Windows program can hack into any PC in the world that uses it and is connected to the Internet the report states Such security concerns could hold serious implications for the dozens of privatesector companies that own and operate the nations critical infrastructure


Although initial reports alluded to the possibility that the hacker may have gained access to the source code of some of the companys future products including Windows Me Windows  and Office a Microsoft spokeswoman said that no source code was compromised or stolen and that every possible step has been taken to ensure the integrity of the code for future users

Microsoft delays deadline for new licensing program

 IDG  After howls of protests and threats of platform defections from user organizations Microsoft has pushed back the deadlines for enrollment to its new licensing program by five months so enterprises can build the cost of the program into next years budget cycles


The news will come as a welcome relief to IT executives who were scrambling to figure out how to pay for the new program called Software Assurance which will replace all of Microsofts upgrade options



The original Oct  deadline for enrollment in Software Assurance will now be extended to February  



However the move does not mean Microsoft is abandoning the new licensing model which has been criticized as a vehicle to resuscitate flat revenues over the past year in the Redmond giants desktop application division and provide a buffer as more applications move to the Web



Microsoft is saying we made a mistake says Chris LeTocq principal analyst with Guernsey Research They listened to IT executives



Those executives were saying they could not afford the new licensing model this year

Some enterprises were looking at as much as a  million fee to get all their software in line with the program which will still officially kickoff on Oct 



Under the program enterprises dont need to actually deploy the software but they must have the license



Never in my career have I seen the customer base so angry at Microsoft says Rob Enderle an analyst with the Giga Information Group They were calling Microsoft things you wouldnt want your family to hear Now Enderle says users wont have to do anything draconian under the pressure of Software Assurance There is less of a panic but I suspect that customers wont soon forget this



Microsoft admitted it heard IT executives loud and clear The decision comes just a week after the company responded to industry complaints and pulled its Smart Tags feature from the upcoming version of Windows XP



There has been a lot of interest in Software Assurance but customers have said they want more time to plan and budget says Simon Hughes program manager for worldwide licensing and pricing at Microsoft Our response has been to extend the transition period



Microsoft intended to formally announce the news last Thursday but the ruling by the US Court of Appeals in the companys antitrust trial scrubbed that effort



Under the new deadlines Open and Select volumelicensing customers can get their noncurrent licenses in line with Software Assurance by purchasing Upgrade Advantage before March   If companies make that move before October   they can get up to two years additional coverage under Upgrade Advantage



Upgrade Advantage the upgrade option for Open and Select customers that Software Assurance replaces gives enterprises the rights to the current version of software That is important because users must be on current versions of Microsoft software to be eligible for Software Assurance



For example a user on a version of Office older than Office XP gets the rights to Office XP and up to two years of upgrade coverage and a path to move into Software Assurance



At the end of the Upgrade Advantage cycle however enterprises still have to buy into Software Assurance which is priced at  percent of the fullretail price of the licensed software For example a  Office license would carry nearly a  fee for Software Assurance



Those same Open and Select customers can enroll their current licenses such as Windows  Professional Office XP and Net Enterprise Servers for the same  fee in Software Assurance between October  and February   The original deadline was January  



In addition Enterprise Agreement and Subscription options for customers with more than  PCs will be available from October  and include Software Assurance



The protests over Software Assurance arose because the program and the  deadline to enroll were announced after enterprises had set budgets for this year That meant enterprises likely had to either raid existing budgets or trim workforce to enroll



For example enterprises contemplating an upgrade after the October  deadline to the recently released Office XP faced the prospect of spending as much as  more per user to purchase new licenses for the suite of software Those costs were about double the fee it would cost the same user to upgrade before the October  deadline



Software Assurance was announced in May and requires enterprises to maintain current licenses for software



Critics say the program is a response to customers that have not been upgrading to new versions of software most notably Office and a way for Microsoft to rectify that loss in licensing revenue Microsoft has reported nearly  billion in revenue in the past three quarters this year for its desktop applications division roughly equal to the same three quarters last year The revenue accounts for  percent of its business so that means  percent of Microsoft revenue has not grown over the past year



Microsoft contends the changes are being made to simplify the alphabet soup of upgrade options The company claims that organizations that upgrade on cycles of three years or less will see a reduction or no change in licensing costs



A study by Guernsey Research shows that enterprises on a twoyear upgrade cycle will save  percent in licensing costs but that enterprises on a threeyear cycle will see a  percent increase in costs

SAN FRANCISCO California Reuters  Computer security experts say the recent SQL Slammer worm the worst in more than a year is evidence that Microsofts yearold security push is not working


Trustworthy Computing is failing Russ Cooper of TruSecure Corp said of the Microsoft initiative I gave it a Dminus at the beginning of the year and now Id give it an F


The worm which exploited a known vulnerability in Microsofts SQL Server database software spread through network connections beginning January  crashing servers and clogging the Internet

Public reminded of risks

It hit a year and one week after Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates sent a companywide email saying Microsoft would make boosting security of its software a top priority


Microsoft placed responsibility on computer users who failed to install a patch that had been available since at least last June


The single largest message is keep your system up to date with patches Microsoft Chief Security Officer Scott Charney said


But the philosophy of patching is fundamentally flawed and leaves people vulnerable Cooper said For example Microsoft didnt follow its own advice as executives confirmed that an internal network was hit by the worm


Microsoft was completely hosed from Slammer It took them two days to get out from under it said Bruce Schneier chief technology officer of Counterpane Internet Security a network monitoring service provider Its as hypocritical as you can get

Fix could have nullified problems

We should have done a better job in protecting the companys own network Mike Nash corporate vice president of Microsofts security business unit said We understood some things customers were facing and it in some ways helped us It was a learning course


There was another misstep on Microsofts part that illustrates the problems with patches Cooper said


In October Microsoft released a fix for a different SQL Server problem that if installed in the expected manner would have made patched systems vulnerable again he said If I followed their advice Id have been vulnerable


Microsoft spokesman Rick Miller said administrators were given the option with the fix to install it so the patch was intact He also said he knew of no customers who installed the fix and were still hit by the worm

Implementing fix proves complex











WHAT IS A WORM


A program that makes copies of itself  for example from one disk drive to another or by copying itself using email or another transport mechanism Source Symantec

VIEW RESULTS





















But most people installing the fix would not necessarily have known how to install it in a safe way Cooper countered


Microsoft released a service pack that would have fixed the problems the week before Slammer hit But not only are there too many patches to keep up with people are reluctant to install them for fear they will interfere with their systems


Microsoft admits making a mistake with the SQL fix and has egg on our face over being hit by the worm Miller said


What this demonstrates and what we readily acknowledge is the patch management process is too complex he said Microsoft is committed to reorganizing our patch system and delivering highquality patches in a streamlined way

Demanding better products

Nash defended the Trustworthy Computing initiative saying the companys security process and culture have changed For instance all Windows developers have received special security training he said


However the fruits of that may not show up until future versions of products are released said Richard M Smith a Cambridge Massachusettsbased computer security consultant Id rather they focus on the problems we have today


The problem is the whole patch regime has lots and lots of problems he said It would be much better if the software shipped from Microsoft with fewer problems to begin with


The solution install patches along with firewalls and other security software and services as well as demand better products from Microsoft the experts said

Thinking of switching

In the meantime Schneier said he was thinking of switching from Windows to the Macintosh platform because of all the security issues My wife has a Mac and she doesnt worry about viruses trojans leaks  he said


A Consumer Reports survey last year found that virus infection rates on Macs are half what they are on Windows noted Smith Is that because Macs are safer I think the answer is yeah

  Google vs Microsoft What you need to knowStory Highlights The escalating Google vs Micosoft battle is mostly over wholl be King of Tech  Top execs at each company dream of ways to steal the others pots of gold  Chrome OS will compete with Windows while Office  will include free online versions  Heres how the two tech giants stack up in four key areas of competition Next Article in Technology    By Ryan Singel 



 


 

  WIRED  In less than a week Google announced an operating system to compete with Windows while Microsoft announced that Office  will include free online versions of its four most popular software programs  a shot at Googles suite of webbased office applications 
The fight between Microsoft and Google is over wholl be seen as the worlds most important tech company 
 And not more than a month and a half ago Microsoft unveiled its new search engine Bing which it hopes will steal market share from Google and finally make it real money online From the news of it its a fullblown tech battle complete with behindthescenes machinations to sic government regulators on each other It is however not a death match  its more of an fight to see who will be the King of Technology since both companies pull in their billions through completely different siphons and are unlikely to severely wound one another any time soon Google pulled in  billion in revenue in   percent of which came tiny text ads bought by the keyword and placed next to search results or on pages around the web Google makes a negligible amount of money bundling its online apps for businesses charging  a head annually  but mostly it just gives its online text editor email and spreadsheet programs away By contrast Microsoft sold  billion worth of Microsoft Word and PowerPoint and other business applications over the last nine months making a profit of  billion It made a further  billion in revenue in  through sales of its operating systems which range from XP installations on netbooks to Vista to Windows Mobile to its server software Google now plans its own range of operating systems starting with Android an opensource OS for small devices like smartphones and Chrome OS a browserfocused opensource OS that will run on notebooks and desktops

 Clearly top executives at each company look over at the others pots of gold and dream of ways to steal them or at least make it harder for the other guy to make money In fact they even dislike each other enough to spend money to make the other one lose revenue  take for example Microsofts behindthescenes campaign to scuttle last years proposed GoogleYahoo advertising deal or its ongoing attempts to derail the Google Book Search settlement But in reality the competition is really about creating universes or ecosystems that it hopes consumers will want to live their technology lives inside And its about ego  a fight to be recognized as the worlds most important technology company Microsoft would love for everyone in the world to be using its Internet Explorer browser to search through Bing to find a story from its MSN portal to email via Hotmail or Outlook to a friend Add in a smartphone running Windows Mobile and an Xbox in the living room for the kids and you have a Microsoft family And though it is much joked about Microsoft is the dominant platform for software developers of all types whether they are making small business software massive online roleplaying games or photoediting utilities Googles ecosystem looks different It starts with a Google Chrome browser oddly running only on Windows with a default homepage set to Google News or a customized Google homepage From there you might go to Gmail and then click on a Word document sent to you as an attachment which Google will quickly  and safely  open for you in its online word processor But most importantly Google wants you to search and travel around the web hitting web pages that run Googleserved ads and Google tracking cookies You might think that Google is a really cool company to give away all this free technology while never thinking about the persistent and silent data collection Google is undertaking to profile you in order to deliver you to advertisers for a premium So how do the two stack up in four key areas of competition Browsers Internet Explorer in all its variations still retains close to  percent of the market depending on who is counting and how That dominance remains even though Microsofts latest offering IE lags behind all the other major browsers in features and advanced web capabilities Firefox Opera and Apples Safari have all driven browser innovation over the last five years but most people have not been convinced to leave IE behind despite other alternatives being safer and more advanced Why does it matter Well IE installations come with a default home page dont they Googles Chrome browser on the other hand is a handsome whizkid of a browser Its sleek and nimble and it revolutionizes how tabs are handled The address bar is the search box Google as default naturally Each website opened runs as its own browser instance and has very low permissions to read and write to files The sandboxing of tabs means that if a single website hangs or crashes the rest are unaffected Meanwhile lower permissions make it harder for a hacker to bust into your computer through your browser Chrome also has less than  percent of the browser market share Online Search Googles name now means search to most users Googles search engine means money to Google In June it delivered  percent of search results pages delivered to US web users In the first three months of  Google pulled in  billion in revenue a majority of which came from AdWords an auctionbased service that triggers ads based on the keywords in a search query Microsoft recently debuted Bing a new search engine it hoped would fare well in comparison to Google Its got some fine innovations and shows the company is thinking very hard about better ways to present information to users by finding ways to synthesize data rather than just retrieving links Still despite these improvements a  million ad campaign and generous press coverage that treats Bing like an underdog Bing gained only a point in June to get Microsoft  percent of all searches Operating Systems Microsoft has been making operating systems since  and has spent  years perfecting MSDOS and Windows NT the frameworks that Windows have been built around Microsoft is estimated to run on about  percent of all laptops and desktops in the world By copying its competitors best features leveraging questionable licensing arrangements and using its base of accustomed users to buy it time against innovators Microsoft has held on to its lead in the OS market for almost  years Thats despite challenges from Digital Research Apple and IBM Microsofts newest version Windows  will be available in the fall Early reviews say the OS boots quickly and sleeps fast and avoids much of the confusing interface decisions that have made many dislike Vista the successor to Windows XP Microsoft also dominates in the business world where nearly every medium to large company standardizes around Microsoft Office Microsoft is also at work on version  of its operating system for handheld devices which it first launched in  Its OS advantages are immense It has millions of users who know nothing else and who like Windows There are millions who are attached to games or the thousands of desktop apps that are only available on Windows Thousands of devices just plug in and work on its hardware And familiarity with Microsoft software is a requirement for a huge number of office jobs By contrast Google first stepped into the OS game in  when it announced its Android operating system for small devices Google estimates that some  phone models will be running its system by the end of the year Last week Google announced but did not show off a new OS to compete with Windows dubbing it Chrome OS That name signifies that Googles OS will be for the web and browserbased It hopes to convince developers to write software that runs inside a browser instead of on top of the OS as developers for Windows and Apples OS X do It will also let web developers extend the power of their websites by expanding the capabilities of the browser allowing websites to lean on the browser for storage and processing help Advertising Google is largely powered by its innovative auctionbased text ads on its own site but then expanded into serving ads on other peoples sites with the Adsense program It bought the adserving and behavioralprofiling giant Doubleclick in  for more than  billion and has ventured into mobile print radio and television ads Microsoft has struggled to replicate Googles online advertising success Despite owning MSNcom  a portal that is second only to Yahoo as a destination  Microsoft has not made money on the internet To turbocharge its addelivery technology it paid more than  billion in cash in  for aQuantive a fullservice online advertising concern Instead Microsofts online ad business lost  billion in  double what it lost in  The company expects  revenues to be higher than the  billion it took in last year but has not said it would make a profit Contrary to what some might have you believe the benefits of the GoogleMicrosoft competition are immense Microsoft had largely grown complacent until Google came along to shake up categories Gmails massive online storage capability and fancy programming made Microsoft hustle to upgrade its popular though not userfriendly web email service Google Maps led to Microsofts Live Maps which now bests Googles efforts in some ways Google has been winning the fight for the last few years showing that it is still nimbler than the software giant from the Northwest But the pendulum may be slowing or even poised to swing the other way With the innovations in Bing and the promise that Microsofts online Office offerings will be free and more fully featured than the Google equivalent Microsoft is taking on Google where it matters for users on the field of innovation And that will make for an interesting race no matter which horse you prefer to ride

  Analysis Microsoft wants some of Googles good thingStory Highlights Deal with Yahoo gives Microsoft a greater share of search market  Combined Microsoft and Yahoo are better poised to take on Google   Yahoo has effectively outsourced its search operation   Google also is challenging Microsoft on its own turf operating systemsNext Article in Technology   Read VIDEO  By Steve Mollman For CNN 



 


 

  CNN  Microsoft knows a good thing when it sees it And what Google has going on with its search advertising business is a good thing  which of course is why Microsoft wants a bigger piece of it 
Combined Microsoft and Yahoo will try to erode Googles dominance in search 
 To that end it struck a deal Wednesday to power the searches on Yahoos various properties The deal will increase the market share of Microsofts search platform Bing The boost will help In June according to estimates from comScore Microsofts share in the US search engine market was  percent and Yahoos was  percent compared to  percent for Google   So Bing will soon have close to a  percent market share making it a stronger alternative to Google and Microsoft will move closer to enjoying the selfreinforcing positive feedback loop that has powered Googles rise to dominance  Watch more on search engines  That loop as described by Gartner analyst Neil MacDonald is essentially what the software giant is after It works like this the more people use the search service the more advertisers are willing to pay because more people are using it And the more paying advertisers there are using the service the better and more relevant the ads that come up   Plus the more the search engine is used the better it becomes thanks to contextual learning algorithms Business  Contending Googles throne As for Yahoo its stock took a hit after the announcement and many observers predicted the deal was the beginning of the end for the firm

   Jason Calacanis CEO of the humanpowered search engine Mahalo wrote a blog posting entitled Yahoo committed seppuku today The once proud warrior of the Internet space laid down its sword knelt at the feet of Microsoft and gutted itself today wrote Calacanis But not everyone sees it that way MacDonald sees a very focused smart deal on both sides Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz was astute he says in realizing that the company was about a collection of media properties and the experience the user has and that you dont have to own search to make that experience compelling   Yahoo will not receive an up front payment from Microsoft as part of the deal Instead it will receive  percent of search revenue generated via its sites during the first five years of agreement according to yesterdays announcement The company estimates that the agreement will add about  million annually to its operating cash flow and that it will be able to save about  million by basically outsourcing search Search data will be shared between the two companies They will continue to compete in other areas including email instant messaging and display advertising coopetition like this is fairly common in both media and technology fields notes MacDonald Google isnt sitting still while Microsoft moves in on its territory Its working on a Chrome operating system slated to come out next year that will compete with Microsofts Windows And its suite of online applications already puts up a fight against the Office juggernaut Of course thats a feeble fight at the moment but then so is Microsofts fight in the search arena One or both of these fights might become less lopsided over time but well have to wait and see For now Google and Microsoft have seemingly insurmountable leads in their respective strongholds Not addressed in the deal is the challenge presented by the growth of realtime search  Twitter being a perfect example  which can make both Google and Bing look downright outdated in certain cases For instance by typing Bing into Twitter you can see what people around the world have been saying and sharing about this deal in the past  seconds Meanwhile the ever growing juggernaut of Facebook also challenges the central place held by Google  and by Bing if Microsoft has its way These search engines use impersonal algorithms to draw an atlas of the Web but Facebook wants users to get their information about the world through their filter of friends and colleagues  just as in real life When a Facebook user taps his or her social graph to find the best dentist they never leave the world of Facebook  and Google and Bing are left out in the cold And Facebook has far more details on its users who use their real names 





 Microsoft at least is an investor in Facebook thanks to a deal struck a few years ago Google much to its chagrin is not But it is clearly right in Microsofts sights

  Microsoft researcher converts his brain into ememoryStory Highlights Microsoft researcher Gordon Bell argues we will soon have searchable memories  Bell details his ideas in a new coauthored book called Total Recall  Bell has been recording almost every detail of his life digitally for a decadeNext Article in Technology    By  John D Sutter CNN 



 


 

  CNN  For the past decade Microsoft researcher Gordon Bell has been moving the data from his brain onto computers  where he knows it will be safe 

Gordon Bell wearing a SenseCam which automatically records photos throughout the day 


 Sure you could say all of us do this to some extent We save digital pictures from family events and keep tons of email    But Bell who is  years old takes the idea of digital memory to a scifiesque extreme He carries around video equipment cameras and audio recorders to capture his conversations commutes trips and experiences Microsoft is working on a SenseCam that would hang around a persons neck and automatically capture every detail of life in photo form Bell has given that a whirl He also saves everything  from restaurant receipts he takes pictures of them to correspondence bills and medical records He makes PDF files out of every Web page he views In sum this mountain of data  more than  gigabytes worth not including the streaming audio and video  is a replica of Bells biological memory Its actually better he says because if you back up your data in enough places this digitized ememory never forgets Its like having a multimedia transcript of your life By about  he says our entire life histories will be online and searchable Locationaware smartphones and inexpensive digital memory storage in the cloud of the Internet make the transition possible and inevitable No one will have to fret about storing the details of their lives in their heads anymore Well have computers for that And this revolution will change what it means to be human he writes

   Bell who along with fellow researcher Jim Gemmell is the author of a new book called Total Recall talked with CNN about the advantages and drawbacks of recording ones life in painstaking digital detail The following is an edited transcript CNN What have you learned about yourself through this process Thats been a really hard question to answer  The main driver of the recall turns out to be a computer screensaver or something where I go looking for a digital memory and I find something else I guess its the rich set of connections and people that Ive been involved with CNN What do you use to record your memories In a way most of what happens during the day is sort of routine  what youve done before So I carry the SenseCam only when I think theres an episode or a sequence or a certain set of events that I want to capture and have automatically photographed But I tend to always carry a camera with me I live next to a fire station and Ive got lots of photos of the hook and ladder coming out of the house And I like food so I tend to photograph wonderfully presented food all the time To me those are very pleasant memories  CNN If we rely on computers instead of our brains will humans become mentally sluggish Thats certainly one of the concerns I tend to counter that theory To me I feel a lot freer In a way I feel like I still remember all that stuff but I generally remember that the computer is remembering something for me so I can find it  People have no memory of phone numbers now because of the cell phone  their address book is in a cell phone So I dont think theyre getting any worse or any less facile about that What an ememory does to me is gives me a really wonderful free feeling  CNN If we all record audio of our lives do you think conversations will become stilted and fake I think there will be a lot of court cases and lawyering around all of that Im personally less hung up about that Certainly people my age and Baby Boomers are But the current XGeneration they think this is pretty natural CNN Are you on Facebook and Twitter Yeah Im on Facebook and Twitter and occasionally I will tweet something Somehow my problem is that I dont think I have anything interesting to tweet about CNN Should all of our memories and observations be public Absolutely not Our own memories are our own private thing and how much you choose to have on Facebook or blogs thats your thing CNN What does your family think about your effort to record everything Gradually everybody is getting this idea  Think of it You are a librarian for your life Somebody has to be the family librarian CNN Are you worried about losing your memory  Forgetting is not a feature its a flaw I dont think forgetting is an important feature of human memory I think its important to be able to remember things accurately CNN Are there any memories you deleted No When we were scanning stuff I had written a memo about a company an unpleasant company  probably the only company I was ever ashamed to be a part of   I put a note on that file that said Dont ever scan or copy this My assistant who was doing the scanning ran across this and said What do you want me to do with this And I said Well gee This is my life I said Its OK just go ahead So its all there CNN Do you think its possible for people to turn away from new technologies Or are advances like Total Recall inevitable  I think its inevitable because so much content is being created Virtually everything is coming in digitally  everything from your photos to your videos to your music  I will love that day when the world is just bits Its the ultimate in green by the way

 A vision of computing from Microsofts future thinkerBy  Kevin Voigt CNN   The future of computersSTORY HIGHLIGHTSCraig Mundie Chief Research and Strategy Officer for Microsoft has an ambitious vision for computing Suggests that in a few years computers will be at least  times as powerful as today Told CNN that in the next decade more natural interface with computers will be commonplaceCloud computing will allow wider range of computing possibilities   Singapore CNN  In the next  years the way people interact with computers will wildly change Hand gestures will be as common as the click of a keyboard and an assortment of documents will be selected not with a mouse but with a scan of the eye   Today most peoples interaction is through a screen  whether they touch it type it point or click its still just graphical user interface says Craig Mundie chief research and strategy officer of Microsoft  While thats very powerful and has a lot of applicability I think it will be supplemented in dramatic ways by what we call a natural user interface Mundie said in an interview with CNN on the sidelines of Novembers Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation CEO summit in Singapore  Mundie sat with CNN to discuss his vision of what computing will look and feel like in the decade to come Much like Nintendos Wii and Sony Playstation  are adding physical interactivity to game play Mundie believes the next decade will see a revolution in the way people physically use computers This will be the ultimate aggregation of the ability of the computer to emulate human senses of sight hearing speech touch gesture and couple them together in a different way for people to interact with a machine  



Video The future of computers


Few people in the world are more influential in creating that future than Mundie who took over the reins as head of the worlds largest computer science research department when Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates announced his transition away from daytoday work at the company he founded  As such Mundie keeps his eyes fixed toward the future of computing With an annual budget of  billion Microsoft spends more than any other company on research Mundie said His departments budget wasnt cut during the downturn I tell people my time horizon is between three and  years in the future he said What will fuel the increase in interactivity is powerful new multiprocessor computers which are expected to be widely on the market by   With that we should get a significant performance gain in some cases more than a factor of  he said  So what you ask yourself then is what do you do with a machine that is  to  times faster To me you start to move the basic model of how people interact with computers Mundie said  
You might sit there and look at a catalogue of movies to watch and just flip your hand like you were turning pages in a book and they would flip on the screenCraig Mundie

The first major commercial application of that technology is expected next year when Microsoft is scheduled to release a new line of its Xbox consoles that eliminates the need for handcontrollers altogether  essentially the players become the controllers  Sometime next year the Xbox team will announce this new type of camera which allows you to sit on that sofa along with up to three of your friends or stand and move around and have the Xbox system calculate in real time the angular position of the  major joints in your body Mundie said  You might play games that way You might sit there and look at a catalogue of movies to watch and just flip your hand like you were turning pages in a book and they would flip on the screen and point at the one you want to play he said  Moving into the cloud Also adding to the firepower of computers in the next decade Mundie believes is the evolution of cloud computing  the move of computing power from home PCs and laptops and onto the Web  I think of The Cloud as taking the publishing abilities of the Internet and adding programmability to it he said And so these high scale things  coupled with these new devices which are smarter perhaps more anticipatory in how they interact with you  this will create a new computing platform which will allow us to attack a new range of problems that in the past have really eluded us  Mundie envisages a day in the near future where you have a discussion on how to lower your carbon footprint  with your house  You want to be able to make a contract with your house that says look this is the policy I want with my family about how green I want to be I dont like to be super uncomfortable but you can mess around with the air conditioning a little bit he said  And if I bought an electric car make sure you charge it up to meet my driving requirements but dont charge in the expensive part of the day  You should be able to describe the problem or the policy you want and the computer should be able to somehow implement that he said  It sounds a bit Star Trekish to some people but I really think were within a few years of starting to see the introduction of these kind of things  largely as a function of the increase in computing power both locally and in terms of the backbone of the Internet in the cloud  On a broader level he believes environmental computing will be able to give policy makers realtime analysis of carbon emissions and its global impact on the environment Creation of D science work stations and healthcare applications are considered strong business opportunities in the next decade he added  Mundie has applied his vision of a hightech living to his own home which he completed  months ago is tricked out with stateoftheart computer controls communication and automation with screens of various size dotted in every room  There is a uniform graphical interface that allows you to control almost anything in the house he said You can control the drapes lights the fireplaces and audio systems  His wifes request  Her specification is I had to deliver onebutton television he said And so I did that

 Whither Natal Microsofts unique E challenge 
By Ben Kuchera  Ars Technica  Filed under Gaming  Gadgets   Peter Molyneux and Project Natal at E  STORY HIGHLIGHTS Project Natal is Microsofts motion control hardware  Sony has similar tech coming out  Natal will likely launch this holiday season

 Microsoft has been more than coy about its upcoming motion control hardware known at the moment as Project Natal Some members of the press more fortunate than we are have seen it although their coverage could only include images of the writers not the hardware or the game itself In some demos last year Peter Molyneux helped the reporters play with the creepy virtual boy Milo who could name the color of the writers shirt among other parlor tricks In other words there just isnt much information or handson impressions to be had with Project Natal and the main challenge Microsoft faces at this years E is not only to make the hardware real for the press and the readers at home but to convince readers that this is something they need to buy this holiday season That may be a bigger challenge than everyone assumes Sony had the right idea at GDC At an inviteonly press event during this years Game Developers Conference Sony gave a short presentation on the power of the PlayStation Move with a few gameplay videos and demonstrations and then set the press free in a large warehouselike space next door in order to simply play with the hardware There were no smoke and mirrors here we just played games chatted up Sony representatives and held what seemed to be final or nearfinal hardware in our hands The next day even more games were shown in the Sony lounge where drinks flowed like water and everyone was able to play as much as they wanted It was a partylike atmosphere which was perfect for the more lighthearted games on display We were given a private demo of the newest SOCOM title played with the PlayStation Move Our time with the hardware left us with some things we liked and some things we didnt but it was clear that the technology was ready to go What Microsoft has planned Microsoft is demanding a lot of our time at E this year On Sunday June  there will be a Project Natal demonstration featuring Cirque du Soleil That should certainly be interesting but how much of the hardware and games well see is an open question Microsofts press conference takes place that Monday morning and then there is yet another Natal event Monday evening The company certainly has plenty of time to show off its newest hardware to the press and were expecting Natal to launch this holiday season An event as big as E in June means that we should be given the whole suite of details price release date and games that will launch alongside the hardware The early tech demos sound promising Gizmodo wrote this last June But turning my air steering wheel I felt completely in control A lot of that was the softwareit registered even the smallest pivots of my elbows that sent my forearms right or leftbut the way it responded exactly how I expected it to is what made it feel so natural Which is the real key here It feels natural Engadget had similar praise As soon as we stepped into line in front of the box the avatar immediately took on our stance and movements And we mean really took them onlittle gestures with our arms the posture we had front and back movementsit tracked with complete accuracy We did notice a bit of stutter during some finer movements but overall the effect was impressive and more than a little eerie The groundwork is there but Microsoft runs the risk of having hardware that looks good and promising but without a single game that will cause gamers to reach for their wallets Microsoft is clearly planning a Natal onslaught at Ebut we know next to nothing about the hardware and the launch could be mere months away Microsoft has quite the challenge make the hardware real show that it can work well outside of the perfectly controlled settings where previous demos had taken place and announce a gameor even more ideally gamesthat will make gamers feel like they need one now It may sound simple but its a tall order for such ambitious hardware Well be at E taking in the full range of Microsoft events so keep your eyes here for coverage Until then the speculation will continueCOPYRIGHT  ARSTECHNICACOM

 How Microsoft crowdsourced Office  

By  Brian X Chen  Filed under Innovation    STORY HIGHLIGHTS Microsoft used crowdsourcing to finetune its latest productivity suite Office   About  million people downloaded beta version of Office before it was released  The beta featured Send a Smile a way for users to send feedback questions  Early reviews havent all been good but Windows says new Office is still a work in progress

 Wired  For several years Denise Carlevato has studied millions of mouse clicks and keystrokes made by anonymous computer users from all over the world Her objective to make Microsoft Office better fit the way millions of people work Months before Microsoft rolled out the latest version of its productivity suite Office   million people downloaded its beta version to test the software and provide feedback  As part of the program Microsoft collected  million comments from beta testers An additional  people participated in Microsofts Virtual Research Lab where Carlevato and her colleagues could observe how people were using new features In a sense it was a massive controlled crowdsourcing project Thats just what you have to do to cater to as broad an audience as possible says Carlevato who has worked as a Microsoft usability engineer for  years We do our darnedest to make sure the features we put into our product are the things people ask for Carlevato told Wiredcom We know from watching them work that they really need it Though some tech observers have predicted Microsofts downfall after falling behind in the smartphone game and being oneupped by Apple in market capitalization many agree that reports of the software titans inevitable demise are greatly exaggerated  Microsoft as a whole remains hugely profitable and Office has consistently been the most lucrative part of Microsofts business raking in billions of dollars each quarter even exceeding sales of Windows And although Google offers a competitive productivity suite Google Docs for free Microsoft still has a major advantage  percent of US online consumers regularly use Office while only  percent use Google Docs according to Forrester Research In some ways the Office versus Google Docs debate doesnt merit a lot of consideration  its still no competition said JP Gownder a Forrester analyst In terms of usage and penetration Google Docs remains a failure  so far anyway But staying in the lead with productivity software isnt easy and to retain the loyalty of millions Microsoft goes to great lengths to determine what customers want  For Office  beta Microsoft included a feature called Send a Smile a comment box for testers to submit feedback and suggestions for improvement  Of the  million Send a Smile comments  included the senders email addresses so the engineers working to improve Office could follow up with them To analyze the Send a Smile feedback Microsoft built a database and programmed algorithms to classify and tag comments under certain categories while filtering out biased feedback and useless drivel From that point researchers manually read every single comment to determine necessary tweaks and additions to Office A major new feature birthed from customer feedback was an online broadcasting tool for users to share PowerPoint  presentations by simply sending around a URL according to PJ Hough corporate vice president of Office Program Management We were making many decisions not based on what others were doing but on what customers wanted us to do Hough said We did research on customers that led us to the path Microsoft also invites select users to participate in its Virtual Lab where they are instructed to perform specific tasks such as formatting a section of a Word document or changing the background color of a PowerPoint presentation After lab participants completed each task Carlevato and her colleagues analyzed their history to observe the actions they took The Virtual Research Lab is especially useful when users struggle to finish a task because researchers can examine why they are becoming confused or taking too long and work to resolve the problem This is what usability researchers call unarticulated needs said Carlevato Going beyond virtual testing Microsoft engineers also worked oneonone with human subjects at the University of Washington to create the brandnew Office web apps suite released in midJune A group of  students testing an early version ofOffice web apps met with engineers every two weeks to discuss features they wanted or didnt like in the webbased suite Microsofts product planner Char Popp helped lead the field trial and she said it was crucial to work in a human environment with live feedback because this was the very first version of Office web apps While the team was building it and giving insights and information it was still all like a big jigsaw puzzle she said Toward the end when this all came together I had the opportunity to go out and see how the web apps were actually going to live with real people Early reviews of the Office web apps including Wireds werent stellar citing some missing key features and elements but Microsoft stressed that this was a versionone product and it would continue to collect feedback to improve the service With any release as big as Office you cant do everything all at once said Hough who added that any unaddressed shortcomings are part of our engineering road map Fortunately for Microsoft there are million Windows Live users with access to the Office web apps who can help crowdsource the
