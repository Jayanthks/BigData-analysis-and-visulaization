Campbell Keith Speights and Chuck Saletta The Motley FoolMotley FoolAugust  ReblogShareTweetShareThese three Motley Fool contributors think now could be the perfect time for biotech investors to addSpark Therapeutics NASDAQ ONCEEsperion Therapeutics NASDAQ ESPR and Celgene Corp NASDAQ CELGto portfolios Why An overreaction to trial data could mean Sparks shares are on sale Esperion Therapeutics has big news fast approaching and Celgene may be one of biotechs best bargainbin buysHeres why these biotech stocks may be right for youPerfection is the enemy of the good enoughChuck Saletta Spark Therapeutics Spark Therapeutics recently saw its shares take a nosedive on news that its candidate for hemophilia A treatment worked but not flawlessly Patients involved in its clinical trial saw a substantial reduction in the bleeding associated with hemophilia but there was one serious adverse reaction to the treatment that resulted in hospitalizationA person points at a buy button on a screen displaying an ascending stock price chartMoreIMAGE SOURCE GETTY IMAGESThe clinical results were strong enough that the company is planning to advance to a phase  clinical trial later this year but the side effects were enough to spook investors With strong efficacy to the treatment seen in the earlier trial theres reason to believe Spark will see successes in its phase  trial Still it needs to understand the causes of the adverse reactions and address them to better assure that its compound will get the green light to ultimately be approved for regular treatmentWith no fatalities in the earlier clinical trial and the adverse reactions appearing to have been treatable theres good reason to believe that Spark Therapeutics can ultimately find a path to approval It may need to limit its patient population based on some stilltobedetermined clinical factor and include adverse reaction monitoring in its treatment protocol Still if the end game is effectively a cure for hemophilia A patients will likely flock to the treatment despite the shortterm adverse reaction risksWith its shares down substantially on word of the adverse reactions in the clinical trial the market may be seriously discounting whether theres any value in Sparks treatment in the future An investor buying now may be getting an opportunity to get in while the news is bad  with upside potential if the treatment eventually wins approval Nothing is certain when investing in biotech but if the news improves chances are that this opportunity may be fleetingClosing in on key dataTodd Campbell Esperion Therapeutics There are  million Americans with elevated badcholesterol levels including  million people with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ASCVDwho could benefit from new medications that further lower their badcholesterol levelsCurrently oral statins are commonly used to combat high cholesterol but millions of people still fail to reach their cholesterol targets and many people cant tolerate statins because of side effects such as muscle weaknessIn cases where statins inadequately control bad cholesterol levels addon therapies can be used including Zetia a blockbuster oral drug or PCSK inhibitors which are costly injected therapiesSoon Esperion Therapeutics will report results from its two remaining phase  trials for bempedoic acid an oral drug that reduces cholesterol production upstream of statins So far bempedoic acids trials show it can reduce bad cholesterol by an additional when its used alongside statinsStory continuesData from one of the two remaining trials will show if its safe and effective when its combined in a singlepill formulation with Zetia Results from that trial are expected later this month The second trial is evaluating its use inASCVD patients on maximally tolerated statin therapy Results from that trial are expected in SeptemberAssuming the results from these trials confirm whats been reported so far Esperion Therapeutics plans to file for FDA and EU OK in Q  and Q  respectively If its eventually approved it could provide a lowcost oral alternative to PCSK inhibitors The Zetia combination pill data is particularly important because a win could position it as the goto secondline treatment for people with stubbornly high cholesterol Prior to losing patent protection Zetia was a  billion drug so there could be a significant market opportunity for bempedoic acid in the secondline settingGranted theres no guarantee its trials will pan out or that regulators will approve it or that doctors will prescribe it Nevertheless the addressable patient population is massive and that could make it a smart move to add Esperion Therapeutics to portfolios before it releases its dataIrrational underexuberanceKeith SpeightsCelgene Former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan famously referred to what he perceived as the overvaluation of technology stocks during the heady dotcom days as irrational exuberance I think investors currently have irrational underexuberance for CelgeneThe biotechs share price has crumbled over the last  months although theres been a bit of a rebound since early July But Celgene still trades at a measly  times expected earnings Its pricetoearningstogrowth PEG ratio is aridiculously low There are a few legitimate reasons for investors pessimism Celgene botched its regulatory filing for potential blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug ozanimod earlier this year It experienced a painful latestage clinical failure in  The company continues to be heavily dependent on Revlimid a blood cancer drug that will face generic competition by However Celgene is on track to file again for approval of ozanimod in early  Market research firm EvaluatePharma ranked the biotechs pipeline as the thirdbest in the industry with promising candidates like fedratinib luspatercept and lisocel potentially on the way Celgene also claims blockbuster drugs Pomalyst and Otezla in its lineup which continue to generate solid growth I think the combination of these current winners and several great pipeline candidates should reduce Celgenes reliance on RevlimidSure Celgene has some pipeline risks But its pipeline is getting increasingly less risky in my view I think a little more exuberance is in order for this big biotech stock More From The Motley Fool    Best

LOS ANGELES California CNN  Columnist Arianna Huffington will run for governor of California in the October  recall election she announced Wednesday


In a speech to supporters the Republican turned leftofcenter independent slammed Californias Republican leadership President Bush and Democratic Gov Gray Davis while promising a unique campaign


Im not to say the least a conventional candidate said the Greekborn yearold before joking about her accent  But these are not conventional times  And if we keep electing the same kinds of politicians who got us into the same kinds of mess funded by the same special interests well never get out of this mess


Huffington has never held public office but is well known as a nationally syndicated columnist and television and radio commentator


Speaking outside a youth center that she supports Huffington criticized the recall process that has given her the chance to run for governor


Nothing is more laughable than hearing the Republicans running blame everything about the state on Gray Davis fiscal irresponsibility while ignoring the orgy of fiscal irresponsibility going on in Washington presided over by George W Bush and the Congress


Lets get real  As ineffectual as Davis may be there can be no doubt that it is the Bush administration  with its tax cuts for the wealthy its perverse political priorities and its waytoocozy relationship with Enron and the other energy companies  that have gotten California where it is


She added My Democratic friends are right  this recall is led by an embittered cult of rightwing zealots who have overdosed on taxcuts KoolAid


But Huffington also criticized Democrats for refusing to present other Democratic candidates for governor in the recall election


It is not just politically imperative it is morally imperative that we do not allow this state to be hijacked by the Republicans  And thats why the Democratic strategy of circling the wagons around Gray Davis makes absolutely no sense for the people of California

   Holy hormones What to expect when puberty hitsStory Highlights Your child might be babyfaced today but sooner or later puberty will strike  Some of the issues parents face changing bodies sexual awakening attitude  Expert Tell kids that the changes theyre experiencing are normal  Talk about changes to come cede some control to maturing kids Next Article in Health    By  Denene Millner 



 


 

 
 I saw it  Im not blind The hair peeking from under those arms and the little sprinkle of it Down There too The curvy hips and shapely legs and the bubble booty that would make the bercurvy Beyonc do a double take  
The signs of puberty are a teachable moment says one doctor Let children know theyre okay the way they are 
 The changes were hard for me to miss after all I still supervised my yearolds nightly supersplashy baths  the ones she happily shared with her little sister a gang of doll babies and a school of rubber fish Still when the pediatrician told my husband and me that it was time for us to have a talk with Mari about puberty we were stunned into silence How after all do you tell a child who still worships SpongeBob Hubba Bubba bubble gum and baths for two about boobs bras periods cramps zits and PMS We Were Not Ready But clearly we needed to get ready because our little girls body was starting to make the long slow journey toward becoming a young womans and despite our collective freakout holding out on the info was no longer an option  Ivor Horn MD a Washington DC pediatrician who counsels her patients parents about puberty acknowledges that parents are uncomfortable with such conversations because all too many of us have memories of our own experiences with parents too embarrassed or unwilling to spill But argues Horn its imperative that we inform our kids about the changes occurring in their bodies  before they get the crazy version of facts from fellow prepubescent playmates in the schoolyard  The signs of puberty are a teachable moment adds Horn herself a mom of two ages  and  Its important to let children know theyre okay the way they are that you love them that way that the changes in their body are normal and they can come to you with any questions The comforting thing here is that if you and your child are staring puberty in the face and  like Nick me and Mari  your panties are in a bunch about it youre not alone Lucky for us were not the first to have kids going through The Change and we sure as shooting wont be the last So to help us through I asked moms in the thick of puberty for useful tips What to Expect When You Have a Girl Boobies  Bras When to expect it Between  and  theres a wide range of normal here What to expect The estrogen thats being pumped into your tweens body from her ovaries causes breast budding  small bumps behind the nipples Eventually the nipples and buds will get bigger darker and sometimes even pointy becoming rounder and fuller over time Her boobs will feel a little tender and one breast may be bigger than the other Let her know that this is totally normal and wont last forever Its OK to give her acetaminophen if shes particularly sore At this stage you might want to get her a cupless or sports bra to help give her support and protect her tender breast tissue from rubbing against material that might irritate her says Sherrie Strong owner of a lingerie store in Snellville Georgia How to deal Its going to be hard adjusting to your daughters new body particularly if shes filling out quickly and looking more like a woman than a little girl Try not to make a big deal about it  shes probably selfconscious enough Tori not her real name a Frisco Texas mom of four simply put her daughter Gabi not her real name then  in a Tshirt to help her get a visual on why she needed a bra Ally not her real name a New York City mom gave her daughter Carmen not her real name  now  a bra headsup about two years ago I just treated it like getting broccoli says Ally When we went to Target Id say Hey pick out some bras you like and throw them in the basket Now she loves them so much she sleeps in them Parentingcom How to get your kid to open up to you Tori had a hard time finding a bra that fit Gabi properly Eventually a friend who works at Victorias Secret offered to measure her daughter so theyd know exactly what size to buy Getting fitted is a smart move go as often as you would have her sized for shoes says Strong Some girls seem to go to sleep an A cup and wake up the next day a C cup Wearing a bra that fits well will help protect her from backaches uncomfortable straps and stretch marks which come when the tissue in the breast is unsupported she adds Menstruation When to expect it Between  and  with most typically getting their periods about two years after their breasts start to develop Many girls also get a vaginal mucuslike discharge about six months before they menstruate for the first time What to expect Shes likely to have all the symptoms you have when you get your period backaches cramps acne PMS  the works Dont expect it to be regular at first  it can take as long as two years before shell establish a cycle How to deal My talk with my mom about menstruation went something like this Me Mommy We learned about periods in health class today The teacher said we should get this kit It comes with books and pads and stuff My mom OK That was it I dont want this for Mari and her yearold sister Lila and you probably dont either If you havent already tell your tween what will happen No need to get all technical about it just say Every girls reproductive system  the part that helps your body make babies when youre a grownup  is going to start working There will be blood You are not going to die Its natural and normal Itll be yucky And sometimes your tummy will hurt And youll have a really bad attitude But it happens to all of us One way to start the discussion might be the way Tori did when her girls discovered her pads and tampons in the bathroom My motto is if they ask Ill answer the best I can I did tell them how to use pads and that theyd get cramps backaches acne and all that good stuff      Though my mom wasnt nearly as communicative the kit she eventually purchased for me certainly helped prepare me for what was to come I also remember thinking it was incredibly cool to have my own stash of stuff You can buy some kits online  the Dot Girls First Period Kit available at httpwwwdotgirlproductscom and the Petite Amie My First Cycle Kit For Girls at httpwwwmypetiteamiecomindexphpqHome come with pads tampons and booklets for less than  apiece  but its pretty easy to make one on your own for much less Check out the Kotex and Tampax Web sites theyre full of information you can print out and put into a cute cosmetics bag with pads and tampons You can add other items too like a heating pad pain relievers and sanitary wipes What to Expect When You Have a Boy Muscles When to expect them Somewhere between age  and late teens and for some even early adulthood What to expect He wont look like Arnold Schwarzenegger overnight but your son will start getting more muscular mostly in his arms and shoulders The male puberty hormone testosterone is working with growth hormones to make him fill out Dont be surprised if you catch him making Hulk poses in the mirror  or asking for dumbbells Parentingcom  bigkid milestones Dede King a Brownsville Pennsylvania mom of five says that every night before bed her yearold Cameron does two sets of light weights he bought with her permission Its kind of humorous that Im reading him his Boxcar Children story at the same time that hes trying to bulk up to look like a man King says How to deal He might be in a rush to keep up with his pals but his developing muscles wont be able to withstand heavy weight lifting until hes about  years old and even then its important for him to have supervision and to increase weight slowly Explain to him that the best way to build up his muscles is by eating healthfully and doing all the things kids do  running jumping playing  and doing team sports says Charles Cappetta MD adjunct associate professor of pediatrics at Dartmouth Medical School And if he wants to work out calisthenics like pushups pullups and squats are better for him now and still build muscles Sweating it out five days a week is plenty no more than one hour a day Wet dreams  Masturbation When to expect them Between  and  for wet dreams around  or  for masturbation though it can begin sooner What to expect As his body produces more testosterone your son may start to ejaculate semen at night Sometimes an erotic dream accompanies these releases sometimes it doesnt If they werent masturbating before most boys will figure out how to pleasure themselves around the time they hit puberty Girls masturbate too  it just seems to be a bigger part of boys lives  Nona not her real name a mom from Atlanta Georgia suspects her yearold son has been masturbating for at least a year He politely goes into his room closes the door and goes to town she says How do I know Well he practically jumps off the bed each time I open the door Im not quite sure why he hasnt figured out that he can just lock it How to deal If you havent talked to your son about wet dreams and he has one he might think hes peed in the bed so give him the  and tell him this is perfectly normal If hes embarrassed by the thought of his mom or dad changing his wet sheets put an extra set in his closet and show him how to change the bed himself   Also try to remember that masturbation is normal human behavior  even though its emotionally hard to accept the fact that your child is evolving into a sexual being The more you remind yourself of this the easier it will be to discuss it with him while laying down some rules Let him know that pleasuring himself is something he should do in private and that he should never do it in a public place or a heavily trafficked room in the house where people could walk in on him Parents have a new responsibility too Its time to start knocking on the bedroom door before barging in Parentingcom How to talk to kids about sex   If you or your tween find it too uncomfortable to bring up the subject try this Kathy not her real name of Greenbrae California fills an envelope with pieces of paper each with a hotbutton tween and teen concern like drinking wet dreams or shaving written on it and has her son now  pick one out every couple of weeks The goal is to vary the level of mortifying subjects so they all get the same casual approach says Kathy We call them TenMinute Topics He actually looks forward to these conversations and they often go longer than  minutes What to Expect in Both Attitude When to expect it Tude can start before any physical changes For girls between  and  for boys between  and  What to expect Brace yourself Hormones wont just change childrens bodies  theyll go straight to their brains too Their emotions will go on more rollercoaster rides than the summer crowds at Six Flags Sensitive Moody Intense Like you when youre PMSing but about  times uglier As tweens get older the influx of hormones triggers abrupt mood swings and irritability Part of the freakout comes too when tweens see the physical changes their bodies are going through and realize they have no control over them    Elizabeth Donovan a child mentalhealth therapist based in Centreville Virginia calls it the eyerolling footstomping youresolameMomandDad stage Ally calls it hard as hell Shes a monster she says of her yearold fresh off an argument over whether she can hang out at a local pizza parlor with her friends  sans adult supervision Carmens push for autonomy on everything from how she dresses to whom she befriends turns into almost daily arguments I think the peer pressure is there but the hormones are also conspiring against us says her mom Parentingcom Are tweens the new toddlers How to deal Try not to take it personally  shes acting crazy because the hormones are making her crazy and shes looking for more autonomy because she sees this with her friends and on TV Besides youre a safe target your kid knows you wont reject her no matter how obnoxious she acts  Its more important now than ever to set boundaries and establish new rules What your kid needs right now is a parent whos supportive and understanding but also firm and consistent says Donovan Stay calm dont get caught up in the arguments and give your child a cooldown period so that the two of you can think about what you really want to say and how to say it she suggests  But by all means give appropriate consequences for bad behavior For example if she refuses to stop screaming at you consider taking away a privilege  something she really wants to do says Donovan The key is consistency If you say you will take away her trip to the mall then you must do it otherwise shell believe you dont mean what you say and the negative behavior will increase Ally says letting Carmen have her say goes a long way in controlling the blowups We do let her vent about how much were ruining her life she says And even though I really do want to cut her off I let her talk and I repeat back to her what she says so she sees Im listening Another coping mechanism Laughing as much as she and her husband can when theyre alone says Ally We have to  to keep from losing it Stinky Underarms  Body Hair When to expect it For both boys and girls beginning at age  What to expect Puberty hormones make hair pop out everywhere Boys will get it under their arms and on their chests legs pubic area behind and face girls will get it under their arms and on their legs and pubic region And thanks to estrogen or testosterones effect on a tweens sweat glands your kid will eventually start smelling like a little construction worker after a hard hot day even if hes not sweating that much  Talia not her real name of West Palm Beach Florida says shell never forget the first time she noticed that her son Smith not his real name  then  smelled I picked him up from basketball and all of a sudden it was just like Whoa Now he wears Extra for Men How to deal When it comes to girls and shaving choosing the right time to start is a decision ideally you both make together That said dont be surprised if she pipes up around fifth grade Theres really nothing wrong with her shaving now as long as you show her how to do it safely but it cant hurt to try to encourage her to put it off a year or so Reminding her that once she starts shaving its usually a lifelong commitment may just do the trick Beards on boys are generally the last to develop think high school  youve got time on this one Parentingcom Why we feel uncomfortable addressing our childrens sexuality As for the first time you notice your kid smells um different keep your approach simple Explain that now that her body is changing she needs to be vigilant about showering washing under her arms and using a deodorant Just expect your child to forget to use it  Smith would run out of deodorant and wouldnt tell us because it wasnt important to him We had a couple of years of him just not using it or us having to remind him to wash under his arms with soap and use the deodorant I struggled with him for a long time as far as hygiene goes But Talias aunt gave her some wisdom that got her through the funk years When he wants attention from girls hell remember every day she said Smith is  now  and Talias aunt was right Hes got his own toiletry bag and an interest in a girl he met at school Byebye funkmaster Hello Romeo

 That night after the pediatrician told us to talk to Mari about The Change Nick helped Lila take her bath alone so that I could chat with Mari as she took a bath in our bathroom While she splashed around in the bubbles I told her about her changing body  about boobies and periods hair and curves and cramps and PMS I showed her my sanitary napkins and tampons and told her about how scared I was when I got my first period and how I wished I could have talked to my mom when it happened And I assured her that no question she had on the subject was offlimits with me  She didnt say much  just nodded her head a bit and promised shed come to me if she had questions And then she went back to splashing around in her bubbles happy to be my little girl if only for a little while longer
