In both cases, the devil is in the details, and investors are hungry to see if they got what they paid for these past few months."I expect a big number," says Eric Jackson, shareholder and founder of Ironfire Capital, in the attached video. "I think Facebook probably had a great fourth quarter, it's their biggest quarter of the year."But whether big will be big enough to satisfy investors who have seen the stock rise nearly 50% in three months remains to be seen, as Jackson says "people have been piling in since the end of the monster lock-up in November."Related: Facebook Shares Heading Back to $38 IPO Price, Says KilburgOfficially, analysts are expecting earnings per share of $0.15 on revenues of $1.5 billion. But Jackson, and many other investors, are worried that anything less than a healthy beat could trigger a round of profit taking after the stock's big run up.There's no denying that Facebook is expensive, as it currently trades at 47-times this year's estimated earnings. At roughly $31 a share, the company has grown to an $80 billion market cap, making it the 11th largest member of the Nasdaq 100 index (^NDX), and ahead of more financially robust companies licks Amgen (AMGN) and Ebay (EBAY).While Facebook's recently announced graph search is still in its infancy, Jackson says the company is throwing so many things at the wall right now that at least a few of them are bound to stick and make money, and more importantly, ''grow into its valuations."Facebook earnings are schedule to be released after the close of trading Wednesday. This will be its third report since going public at $38 share last May.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read Next3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Watch in AprilMotley FoolIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatch5 Ways The Smart Money is Playing the Billion Dollar Satellite Internet TrendInsider MonkeyWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolNOT REAL NEWS: A look at what didn't happen this weekAssociated PressZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolHyundai hires former Ghosn ally Munoz as global COO, Americas headReuters'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business Videos1 Big Reason Why Disney Stock Is Just Getting StartedMotley FoolBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBC57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolDo Institutions Own Shares In Cloudera, Inc.

Earnings forecasts are material information, especially when they are prepared by analysts who have had privileged access to company management. As lead underwriters on the IPO, these analysts would have had much better information about the company than anyone else. So the fact that these analysts suddenly all cut their earnings forecasts at the same time, during the roadshow, and then this information was not passed on to the broader public, is a huge problem.Any investor considering an investment in Facebook would consider an estimate cut from the underwriters' analysts "material information."What's more, it's likely that news of these estimate cuts dampened interest in the IPO among those who heard about them. (Reuters reported exactly this--that some institutions were "freaked out" by the estimate cuts, as anyone would have been.)In other words, during the marketing of the Facebook IPO, investors who did not hear about these underwriter estimate cuts were placed at a meaningful and unfair information disadvantage. They did not know what a lot of other investors knew, and they suffered for it.Selective dissemination of this sort could be a direct violation of securities laws. Irrespective of its legality, it is also grossly unfair. The SEC should investigate this immediately.We first heard rumblings about this last week, and we were so startled that we assumed the reports were wrong. Then, over the weekend, when Reuters reported the basic story again, we said that if it was true, Facebook IPO buyers deserved to be "mad as hell" about it. And now Reuters has the details, and they sound as bad as we had feared.There are a couple of possibilities for what happened.The first one is bad news for Morgan Stanley and the other lead underwriters on the deal.The second is also bad news for Facebook.According to Reuters, the underwriter analysts cut their estimates after Facebook issued an amended IPO prospectus in which the company mentioned, vaguely, that recent trends in which users were growing faster than revenue had continued into the second quarter.To those experienced in reading financial statements, this language was unnerving, because its mere existence could have been taken to mean that Facebook's revenue in the second quarter wasn't coming in as strong as Facebook had hoped (why else would the language have suddenly been added at the 11th hour?)To those who aren't experienced at reading filings, however, the real meaning of this language could easily have been missed. Facebook's users have been growing faster than revenue for a while, so why would it be news that this was continuing?In response to the amendment, meanwhile, all three lead underwriter analysts suddenly cut their estimates.Now, regardless of why the analysts cut their estimates (and this will be important), estimate cuts of any sort are material information, so if this news was given to some institutional clients, it also obviously should have been given to everyone.That's the first problem.The second potential question and problem is whether Facebook told the underwriters to cut their estimates--either by directly telling them to, or, more likely, by "suggesting" that the analysts might want to revisit their estimates in light of the new disclosures in the prospectus.If there was any communication at all between Facebook and its underwriters regarding the analysts' estimates, Facebook will likely be on the hook for this, too.Speaking as a former analyst, it seems highly unlikely to me that the vague language in the final IPO amendment would prompt all three underwriter analysts to immediately cut estimates without some sort of nod and wink from someone who knew how Facebook's second quarter was progressing. (To get this message from the language, you really have to read between the lines). But even if this is what happened, it is still unfair that news of the estimate cut wasn't disseminated quickly and clearly to everyone considering buying Facebook's IPO.The bottom line is that, even if dissemination laws were followed to the letter (which frankly seems unlikely), the selective disclosure here was grossly unfair.Story continuesThe SEC needs to look into this.And as it does, the SEC should also revisit the practice that allows underwriter analysts to develop estimates that are used to market IPOs to institutional clients but are not shared with the public. In Europe, research analysts publish full reports on companies BEFORE they go public. This is a much better system, and the U.S. should switch to it. But at the very least, the SEC should mandate that any information given to some clients (e.g., earnings estimates and changes in earnings estimates) be given to all clients.

Facebook says 88 million to 100 million people are on the service during primetime TV hours, almost as many people who watched this year’s Super Bowl.But users might revolt; it’s happened before, many times before.After all, people are flocking to social networks to see cute pictures and silly posts from friends and family, not to sit through ads for pickup trucks, allergy pills and fast food.Related: Facebook's Back: Shares Top $38 IPO PriceAngry users could revive the “Quit Facebook Day” protest from 2011, when a change in privacy settings sparked criticism. But the organizers’ website ended up with only 40,620 “committed Facebook quitters,” a drop in the bucket for the huge social network.And there are some reasons to believe that Facebook will succeed.Last week, additional details about the video advertising leaked out. Ads will run only 15 seconds and users won’t see more than three per day, Bloomberg reported. And advertisers will be charged up to $2.5 million per day – more expensive per second than a TV ad on this year’s Super Bowl broadcast, which went for $4 million per 30 seconds.Facebook declined to comment.Currently, the site allows advertisers to embed video ads in posts, which users only see if they subscribe to the advertisers' feed, limiting the audience to a fraction of Facebook’s users base.But Facebook has already set a precedent for putting unavoidable ads in the main news feed. Starting last year, advertisers could buy spots to run text and picture ads in the feed. The innovation brought few complaints and much new ad revenue and helped the company report a 53% jump in second quarter sales from last year.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said last month that the company found no “meaningful drop” in customer satisfaction when it polled people who saw the static ads in their feeds versus those whose feeds were ad free. Facebook isn't planning to start putting ads yet on Instagram, the photo posting network it bought last year for $1 billion, Zuckerberg added.Google’s YouTube site has slowly but surely been increasing its video advertising without drawing significant criticism. Still, only about 14% of YouTube videos played have ads, according to analyst Rory Maher.Asked about putting video ads in Facebook news feeds on a call with analysts last month, Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg wouldn’t say much.“So the demand to do more in video on Facebook is there, and we're exploring how we can expand that, but we don't have anything new to announce today,” she said.The move would also be consistent with the long-term trend toward increasingly pervasive advertising in American culture. Once upon a time, ads in movie theaters were considered controversial. Telemarketing evolved into faxed ads, email ads, web ads, phone ads and on and on.The biggest controversy in Facebook’s history was probably its 2007 Beacon project, which was going to track users' activity around the web. Beacon set off a wave of bad publicity and Facebook quickly scaled back the plan, then abandoned it altogether in 2009. Last year Zuckerberg admitted the plan was “a small number of high profile mistakes,” the company has made.If enough users complain, Zuckerberg could easily cancel the news feed videos, too. But history suggests he won’t have to.Tell Us What You Think!Send an email to: thedailyticker@yahoo.com.You can also look us up on Twitter and Facebook.More from The Daily Ticker:Detroit Goes Begging as Obama Sends Money OverseasHow Monsanto Controls the Government: Chris ParkerThe Top 5 Steakhouses in AmericaReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read Next3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Watch in AprilMotley FoolNOT REAL NEWS: A look at what didn't happen this weekAssociated PressMom's Post About Putting Kids in Timeout During Tantrums Goes ViralParentsChristchurch shooting videos are still on Facebook over a month laterEngadgetThe Morning After: The Weather Channel got hackedEngadgetZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance1 Big Reason Why Disney Stock Is Just Getting StartedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatchWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceWhy it's so hard for some Americans to get high-speed internetYahoo FinanceJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCoachella Weekend 2: What to Watch ForVarietyMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceTrump sours on Mueller report after initial upbeat viewAssociated PressCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraph5 Ways The Smart Money is Playing the Billion Dollar Satellite Internet TrendInsider Monkey

And advertisers will be charged up to $2.5 million per day – more expensive per second than a TV ad on this year’s Super Bowl broadcast, which went for $4 million per 30 seconds.Facebook declined to comment.Currently, the site allows advertisers to embed video ads in posts, which users only see if they subscribe to the advertisers' feed, limiting the audience to a fraction of Facebook’s users base.But Facebook has already set a precedent for putting unavoidable ads in the main news feed. Starting last year, advertisers could buy spots to run text and picture ads in the feed. The innovation brought few complaints and much new ad revenue and helped the company report a 53% jump in second quarter sales from last year.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said last month that the company found no “meaningful drop” in customer satisfaction when it polled people who saw the static ads in their feeds versus those whose feeds were ad free. Facebook isn't planning to start putting ads yet on Instagram, the photo posting network it bought last year for $1 billion, Zuckerberg added.Google’s YouTube site has slowly but surely been increasing its video advertising without drawing significant criticism. Still, only about 14% of YouTube videos played have ads, according to analyst Rory Maher.Asked about putting video ads in Facebook news feeds on a call with analysts last month, Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg wouldn’t say much.“So the demand to do more in video on Facebook is there, and we're exploring how we can expand that, but we don't have anything new to announce today,” she said.The move would also be consistent with the long-term trend toward increasingly pervasive advertising in American culture. Once upon a time, ads in movie theaters were considered controversial. Telemarketing evolved into faxed ads, email ads, web ads, phone ads and on and on.The biggest controversy in Facebook’s history was probably its 2007 Beacon project, which was going to track users' activity around the web. Beacon set off a wave of bad publicity and Facebook quickly scaled back the plan, then abandoned it altogether in 2009. Last year Zuckerberg admitted the plan was “a small number of high profile mistakes,” the company has made.If enough users complain, Zuckerberg could easily cancel the news feed videos, too. But history suggests he won’t have to.Tell Us What You Think!Send an email to: thedailyticker@yahoo.com.You can also look us up on Twitter and Facebook.More from The Daily Ticker:Detroit Goes Begging as Obama Sends Money OverseasHow Monsanto Controls the Government: Chris ParkerThe Top 5 Steakhouses in AmericaReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read Next3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Watch in AprilMotley FoolNOT REAL NEWS: A look at what didn't happen this weekAssociated PressMom's Post About Putting Kids in Timeout During Tantrums Goes ViralParentsChristchurch shooting videos are still on Facebook over a month laterEngadgetThe Morning After: The Weather Channel got hackedEngadgetZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley Fool1 Big Reason Why Disney Stock Is Just Getting StartedMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCTrump sours on Mueller report after initial upbeat viewAssociated PressIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatchAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraph57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolCoachella Weekend 2: What to Watch ForVarietyWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergThis 1 Assumption Could Totally Destroy Your RetirementMotley Fool3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley Fool

Facebook's Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said to CNBC's Julia Boorstin Monday:"Twelve percent of consumer media time is on mobile, and just 3% of the budgets, and we think we offer by far the best opportunity to reach customers by mobile. Facebook gets one in seven minutes on the desktop. We get one in five minutes on mobile. So, a greater percentage."(Read: 'Like' it or not: 10 things Facebook changed in 10 years)But no everyone thinks Facebook's mobile revenues are what give the company value. Brian Wieser, Senior Analyst at Pivotal Research Group, believes the large amount of time mobile users spend on Facebook doesn't matter so much to the company's top line."Time and money have very little to do with each other," says Wieser on CNBC's Street Signs' Talking Numbers segment. "If that were the case, Google would be generating about $100 million, maybe $1 billion of revenue. It's not a relevant metric but it's a nice story. The reality– and the better story for Facebook – is that it is a bedrock foundation piece of modern advertising."Talking Numbers contributor Richard Ross, Global Technical Strategist at Auerbach Grayson, says Facebook's charts alone make the company a must-have.(Read: Twitter still among 'priciest stocks in the universe'?)"Facebook has to be the cornerstone of any portfolio at this point," says Ross. "The stock is in an outstanding technical position. There's as much as 50% upside from current levels."Ross notes that the stock is now nearly double where it was a year ago thanks in large part to its defining its mobile strategy. He now sees the stock price traveling in an uptrend channel with a $73 per share price target. But he thinks the long-term trend is even more positive."Longer-term, there's 50% upside here," says Ross. "This is a $160 billion company. It could be twice that you'd still be a buyer. You have to own Facebook."To see the full discusson on Facebook with Wieser on the fundamentals and Ross on the technicals, watch the video above.More from Talking Numbers:This chart says Tesla is cheap Why you should think twice before buying Why big tobacco will never go away ________________Follow us on Twitter:  @CNBCNumbersLike us on Facebook: facebook.com/CNBCNumbersReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read Next3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Watch in AprilMotley FoolIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatch5 Ways The Smart Money is Playing the Billion Dollar Satellite Internet TrendInsider MonkeyWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolNOT REAL NEWS: A look at what didn't happen this weekAssociated PressZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolCoachella Weekend 2: What to Watch ForVarietyAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley FoolWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceWhy it's so hard for some Americans to get high-speed internetYahoo FinanceJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNWhere Will Netflix Be in 5 Years?Motley FoolMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceTrump sours on Mueller report after initial upbeat viewAssociated PressWhat's next for Trump following the Mueller Report?Yahoo Finance Video

Facebook already removes verifiably false posts about the dates, times and locations of polling stations — but will now exclude false posts that wrongly describe methods of voting — such as by phone or text message — as well as posts that aim to exclude portions of the population, such as based on a voter’s age, for example.Story continuesReblogShareTweetShareWhat to Read NextIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatch3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Watch in AprilMotley Fool5 Ways The Smart Money is Playing the Billion Dollar Satellite Internet TrendInsider MonkeyWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolNOT REAL NEWS: A look at what didn't happen this weekAssociated PressZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolState defends South Dakota pipeline protest legislationAssociated Press'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business Videos57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetIndia's population skews young, which may sway its electionsAssociated PressAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloomberg3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceThe Boeing 737 MAX Is 1 Step Closer to Flying Again -- but Don't Expect to See It SoonMotley FoolGM Stock Could Take Off if It Takes a Hint From Disney+Motley FoolThis 1 Assumption Could Totally Destroy Your RetirementMotley FoolSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo Finance1 Big Reason Why Disney Stock Is Just Getting StartedMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNMicrosoft staff are openly questioning the value of diversityQuartz

Analysts on average are expecting the company to report $16.4 billion in revenue for the quarter, suggesting growth of 26% YoY. But that would mark a sharp slowdown from growth of 47% YoY in the fourth quarter of 2017.## Mixed 2018 resultsFor the third quarter of 2018, the most recent reported period, Facebook posted $13.7 billion in revenue, an increase of 33% YoY but about $40 million below consensus revenue expectations for the quarter. Snap (SNAP), Twitter (TWTR), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Yelp (YELP) grew their revenues by 43%, 29%, 21%, and 8.0% YoY, respectively, in the third quarter.For the second quarter of 2018, Facebook reported revenue of $13.2 billion, representing an increase of 42% YoY. Still, revenue missed consensus estimates by about $120 million. In the first quarter of 2018, Facebook generated $12 billion in revenue, representing an increase of 49% YoY. First-quarter revenue beat consensus estimates by about $560 million.## Fourth-quarter track recordWhile Facebook’s quarterly growth rate has been slowing (as illustrated above) and the company has reported mixed results so far for 2018, it has routinely topped fourth-quarter expectations. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Facebook generated $13 billion in revenue, beating consensus estimates by around $420 million. In the fourth quarter of 2016, it generated revenue of $8.8 billion, exceeding consensus estimates by $300 million. In the fourth quarter of 2015, revenue was $5.8 billion, about $470 million above consensus estimates.Continue to Next PartBrowse this series on Market Realist:  * Part 2 - Did Facebook’s Profitability Improve in Q4?  * Part 3 - How Facebook’s Advertising Base Is Trending  * Part 4 - Samsung to Install Permanent Version of Facebook AppStory continuesReblogShareTweetShareWhat to Read NextIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatch3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Watch in AprilMotley FoolNOT REAL NEWS: A look at what didn't happen this weekAssociated Press5 Ways The Smart Money is Playing the Billion Dollar Satellite Internet TrendInsider MonkeyMom's Post About Putting Kids in Timeout During Tantrums Goes ViralParentsZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosIs Ubiquiti Networks Inc (UBNT) Going to Burn These Hedge Funds?Insider MonkeyAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolWhy it's so hard for some Americans to get high-speed internetYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceDollar has Sharply Returned to the HighsFX EmpireWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCIs Paycom Software, Inc.

Too many investors have forgotten it, largely thanks to the market's mostly unfettered advance since 2016. But we caught a brief glimpse of that reality in early 2018, when the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell roughly 10% from its peak. The bigger-picture backdrop was so overwhelmingly bullish, however, that investors were quick to forget it and rekindle the rally.This more recent stumble in October was a not-so-gentle reminder that stocks aren't bulletproof. Indeed, equities - still up 12% since early April and headed into a time of year known for marketwide weakness - appear ripe for the bearish pressures of heavy profit-taking. And some stocks that have outperformed their peers of late suddenly seem more vulnerable than others.Here are a dozen stocks to watch that may well take the biggest hits should the market tide turn fully bearish. They've been big winners of late, but they don't appear to have the kind of staying power they need to hold their ground when things get rocky.SEE ALSO: 10 Companies Already Hurt by President Trump's TariffsFacebookGetty ImagesMarket value: $442.1 billionFacebook (FB, $151.38) has been contending with some noncyclical problems of late, putting serious selling pressure on the stock. The 30% loss from its July peak, however, may only be part of its repricing should the market's broad tide worsen any further.Much of Facebook's weakness has been spurred by its own hand, such as the fallout from the Cambridge Analytica debacle. There have been other external drivers, too, including the possibility that the company is nearing its maximum user headcount. Whatever the case, the collective impact of Facebook's headwinds prompted Chief Financial Officer David Wehner to caution a quarter ago that the company expects "revenue growth rates to decline by high single-digit percentages from prior quarters."Wehner also warned that operating margins likely would fall from Q2's 44% to somewhere in the mid-30% area in the foreseeable future.Further fanning the selling flames is a frothy valuation that was deliberately dismissed for too long. Even after losing 30% of their value, FB shares trade at nearly 24 times trailing earnings, and 18.5 times 2019 profit expectations that may be too optimistic.Combine all that with the increasingly troubling market backdrop, and Facebook is among a handful of mega-cap stocks to watch as potential liabilities.SEE ALSO: Millionaires in America: All 50 States RankedNetflixStory continuesCourtesy NetflixMarket value: $144.0 billionNetflix (NFLX, $325.89) is undeniably a "story" stock, bid up to nosebleed valuations based on its premise and hopes for significant profits in the future ... at the expense of comfortable near-term results.The dynamic works when things are good. But when the backdrop turns rocky, the fragility of mere stories - rather than actual results - becomes a liability.Despite the stock's 62% advance so far this year, the pros maintain their price target of $382, up another 17% from current levels. They also still (mostly) rate it a buy, even if not an outright strong buy. That optimism also may quickly turn into a liability, however, if traders start seeing the Netflix glass as half-empty. In that case, that trailing price-to-earnings ratio of 148 starts to look really, really ugly, and the potential for downgrades adds to the threat.Another pitfall could just as easily put Netflix shares into a nosedive in the foreseeable future. Should subscriber growth come up short again as it did a quarter ago, investors may assume it's a sign that Netflix's service is within reach of saturation.SEE ALSO: 7 Sell-Rated Stocks to Avoid This FallAdvanced Micro DevicesCourtesy Matthew Rutledge via FlickrMarket value: $25.0 billionSemiconductor company Advanced Micro Devices (AMD, $25.00) was teetering on the brink of collapse just a few years ago, but some savvy design work has brought AMD back from zombie status. Tech customers are choosing Advanced Micro Devices' wares.Investors have taken notice, and responded. Even with the recent lull, AMD shares are up more than 160% since April's low, and are up nearly 900% since the end of 2015, in anticipation of sales growth that ended up panning out.Sooner or later, though, Advanced Micro Devices must turn that revenue into a respectable profit. It's not clear whether AMD will be able to do that well enough to justify a forward-looking P/E ratio of 38.Rival Intel (INTC) admittedly was caught unaware by AMD's overhaul, but it's not as dead in the water as some observers have suggested. Baird analyst Tristan Gerra expressed such doubts in early October, downgrading AMD and saying:"While AMD's fundamentals continue to improve: 1). PC share gains expectations resulting from Intel's CPU shortage may be too high; 2). Graphic cards channel inventory deleveraging is likely a multi-quarter dynamic; 3). EPYC ramp outlook is impressive but remains limited and Intel will react with new architectures," he wrote. "(The) stock is currently trading at 25x our new 2020 EPS estimate. Expectations are high while Intel continues to execute and will likely introduce new architectures to protect its share in data center in the medium term."SEE ALSO: 7 Struggling Companies in Retreat ModeSalesforce.comCourtesy Salesforce.comMarket value: $106.5 billionCustomer relationship management platform provider Salesforce.com (CRM, $137.81) has been pegged as a buyout candidate for a while now. However, it has largely sidestepped any prospective overtures by being a buyer - of companies including MuleSoft and Demandware - more than dressing itself up as a buyee.Investors have loved all the growth (organic and inorganic alike) that deal-making has driven. CRM shares are up a whopping 33% so far this year even factoring in the stock's recent weakness; they've roughly doubled since the end of 2016.Those bulls may have gotten ahead of themselves. Salesforce.com's revenues are projected to rise 26% this year and another 20% in 2019, while per-share earnings are expected to improve from $1.35 in 2017 to $2.51 this year and $2.73 next. But the stock's current valuation is nearly impossible to justify outside of the now-waning market euphoria. CRM is priced at 51 times its forward-looking earnings, and traders are taking notice, hence the 14% slide in just two weeks. And the bears might not be done repricing Salesforce.com to reflect newly realized market risks.SEE ALSO: 7 Low-Cost Gold ETFsAdvance Auto PartsCourtesy Mike Mozart via FlickrMarket value: $12.2 billionAdvance Auto Parts (AAP, $163.17) is a company that has been strangely resilient of late, defying the broad tide. But it's still just as prone to a pullback amid greater weakness, and has more to pay the piper than its peers should the ball get rolling.By almost all accounts, Advance Auto Parts should be fighting a losing battle. Not only is it competing with Amazon.com (AMZN), it's fighting a war against more durable, longer-lasting vehicles. New-car sales may be slowing, but with so many barely used cars on the road and much older vehicles still working just fine, repairs and maintenance needs are minimized.The proof is in the numbers. Advance Auto Parts' revenues and operating income have been down more often than not since late 2015. Yet AAP shares are up 55% year-to-date, translating into an uncomfortably frothy forward-looking P/E of 20.5 -- and have given up very little ground since the end of August despite all the red flags.Don't blindly rely on this apparent strength. This may be a case where the would-be sellers haven't gotten around to tearing into Advance Auto Parts, and are instead waiting on just the right trigger. With so much pent-up downside, however, AAP could get hard in one sweeping selloff.SEE ALSO: 10 of the Market's Most Shorted StocksIlluminaCourtesy IlluminaMarket value: $46.0 billionShares of health diagnostic outfit Illumina (ILMN, $304.76) have already been backpedaling, losing more than 15% of their value just since the beginning of the month. However, ILMN still is up about 40% for the year, and the drubbing might not be over yet if the environment remains bearish.Illumina is the real deal within the genome-sequencing realm. It can look at anyone's DNA and spot potential genetic problems, diagnose vulnerability to cancer and weigh reproductive hurdles. More tests are on the way too, as medical science continues to figure out exactly how human genetic material works. But even without more testing options, Illumina has enjoyed years' worth of double-digit sales growth and reliable net profits since 2014.A lot can change when investors become nervous, however. Even acknowledging strong predicted earnings growth for Illumina this year and next, ILMN's trailing P/E of 70 and projected P/E of 50 start to look problematic, especially when viewed through a bear's spectacles. Indeed, valuation might be what has sparked the selloff so far.SEE ALSO: 10 Best ETFs to Buy for an All-Weather PortfolioCincinnati FinancialGetty ImagesMarket value: $12.2 billionMost financial stocks have struggled since August, as investors weighed the potential impact of an inverted yield curve and priced in the raw toll that higher interest rates might take on finance-related activity. Shares of insurer Cincinnati Financial (CINF, $76.33) have mostly sidestepped this headwind.But it might not be able to do so indefinitely.Sure Dividend CEO Ben Reynolds explains about this Dividend Aristocrat, "Cincinnati Financial is extremely overvalued today. The company is currently trading for a price-to-earnings ratio of 29.5 and a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.6. Over the past decade, the company's stock has traded for an average price-to-earnings ratio of 20.5."Reynolds also is concerned about the time it takes CINF to work past cyclical problems, which would include a yield-curve inversion. Sure Dividend's chief continues, "Cincinnati Financial is vulnerable during recessions. Earnings per share declined from $3.54 in 2007 down to $1.32 in 2009, a 63% decline. And the company's adjusted earnings-per-share have still not hit pre-Great Recession highs."Even if turbulence doesn't turn into a full-blown recession, it could do enough damage to ding the company's bottom line for the foreseeable future. Suddenly, investors have good reason to second-guess the resiliency they've priced into CINF shares.TripAdvisorGetty ImagesMarket value: $6.2 billionTripAdvisor (TRIP, $44.20) already was in trouble before the market bumped into a headwind. While TripAdvisor still is a destination within the online travel-booking arena, its role and value are being increasingly questioned by at least a couple of its biggest customers: Booking.com (BKNG) and Expedia (EXPE).Many consumers assume all these companies are doing the same thing, in competition with one another. That's not exactly the case. Expedia and Booking rely on TripAdvisor to connect its customers with their clients, and they pay TripAdvisor for those referrals.As time marches on, though, Expedia, Booking.com and their peers increasingly don't need TripAdvisor to serve as a middleman. Meanwhile, Alphabet (GOOGL) division Google - which has been in this business for a while - just rolled out a few more tools that allow it to more effectively act as an online travel agent.Both are problematic for the beleaguered TripAdvisor. But more than that, it's a double-barreled liability most investors are choosing not to stomach. Shares are down 27% since July's high, but could fall more if investors believe the economy's recent strength is in jeopardy.SEE ALSO: The Best and Worst Presidents (According to the Stock Market)ANGI HomeservicesGetty ImagesMarket value: $9.2 billionOnline services conglomerate ANGI Homeservices (ANGI, $18.97) - you may know it better as its combined brands, Angie's List and HomeAdvisor - is a great concept. That's a big part of why IAC/InterActiveCorp (IAC) acquired Angie's List in 2017, then spun it off after combining it with HomeAdvisor. It has acquired several other similar platforms before that deal and even a couple more in the meantime, all in the name of greater scale that would lead to wider profit margins.But online consumer services is an increasingly crowded market with an increasingly limited potential for profit growth. And IAC's strategy hasn't worked out all that well. Some would say it hasn't worked at all.Most growth has been inorganic, and losses (on operating and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles bases) remain the norm. That might be a key part of why CEO Chris Terrill will be stepping down at the end of this year and passing the torch to the company's chief product officer, Brandon Ridenour. But ANGI may not have a personnel problem - it may the product (or products) itself that is the crux of the company's growth challenges.Between the sheer disruption of a CEO transition and the lingering doubts incited by the change, the 9% stumble ANGI shares have suffered since the Ridenour announcement may only be the beginning of the stock's weakness.CarvanaGetty ImagesMarket value: $6.5 billionUsed-car sales venue Carvana (CVNA, $46.57) already is feeling the pressure of a cyclical slowdown in automobile sales. If the broad market hits a speedbump, it may feel worse than it really is, but it'll still feel bad enough to bring Carvana to a screeching halt."Peak auto" in the United States was a real thing, marked by an annualized sales pace of 18.25 million new cars in November 2015. That peak caused a ripple effect, spurring the turn-ins of millions of barely used vehicles before and after the new-car mania. Now both face a slowdown; most anyone who wanted to purchase a new or relatively unused automobile now has one.Carvana still is growing its top line, though the pace of growth has diminished over the past couple quarters. Meanwhile, the company has logged a net loss in each of those two quarters, pulling it back into red ink - something CVNA hadn't planned on happening.That brewing concern is a big part of the reason CVNA has peeled back roughly 35% from the high hit in September. But with 150% year-to-date gains still in its pocket, Carvana is one of several stocks to watch for continued profit-taking potential.SEE ALSO: 45 Smart Financial Moves You Can Make in an Hour or LessTwilioGetty ImagesMarket value: $7.0 billionTwilio (TWLO, $68.02) has had an amazing 2018. Shares were up more than 260% for the year at one point, and even the recent pullback leaves TWLO with an impressive 183% gain.But like Carvana, those big gains leave Twilio vulnerable to further downside.Twilio offers businesses a variety of cloud-based services, ranging from login authentications to text marketing to call-routing and more. There's clearly a growing market for such services, as the world becomes increasingly digital and consumers are increasingly connected to their smartphones. This paradigm shift and Twilio's real solutions made for an easy bullish argument.The bulls have arguably gotten more than a little overzealous, however. TWLO shares are trading at nearly 470 times next year's adjusted earnings estimates, and at 14 times the company's trailing 12-month sales. The marketwide P/S average is a bit below 3.Translation: Even if Twilio squeezes the most profit it possibly can out of its revenue, it's still going to be valued well beyond the norm. Investors are more apt to sell off such wildly overpriced stocks if the market gets any hairier.Iridium CommunicationsGetty ImagesMarket value: $2.2 billionIridium Communications (IRDM, $19.57) isn't exactly a household name, but that doesn't make it any less vulnerable to a setback. The stock is up more than 70% from May's low despite a sizable pullback since the end of September, so there's room for profit-takers to plow in. There's reason, too.Iridium Communications makes and market satellite-based communications solutions. It names the U.S. government as a customer, but it also offers services to and with private enterprises. It's partnering with Amazon.com, for instance, to co-develop a platform that will power the Internet of Things.Business has been stable, but not impressive. It hasn't recorded sustained revenue growth since 2012, and operating income has been slipping since 2017.So why this year's big rally? Investors, as they usually do, are looking past the present into the future. The market believes Iridium's Amazon partnership could become a model for similar deals, rekindling revenue and profit growth for good. That may happen.But the difference between the company's GAAP and non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings is difficult to handicap, and investors tend to be forgiving of actual losses when the backdrop turns bleak. Never even mind that non-GAAP profits are currently edging lower.That makes IRDM among the momentum stocks to watch that are sitting dangerously close to the cliff's edge.SEE ALSO: Best Online Brokers, 2018EDITOR'S PICKS12 Top Stock Picks to Shield Your Portfolio53 Best Dividend Stocks for 2018 and BeyondAmerica\'s Most Popular Breakfast Cereals (And the Stocks Behind Them)Copyright 2018 The Kiplinger Washington EditorsReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextMarijuana Stocks: Let the Writedowns BeginMotley FoolNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunch2 Stocks You Can Buy and Hold ForeverMotley Fool2 Top Stocks You Can Buy on SaleMotley FoolBeyoncè's Netflix deal reportedly worth $60 million: VarietyMarketWatchZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool5 Top Pharmaceutical Stocks to Buy in 2019Motley FoolAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHere's What Hedge Funds Think About Old Republic International Corporation (ORI)Insider MonkeyWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphIf You Had Bought CBL & Associates Properties (NYSE:CBL) Stock Five Years Ago, You'd Be Sitting On A 93% Loss, TodaySimply Wall St.Misfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance內地熱門城市樓價回升星島日報57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolWhat's next for Trump following the Mueller Report?Yahoo Finance Video

Heck, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has rallied almost 40% off its Christmas Eve low. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) had been one of the best FANG performers during December, a surprise to many investors given how poorly the name has done since July.The sentiment is starting to charge, not only around Facebook stock, but around stocks in general. That has left investors wondering if now may be the time to get long the social media giant.After all, Facebook possesses platforms like Instagram and WhatsApp, not to mention its own legacy platform. Thanks to its rich vault of user data, it’s able to offer advertisers pinpoint accuracy when it comes to targeted ad searches. For years, that paved the way to enormous growth at Facebook, not to mention its huge margins.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsThe company has been under attack this year though. The media has been slugging Facebook left and right for its questionable data use and business practices, while management hasn’t exactly been upbeat. That has put a beating on the stock, as you’ll see in the two charts below.Trading FB Stockchart of FB stockMore Click to EnlargeA look at the 30-month weekly chart shows how quickly Facebook stock price has retreated. Shares sank from almost $220 at its highs in July to sub-$125 last month. From peak to trough, we’re talking about a roughly 45% decline.  10 Stocks You Can Set and Forget (Even In This Market)  That’s a big-time beating for what was one of the market’s best-performing stocks over the last few years. After falling below the 200-week moving average in December, FB stock has regained this level. In fact, it’s pushing over downtrend resistance (purple line) as well as the 10-week moving average. That’s an encouraging sign for bulls and if the market can maintain momentum, FB stock could be ready to make a large move, perhaps back to the $150-ish level.We can also see that momentum is slowly progressing to a potentially bullish setup, highlighted by the blue circle at the bottom. Should resistance succeed and knock FB back down, I want to see if $130 holds as support. If it doesn’t, $120 could be on the table.chart of FB stockMore Click to EnlargeOn the short-term chart above, we see Facebook stock poking over the 21-day moving average. However, it’s near downtrend resistance (blue line) and just below the 50-day moving average. Over the 50-day and FB stock will look much better and it could pave the way to a rally up to the $150 to $155 area.Ultimately, I need to see what levels hold up as support for FB, rather than what levels hold up as resistance. Resistance gives bears a low-risk shorting opportunity, but those looking to buy need to know what level is safe. Right now, that’s not entirely clear. I would love to see FB hold this $130 to $132 area on a market-wide pullback.Bottom Line on Facebook StockFacebook has a lot of positives, despite floating in a sea of negatives at the moment. It owns some of the internet’s most prized possessions and makes plenty of money in the process. However, the company has very much become a prove-it story.The prove-it thesis holds solid ground on the technicals, as you can see above. Facebook stock literally has to prove to investors that it has what it takes to rally, and that means it has to get out of this nasty downtrend. On the fundamental front, management needs to prove it can achieve growth.While 2018 will probably still be a solid year for Facebook fundamentally, 2019 is not the same. Facebook is forecast to grow sales and earnings about 36% this year. In 2019, earnings expectations slow to just 0.9% growth, despite almost 25% revenue growth. That leaves FB stock at about 18.4 times this year’s earnings.Story continuesNot an outrageous valuation, but without a return to earnings growth, investors won’t want to pay up to own this name. Even if it’s more profitable than social media peers like Snap (NYSE:SNAP) and Twitter (NYSE:TWTR).Bret Kenwell is the manager and author of Future Blue Chips and is on Twitter @BretKenwell.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)MoreFor Facebook (FB), the question about 2019 isn’t whether the year will be excruciating for the social network; it’s how excruciating it will get.Two toxic storylines that unfolded throughout 2018—Facebook’s careless treatment of users’ data and ineffectual responses to abuses of its system—won’t go away in 2019. And depending on how angry regulators and legislators get about them, they could impose serious costs on the company.Facebook, meet FTCFacebook’s most serious threat comes from a settlement it signed with the Federal Trade Commission in 2012 after it had engaged in a bout of settings changes that exposed some private data and left enraged users threatening to quit (sound familiar?).Under that deal with that regulatory agency, the firm pledged to institute a comprehensive privacy-protection program and to obtain people’s upfront permission before making any of their user data more public.Then the Cambridge Analytica data heist happened: A personality-quiz app that some 300,000 Facebook users installed wound up collecting the data of about 87 million of their friends and funneling it to that now-shuttered research firm. That’s taken a hammer to those promises and led Stifel analyst Scott Devitt to headline a late-October note to clients “Facebook: digital tobacco.”Cambridge Analytica now puts the FTC in a position to take a hammer to Facebook—if it determines the company violated the terms of its deal. That settlement left Facebook exposed to fines of $16,000 per violation, a cost that subsequent adjustments have raised to $41,484.Christopher Wylie, former director of research at Cambridge Analytica, testifies during a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee at Capitol Hill, Wednesday, May 16, 2018, in Washington. ( AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)MoreMultiply that by the 70 million-plus U.S. users whose data was compromised by the personality-quiz app at stake in the Cambridge scandal, and you’re looking at $2.9 trillion and change.In early December, Columbia University law professor Tim Wu estimated the odds of some sort of enforcement action at 80%. Two weeks later, after The New York Times reported on Facebook’s sloppy oversight of leaky data-sharing partnerships, he amended that estimate in an e-mail: “Now 95%.”Other government offices will take a bite, tooBut some action doesn’t mean strong action. Hal Singer, an economist and professor at Georgetown University’s business school, worried that the FTC would continue to exhibit symptoms of regulatory capture—when an agency listens too closely to the firms it oversees. “The FTC sure behaves that way,” he commented.Facebook’s harshest critics would like to see the FTC not just fine Facebook but also impose a structural remedy—as in, forcing the company to undo its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp and spin them off as revived competitors.That still seems unlikely. Dipayan Ghosh, a fellow at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government and earlier a privacy and public-policy adviser at Facebook, predicted “a new set of stringent commitments forced on the company that builds significantly off of its existing consent order.”But the European Union has a say too, and the EU has already shown itself far more willing to whack U.S. tech giants with punishments far harsher than anything the FTC has handed down lately. So far, however, Facebook’s only been hit with a £500,000 fine by a U.K. regulator, the maximum possible under pre-2018 regulations.Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s next visit to Congress—that’s a matter of “when,” not “if”—will also probably feature pointed questions about a structural cure.FILE- In this Sept. 5, 2018, file photo Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg testifies before the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on 'Foreign Influence Operations and Their Use of Social Media Platforms' on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana, File)MoreStory continuesThat interrogation is likely to come from both sides of the aisle. While many incoming Democratic House representatives campaigned on providing a check to corporate power, incoming Sen. Josh Hawley (R.-Mo.) has voiced similar critiques of social-media giants.For Republicans skeptical of complicated regulatory frameworks, injecting competition into the market by forcing Facebook to spin off Instagram may have a refreshing simplicity to it."It's not clear to me that the current system is good for innovation,” conservative pundit Bill Kristol said at a late-November event introducing a set of tech-policy proposals featuring serious curbs on the power of social networks. He compared their dominance to that of Ma Bell-era AT&T.Don’t forget that states and cities, some of which actually have comprehensive privacy rules of their own, can take action independent of Washington. On Dec. 19, Washington, D.C., attorney general Karl Racine sued Facebook for violating District privacy laws. He’s likely to have company: In March, 37 state and territory attorneys general signed a letter to Zuckerberg asking for answers about the Cambridge Analytica case.Some things Facebook could doIf Facebook spends next year responding to these criticisms by warming up the same lame defenses that persuaded few people this year—bland pledges to do better, unaccompanied by meaningful changes in policy—things will only get worse for the company.It needs to embrace transparency instead of regarding it as a medicine only administered in tightly controlled doses. (One start: finally shipping the promised “Clear History” tool to edit and delete Facebook’s data about your activity on other sites.) The company needs to hold somebody accountable—somehow, nobody seems to have gotten fired for these mistakes. And it needs to drop its growth-hacking habit of preying on everybody’s fear of missing out with incessant, nagging notifications.If Zuckerberg is serious about focusing on “time well spent,” his company needs to accept that this means less time overall on Facebook. That would be good for the company in the long run—and good for everybody else sooner.More from Rob:Facebook wants to give you a way to fight having your posts taken downGoogle Maps will now help you find Lime scootersMicrosoft is asking the government to regulate the company’s facial recognition technologyEmail Rob at rob@robpegoraro.com; follow him on Twitter at @robpegoraro.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatch3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Watch in AprilMotley FoolNOT REAL NEWS: A look at what didn't happen this weekAssociated PressMom's Post About Putting Kids in Timeout During Tantrums Goes ViralParentsThe Morning After: The Weather Channel got hackedEngadgetZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley Fool'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolChristchurch shooting videos are still on Facebook over a month laterEngadgetBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraph內地熱門城市樓價回升星島日報5 Ways The Smart Money is Playing the Billion Dollar Satellite Internet TrendInsider MonkeyAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin Rivet3 Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Next 50 YearsMotley FoolWhy Livestreaming TV Can't Break ThroughMotley FoolWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceThe Boeing 737 MAX Is 1 Step Closer to Flying Again -- but Don't Expect to See It SoonMotley FoolThis 1 Assumption Could Totally Destroy Your RetirementMotley FoolWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo Finance

The stock is up about 450% overall, and it's more than doubled over the past three years.But Facebook is facing some problems: a data privacy scandal that's still unfolding, leading to investigations from the FTC and SEC; evidence that teens have little interest in using Facebook; and a valuation that bakes in some optimistic assumptions about growth and profitability.If you want to invest in a stock that could outperform Facebook in the coming years, three of our Fool.com contributors have some ideas. Here's why you should take a look at Proto Labs (NYSE: PRLB), Walmart (NYSE: WMT), and Axon Enterprise (NASDAQ: AAXN).The Facebook app on a smartphone.MoreImage source: Facebook.A new kind of manufacturing companyTravis Hoium (Proto Labs): It's no small feat to upend the manufacturing industry, but that's exactly what Proto Labs is doing. The company is making it easier to develop products with rapid prototyping tools like 3D printing, CNC machining, and small-batch injection molding. These are valuable tools as product development cycles get shorter and companies need on-demand services to quickly expand production, test materials, and offer customization, all more quickly than traditional manufacturing methods. PRLB Revenue (TTM) ChartMorePRLB Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts.The financial growth Proto Labs has shown from its rapid prototyping model speaks for itself. Over the last decade, both revenue and net income are up over 400% and show no sign of slowing down. The company continues to add both manufacturing facilities and capabilities for rapid prototyping that make it more useful to designers. It's also technology agnostic, adding and subtracting technology and tooling as necessary, rather than betting its future on one technology that may go out of favor. Where I think Proto Labs has a durable advantage over the competition is as a preferred supplier to the key decision makers in the design process. It's not trying to sell 3D printers to consumers or schools, a mistake 3D printer manufacturers made. Instead, Proto Labs is working directly with the designers building parts and making manufacturing decisions. If the company is able to please those customers, it'll be able to build on its already solid foundation and generate outstanding returns for investors in the long term. Story continuesA retail resurgenceTim Green (Walmart): With Facebook valued at around $600 billion and facing investigations into its lax data security, I don't think it's a stretch to say that the stock may be in for a rough ride. Walmart, the megaretailer that's reinventing itself for the age of e-commerce, could end up producing better returns for investors.You may not consider Walmart to be a growth stock, but I think that's a mistake. Comparable-store sales have been steadily growing for years, at a time when the retail industry is going through a reckoning. Walmart's online business is also booming, with the company expecting around 40% growth this year. Online grocery as well as free two-day shipping are helping to drive customers to the retail chain.Because Walmart is so big, even modest growth translates into big increases in sales. With about $500 billion of annual revenue, each percentage point of growth leads to $5 billion of additional revenue. The bottom line is taking a hit as the company invests in e-commerce, but the end result will be an even bigger retailer with a solid foothold in online retail.If you think Amazon is going to dominate online retail indefinitely, I think you're in for a surprise. Walmart should not be counted out. If the company can keep growing its e-commerce sales at a brisk pace while maintaining the solid performance of its stores, the stock could be a winner over the next few years.An emerging security leaderJeremy Bowman (Axon Enterprise): Facebook has become one of the biggest companies in the world thanks to its dominance of social media, the power of network effects, and platforms like Instagram and WhatsApp, which create a multiplier effect.Axon Enterprise, the company formerly known as TASER International and maker of the eponymous stun gun, has many similar qualities in its industry, security and law enforcement.  Like Facebook, Axon is the market leader in its own niche of conducted electrical weapons (better known as Tasers). However, that's not the company's only business, as it's also the leader body cameras, which are growing more popular amid controversy over police shootings and violence. It also has its own cloud-based digital evidence management software, Evidence.com. Those three business components support and reinforce each other to create a tight web of network effects, as the information from body cameras, in-car video, and audio recordings can easily be uploaded onto the Evidence.com database.That combination of businesses has delivered solid growth for Axon. Revenue increased 28% in its most recent quarter to $101 million, and its operating margin nearly doubled from 6.8% a year ago to 13.4%. That margin expansion is due to its software and sensors segment, and should continue, as Evidence.com is a subscription-based business, a model that naturally expands as it draws more users. As a result, adjusted earnings per share in the quarter more than doubled from $0.14 to $0.32. Thanks to a surge after both of its earnings reports this year, Axon shares are up a whopping 160% so far in 2018, but with a potent combination of businesses and the increasing need for security and evidence management, this stock could just be getting started.

(NASDAQ:FB) has begun to rise again. The Facebook stock chart took a beating following the Cambridge Analytica scandal. However, with a solid earnings report, FB stock gained some of that value back. Now, as FB recovers from the lowered focus on ads and Cambridge Analytica, FB again resumes its growth path. FB currently trades 10% below its 52-week high. I believe FB can recoup lost advertising revenue and gain the 10% back in the near term for three reasons.Reason 1: Less Emotion-Driven TradingThe year 2018 has proven itself to be a roller coaster ride for the Facebook stock chart. As many might recall, the downward moves on the Facebook stock chart began with negative FB stock news. CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the FB News Feed would have more of a “friends and family” focus. The equity sold off further on Facebook’s alleged role in influencing the 2016 presidential election.However, traders need to exercise perspective in this regard. InvestorPlace’s Josh Enomoto correctly stated that traders made an emotion-driven decision in selling off FB. The theory that Russian hackers influenced the outcome of the 2016 Presidental election has persisted in the news cycle for months. For that reason, stock analysts might understand why even the hint of involvement from the social media giant might motivate investors to sell the stock.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  10 Small-Cap Stocks With Large-Cap Potential  Still, I think sellers failed to see the big picture. The idea that FB, which is having to manage perceptions of anti-conservative bias, influenced the election in favor of President Trump comes across as lacking credibility. Further, as Enomoto stated in his analysis, “who did the actual voting?” Fortunately for FB stock investors, the emotions that drove this downward move have begun to fade.Reason 2: The Facebook Dating AppWhile arguments about Facebook influencing elections may lack credibility, its strategic moves do not. Much like its big tech counterpart Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), FB strikes fear amongst potential competitors. Twitter Inc (NASDAQ:TWTR) and Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) have reeled under Facebook’s competitive threat. FB’s next victim has become Match Group Inc (NASDAQ:MTCH). MTCH stock fell 18% upon Facebook’s announcement of its dating app.MTCH investors should be afraid. FB already has the most of the data needed to present its users as dating prospects. With the new app, users will have an easier time filling out a profile. Also, they will not have to pay high fees to belong to a dating site. This app serves as another powerful way to apply FB’s massive data trove. It also opens up a new avenue to sell ads. Furthermore, FB thrived through the years because users voluntarily handed over personal data. A dating app gives users reasons to share more data — sometimes of a very personal nature — which FB could find more ways to monetize.Reason 3: Compelling Chart and FundamentalsIf dating apps or the emotion-driven trading decision of recent months do not show FB stock as a buying opportunity, perhaps other factors will. The Facebook stock chart saw a dramatic reversal to the upside following earnings. With the earnings beat, both the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) and the stochastics indicate the uptrend has returned.Even after the 9% increase in earnings, FB stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 23. Moreover, earnings estimates project an average annual growth rate exceeding 20% over the next three years.The Facebook stock chart and the fundamentals show FB can rise 10% to return to its 52-week high. More importantly, it can return to the growth trajectory that has given FB one of the largest market caps in the world.Concluding Thoughts on FB StockFacebook stock will rise back to its 52-week high and beyond for several reasons. FB stock took a hit first by reducing ad space and second, by its supposed role in the Cambridge Analytica scandal.However, both the earnings numbers and the stock chart show this correction in Facebook was driven by one thing — feelings. The latest earnings report shows these feelings to be largely unfounded. Moreover, with the upcoming Facebook dating app, Facebook will be well-positioned to recoup lost ad revenue and gain new data which could they potentially monetize. Furthermore, the stock trades at a forward PE of about 23 and enjoys a near-term earnings growth rate above 20%.  Warning: 5 Stocks to Ditch in May and Go Away (Including Tesla Inc)  As for the question of “Should I buy Facebook stock today,” both the fundamentals and the charts state an emphatic “YES!”As of this writing, Will Healy did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned stocks.More From InvestorPlace  10 'Toxic' Stocks Investors Will Dump Next    5 Beaten-Down Stocks to Scoop Up Now    These 7 Best-Performing CEOs Guarantee High Returns    10 High-Tech Gifts Mom Would Love for Mother’s Day   Compare Brokers The post 3 Reasons Facebook Inc Will Go Up 10% – and Beyond appeared first on InvestorPlace.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatchIs Snap Inc (SNAP) A Good Stock To Buy According To Hedge Funds?Insider Monkey3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Watch in AprilMotley FoolWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolYou don't need a computer science degree to run Google or Facebook, says former Google CEO Eric SchmidtYahoo FinanceZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceShould We Be Delighted With CVR Energy, Inc.'s (NYSE:CVI) ROE Of 22%?Simply Wall St.Aon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHere's What Hedge Funds Think About NIO Inc.

Just one of those 30 stocks in the Dow on its expansion date in October 1928 still remains today: ExxonMobil, which back then was known as the Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey. A welcome mat lying on a deck.MoreImage source: Getty Images.Since May 26, 1896, the Dow has undergone more than 50 component changes to the index. A committee that meets a few times annually and decides whether or not to make changes attempts to present the best picture of the U.S. economy using only 30 stocks. This means packing the Dow with meaningful companies, while also attempting to represent as many sectors and industries as possible. It's not an easy task, and any number of changes in a company's corporate structure via a merger, spinoff, or perhaps just poor performance could mean the removal of a Dow component from the index.Recently, we witnessed industrial conglomerate General Electric get the boot from the Dow after what was a more than 110-year run in the index. ExxonMobil still has another 20 years to go if it wants to top that mark set by GE. But General Electric's departure demonstrates that change is a relative constant in the Dow.Earlier this week, I looked at the next three stocks that I believe have the best chance of being kicked out of the Dow, with DowDuPont being my likeliest selection. Considering that DowDuPont has plans to break up into three separate but focused companies by the first half of 2019, its relevance in the Dow could fall, prompting the S&P Dow Jones Indices committee to show the industrial giant the door. Which stocks could be added to the Dow next? But the real question is: Which stock(s) could be the next to join the Dow?While it's nothing more than dart throwing at this point, I have my eye on three possible substitutes.A customer with a basket of fruit waiting in line at the supermarket to pay.MoreStory continuesImage source: Getty Images.Costco Wholesale With plenty of healthcare and technology sector representation in the Dow, one interesting aspect about the index is that there's very little representation from the food industry. Yes, beverage giant Coca-Cola and fast-casual restaurant chain McDonald's are part of the index, but that doesn't tell us enough about the food industry or consumers' buying habits. That's why I believe the addition of Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) to the Dow would be a nice fit.To begin with, approximately two-thirds of Costco's sales are food items, which would give the Dow a considerably more accurate representation of the food industry.Secondly, unlike a majority of retailers, Costco isn't a company that relies on netting the bulk of its profit in two or three months out of the year. Most of its margin is derived from a membership fee charged annually to customers who wish to shop at its warehouses. This membership fee actually allows Costco's profits to front-run consumer purchases as opposed to lagging those purchases, as is common with mall-based retailers. That should allow for earnings consistency not often seen with consumer-based companies included in the Dow.And finally, because these membership fees, which often have a very high renewal rate among existing members, provide the bulk of Costco's profits, the company tends to keep the margins on its food items razor thin. This can provide an even more accurate glimpse of how the food industry is performing, as well as how those prices are impacting consumer buying habits. Let's not forget that around 70% of U.S. gross domestic product is consumption-based.With a $217 share price and a meaningful market cap of $95 billion, Costco would make for a smart addition to the Dow.Surgeons in an operating room with an individual's vitals displayed on a computer screen.MoreImage source: Getty Images.Medtronic David Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, opined in a statement when booting GE out of the Dow that "[C]onsumer, finance, healthcare, and technology companies are more prominent today." That's sort of a clue to Wall Street and investors that the committee will be looking to ensure strong representation in these sectors in the years to come. Assuming Pfizer gets the heave-ho at some point in the future, which I predicted as a possibility earlier this week, a possible replacement might be medical device behemoth Medtronic (NYSE: MDT).Right now, the Dow is represented by five healthcare companies: the nation's leading insurer UnitedHealth Group, pharmacy giant Walgreens Boots Alliance, healthcare conglomerate Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), and drug giants Pfizer and Merck. While most healthcare avenues are covered here, there's a redundancy with two drugmakers, Pfizer and Merck, in the Dow. Even with Pfizer being the larger company by market cap, it has the lowest share price in the index, making it potentially expendable (remember, the Dow is entirely a price-weighted index).Medtronic would be a solid fit since it would be the largest pure-play medical device maker that the committee could add. Don't get me wrong -- Johnson & Johnson's global device unit is huge -- but it's not a medical device pure play. J&J has its hands in consumer healthcare products and drug development, as well. In fact, the percentage of Johnson & Johnson's sales derived from pharmaceuticals has been steadily growing for more than a half decade and nearly hit 50% of total sales in the second quarter. With Medtronic, the Dow would get a $120 billion company with a reasonably high $88 share price. More so, it would position the index to take advantage of an aging American population that'll likely require a growing number of medical devices to live longer and healthier lives. If Pfizer were to be shown the door, I believe Medtronic is a logical replacement.A Facebook engineer writing code on his computer.MoreImage source: Facebook.FacebookLastly, there's always the potential that social media kingpin Facebook (NASDAQ: FB) could get added to the Dow. Sporting the fifth largest market cap in the U.S. at $592 billion and a $208 share price, the argument can clearly be made that this is a relevant business.According to the company's first-quarter operating results, there were an average of 1.45 billion daily active users, up 13% year over year, with 2.2 billion monthly active users. In fact, the company's four main assets -- Facebook, Messenger, WhatsApp, and Instagram -- represent four of the seven most visited social media sites in the world. That type of relevance shouldn't be overlooked by the S&P Dow Jones Indices committee.However, Facebook has two knocks against it that could thwart its addition to the Dow. First, it's a relatively young company. Even though it's been dominant, Facebook only debuted six years ago as a publicly traded company. The committee generally only adds companies after they've demonstrated that they have a time-tested business model. We're not exactly there yet with Facebook.The other issue is that there are already six technology stocks represented in the Dow (note, I'm lumping Apple in as a tech stock, even though it's occasionally referred to as a "consumer goods" company). That's 20% of the index. If a company like IBM, which has struggled to keep up with the changing tech landscape, were shown the door, then a company like Facebook would be a potentially logical addition. But without removing any tech stocks, it could be a tough sell to get Facebook into an already tech-heavy Dow.Still, it's hard to ignore a company worth $592 billion with a huge economic moat -- meaning there's still a chance Facebook gets the call during the next round of changes.

His company Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) has become one of the most valuable in the world largely due to his investments, both in stocks and the companies he's bought. Investors who were lucky or smart enough to buy Berkshire stock in its early days have become millionaires as shares gained an amazing 1,826,163% from 1965 to 2015. That's an annual growth rate of 21.6%, more than double the 9.9% that the S&P 500 has returned in that time with dividends included. Investors flock by the thousands to Berkshire's annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, and his aphorisms about economic moats, value, and other subjects have become virtual gospel in the market. However, like anyone, Buffett is a product of his time and generation, and as an 87-year-old, his perspective on investing is skewed by his age.For instance, he ignored the greatest story in business in the last generation -- the emergence of the tech industry -- as he long refused to buy tech stocks because he said he could not value them or predict where they were going. Today, the tech industry is more valuable than any other. In fact, the five most valuable American companies, and the only ones bigger than Berkshire, are all tech companies.Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway's annual investor meetingMoreImage source: The Motley Fool.When Buffett finally broke his personal boycott of tech stocks, he did so by dumping more than $10 billion in 2011 into IBM, in part because he was so familiar with the company after reading its annual report for 50 years. That investment turned into a terrible bet as IBM shares dropped around 20% during the seven years Buffett owned them, while the S&P 500 more than doubled. He later said he should have bought Alphabet or Amazon, instead.Even Buffett's own personal tastes seem to color his stock picks. For instance, he is a big fan of junk food in general and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) products in particular, and the beverage giant is his second-largest holding. Buffett once even mocked Whole Foods Market, saying he doesn't see many customers smiling there. However, Coke stock has also significantly underperformed the market over the last 10 years. If Buffett had been born 50 years later, his investing style would be the same, but his stock picks would probably be much different. It's impossible to know what the Oracle of Omaha would buy if he were just getting started today, but here are three stocks that would likely be on his radar.1. FacebookMillennial Buffett would be all over social media, of course, communicating with investors, and posting selfies on Instagram. No doubt he'd be a fan of Facebook (NASDAQ: FB), and not just the platform, but the stock, too. Facebook has plenty of the qualities that a tech-savvy, value investor like Millennial Buffett looks for. First off, it has a huge economic moat, thanks to the network effects of a platform with more than 2 billion members, and the unique value it offers advertisers. The 87-year-old Buffett has long been a fan of newspaper stocks, noting that newspapers can essentially act as local monopolies if they have no nearby competition. Facebook offers this same advantage, but on a global scale in the digital age, thanks to the power of the internet. Story continuesBuffett himself also recognized the power of digital advertising, noting that he should have bought Google after he realized the click rates that GEICO, his auto insurance subsidiary, was paying the search giant. Facebook, like Google, has similar pricing power. At a P/E of 33, Facebook may not look like a typical value stock, but considering its earnings per share jumped 54% to $5.39 last year and it had a 50% operating margin, the stock looks cheap for its growth rate.  2. StarbucksMillennial Buffett was into the kombucha craze for a minute, but these days he's a devoted cold-brew aficionado. While he likes to visit independent coffee shops from time to time, he's been a longtime Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) Rewards member, and he keeps the java giant's app handy on his phone. Young Buffett also recognizes the market power of Starbucks. In many ways, Starbucks is to his generation what Coca-Cola was to the real Buffett's. He once boasted that Coca-Cola was such a strong brand that if you gave him $100 billion to take away Coke's market leadership in soft drinks, he would give it back to you and say it couldn't be done. However, these days Starbucks seems to be doing just that.Domestic soda sales have declined every year since 2004, and the coffee chain is a big reason. Millennials are largely turning away from sugary sodas and the artificial sweeteners in diet beverages, but coffee consumption seems likely to continue to grow as workplace culture for millennials has been moving out of the traditional and into places like coffee shops.Starbucks has also capitalized on the huge opportunity in China, which chairman Howard Schultz believes will one day be its biggest market, ahead of the U.S. It's also established itself as a consistent dividend payer, likely to be a Dividend Aristocrat one day, and trades at a reasonable P/E of 27.4, not much higher than Coke at 23.5.3. PayPalSplitting checks is so Gen-X. After Millennial Buffett grabs a bite with his buddies at happy hour, he just Venmos them a few bucks on the Uber ride home. The actual Buffett's favorite investing play has traditionally been banking and insurance companies. Buffett loves the business model in insurance as the "float," or the money he gets from premiums that have yet to be paid out, can be invested to earn a profit. PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) offers the same business model, but again has the power of mobile and digital behind it. Like credit card companies, PayPal collects transaction fees of around 2.9% on payments with debit and credit cards, but the company also benefits from the float, or money that users leave in their PayPal accounts that PayPal earns interest on.  In 2014, PayPal acquired Venmo, the app that's become popular with millennials for sending money to reimburse one another for expenses like drinks or rent. PayPal has been slow to monetize Venmo, but has been taking steps recently, such as testing Venmo payments at retail locations.  Nonetheless, PayPal is growing fast, as the opportunity for digital payments could be huge. In 2017, earnings per share grew 27% on a 21% increase in revenue, and management expects to increase another 20% in EPS this year.  At a P/E of 41, the stock may not be cheap, but if the company maintains its lead in digital payments, investors should reap the long-term benefits.  More From The Motley Fool   3 Growth Stocks at Deep-Value Prices    5 Expected Social Security Changes in 2018    6 Years Later, 6 Charts That Show How Far Apple, Inc.

Facebook stock trades at barely 19x earnings. Back out some $14 per share in cash, and the price-earnings multiple assigned to FB stock gets closer to 17x. For a tech giant expected to grow revenue 24% next year, that multiple seems absurd.Yes, spending is going to rise next year, hitting earnings. Guidance for that spend led Facebook stock to the largest one-day loss in stock market history back in August. But spending will normalize going forward, meaning Facebook should get back to growth as soon as 2020. Yet, a 17x ex-cash multiple suggests hardly any growth is priced in at this point.Despite the attractive numbers, however, there are reasons to sell Facebook stock. And those reasons are mounting. Facebook continues to run into problems and Mark Zuckerberg & Co. continue to manage those problems poorly. At some point, the risk here is that Facebook is going to turn off users, and not just investors.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips  5 Blue-Chip Stocks That Could Break Their Bull Trend  If that happens, even a price that is threatening a 22-month low won’t be cheap enough, or close.The “Never One Cockroach” Problem for Facebook StockAs Warren Buffett put it regarding scandal-plagued Wells Fargo (NYSE:WFC), “What you find is there’s never just one cockroach in the kitchen when you start looking around.” That old investing saw has been proven yet again when it comes to Facebook stock.For most of 2018, there’s been a steady drip of negative news. It started with the Cambridge Analytica scandal in March. FB stock bounced back quickly from those declines before the post-Q2 earnings plunge. But even then, bad news was starting to build up. WhatsApp founder Jan Koum departed, reportedly over privacy issues. In June, the Wall Street Journal reported that Facebook gave developers access to user data after it had insisted otherwise. The paper disclosed an SEC probe the following month. At the same time, concerns about the platform’s use in lynchings in India and violence in Myanmar began to rise.The company itself disclosed a security issue in September. In November, as Larry Ramer pointed out, the New York Times reported that COO Sheryl Sandberg had tried to keep Russian misinformation efforts quiet – and that a Facebook-hired lobbying firm had tried to tie Facebook opponents to billionaire activist (and target of right-wing disdain) George Soros.Now, the company is being sued by the District of Columbia. And the Times is reporting that the company gave away much more data than it disclosed to partners including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). FB stock is down nearly 5% on the news.Can we be sure that no more bad news is on the way? And do investors really want to wake up every morning waiting for the next shoe to drop – and for Facebook stock to do the same?The Management Problem for FB StockFacebook admittedly has had more than its share of problems of late. But it’s also done a terrible job responding to those problems. The company increasingly seems tone-deaf and authoritarian. Sandberg hemmed and hawed her way through the Soros scandal. She first denied any knowledge that the company had hired lobbying firm Definers. The Facebook COO then acknowledged that “some of their work was incorporated into materials presented to me and I received a small number of emails where Definers was referenced” – in a post that the company tried to bury by releasing it on the day before Thanksgiving.CEO Mark Zuckerberg seems to alternate between saying the problems aren’t that big, will be fixed, have to be fixed, or already have been fixed. A post from another Facebook executive in regard to Wednesday’s Times story insisted that no data was released without users’ permission – then pointed out that most of the features were shut down anyway, while the company is “already in the process of reviewing all our APIs”. Which is it? Does anyone trust that response at this point?There’s simply a constant perception here that Facebook has something to hide. There’s a consistent response of “delay, deny, and deflect,” as the Times put it. Even beyond that, there’s a sense that Facebook can’t even control itself. Why are privacy issues only being reviewed in 2018? Why was data privacy not a greater focus in the past?Story continues  10 Small-Cap Stocks That Look Like Bargains  Even giving the company the benefit of the doubt, it repeatedly seems like Facebook itself is surprised to see all the ways in which its data can be abused. That further erodes confidence in management at this point.Will Users Leave?The risk in the near- to mid-term is that users will stop giving Facebook the benefit of the doubt. The story of Facebook stock can’t be separated from the story of Facebook users, as I wrote in April. The #DeleteFacebook movement fizzled out, admittedly. And user growth has been stable, if slowing (that’s hardly surprising given the sheer size of the user base).But bad news and clumsy responses are going to affect Facebook’s brand image. And once defections start, they may not stop. Facebook is the classic beneficiary of the “network effect”: each incremental user adds to the experience and value of the existing base. It’s fun to go to Facebook because everyone is on Facebook.That effect works in reverse as well. Users now have multiple reasons to leave the platform – or at least limit their usage. Some may not want to further line Zuckerberg’s already full pockets. Others may see too much privacy risk. For some (myself included), the sheen has worn off.This isn’t to say that Facebook necessarily is the next Myspace. WhatsApp and Instagram can cushion any weakness in the namesake platform. But even at 17x earnings, user declines probably aren’t priced in.Are Regulators Coming?Big tech firms are seeing increased political risk – and Facebook probably faces the most at the moment. It’s alienated liberals by attacking Soros and allowing Russian disinformation to spread. Conservatives believe the platform, and the company, have an intrinsic left-wing bias. Facebook probably doesn’t have many allies in Congress – or the White House.I’m skeptical a legally-forced breakup of Facebook is on the way. But stranger things have happened. At the least, Facebook already is facing increasing regulation around privacy in Europe. U.S. regulators and legislators could follow.And because of its missteps of late, Facebook has put itself in the crosshairs. Zuckerberg just a few years ago appeared a wholesome American success story. He now looks like a villain in many citizens’ eyes. As such, politicians can score points attacking Facebook now. The more bad news that gets released, the higher those scores go.  10 Best Stocks to Buy That Represent the Future  The broad point is that the bad news for Facebook likely isn’t over. And the effects of that bad news are unclear. At the least, the risks to Facebook stock from user fatigue and political action are rising. As long as that continues, FB stock will stay stuck at best.As of this writing, Vince Martin has no positions in any securities mentioned.More From InvestorPlace  2 Toxic Pot Stocks You Should Avoid    10 Small-Cap Stocks That Look Like Bargains    7 Trade War Losers Set to Become Big 2019 Winners    5 Oil Stocks to Buy Even If Oil Prices Keep Falling   Compare Brokers The post 4 Reasons to Sell Facebook Stock Near the Lows appeared first on InvestorPlace.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatch3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Watch in AprilMotley FoolWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolNOT REAL NEWS: A look at what didn't happen this weekAssociated PressMom's Post About Putting Kids in Timeout During Tantrums Goes ViralParentsZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceMark Cuban explains how to make a 16% guaranteed returnMarketWatchWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolHere's What Hedge Funds Think About NIO Inc.

It expects that growth rate to further decelerate by high single digits over the next few quarters.That slowdown sounds alarming, but a 20%-30% growth rate would still be impressive. It also indicates that Facebook plans to monetize its users more carefully in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Wall Street still expects Facebook's revenue to rise 37% this year and 25% next year, so its high-growth days certainly aren't over.Facebook is also still incredibly profitable. Its operating margin slipped three percentage points to 44% last quarter, but its net income rose 31% to $5.1 billion as its EPS rose 32% to $1.74, topping expectations by three cents. Analysts expect Facebook's earnings to grow 33% this year and 16% next year.2. It trades at historically low valuationsAt $175, Facebook trades at nine times next year's sales and 21 times next year's earnings. Those are both historically low valuations for the company, and they're easily justified by its forward growth rates.FB PS Ratio (TTM) ChartMoreFB PS Ratio (TTM) data by YChartsFor comparison, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) trades at about 26 times forward earnings, compared to analyst projections of 23% growth this year and 21% growth next year.3. It's still gaining new active users and monetizing themFacebook is still the largest social network in the world by a wide margin. Last quarter its monthly active users (MAUs) rose 11% annually to 2.23 billion, as its daily active users (DAUs) grew 11% to 1.47 billion.The fact that Facebook's revenue growth continues to outpace its active user growth indicates that its average revenue per user is still rising. This isn't surprising, since Facebook and Alphabet's Google hold a near-duopoly on internet ads across many markets (including the United States).Story continuesMoreover, Facebook's business model, based on crafting targeted ads based on users' social profiles and connections, is arguably superior to Google's less-personalized model of using search, browsing, and location queries.4. It still has plenty of new revenue streamsMany investors often forget that Facebook also owns Instagram, which has over a billion MAUs, and WhatsApp, which has over 1.5 billion MAUs. Facebook's own Messenger app, which it's expanded as a stand-alone platform for mini-apps, reaches over 1.3 billion MAUs.Facebook only recently started monetizing these platforms, with more ads in Instagram, business-oriented features in WhatsApp, and the introduction of new services like mobile payments and games in Messenger.A woman checks social media messages on her phone.MoreImage source: Getty Images.Last quarter Facebook stated that 400 million people were already sharing Instagram Stories, the new feature which it launched to counter Snap's (NYSE: SNAP) Snapchat Stories, and that 450 million people were using WhatsApp Status, which lets user send ephemeral texts, photos, videos, and GIFs like Snapchat.Earlier this year KeyBanc analyst Andy Hargreaves estimated that Instagram could generate nearly $9 billion in annual revenues this year (equivalent to 16% of its estimated sales), and eventually $22 billion in sales by 2022. Therefore, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger -- and possibly even Oculus VR -- will give Facebook plenty of ways to monetize users beyond its core social network.5. Its growing pains should be temporaryMany American investors seemed to lose faith in Facebook after the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Yet the company continued to grow its user base, and the data breach and controversy over Facebook's role in the 2016 election aren't major news stories in overseas markets.Facebook has already introduced new measures to tighten its privacy settings and combat fake news and propaganda accounts. If Facebook gets past these growing pains, it could emerge as a stronger and more mature tech company.Should you buy Facebook too?Facebook isn't a stock for everyone. Some investors may have ethical objections with its business model, or consider the stock too volatile. However, I think investors who buy Facebook on this prolonged dip should be well-rewarded in the future as the social media company evolves.

The user base is still small, and many big companies are leery of investing. In 2019, however, we could see some shifts in the VR landscape as new hardware and software are introduced. Here are the five companies I'll be watching to see where VR is headed. Digitized woman in VR headset.MoreImage source: Getty Images.FacebookIt may be a small part of Facebook's business, but Oculus is a giant in the world of virtual reality. It's one of the two main high-end VR devices -- along with HTC Vive -- and Oculus is quickly expanding its VR platform. In 2018 it launched the Oculus Go, a low-end device that's great for 360 videos and comes at an accessible price point of $200.In 2019 Oculus expects to launch the Quest headset, which will be the first high-end stand-alone VR headset, at a price point of $400. The product could make VR much more accessible to consumers, and help increase the install base beyond the few million units in the market today. Facebook is trying to become the platform of choice for VR consumers and developers. If the Oculus Quest goes well, 2019 could be the year it takes a big step in that direction. SonyIt may sound surprising, but Sony (NYSE: SNE) is actually the leader in virtual reality headsets worldwide. In August the company passed 3 million PSVR headsets sold, far exceeding around 1 million for Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. Sony has the benefit of having sold over 73 million PS4 units, which power the PS4 headset, but users seem to like the device's value proposition over competitors.The challenge for Sony will be staying ahead of devices like the HTC Vive Pro, which brings better graphics and performance for high-end users, and Oculus Quest, which will be great for the masses. PS4's computing power will ultimately be a limiting factor for PSVR unless the company decides to upgrade in 2019.Rumor has it that Sony will upgrade PSVR when it releases PS5, which should be out in 2020 or 2021. That's a long time to wait for another headset upgrade, but for the leading VR headset on the market today it's the best that enthusiasts are going to get. Video games' power trioConspicuously absent from the VR industry thus far have been Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ: ATVI), Electronic Arts (NASDAQ: EA), and Take-Two Interactive (NASDAQ: TTWO). They look at the relatively small install base of VR headsets compared to PC, console, and mobile, which combined have billions of potential customers, and just don't see an opportunity worth investing in... yet. I think 2019 could be the year at least one of these companies dips its toes into the VR waters. Quest's introduction should help expand the market and improve the accessibility of the technology. If the install base of that device reaches a million or more in the first few months, it could make the industry more enticing for large developers. They also don't want to risk losing the industry to upstart competitors. Population: One, a Fortnite-like VR game, is expected to be introduced by BigBox VR in spring 2019, and games like Beat Saber are growing in popularity. These could be the equivalent of Candy Crush or Clash of Clans, which took over mobile, building a brand and user base lead that big game makers can only acquire, not build organically themselves. Someone needs to be an early mover, but who will it be?Story continuesVR will have a big year, one way or anotherGiven all of the developments coming to the VR industry, 2019 is going to be a big year. Either the billions of dollars of development money will start to pay off, or they won't. I tend to believe the technology is good enough and content is coming out fast enough for adoption to grow, and Facebook, Sony, and video game companies could be big winners. But the industry has had high hopes before, only to be dashed by weak adoption rates -- and ultimately the user base size will decide if 2019 is a good year for VR.  More From The Motley Fool   10 Best Stocks to Buy Today    3 Stocks That Are Absurdly Cheap Right Now    5 Warren Buffett Principles to Remember in a Volatile Stock Market    The $16,728 Social Security Bonus You Cannot Afford to Miss    The Must-Read Trump Quote on Social Security    10 Reasons Why I'm Selling All of My Apple Stock  Travis Hoium has no position in any of the stocks mentioned and owns a virtual reality start-up.

On Tuesday, Marcus published a post outlining the six major trends, or themes, he sees influencing Messenger — and its 1.3 billion monthly active users — throughout the year.His predictions outline a mix of logical extensions and course-corrections for the messaging service he joined in 2014. More real-time features If 2017’s deluge of political and pop culture news reinforced anything, it was that on-the-fly communication proved instrumental, not just for keeping in touch, but for keeping tabs on what happened in the world. There were grim stories of sexual harassment in Hollywood posted across social media; there were survivors of natural disasters who communicated their safety on Facebook (FB). And, of course, there were President Donald Trump’s tweets. Regardless of the kind of content, those examples illustrated the klout of messaging and social media once again. To wit, Marcus foresees Messenger rolling out more ways to make sure users stay connected, whether it’s in the U.S. or in emerging markets. “This year, you’ll see us continue investing in real-time communications to make sure that no matter where you are, you can easily stay connected to your loved ones,” Marcus wrote in the post. “No one wants to miss a special moment, but real-time communication is what connects us in times of crisis too… and we unfortunately saw more than our share of that last year.” Beefier group chatsGroup chat was one of Messenger’s most popular features. In 2017 alone, the messaging service said 2.5 million new group chats were created on Messenger everyday, with the average group chat having 10 people. In addition to group chat features rolled out last year, like the @mentions ability to call out someone in a chat by their username, Marcus suggested that the Messenger group chat experience will grow further in 2018, by, for instance, finding ways to integrate group chat into live video group chat.  A more streamlined experience While Messenger grew to 1.3 billion monthly active users in September, it also got flack by some tech media for trying to do too much. As part of Facebook’s larger push to emulate Snapchat’s Stories, for example, Messenger launched a similar feature of its own at the beginning of last year — a feature that was consolidated with Facebook Stories in November. Earlier this month, the Messenger team said M, the human-powered personal digital assistant being tested with some 2,000 users, would be retired. A Facebook spokesperson told Yahoo Finance in early January that Facebook would take its learnings from M and use them to power other artificial intelligence-related projects at the social network. “Over the last two years, we built a lot of capabilities to find the features that continue to set us apart,” Marcus explained. “A lot of them have found their product market fit; some haven’t. While we raced to build these new features, the app became too cluttered. Expect to see us invest in massively simplifying and streamlining Messenger this year.”More visual ways to communicate Marcus thinks visual messaging — using images, videos, GIFs and stickers — to “fully explode.” That’s probably of little surprise to some, given Messenger users sent over 500 billion emojis and shared 18 billion animated GIFs last year in 2017. Expect Messenger to roll out even more ways for users to visually express themselves, as it works to draw more emoji-loving, GIF-happy teens and millennials to its service. Messaging as a preferred method of customer service Likewise, Marcus also remains bullish on messaging platforms shouldering more customer service requests, as more people learn they can message and interact with companies on platforms like Messenger rather than having to dial a company’s customer service number the old-fashioned way. To wit, according to a Facebook-commissioned study by Nielsen published in December, 56% of people prefer to message a business rather than call customer service, while 67% of those same people expect to message businesses even more over the next two years.“While calling still plays a prominent role in customer service, this has opened the door for brands and businesses to communicate with their customers in a variety of new ways to not only respond to issues or one-off questions, but to offer an up-sell opportunity to benefit both people and the business,” Marcus wrote. Story continuesMessaging as a marketing channelMore and more, Marcus has learned that people expect to find businesses with some sort of messaging component: a live chat box on a company’s website, a customer service chat bot inside an app, or the ability to interact with a business on a full-blown service like Messenger. Likewise, more marketers over the past 12 months have expressed interest in using messaging as a way to connect with their customers. “We’ve been encouraged to see that bigger brand names are bringing a presence to Messenger (LEGO, Katy Perry, Apple Music) which signals the acceptance from CMOs [chief marketing officers] that it’s time to create a unique and effective experience that can reach more people at scale,” Marcus wrote. “Look for investment in rich messaging experiences, not only from global brands, but small businesses who need to be creative and nimble to stay competitive.” While Facebook has taken heat at times over tweaks and changes — last week’s controversial News Feed changes come to mind — Marcus’s pledge to simplify Messenger in some ways, while doubling down on popular features such as group chat should be well-received as the service works to snag its next 1 billion users. —JP Mangalindan is the Chief Tech Correspondent for Yahoo Finance covering the intersection of tech and business. Email story tips and musings to jpm@oath.com. Follow him on Twitter or Facebook.More from JP:AMD CEO: Our processors are more affordable than Intel’sAmazon Alexa and Google Assistant duke it out at CES Sennheiser co-CEO: Why we’re betting on AR and VR with 3-D audioAMD CEO on chip security flaws: ‘We’re absolutely all over’ securitySamsung’s plan to dominate the self-driving car industryHarman Kardon wants to lighten your mood with MoodscapeSamsung to offer one app to rule all your devicesAmazon: Yahoo Finance’s Company of the YearAmazon Web Services CEO: We’re going to see an ‘explosion’ of voice appsFacebook named the No. 1 place to work in the USFacebook targets 6- to 12-year-old demographic with Messenger Kids Facebook publishes ad rules in wake of Russias revelations ‘Scandal’ creator Shonda Rhimes: Why I left ABC for NetflixIntuit CEO: Old-school accountants will be ‘struggling in 5 years’ because of A.I.How Amazon quickly trains 120,000 employees for the holidaysFollow Yahoo Finance on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley Fool5 Ways The Smart Money is Playing the Billion Dollar Satellite Internet TrendInsider Monkey'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceChristchurch shooting videos are still on Facebook over a month laterEngadgetAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley FoolWhy Livestreaming TV Can't Break ThroughMotley FoolWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCThe Boeing 737 MAX Is 1 Step Closer to Flying Again -- but Don't Expect to See It SoonMotley FoolReport: FTC considering oversight of Facebook's ZuckerbergAssociated PressMisfits Market CEO on working to reduce food wasteYahoo Finance VideoLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo Finance

So when a stock is upgraded, or more rarely, downgraded, the market takes note. This is especially the case for a market-leading stock like Facebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) — see below!We used TipRanks to find the most interesting recent stock ratings- and zeroed in on the stocks with a ‘Strong Buy’ Street consensus. Why is the sentiment now shifting for these seven stocks? Could it be that the market is looking more optimistic?“I’m not a real positive guy, but I’m starting to turn more positive. We’re starting to see good things across the marketplace. Value is being uncovered,” Wells Fargo Securities’ Chris Harvey told CNBC on May 6.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsHe continues: “You don’t have to run. It’s really selective, be slow, be methodical and look for opportunities,” Harvey said. “It’s a walk, not run-type of situation.”  The Top 20 Stocks of 2018  So with this in mind, let’s dive in now and find out what these seven stock upgrades are all about. It’s time to get bullish:[Editor’s Note: This story was originally published on May 14, 2018. It has since been updated and republished to reflect new information.]Strong Buy Stock: Dynavax Technologies (DVAX)Source: ShutterstockCutting-edge biotech stock Dynavax Technologies Corp (NASDAQ:DVAX) now has JP Morgan’s seal of approval. The move comes ahead of the all-important ASCO conference on June 1-5. DVAX will present key clinical trial data on its immunotherapy treatments for cancer. Most notably, this will include a Phase 2 melanoma update for Dynavax’s lead product candidate SD-101.Top JP Morgan analyst Anupam Rama believes the market is vastly underestimating the potential of this drug. The stock’s current valuation ignores the early signs of efficacy demonstrated by SD-101 says Rama. Encouragingly, Dynavax has committed to initiate a Phase 3 trial in melanoma by the end of this year and in head and neck cancer in early 2019.He adds: “We believe the recent downside has created an interesting entry point ahead of ASCO, additional SD-101 readouts in 2018 and the Heplisav launch long-term.” This is especially true when you consider that Heplisav is a “best-in-class Hepatitis B vaccine.” The vaccine has already been launched in the US with a 60-person field sales team.In conjunction with the rating upgrade, Rama boosted his price target from $25 to $27 (38% upside potential). The new rating also brings Rama in line with Street consensus. Our data shows that the stock currently floats a ‘Strong Buy’ rating with five recent bullish calls. These analysts have a $30 average price target (53% upside potential).What’s more, Cantor Firzgerald’s Elemer Piros reiterated a “buy” rating on DVAX stock just nine days ago. Piros noted that Dynavax’s Heplisav-B has “demonstrated higher protection in general patient groups and in high-risk patient populations…”Strong Buy Stock: Facebook (FB)fbMoreSource: ShutterstockFive-star Stifel Nicolaus analyst Scott Devitt is one of the Top 50 analysts on TipRanks. His stock picking ability is second-to-none (this 25% average return per rating). But even top analysts can make mistakes. “Post-1Q earnings, we chose to stick with our recent view on Facebook and were wrong to do so. With the information available now, FB stock is too cheap to ignore despite its challenges” stated Devitt on April 26.Story continuesDevitt downgraded the stock in early January and explains why here: “We became concerned about Facebook on the heels of survey data suggesting platform fatigue. Our views were emboldened when Mr. Zuckerberg began to discuss fixing Facebook in 2018.”Now, however, “we may be getting closer to the other side in these areas of concern and valuation may provide the support to see us through.” Plus FB has the benefit of key growth drivers like WhatsApp, Instagram and video to ‘fuel above-market ad revenue growth for the next several years.’We can see that his FB upgrade comes with a $202 price target. That translates into 8% upside from current levels. However, this is still far below the Street.  7 Stocks Paying Monthly Dividends That You Should Consider Buying  Based on the last three months of ratings, analysts have an average FB price target of $220. This suggests more appealing upside potential of 18%. Thirty out of 32 recent analyst ratings on FB are bullish.Strong Buy Stock: MDC Partners (MDCA)sbacmsnMoreSource: ShutterstockKeep a close eye on small-cap MDC Partners Inc. (NASDAQ:MDCA) — an intriguing marketing and communications network. Most interestingly, MDC was recently upgraded by five-star Wells Fargo analyst Peter Stabler. He has a $10 price target on the stock (130% upside potential).So what prompted this move? According to Stabler, shares offer compelling valuation and favorable risk/reward. Weighed down by disappointing Q1 earnings results, shares are now at $4.35, down from over $7 five days ago.“Though MDC’s results this quarter again remind us that the company’s small size can lead to higher volatility, we continue to view the macro marketing landscape as generally more favorable for smaller agency players” the analyst argued. He concluded, “we continue to believe future margin upside is possible.”Three top analysts have published recent buy ratings on MDCA. With an $11.50 average price target, these analysts are projecting upside potential of over 160%.Strong Buy Stock: Voyager Therapeutics (VYGR)Source: ShutterstockVoyager Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VYGR) is developing intriguing gene therapies for neurological diseases. Case in point: the company is working with AbbVie Inc (NYSE:ABBV) to develop a revolutionary Alzheimer’s treatment. The deal includes a $69 million upfront payment to Voyager and more than $1 billion in potential milestone payments.However, Voyager shares plunged recently, dropping 34% in March. Bear in mind though that on a year-to-date basis, shares are still up 10%. The move downwards was enough to convince top Wedbush analyst David Nierengarten to return to the Voyager bull story. He blamed confusing hedging language in Voyager’s 10Q filing as part of the reason for the fall.Now the risk/ reward ratio is much more compelling says Nierengarten — especially ahead of the pivotal trial for VY-AADC. This is the company’s lead product candidate for the treatment of Advanced Parkinson’s disease.  5 Tech Stocks That Will Turn It Around Soon  His $28 price target indicates massive upside potential of over 50%. In total, this stock has scored eight consecutive buy ratings in the last three months. From the current share price, analysts are projecting big growth of over 98%, with five-star analyst Dane Leone recently slapping VYGR shares with a “buy” rating and a $32 price target.Strong Buy Stock: New Relic Inc (NEWR)Source: ShutterstockSoftware vendor New Relic, Inc. (NYSE:NEWR) has just reported earnings results that crushed expectations. Post report, shares jumped 18% on May 9. The move came as investors digested an impressive 34% revenue growth. The company, which helps businesses track and quickly fix software bugs, ascribed the beat to an increase in spending per customer.“We’ll obviously be getting new customers, but the average spend we expect to continue to go up in our existing folks,” said CFO Mark Sachleben during the earnings call. “We saw some great metrics around that this past year.”On the news top BMO Capital analyst Keith Bachman upgraded NR from “hold” to “buy.” He also bumped up his price target to $95 (from $83). According to Bachman, the company’s “competitive advantage in leveraging large performance data sets to help deliver value.” He also describes himself as “encouraged” by customer revenue growth.“We continue to see good opportunities for more expansion/upside as APM [application performance management] penetration grows, Infrastructure gains momentum, and new machine learning and analytics-driven opportunities emerge” commented top Oppenheimer analyst Ittai Kidron on May 9.Strong Buy Stock: NiSource (NI)Source: Andy Arthur via FlickrNiSource, Inc (NYSE:NI) serves nearly four million natural gas and electric customers across seven states. And now Goldman Sachs has upgraded NI because it ‘deserves a premium valuation’. Not from Hold to Buy as you might expect, but from Buy to Conviction Buy. NI is now one of an elite alpha-generating group of stocks that Goldman Sachs expects to outperform.“[We] view this defensive, small-cap utility as one of our top ideas into [the second half of 2018],” says Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Lapides.Above-average EPS, dividend growth and an attractive valuation all bode well for share prices. However, Lapides is particularly excited about the “next leg of the NI story” and sees multiple upward EPS revisions for 2019 and beyond. His $30 price target indicates upside potential of just over 20%.  10 Stocks That Are Screaming Buys Right Now  In total, NI has scored four recent buy ratings from top analysts. These analysts see NI shares spiking 8.3% to $27 in the coming months.Strong Buy Stock: Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT)Source: ShutterstockSarepta Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:SRPT) is a commercial-stage biopharma, which focuses on the treatment of rare neuromuscular diseases. Primarily, the company is busy developing its product candidates for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). And even a spate of unwelcome news (including a regulatory setback in Europe) hasn’t dampened investor enthusiasm.Shares are up by over 68% in the last three months, with strong demand for Exondys 51 boosting prices. This is the first Duchenne muscular dystrophy (“DMD”) treatment to gain approval in the U.S. since September 2016. Management projects the peak annual sales potential of its late-stage DMD drugs- which include Exondys 51- at a whopping $2 billion.Barclays’ Gena Wang comments:“While we see limited EU opportunity for Exondys 51, and some risk in golodirsen approval based on biomarker data, a good safety profile of PPMO assets could replace suboptimal PMO franchise. We expect a reasonable chance for SRPT’s microdystrophin program to show promising clinical activity.”Indeed the PPMO platform of drugs could be “ten times more effective” than Exondys 51 according to Sarepta’s CEO Doug Ingram.As a result, this five-star analyst upgraded SRPT from Hold to Buy on May 11. Her new rating comes with a bullish price target of $107. Overall, our data show that this ‘Strong Buy’ stock has scored 16 recent top analyst buy ratings versus only two hold ratings. These analysts have an average SRPT price target of $98.64.Which stocks are the top 25 analysts recommending right now? Find out here.TipRanks offers investors the latest insight into eight different sectors by tracking the activity of 4,500 analysts, 5,000 financial bloggers and even 37,000 corporate insiders.

Is a Must-Own StockLuke LangoInvestorPlaceMay 14, 2018ReblogShareTweetShareFacebook, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) recently fell victim to what was arguably its worst PR incident ever after a whistle-blower exposed a data leak that happened in 2015 regarding political analytics firm Cambridge Analytica.A few weeks later, Facebook reported what was arguably its best earnings report ever.Facebook reported its best financial results ever against the backdrop of its worst PR incident ever. That is shocking. More importantly, it’s a testament to just how powerful and necessary the Facebook machine has become.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading TipsAs such, Facebook stock has rallied off its post-Cambridge Analytica lows of $150 to trade in the $180’s. That is right around where it was trading prior to the data leak news hitting the wire.Have you missed the rally?Hardly. This was just a rebound. A minor blip in the overall upward trajectory for Facebook stock.This upward trajectory will persist. Facebook stock is supported by some of the strongest fundamentals in the market, with a big growth narrative converging on a relatively discounted valuation. That creates a compelling opportunity to buy and hold FB stock for the long-run.Facebook is so massive that it has become an integral part of how the internet functions, and it is poised not only to grow more, but to provide more services in one place — and the markets are not currently valuing it this way.Here’s an in-depth look at why Facebook stock is a must-own here and now:1. 2 out of 3 People Who Can Have a Facebook Account, Do Have a Facebook AccountPerhaps the most important and most attractive thing about Facebook is its size.The social media behemoth has 2.2 billion monthly active users. The world has about 7.6 billion people, and of those, only roughly 4.1 billion have access to the internet. About 800 million of those internet users are in China, where Facebook is blocked. Therefore, the global internet population that has legal access to Facebook numbers around 3.3 billion.Again, Facebook has 2.2 billion monthly active users. That means that essentially 2 out of every 3 people in the world that can have a Facebook, do have a Facebook account.No other company in the world has that scale. Not Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Not Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX). And not even Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) or Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).Facebook is on its own playing field in terms of global size, reach and scale.And that doesn’t even consider Facebook’s newly minted “Family of Apps”. Those 2.2 billion monthly active users are on the core Facebook platform alone. Facebook has another 1.5 billion monthly users on WhatsApp, 1.3 billion monthly users on Messenger, and 800 million monthly users on Instagram.  5 Tech Stocks That Will Turn It Around Soon  Put it all together, and that is 5.8 billion users. Granted, there is heavy overlap between users, so it isn’t 5.8 billion distinct users. But the entire Facebook ecosystem essentially acts like and has the power of a platform that has 5.8 billion combined monthly users because what matters isn’t distinct users, but rather, the number of eyeballs you capture and for how long you capture them (if a user goes from Facebook to Messenger to Instagram, that same user will have used 3 different apps, but stayed within the Facebook ecosystem the whole time).2. Facebook Is the Internet IDIn many senses, Facebook’s massive size is its greatest asset. Because it is so big, Facebook has become an irreplaceable part of the internet.I like to think of Facebook as the internet ID. In the physical world, everyone has a physical ID that they use to identify themselves and get into places. If you are walking into a bank, they ask for your ID to confirm identity. If you get pulled over by the cops, they also ask for your ID. And if you want to a drink at a restaurant or a bar, chances are they will be asking for your ID, too.fbMoreStory continuesSource: ShutterstockFacebook is exactly this for the digital world. Facebook is your digital ID, complete with a profile picture, life details like birth-date and workplace, and a list of friends and recent activity. Because of this, it has all the information and data that anyone needs to identify you. Also, because everyone has a Facebook, it is a universal means for digital identification.This is why there are so many “Login with Facebook” options across the internet.Streaming music platform Spotify Technology SA (NYSE:SPOT) uses “Login with Facebook”. So does dating app Tinder — owned by  Match Group Inc (NASDAQ:MTCH). As do ride-sharing app Uber, rent-sharing app Airbnb, social payments platform Venmo — owned by Paypal Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PYPL), professional networking site LinkedIn — owned by Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), sports news platform ESPN (a Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS) property), and many, many more.They all use this feature because: 1) it is easier, 2) everyone has a Facebook, 3) is it arguably more secure, and 4) Facebook has all the data in the world that any of them need in order to get started on creating a personalized account for new users. It doesn’t matter that Facebook is in direct competition with some of these companies. That’s how vital Facebook has become.From this perspective, it is easy to see how Facebook’s size and data have allowed it become to the internet’s ID. In doing so, Facebook has become part of the underlying fabric of the internet.Moreover, because Facebook’s database is so large, the company has indeed become an irreplaceable part of the internet. Facebook has relevant information data on more than 2 billion people globally. Until another platform can rival that scale, Facebook is irreplaceable.3. Facebook’s Size Is Also Its Greatest Financial WeaponFrom a financial perspective, Facebook’s size is so important for two reasons: 1) unparalleled reach and 2) unparalleled targeting abilities. All advertisers want is the most bang for their buck, and that means max reach with max engagement. Facebook is the only platform that maximizes both due to its size.On a raw basis, its 2 billion-plus user base is unrivaled, and naturally, Facebook offers the most global reach for advertisers. On a deeper lever, Facebook has a lot of data on 2 billion people-plus, and can use that unparalleled database to create unparalleled targeted advertising solutions. Thus, Facebook’s size allows it to offer advertisers max reach with max engagement, a combination which has allowed Facebook to dominate other social media peers in the digital advertising space.Moreover, Facebook’s size makes it a successful imitator. Case and point: Instagram Stories and WhatsApp Status. Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) was killing Facebook for several years and teens were ditching Facebook and flocking to Snapchat. Then, Facebook cloned Snapchat’s core feature, Stories, and put it into its app ecosystem.The net result was that because of the initial size of Instagram and WhatsApp, Instagram Stories and WhatsApp Status became huge hits. Now, Facebook is behind the two largest Stories platforms in the world.Facebook’s size allows it do this replication in essentially any space, and be successful in doing so. That is why Facebook Dating poses a meaningful threat to Match Group Inc (NASDAQ:MTCH), and why Facebook can jump into almost any business that it wants to.4. Facebook User Growth Is High in Low Internet Penetration MarketsA lot of folks are concerned that the growth in Facebook’s user base has stalled out. While the numbers support this slowing growth trend, I don’t think it’s fair to say that Facebook is done growing its user base.User growth has come down from 30% to 20% to 15% and lower over the past several years. But that is simply a result of the law of large numbers. Once you get to a point where 2 out of every 3 internet users is on your platform, user growth is naturally going to slow.Source: ShutterstockBut don’t underestimate the global internet growth narrative.Roughly 95% of the entire North American population is on the internet. That is a maxed out market. As such, Facebook’s US & Canada monthly user base grew by only 3% last quarter.Europe also has a pretty high internet penetration rate of 85%. That is also a maxed out market. Not surprisingly, Facebook’s Europe monthly user base growth was also weak. It grew just 7% last quarter.Everywhere else, however, is a completely different story.Asia’s internet penetration rate is below 50%, while Facebook’s Asia-Pacific monthly user base grew by an impressive 22% last quarter.In other parts of the world, the internet penetration rate is right around 50%, which is why Facebook’s Rest of World monthly user base grew by 12% last quarter.Overall, what we see is not too surprising. In markets where internet penetration is high, Facebook user growth is slow, around 3-7%. But in geographies where internet penetration is still low and growing, Facebook user growth is still strong, in the 10% to 20%-plus range.5. Facebook Could Hit 3 Billion Users SoonOn a global scale, it looks Facebook still has a ways to go in terms of user growth.The global internet penetration rate is just 55%, miles below North America’s rate of 95%. Presumably, internet usage globally is only growing, and that 55% global rate will continue to grind higher towards 95%. As that happens, Facebook’s total addressable market will expand. If Facebook can maintain its share in that growing market, then Facebook’s user base could easily keep growing at a healthy rate for the next 5-10 years.  The Bottom Line on a Really Encouraging Earnings Season  How much bigger can it get?Well, it is unlikely global internet penetration rates hit North America levels, but a 70% rate seems achievable in 5-10 years. Assuming global population heads towards 8 billion, then that would imply 5.6 billion global internet users, including China. Assuming Facebook maintains a roughly 53% penetration rate among global internet users (including China), then you are looking at nearly 3 billion Facebook users in 5-10 years.And that doesn’t even include the billion-plus users on WhatsApp and Messenger, and the nearly billion users on Instagram. Thanks to global internet expansion, those numbers will head higher, as well.6. Messenger and WhatsApp Give The Advertising Business a Lot of Unused FirepowerUser growth through global internet usage expansion is a promising growth driver for Facebook stock going forward.But it isn’t the only one.Indeed, Facebook stock’s explosion in 2015, 2016, and 2017 from $80 to $180 was largely driven by a ramp in monetization trends. Namely, Facebook started monetizing Instagram, and that added extra firepower to average revenue per user (ARPU) growth.For the longest time, Facebook wasn’t making any money from Instagram. It was just a platform with a ton of users but not many ads and not much money running through the system.Then, in 2015, Facebook decided to get serious about putting ads on Instagram and making money from the platform. I remember the initial gut reaction from users was: “Ugh! More ads? I’m going to stop using Instagram so much.” But that never happened. Because the ads were non-intrusive and actually relevant (thanks to the company’s huge database), nobody quit Instagram. Instead, the platform’s user base has nearly tripled since then from 300 million to 800 million.Meanwhile, Facebook started making a ton of money off Instagram.Between 2011 and 2014, Facebook’s domestic ARPU grew at a 41% rate from roughly $3 to roughly $9. During that same stretch, global ARPU grew at a 27% clip from roughly $1.40 to around $2.80.Once Facebook started seriously monetizing Instagram in 2015, everything changed. For the better.From 2014 to 2017, Facebook’s domestic ARPU grew at a 44% rate to nearly $27. Global ARPU, meanwhile, grew at a 30% clip to nearly $6.20.In other words, despite dramatically increasing scale and tougher laps, Facebook’s unit monetization growth actually accelerated in 2014-17 versus 2011-14.Why? Instagram.Now, the Instagram ad ramp is largely in the rear-view window, but Facebook is still sitting on two other, much larger platforms that have yet to be monetized in Messenger and WhatsApp. That means Facebook stock has two Instagram-like catalysts still in the pipeline.Facebook has barely monetized these platforms so far. Right now, Messenger only has ads on the contact list, which are unintrusive to the point that many users don’t register them. (Facebook’s most recent earnings mention Messenger as a component of ad revenue, but don’t spike out the individual numbers for the app.)  WhatsApp has no ads.Thus far, management hasn’t figured out the ideal way to monetize on a messaging app, whether it be through ads or social commerce or anything else. Eventually, though, management will figure this out. At that point in time, Facebook will start making big bucks from Messenger and WhatsApp.Financially, that means that ARPU, although it is really big right now, could get a lot bigger. If so, Facebook stock could explode higher.7. Watch & Workplace Are Big Growth Drivers for Facebook StockUp until this point, this article has focused exclusively on Facebook’s advertising business and why that business isn’t going to slow anytime soon. As a result, Facebook stock should head higher even if Facebook was just its advertising business.But it’s not.Facebook stock has been hammered, falling 20% from the highs it made just last month. While hard to do, it's time to start nibbling FB stock.MoreFacebook is building out multiple nascent hyper-growth businesses that could one day be huge contributors to both the top and bottom lines. The sum of these businesses not only strength the fundamentals supporting Facebook stock, but also add significant longevity to Facebook stock’s growth narrative.First, there is Facebook Watch. Facebook launched Watch in mid-2017 after it become crystal clear that streaming on-demand entertainment was the way of the future. At that time, Netflix was just carving up the traditional cable industry, and there was a massive shift happening from the cable model to the streaming model. As such, Facebook launched Watch to get into this space.Watch hasn’t made much of a splash just yet, but again, it is only matter of time before Watch scales into something meaningful. After all, Facebook does have the largest potential streaming audience in the world (2 billion-plus users) and a whole bunch of cash on the balance sheet. Thus, once Facebook appropriately deploys its massive amount of resources to developing and/or acquiring content, Facebook will be able to stream that content to the largest on-demand, streaming audience in the world.Considering how much money Netflix is making in the streaming world, Facebook Watch could easily morph into a huge money-maker for Facebook stock.  7 Consumer Goods Stocks That Will Rise Again  Second, there is Facebook Workplace, which is a highly undervalued part of the Facebook business. Workplace is the social network’s enterprise edition. It’s essentially a cloud-based communication tool designed for businesses of all sizes. And, it’s exactly like Slack, the hyper-growth start-up which has made a killing selling enterprise communication tools.Formerly known as Facebook at Work, Workplace debuted in October 2016 to very little fanfare. Most investors have since forgotten about it. But Workplace scored a big win last year by signing on the world’s biggest employer, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT). And that will likely be only the first in a series of major wins for Workplace as enterprise social networking goes mainstream (IDC expects the ESN market to grow at a 19% clip annually to $3.5 billion by 2019).Facebook makes money off of Workplace by charging a subscription fee. At $3 per month per user for premium, Workplace could easily scale into a material revenue stream for Facebook if the ESN market gains momentum over the next several years.8. Marketplace & Native Payments Are Bigger Growth Drivers for Facebook StockBeyond Watch and Workplace, there is Facebook Marketplace. Much like Watch, Marketplace has been around for a few quarters, but hasn’t made much of a splash just yet. But also like Watch, it really is only a matter of time before Facebook turns Marketplace into something big.As it stands, Marketplace looks like a digital garage sale of 2 billion-plus potential buyers and sellers. That model makes sense, but isn’t a complete version of what Marketplace could be. It will eventually morph into a place that accommodates those 2 billion-plus buyers and sellers, while also making room for official retailers to sell goods to a targeted group of buyers (yet another use-case of Facebook’s massive database). In this sense, Marketplace could one day scale to be the place for all e-commerce transactions.Along the same lines as Marketplace, Facebook is rolling out native payment capability across its ecosystem. Pretty soon, “Buy Now” features will be common across all of Facebook. Imagine you see an advertisement, and that ad interests you.Currently, there is a decent amount of friction in the process of turning that interest into financial action. You have to click that ad, likely veer away from Facebook, open another window, enter separate payment and delivery info, so on and so forth.Source: ©iStock.com/kravcsIn the future, Facebook will add capability which removes those frictions. You will be able to store your payment and delivery info within the Facebook ecosystem, so that if you see an ad on Instagram or Facebook that interests you, you are literally just a few clicks away from turning that interest into financial action.This capability at scale could be huge for Facebook. Facebook could take a commission off every sale that happens through its platform, much like a payments processing company does. If so, Facebook could make a ton of money off people buying and selling directly through the Facebook ecosystem. Facebook could also charge higher rates for its digital real estate in a world where they reduce commerce friction, thus adding even more firepower to the already super-charged advertising business.9. The Street Underestimates Facebook’s GrowthTo recap, Facebook’s size gives the company perhaps the biggest moat in the world, while also enabling the company to replicate essentially any business at scale. Further, Facebook’s advertising business is on fire, and the future monetization of social conversation apps Messenger and WhatsApp mean that the ad business still has a ton of firepower. Meanwhile, Facebook is developing multiple nascent hyper-growth businesses like Watch, Workplace, Marketplace, and native payments, the sum of which could add meaningful contributions to the financials over the next 5-10 years. Put that all together, and I really don’t understand why the Street thinks revenue growth is going to slow all the way to 25% next year, versus nearly 50% last quarter. Yes, I understand the law of large numbers. Growth is supposed to slow with scale.But that hasn’t happened at Facebook. Revenue growth last quarter was nearly 50%. In the year ago quarter, it was also nearly 50%. Two years ago, it was a hair over 50%. Three years ago, it was a hair under 50%.Why, then, is Facebook’s revenue growth going to all the sudden plummet to 25% after spending multiple years right around 50%?Law of large numbers? The company has defied that trend for a while, and revenues are still less than $100 billion. Google has revenues in excess of $100 billion, so I really don’t see law of large numbers kicking in just yet.Muted user growth? Maybe. But global internet usage expansion should keep user growth healthy in the 10%-plus range, and that level of growth led to 50% revenue growth this past quarter. That trend shouldn’t change any time soon.Instagram ad ramp is over? Again, maybe. But also unlikely. Judging by Snap’s recent results, Instagram is kicking Snap’s butt, and that means a ton of teen-oriented ad dollars are flowing into Instagram. Plus, Messenger and WhatsApp still have yet to be monetized.Digital ad business is nearing saturation? Again, maybe, but unlikely. And largely irrelevant. By the time the ad business does near saturation (after WhatsApp and Messenger have been fully monetized), the other businesses like Watch, Marketplace, and Workplace will be the big growth drivers.Overall, then, I really don’t see why Facebook’s revenue growth is slated to come off the rails over the next several years. The biggest growth drivers remain strong, and there are more growth drivers in the pipeline. As such, it looks like Facebook stock will continue to benefit from successive beat-and-raise quarters over the next several years.How Much Is Facebook Stock Worth?Given that last quarter’s 50% growth rate has been consistent for the past several years and there are big growth drivers still in the pipeline, I don’t think revenue growth will come down by all that much over the next several years. At around $100 billion in revenues, I do expect law of large numbers to start kicking in. I also expect ad revenues to slow some as Facebook and Instagram start to get maxed out. But the overall growth rate will remain robust.All things considered, I think this is a 30% revenue growth company per year over the next 5 years. I also think that operating margins will stay high in the 50% range thanks to robust demand for the company’s ad products. That combination leads me to believe that FB can earn around $18 per share in 5 years.  10 Stocks That Are Screaming Buys Right Now  A market-average growth multiple of 20-times forward earnings on those $18 earnings implies a four-year forward price target for FB stock of $360. Discounted back by 10% per year, that equates to a fair value for FB stock of above $240.Bottom Line on Facebook StockFB stock is a case of big growth converging on a discounted valuation. That convergence normally results in significant share-price out-performance in a multi-year window.That is exactly what will happen over the next several years with Facebook stock. As such, this is a must-own stock for investors with a long-term horizon.As of this writing, Luke Lango was long FB, AMZN, GOOG, and AAPL.More From InvestorPlace  7 Cheap Stocks With Strong Technical Signals    10 Stocks That Are Screaming Buys Right Now    3 Augmented Reality Stocks That Look Like Winners    Flipkart Won't Save Walmart Inc Stock Just Yet   Compare Brokers The post 9 In-Depth Reasons Why Facebook, Inc.

His second such call with the media in two weeks.“I think life is about learning from mistakes and what you need to do moving forward,” Zuckerberg explained during the call.Facebook conducted the call just hours after it disclosed that the information of as many as 87 million people — 37 million more than initially reported — may have been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica. In the weeks since the scandal surfaced in mid-March, Facebook stock has tumbled 16% to $155 a share, all while critics have called for government regulation.Facebook, meanwhile, is now running a full-court press after a shaky start: having Zuckerberg interview with numerous outlets, as well as taking steps to reign in the personal data made available to third-party developers. The U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee also announced on Wednesday Zuckerberg will testify about the Cambridge Analytica matter on April 11. Zuckerberg took a humble tact when addressing the scandal during the Wednesday call.“Our job was to give them tools — it was largely to give them responsibility,” Zuckerberg added. “Given what we know today and across all of our tools and what our place is in society, we need to take a broader role of responsibility. We need to take full responsibility for the outcome for how people use those tools as well.” But while public scrutiny may be taking its toll on Facebook’s stock, the #deletefacebook movement which calls for users to delete their accounts and advertisers to walk away hasn’t made a significant impact on Facebook’s massive 2.13 billion user base or advertising dollars.“I don’t think there’s been a meaningful impact we’ve observed,” Zuckerberg said. “But look, it’s not good… It still speaks to people feeling like this is a massive breach of trust, and we have a lot of work to do to repair that.”—JP Mangalindan is the Chief Tech Correspondent for Yahoo Finance covering the intersection of tech and business. Email story tips and musings to jpm@oath.com. Follow him on Twitter or Facebook.More from JPRichard Branson: Trump’s steel tariffs are ‘counterproductive’ for US economy Richard Branson: Government regulation of Facebook ‘makes sense’ Forget Photoshop, Adobe’s fastest-growing business is marketingFormer Facebook employees sold their shares before the social network’s stock took a real hitFacebook botches response to a scandal, againReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatch3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Watch in AprilMotley FoolWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolNOT REAL NEWS: A look at what didn't happen this weekAssociated PressMom's Post About Putting Kids in Timeout During Tantrums Goes ViralParentsZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley Fool1 Big Reason Why Disney Stock Is Just Getting StartedMotley FoolSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo Finance57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergNetflix might have more Beyoncé specials planned after 'Homecoming'Engadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetFord's Profit Can Soar Thanks to Fresh Products in the Right SegmentsMotley FoolStill Near a 30-Year Low, Is ExxonMobil a Buy?Motley Fool'American Ninja Warrior Junior': Get an exclusive sneak peek at the semi-finals!AOL.comAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceWarren Buffett says stock buybacks make 'nothing but sense'Yahoo FinanceThe Boeing 737 MAX Is 1 Step Closer to Flying Again -- but Don't Expect to See It SoonMotley FoolJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCN

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File photoMoreHow Facebook (FB) makes money can confuse anybody. Just ask Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), who during Tuesday’s Senate interrogation of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg asked the 33-year-old how the social network stayed in business.Zuckerberg’s four-word answer: “Senator, we run ads.”But it’s how those ads come together that’s interesting, and everybody on Facebook should understand how the company can use its deep knowledge of our interests to attract advertisers anxious to aim their pitches at customers with the greatest potential returns. Fortunately, Facebook’s ad machinery isn’t a secret; anybody who maintains a public page, myself included, can use the same basic tools to target ads at people by telling Facebook what kind of interests and demographics they want to attract — or exclude.Address for successZuckerberg’s refrain “we do not sell data to advertisers” holds up on this closer inspection. Facebook has never let me see details about individual users or target them by name.Facebook ads work the other way. You tell the social network what kind of people should see your ad, and Facebook obliges as best as it can.Companies and individual with Facebook pages can use the company’s vast array of user information to target specific groups for their ads.MoreIt starts with a request to select the target audience’s gender (your only choices are male or female) and age range (you can set that as low as 13, Facebook’s minimum age). Then you choose a location.Since in this test, I would be boosting a post about what Facebook should do to restore trust among its users, there was one obvious choice: Facebook’s street address of One Hacker Way, Menlo Park, CA 94025. I then included anybody within 20 miles of there.That’s not too different from digital advertising as offered by Facebook’s competitors — including Yahoo Finance’s corporate parent Verizon (VZ).Your interests can be interestingBut you can also target people on Facebook by their interests, something Facebook knows better than most other online companies. Type a term or phrase, and Facebook will suggest possible matches from an immense inventory of demographics, interests and behaviors.The word “minority,” for instance, yields suggestions like “Lesser Poland,” “Los Angeles Dodgers minor league players” and “Nucleic acid double helix.” You’re more likely to be surprised by interests you can’t target — for instance, HBO’s comedy “Silicon Valley” is in Facebook’s database, but not Showtime’s drama “Billions.”An example of how companies can set up ads to target specific Facebook users.MoreWords and phrases tied to various sorts of bigotry also appear off-limits, to judge from experimentation that hopefully doesn’t have Facebook thinking I’m a Nazi. That’s a change from what Pro Publica found last year, when its reporters could buy ads with anti-Semitic termsIn this ad test, I added such interests as “Facebook and Privacy,” the Federal Trade Commission, and “Personally identifiable information.” I tried adding “General Data Protection Regulation,” but the European Union’s sweeping privacy rule isn’t on Facebook’s list. Facebook predicted this exercise in targeting could reach 1.7 million people — if I paid generously. Limiting my ad budget to $10 would only reach 1,000 to 3,900 people in a day.Story continuesYou can also exclude demographics and interests from an ad. Last year, Pro Publica found that this system let advertisers hide housing ads from minorities, but this dialog didn’t let me add ethnic, racial or religious terms.Custom audiencesThe other way to target people by Facebook requires first finding them outside the social network. Its Custom Audiences feature lets you upload a customer list and have Facebook show your ad to those people — if your information matches what it knows about them.The easiest way to do this is to create and upload a simple spreadsheet with people’s email addresses, phone numbers, names, birthdays and other details. You don’t, however, need their street addresses — just city, state and Zip code. I tested this with my own info and that of three Yahoo Finance colleagues — with their permission, since Facebook’s rules require that upfront. (The minimum size for a Custom Audience upload is 100; I filled out the rest with made-up entries.)Facebook allows advertisers to target specific users, but only if they have the users’ permission.MoreRoughly a half hour later, Facebook had matched my database with Facebook accounts — but it didn’t tell me which ones. It then offered to expand this list’s reach by creating a “lookalike audience” of people who match the Facebook-determined traits of my custom audience.You can also generate a Custom Audience by adding a “Facebook Pixel” to your site to track and record what visitors do there.I didn’t actually purchase this ad after going to all this trouble, but I have bought Facebook ads before — in the spring and fall of last year, the site offered me a credit to try boosting a post on my page. The results weren’t all that impressive.What remains a mysteryAs a Facebook user, much of the social network remains a black box to me — I can only guess about some of its “People You May Know” suggestions, for instance. And while the Ad Preferences interface (facebook.com/ads/preferences) lets me see and edit what Facebook thinks fascinates me, it doesn’t tell me how it learned that.But as an advertiser, much of this is mysterious too. I can’t tell how Facebook decides which users will be interested in a particular topic. And while I may want to avoid looking like a practitioner of surveillance capitalism, I couldn’t tell Facebook to consider only data based on people’s activity on Facebook itself.But Facebook ads clearly work — according to the research firm eMarketer, it accounted for 19.9% of digital ad spending in 2017, second only to Google (GOOG, GOOGL). If you don’t like that, all I can suggest for now is this: try not to click on too many Facebook ads.More from Rob:New study finds 66% of shared links on Twitter came from botsWe need a federal law protecting consumers from data leaksHow Facebook should fix its privacy problemSorry baseball fans: These TV networks strikeout at online streamingBig Tech’s accountability-avoidance problem is getting worse Email Rob at rob@robpegoraro.com; follow him on Twitter at @robpegoraro. ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatch3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Watch in AprilMotley FoolWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolNOT REAL NEWS: A look at what didn't happen this weekAssociated PressMom's Post About Putting Kids in Timeout During Tantrums Goes ViralParentsZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchSamsung Galaxy Fold screens reportedly break for some usersYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business Videos'American Ninja Warrior Junior': Get an exclusive sneak peek at the semi-finals!AOL.comWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceCoachella Weekend 2: What to Watch ForVariety'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBC57% of Americans Aren't Using This Ridiculously Simple Retirement ToolMotley FoolNetflix might have more Beyoncé specials planned after 'Homecoming'EngadgetAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetAmazon's Next Move in Advertising: Streaming MusicMotley Fool

Facebook did not cite the source of these accounts, but The New York Times reported that they were run by Americans."Many were using fake accounts or multiple accounts with the same names and posted massive amounts of content across a network of Groups and Pages to drive traffic to their websites," Nathaniel Gleicher, Facebook's head of cybersecurity, wrote."Many used the same techniques to make their content appear more popular on Facebook than it really was. Others were ad farms using Facebook to mislead people into thinking that they were forums for legitimate political debate."According to The New York Times, the removed accounts included Right Wing News — a page that sometimes spread fake news with a right-wing slant — as well as the left-wing pages Resistance and Reverb Press.The activity echoes the actions of Russia during the 2016 US election, when it attempted to influence American politics using a coordinated campaign of fake accounts that spread hoaxes and misleading information.Facebook said it looked at the behavior of the accounts, rather than the content posted, in its decision to ban them."Today, these networks increasingly use sensational political content — regardless of its political slant — to build an audience and drive traffic to their websites, earning money for every visitor to the site. And like the politically motivated activity we've seen, the 'news' stories or opinions these accounts and Pages share are often indistinguishable from legitimate political debate," Gleicher wrote. "This is why it's so important we look at these actors' behavior — such as whether they're using fake accounts or repeatedly posting spam — rather than their content when deciding which of these accounts, Pages or Groups to remove."A Facebook spokesperson did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for clarification on the sources of the accounts and details of the accounts themselves.Some critics have attacked Facebook on the timing on the removals, coming just weeks before the US midterm elections. "Early voting is already happening in some states, and Election Day is a few weeks away, so it’s especially inexcusable that Facebook is only now deleting political disinformation pages. Facebook has long been aware of the presence and activities of these pages but did nothing until the company sensed a potential public relations disaster as reporters started working on stories about right-wing networks intentionally promoting misinformation through their operation of these pages," Angelo Carusone, president of media watchdog Media Matters, said in a statement. "So, while it’s a good thing that Facebook is finally taking this action, it’s yet another example that Facebook is not prepared to proactively meet the challenges of abuse and misinformation on its platform; instead, the platform does the bare minimum to respond to the latest PR crisis."Do you work at Facebook?

The most recent findings indicate that 36% of teens use the social media platform, compared with 45% in the spring (and 60% in the spring of 2016).(Photo: screenshot/Piper Jaffray)MoreOnly 5% of teens ranked Facebook as their No. 1 favorite social network, versus 32% for Instagram and 46% for Snapchat (SNAP). This number has continued to drop since spring 2016, when 15% of teens said Facebook was their favorite platform. The report isn’t surprising, as it was previously reported that 42% of Facebook users have taken a break from the site in the last year. In a Pew Research survey, 44% of users between the ages of 18 and 29 admitted to deleting the Facebook app from their phones. Piper Jaffray analyst Sam Kemp previously told Yahoo Finance that Facebook isn’t as addictive for teenagers the way Snapchat is.(Photo: REUTERS/Eric Thayer)More“When Facebook first came up, it was the only option for new media formats,” he said. “Now, the alternatives are more gratifying for teens.”These alternatives include Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter (TWTR), Pinterest, and Tumblr. Instagram is the most-used platform, followed by Snapchat and Twitter. And this doesn’t even factor in the number of teens who are increasingly turning to video games and Netflix (NFLX).While it’s up for debate whether this decline in use stems from data breaches, better options from other social media platforms, or other factors, it’s clear that, if this trend continues, Facebook may soon become a thing of the past.Adriana is an associate editor for Yahoo Finance.

Critics have dubbed this as an effective "link tax," but proponents say hyperlinks will be exempt.Meanwhile, Article 13 calls for "effective content recognition" technology to filter out copyright-protected content. Detractors hold that this part of the law could threaten social media users' ability to share anything from internet memes to snippets of music and film.Reacting to the result of the vote, Julia Reda, a German Pirate Party lawmaker, said it was "catastrophic" that the parliament voted in favor of the most controversial pieces of the legislation."Final vote for Parliament position on the copyright directive with #UploadFilters and #LinkTax adopted," she wrote in a tweet. "Parliament has failed to listen to citizens' and experts' concerns."TweetOpponents of the directive have been using the hashtag #SaveYourInternet on social media."The legislation is now better balanced, answering many of the concerns of journalists, publishers and musicians whose work was being shared freely online without stifling innovation or fundamentally changing the nature of the internet," Sajjad Karim, a British Conservative lawmaker, said in a statement following the vote."It also takes into account the rights of users, ensuring that materials used for teaching and research, and by cultural and heritage organizations, are not encumbered by unnecessary restrictions."What's next?Wednesday's vote won't be the last you've heard about the EU's copyright reforms.Lawmakers had initially voted to delay the vote, rejecting the version of the directive that had been agreed by a committee at that time.Now that politicians in Strasbourg have come to an agreement, the next stage for the law will be what's known as "trilogue," which consists of talks between European Parliament, EU executive body the European Commission, and a collective of the leaders of EU member states known as the European Council.And even once the directive goes through this process, it will still require each individual EU nation to decide on how they will implement the new rules.The EU copyright battle pits media companies and musicians against tech giants over the widespread availability of their content online. Supporters of the law argue that people and companies in the creative industries are being starved of revenues lost to the sharing of their intellectual property on digital platforms.It could particularly impact platforms like Facebook FB and Google's GOOGL YouTube, which rely on user-generated content. Google has been accused of lobbying aggressively to prevent the directive from being passed into law.The issue has drawn attention from notable figures in both the tech and media worlds, including internet pioneer Tim Berners-Lee, Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales, former Beatles star Paul McCartney and French DJ David Guetta .More From CNBC AT&T CEO calls Netflix the 'Walmart' of video streamingSnap shares tumble after BTIG's Greenfield cuts target to $5Apple will probably lower iPhone prices on Wednesday — here's whyReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextGold Faces A New Trade Conflict, Banks Accumulate The MetalFX EmpirePound Looks Placid in Brexit Break Before Parliament Meets AgainBloombergWhy Livestreaming TV Can't Break ThroughMotley FoolPanel to review approval of Boeing 737 Max flight controlsAssociated PressIntroducing Électricite de Strasbourg Société Anonyme (EPA:ELEC), The Stock That Dropped 18% In The Last YearSimply Wall St.Zookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatchWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunch'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosNetflix might have more Beyoncé specials planned after 'Homecoming'EngadgetAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo Finance'American Ninja Warrior Junior': Get an exclusive sneak peek at the semi-finals!AOL.comWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley Fool

The company witnessed a tumultuous ride in recent months following the data breach report from Cambridge Analytica. In fact, the stock slipped into correction territory and erased about $50 billion in its market-cap value on the news in a week (read: 4 Tech ETFs That Tumbled Most on Facebook Data Scandal).Despite the slide, Facebook has been able to outperform the industry by a margin of 1.7% from a year-to-date look. The outperformance might continue given the positive earnings revision trend, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat, and attractive fundamentals though earnings surprise is difficult to predict at this time.Inside Our MethodologyFacebook has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and an Earnings ESP of -0.47%, implying that a beat cannot be predicted this quarter. According to our surprise prediction methodology, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) when combined with a positive Earnings ESP makes us confident in predicting an earnings beat. A Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) is best avoided going into the earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Although the stock saw negative earnings estimate revision of a couple of cents over the past 30 days for the first quarter, the earnings estimates have moved up by 12 cents over the past 90 days. Additionally, Facebook’s earnings surprise history is robust, with a positive earnings surprise of 15.78% on average over the past four quarters. It is expected to post solid earnings growth of 10.58% and revenue growth of 42.66% in Q1 (read: 5 Reason Why FANG ETFs Lost Their Charm in March).The stock has a top Growth Style Score of A but Value and Momentum Score of D and C, respectively, look ugly. According to the analysts polled by Zacks, Facebook has an average target price of $215.63 with 93% giving a Strong Buy or a Buy rating ahead of the company’s earnings. This represents 30% upside from the current price.What to Watch?After a data scandal, the social media giant is subject to increased regulatory pressure, and could have to spend more cash to examine content and protect data. This would amplify the already higher spending expectation for 2018. In the last earnings report, the company expects operating expenses to increase 45-60% this year, higher than 32% recorded in 2017. This would have a significant impact on the company's profitability.  ETFs in FocusGiven Facebook's attractive fundamentals, investors could focus on ETFs having the largest allocation to the social media giant. While there are several ETFs in the space having FB in their basket, we have highlighted five funds that have the social media giant in their top five holdings (see: all the Technology ETFs here):Global X Social Media Index ETF SOCL — The fund has delivered returns of 3.8% since the start of the year and carries a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a High risk outlook. Facebook takes the third spot with 8.8% allocation.First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index FDN — The fund has gained 14.1% in the same time frame and has a Zacks ETF Rank #2 (Buy) with a High risk outlook.

But in today's testimony Mark Zuckerberg also mentioned a much higher estimate of "tens of thousands," though the confidence in this number would be also be much lower."In the IRA specifically, the ones we've pegged back to the IRA, we can identify 470 in the American elections, and the 270 that we went after in Russia last week," he began in response to Senator Feinstein (D-), who had asked about the numbers of accounts associated with this type of coordinated disinformation campaign.But then he continued:"There are many others that our systems catch which are more difficult to attribute specifically to Russian intelligence, but the number would be in the tens of thousands of fake accounts..."The tens of thousands number must be taken with a grain of salt, since clearly Facebook has not been able to definitively attribute more than the stated 740 or so to the IRA and Russian intel. But it is still significant; this is clearly different from the 30,000-odd accounts banned in relation to France's election. That was a specific number and also not mentioned in connection with Russia specifically, as this estimate was.It seems clear that Facebook is being conservative in its enumeration of Russian-linked accounts, and that very well may be the responsible thing to do. But Zuckerberg's remarks today establish a ceiling in the tens of thousands in addition to the floor of several hundred.

Unfortunately, that prediction has come true more than once,” Cook said when asked about the Facebook data misuse by Cambridge Analytica. “I think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary.”Apple has emphasized security and privacy as an important selling point in its products. Unlike Google or Facebook, whose revenue is driven by ads, Apple mainly makes money by selling premium devices like iPads and iPhones. Cook finds the idea of collecting data and selling them to marketers unacceptable. “The ability of anyone to know what you’ve been browsing about for years, who your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life — from my own point of view it shouldn’t exist,” Cook said.Apple’s business model is differentUnlike other tech giants like Facebook and Google, Apple says it doesn’t profit from collecting user data. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola)MoreCook said he has been careful of inviting government regulations. Back in 2016, Apple had a well-known dispute with the FBI over obtaining access to an iPhone used by a shooter in the San Bernardino attack. Though the FBI ultimately broke into the phone without Apple’s help, Apple pledged it would go to court to protect user privacy. Last year, Sen. Al Franken raised privacy issues on the iPhone X’s Face ID authentication technology. Apple soon responded by clarifying the data would never be sent to Apple, nor is it included in device backups.It’s not the first time that Cook has critiqued peer tech companies. In an open letter in 2014, he emphasized that Apple doesn’t build profiles of its users from their email content or browsing habits “to sell to advertisers,” essentially calling out Google and Facebook. “Our business model is very straightforward: We sell great products,” he wrote. “We don’t build a profile based on your email content or web browsing habits to sell to advertisers. We don’t ‘monetize’ the information you store on your iPhone or in iCloud. And we don’t read your email or your messages to get information to market to you.”Krystal Hu covers technology and economy for Yahoo Finance.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) MoreNEW YORK (AP) -- Facebook and other companies routinely track your online surfing habits to better target ads at you. Two web browsers now want to help you fight back in what's becoming an escalating privacy arms race.New protections in Apple's Safari and Mozilla's Firefox browsers aim to prevent companies from turning "cookie" data files used to store sign-in details and preferences into broader trackers that take note of what you read, watch and research on other sites.Lance Cottrell, creator of the privacy service Anonymizer, said Apple's effort was particularly significant, as it takes aim at a technique developed by tracking companies to override users' attempts to delete their cookies.Safari makes these protections automatic in updates coming Tuesday to iPhones and iPads and a week later to Mac computers. Firefox has similar protections on Apple mobile devices and is rolling out them out to personal computers in the coming months.To get the protections, you'll have to break your habit of using Google's Chrome browser, which by some estimates has more than half of the worldwide browser usage. Safari and Firefox have less than 20 percent combined.Even then, Safari and Firefox can't entirely stop tracking. For starters, they won't block tracking when you're using Facebook or Google itself. Nor can they help much when you use phone or tablet apps, unless the app happens to embed Safari, as Twitter's iPhone app does.But Will Strafach, a mobile security expert who is designing data security tools for phones, said imperfect protection is better than no protection. He notes that burglars can still break down a door, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't bother locking it.Cookies and other trackers can be used by companies to keep track of who you are as you move from website to website. The companies can build a digital profile as you, say, read about Democratic or Republican viewpoints, buy a particular brand of pet food or indulge in the entire season of "Keeping Up With The Kardashians."News, video and other third-party sites use Google and Facebook cookies to customize ads to your hobbies and interests, rather than hawking products you might never buy. That's why you might see an ad for shoes soon after searching for them elsewhere.Apple says its tests show that some popular websites are embedded with more than 70 such trackers. Many of these are from Facebook and Google, which are expected to command a combined 57 percent of the $107 billion U.S. digital advertising market this year, according to the research group eMarketer.Though general awareness of data collection has grown in the wake of Facebook's Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal , how trackers work behind the scenes remains a mystery to many people.Ghostery and other products have long offered tracking protection. The browsers are now trying to incorporate that directly so you don't have to go looking for browser add-ons.Safari will try to automatically distinguish cookies that are useful from ones that are there just to track you. Apple notes that cookies can appear in unexpected places, such as sites that embed "like" and "share" buttons. Now, those cookies will be blocked until you click on one of those buttons, in which case you'll be prompted for permission to allow the tracking. If you don't, your "like" won't register.Safari is also attacking a technique developed to circumvent cookie deletions. Through "fingerprinting," a company can identify you through your computer's characteristics, such as browser type and fonts installed. Your new cookie can then be tied to your old profile. Safari will now limit the technical details it sends.Firefox has an anti-tracking feature that also tries to distinguish tracking cookies from useful ones. It's on by default only on Apple's mobile devices. Mozilla is testing a broader rollout for personal computers, though its plans for Android are not yet known. For now, you need to turn it on or use a private-browsing mode, which gets more aggressive at killing cookies, including useful ones.For PCs, Firefox also has an optional add-on, called Facebook Container, to segregate your Facebook activity from everything else. Think of it as a wall that prevents Facebook from accessing its data cookie as you surf elsewhere. A version is available for other trackers, too, but requires configuration on your part.Story continuesNone of the Firefox tools, though, address fingerprinting.Unsurprisingly, advertisers aren't happy.In a statement, Interactive Advertising Bureau executive Dennis Buchheim said that even as browsers makers feel pressured to deliver privacy-centric features, they should consider the importance of advertising in enabling free services.The new Safari and Firefox tools don't block ads. But without cookies, websites might get paid a lot less for them, said Jed Williams, chief innovation officer at the Local Media Association, an industry group for news publishers.Apple and Mozilla are able to push the boundaries on privacy because neither depends on advertising. Google makes most of its money from selling ads.Facebook and Google declined comment on the Safari and Firefox tools. But Google said its Chrome browser offers tools to control and delete cookies and set preferences for certain websites.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) MoreNEW YORK (AP) -- Facebook and other companies routinely track your online surfing habits to better target ads at you. Two web browsers now want to help you fight back in what's becoming an escalating privacy arms race.New protections in Apple's Safari and Mozilla's Firefox browsers aim to prevent companies from turning "cookie" data files used to store sign-in details and preferences into broader trackers that take note of what you read, watch and research on other sites.Lance Cottrell, creator of the privacy service Anonymizer, said Apple's effort was particularly significant, as it takes aim at a technique developed by tracking companies to override users' attempts to delete their cookies.Safari makes these protections automatic in updates coming Tuesday to iPhones and iPads and a week later to Mac computers. Firefox has similar protections on Apple mobile devices and is rolling out them out to personal computers in the coming months.To get the protections, you'll have to break your habit of using Google's Chrome browser, which by some estimates has more than half of the worldwide browser usage. Safari and Firefox have less than 20 percent combined.Even then, Safari and Firefox can't entirely stop tracking. For starters, they won't block tracking when you're using Facebook or Google itself. Nor can they help much when you use phone or tablet apps, unless the app happens to embed Safari, as Twitter's iPhone app does.But Will Strafach, a mobile security expert who is designing data security tools for phones, said imperfect protection is better than no protection. He notes that burglars can still break down a door, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't bother locking it.Cookies and other trackers can be used by companies to keep track of who you are as you move from website to website. The companies can build a digital profile as you, say, read about Democratic or Republican viewpoints, buy a particular brand of pet food or indulge in the entire season of "Keeping Up With The Kardashians."News, video and other third-party sites use Google and Facebook cookies to customize ads to your hobbies and interests, rather than hawking products you might never buy. That's why you might see an ad for shoes soon after searching for them elsewhere.Apple says its tests show that some popular websites are embedded with more than 70 such trackers. Many of these are from Facebook and Google, which are expected to command a combined 57 percent of the $107 billion U.S. digital advertising market this year, according to the research group eMarketer.Though general awareness of data collection has grown in the wake of Facebook's Cambridge Analytica privacy scandal , how trackers work behind the scenes remains a mystery to many people.Ghostery and other products have long offered tracking protection. The browsers are now trying to incorporate that directly so you don't have to go looking for browser add-ons.Safari will try to automatically distinguish cookies that are useful from ones that are there just to track you. Apple notes that cookies can appear in unexpected places, such as sites that embed "like" and "share" buttons. Now, those cookies will be blocked until you click on one of those buttons, in which case you'll be prompted for permission to allow the tracking. If you don't, your "like" won't register.Safari is also attacking a technique developed to circumvent cookie deletions. Through "fingerprinting," a company can identify you through your computer's characteristics, such as browser type and fonts installed. Your new cookie can then be tied to your old profile. Safari will now limit the technical details it sends.Firefox has an anti-tracking feature that also tries to distinguish tracking cookies from useful ones. It's on by default only on Apple's mobile devices. Mozilla is testing a broader rollout for personal computers, though its plans for Android are not yet known. For now, you need to turn it on or use a private-browsing mode, which gets more aggressive at killing cookies, including useful ones.For PCs, Firefox also has an optional add-on, called Facebook Container, to segregate your Facebook activity from everything else. Think of it as a wall that prevents Facebook from accessing its data cookie as you surf elsewhere. A version is available for other trackers, too, but requires configuration on your part.Story continuesNone of the Firefox tools, though, address fingerprinting.Unsurprisingly, advertisers aren't happy.In a statement, Interactive Advertising Bureau executive Dennis Buchheim said that even as browsers makers feel pressured to deliver privacy-centric features, they should consider the importance of advertising in enabling free services.The new Safari and Firefox tools don't block ads. But without cookies, websites might get paid a lot less for them, said Jed Williams, chief innovation officer at the Local Media Association, an industry group for news publishers.Apple and Mozilla are able to push the boundaries on privacy because neither depends on advertising. Google makes most of its money from selling ads.Facebook and Google declined comment on the Safari and Firefox tools. But Google said its Chrome browser offers tools to control and delete cookies and set preferences for certain websites. Google says users can also decline personalization and get generic ads instead, though tracking continues in the background while using the company's services.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextFoxconn says it remains committed to Wisconsin investment projectReutersAt $1 Trillion, Apple is Bigger Than These ThingsInvestopediaIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatchWhat to Expect When Alphabet Reports Later This MonthMotley FoolWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceTesla's board is about to get a lot smallerTechCrunchAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunchWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergQualcomm's joint venture with Chinese province to shut down: The InformationReuters

Now, Cook and company are taking their own steps to jam up social media sites’ web-tracking tools by blocking them in both the upcoming macOS Mojave and iOS 12 versions of Apple’s Safari browser. In other words, the war of words between Facebook and Apple seems to have just gone hot.Blocking social tracking“In Safari, enhanced Intelligent Tracking Prevention helps block social media ‘Like’ or ‘Share’ buttons and comment widgets from tracking users without permission,” Apple said in a statement.The move won’t completely stop you from being able to use Like and Share buttons or make comments on sites using Facebook plugins on websites, but it will require you to take the extra step of confirming that you want to have Facebook share your data via a pop-up that warns of as much.If you don’t confirm you want to use the Like or Share buttons or leave a comment, they won’t be able to track your data at all. This is especially important for people who don’t have Facebook, but can still be tracked through these social features.Social tracking will be curtailed in macOS Mojave and iOS 12.MoreThat’s a big move on Apple’s part, and follows Cook’s comments that consumers’ data and privacy is a civil right and human right. When he was asked how he would handle Facebook’s data scandal during an interview with MSNBC, Cook he “wouldn’t be in this situation.”This isn’t the first time that Apple has hit out at social media sites and other platforms for trafficking in users’ data. Cook previously expressed how Apple could easily monetize user data to make an enormous sum of cash, but chooses not to on moral grounds.Of course, Apple has had issues of its own when it comes to how its iPhones are built.Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg hasn’t taken the criticism lying down, though. In an interview with Vox, he called Cook’s comments “extremely glib” and said that if you are going to build a service that connects people around the world, some of whom can’t afford to pay, an advertising-based model is the only way to go.Stopping fingerprintingApple isn’t just hitting back at social media sites — the company is also making it harder for advertiser networks to track users based on the kinds of devices they use. Called fingerprinting, this technique allows advertisers to track web users based on the machine they use, the kinds of fonts they use and legacy plug-ins they use.Apple says that these kinds of indicators can make it easy for advertisers to accurately track users across multiple sites and get a better picture of who you are. With the macOS Mojave version of Safari, though, Apple is making it harder for advertisers to see who you are and what you like.It’s a move that will surely make privacy advocates happy, but will raise the ire of your advertisers and advertiser-supported businesses.More from Dan:How to make sure Russian hackers can’t attack your router againZuckerberg: Elon Musk is right about self-driving carsApple CEO Tim Cook brings up data privacy in Duke graduation speechWarren Buffett: ‘Cyber is uncharted territory and it’s going to get worse, not better’Why AI is the next frontier for medicineEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@oath.com; follow him on Twitter at @DanielHowley. Follow Yahoo Finance on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedInReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextFoxconn says it remains committed to Wisconsin investment projectReutersAt $1 Trillion, Apple is Bigger Than These ThingsInvestopediaCorporate America embraces 420 as pot legalization growsAssociated PressWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley Fool3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Watch in AprilMotley FoolZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo Finance1 Big Reason Why Disney Stock Is Just Getting StartedMotley FoolWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBC'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadgetAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadgetWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergThe Boeing 737 MAX Is 1 Step Closer to Flying Again -- but Don't Expect to See It SoonMotley FoolIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatch

Photograph: Greg Baker/AFP/Getty ImagesMoreApple has updated its rules to restrict app developers’ ability to harvest data from mobile phones, which could be bad news for a Facebook-owned data security app called Onavo Protect.Onavo ostensibly provides users with a free virtual private network (VPN) which, it claims, helps “keep you and your data safe when you browse and share information on the web”. What is not immediately obvious is that it feeds information to Facebook about what other apps you are using and how much you are using them back to the social networking giant.“The problem with Onavo is that it talks about being a VPN that keeps your data private, but behind the scenes it’s harvesting your data for Facebook,” said Ryan Dochuk, CEO of the paid-for VPN TunnelBear. “It goes against what people generally expect when they use a VPN.”Onavo has been a Trojan horse for Facebook (in the classical sense, not as malware), allowing it to gather intelligence on the apps people use on tens of millions of devices outside its empire. This real-time market research highlights which apps are becoming popular and which are struggling. Such competitive intelligence can inform acquisition targets and negotiations as well as identify popular features it could copy in rival apps.As first reported by Bloomberg, Apple’s new App Store rules explicitly ban the collection of “information about which other apps are installed on a user’s device for the purposes of analytics or advertising/marketing”, which appears to be intentionally worded to clamp down on apps like Onavo.“Apple has been very clear that it’s pro-privacy,” ,” said Joseph Jerome, a privacy specialist from the Center for Democracy and Technology, “and with every iteration of iOS [Apple’s mobile operating system] has been trying to restrain the ability of apps to know what’s going on on the device if a user hasn’t authorised it.”Onavo started life in Tel Aviv in 2010 as a startup that helped people reduce their wireless bills by compressing incoming data on an iPhone or Android device. It also highlighted which apps were using the most data. For mobile publishers, it provided analytics to help them keep track of how their apps were performing against competitors. In May 2013, it launched a VPN called Onavo Protect, which promised to protect people’s data when they were browsing the web from their phone on a public wifi network.Facebook bought the company in October 2013 for an undisclosed sum, estimated to be between $100m and $200m.Onavo provides information to Facebook about what other apps you are using and how much you are using them. Photograph: Christophe Morin/IP3/Getty ImagesMoreVPNs work by redirecting and encrypting all data leaving your computer, phone or tablet and sending it to another server in another location. They position themselves as tools for protecting people’s privacy and security, but that very much depends on who is running the VPN and how they make their money.“This server is in a really privileged position,” said Dochuk. “Essentially, it needs 100% of consumer trust because 100% of their data is going through that server.”This means whoever runs the VPN knows which apps are installed on your device and how much you use them; which websites you visit; and your device type and location.There are some VPNs, such as TunnelBear, that cover their server and bandwidth costs through paid subscriptions and others, like Hola and Onavo, that provide a free service to the end user, but extract value from the data they collect or by selling people’s unused bandwidth.Story continues“If you’re not paying with your money you are probably paying with your data,” said Will Strafach, a security specialist who has analysed the Onavo app.According to the Wall Street Journal, Facebook employees have put the Onavo data to good use by monitoring the performance of rival Snapchat, particularly after Facebook’s Instagram app launched similar features. Onavo’s data also reportedly helped guide Facebook’s decision to buy WhatsApp for $19bn in 2014 and to clone the popular group video chat app Houseparty.In written questions following CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s congressional testimony in April, lawmakers asked Facebook whether its use of data gleaned from Onavo violated the privacy consumers expect of a VPN.Facebook said that it explained what data it would receive when a user installed the app.“This helps us improve and operate the Onavo service by analysing your use of websites, apps and data,” Onavo Protect’s App Store messaging reads. “Because we’re part of Facebook, we also use this info to improve Facebook products and services, gain insights into the products and services people value, and build better experiences.”Users have to accept these terms before using the app.The company has acknowledged it uses Onavo to monitor competitors, but it insists this is not unusual: “Websites and apps have used market research services for years.”Facebook said it did not connect the app usage data collected through Onavo to the data collected from an individual’s Facebook account.Strafach said it would be easy for Facebook to connect the data if the person also had the Facebook app installed on their phone.“You just have to trust that they are not doing that,” he said.Given Facebook’s recent track record with data privacy, that trust may have slightly eroded.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextIllinois cop pulls man over — and gives him a ride to his job interview instead of a ticketMarketWatchWhy Pinterest Could Be the Hidden Gem of the 2019 IPO ClassMotley Fool3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Watch in AprilMotley FoolNOT REAL NEWS: A look at what didn't happen this weekAssociated PressMom's Post About Putting Kids in Timeout During Tantrums Goes ViralParentsZookeeper hospitalized after tiger attack at Topeka ZooAssociated PressAmerica’s 3 wealthiest families have more money than 4 million average families combinedYahoo FinanceBreaking the cannabis glass ceilingYahoo FinanceSamsung's $2,000 folding phone gave me a brief but tantalizing glimpse of the future — before it brokeCNBCWedbush cuts Snap rating to neutralYahoo Finance VideoInfluencers Transcript: Eric Schmidt, April 18, 2019Yahoo FinanceTaco Bell Hiring Parties Are Crazy Enough to WorkMotley FoolBoeing's Big Win: $14.3 Billion to Modernize the B-52 and B-1 BombersMotley FoolThe Navy's Most Expensive New Ship Program Might Cost Even More Than AnticipatedMotley FoolBlackBerry Messenger is shutting down in MayEngadget'Who are you?': This child robot talks and cries like a real patientYahoo Finance Video'It totally changes the experience': Square eyes Major League Baseball parksYahoo FinanceMueller investigation was a ‘horror show’: Former FBI assistant directorFox Business VideosHow 'Jersey Shore' star Vinny Guadagnino invests his millionsYahoo FinanceFormer White House economist: U.S. 'shooting ourselves in the foot' in trade warYahoo FinanceBlackBerry's marginally upgraded, red-accented KEY2 is out todayEngadgetAon's new $1,000,000 risk-reward challenge is an interesting development for the PGA tourYahoo Finance VideoThis week in Trumponomics: Mueller spares the marketsYahoo FinanceJohn McAfee Promotes Steven Seagal-Endorsed Crypto Scam CoinCCNDisney, Starbucks, Walmart: Big companies are increasingly offering education benefits for employeesYahoo FinanceCrypto Developer Raises $4 Mln From Samsung, Others to Launch Wallet Without Private KeysCointelegraphTesla's board is about to get a lot smallerTechCrunchWhat are America's healthiest communities?Yahoo Finance VideoBitcoin heads for mass market adoption as Millennials get onboardCoin RivetLyft's Fast-Slumping Stock Quickly Leads to Investor LawsuitsBloombergThe Boeing 737 MAX Is 1 Step Closer to Flying Again -- but Don't Expect to See It SoonMotley FoolNetflix says it's testing a shuffle feature for when you don't know what to watchTechCrunch

  Man pleads guilty to racial threat using fake Facebook accountStory Highlights African-American man created account in November, pretending to be supremacist  He used account to make death threat against a black university student  Man told FBI that he only wanted "to get a reaction"  He will be sentenced November 18, could get prison time Next Article in Crime »    



 


 

  (CNN) -- An African-American man has pleaded guilty after being accused of impersonating a white supremacist in a fictitious Facebook account to make death threats against an African-American university student. 
A Mississippi man admitted creating a false Facebook profile in November. 
 Dyron L. Hart, 20, of Poplarville, Mississippi, pleaded guilty Wednesday before U.S. District Judge Kurt D. Engelhardt to one count of communicating threats in interstate commerce, according to a Department of Justice statement. Hart admitted creating the fictitious account in November, pretending to be a white supremacist outraged by the election of Barack Obama as the nation's first African-American president, the statement said.   He then transmitted a death threat via Facebook to an African-American student at Nicholls State University in Louisiana, saying he wanted to kill African-Americans because of Obama's election, according to the statement. A court document provided by the U.S. attorney's office said Hart told an FBI interviewer that  he intended the threat to be a prank "to get a reaction."

 The document said Hart admitted creating the Facebook profile under the name "Colten Brodoux" and used a photo of a Caucasian man that he found on a white supremacist Web site. "This is an extremely odd case, a very unusual case," said U.S. Attorney Jim Letten of the Eastern District of Louisiana. "The contents of the messages were extremely troubling and provocative and very threatening." Hart will face a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine when sentenced November 18, the statement said.

   Five clues that you are addicted to FacebookStory Highlights Therapists report seeing more people with addiction to social-networking sites  The sites themselves are not the problem; disconnection from real life is  People put best face forward on Facebook, therapist says  You may be addicted if you lose sleep over Facebook, obsess over old flames Next Article in Health »   Read  VIDEO   By  Elizabeth Cohen  CNN Senior Medical Correspondent 



 


 

  (CNN) -- One day recently, Cynthia Newton's 12-year-old daughter asked her for help with homework, but Newton didn't want to help her, because she was too busy on Facebook. So her daughter went upstairs to her room and sent an e-mail asking her for help, but Newton didn't see the e-mail, because, well, she was too busy on Facebook. 
The problem exists when a Facebook user crosses the line from social networking into social dysfunction. 
 "I'm an addict. I just get lost in Facebook," Newton said. "My daughter gets so PO'd at me, and really it is kind of pathetic. It's not something I'm particularly proud of. I just get so sucked in."   Newton (that's not her real name; she's embarrassed by her Facebook use and requested anonymity) says she spends about 20 hours a week on the social networking site, half the time for work -- she runs an online business -- and half just for fun. She's tried to cut down on her Facebook use but failed.  "I can go a whole day without Facebook," she said. "But I've never made it through an entire weekend." Although there are no statistics on "Facebook addiction" -- it isn't an actual medical diagnosis -- therapists say they're seeing more and more people like Newton who've crossed the line from social networking to social dysfunction.   "Last Friday, I had three clients in my office with Facebook problems," said Paula Pile, a marriage and family therapist in Greensboro, North Carolina. "It's turned into a compulsion -- a compulsion to dissociate from your real world and go live in the Facebook world."  Watch more on Facebook addiction »   So how do you know when your Facebook use has turned into a compulsion? You can take Pile's "Facebook Compulsion Inventory" to find out. Pile and the other therapists interviewed for this article were quick to say that Facebook itself isn't the problem and that the vast majority of its 200 million users probably function just fine.  "I'm on it myself," Pile said. "My daughter just got married, and I got great happiness posting her wedding pictures for all my friends to see."

 She says problems arise when users ignore family and work obligations because they find the Facebook world a more enjoyable place to spend time than the real world. Newton says she checks Facebook first thing when she wakes up, and then she checks her Facebook page as many as seven times while at work, and then she'll check Facebook again when she gets home and one more time before she goes to sleep. If you've been keeping count, that's about 10 times a day. A single parent, Newton includes "Facebook flirting" with men and meeting up with old schoolmates among her favorite activities.  "One old friend told me he had a huge crush on me in kindergarten, and it tore him apart when we weren't put in the same class in first grade," she said. "When I read that, it was like, wow. I blushed at my computer. I had no idea I was so important to him. It felt very real and warm and dear." The problem is that it's not real, says Joanna Lipari, a clinical psychologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. She compares Facebook to "The Truman Show," the 1998 Jim Carrey movie about a fabricated world where nothing ever goes wrong.  "Facebook is a fun, pleasant, happy, beautiful world. People only present the crème de la crème of their lives on Facebook. And these people want to be your friends! It's very seductive." It's especially seductive when real life isn't going so well, Pile adds. "In real life, people have morning breath, and you have to pay bills with them, and you argue about who's going to change the baby's diaper," she said. "But Facebook is happyland. You don't have to deal with any of that." Newton says she knows all this and is frustrated at how much time she spends on Facebook, given that she has a job and a child.  "I've thought about going cold turkey, but that would make me so uncomfortable. I know I couldn't do it." You know you're a Facebook addict when ... 1. You lose sleep over Facebook "If you're staying up late at night because you're on Facebook, and you're tired the next day, Facebook may be a compulsion for you," Lipari said. "You shouldn't be neglecting yourself because of Facebook." 2. You spend more than an hour a day on Facebook Pile says it's hard to pinpoint exactly how much is too much time to be spending on social networking.  "I can't imagine that anyone would need more than an hour a day on Facebook, and probably no one needs more than 30 minutes," she said. 3. You become obsessed with old loves Reconnecting with old friends is one of the great attractions of Facebook, and there's nothing necessarily wrong with "friending" an old boyfriend or girlfriend. But Pile warns that it can get out of hand very quickly. "One of my clients met up with an old boyfriend on Facebook. They started spending hours and hours into the night talking to each other on Facebook. She made some really inappropriate comments about how unhappy she was in her marriage," Pile said. "Her cousin saw the comments and told her parents, and the parents told the husband, and now they're in the process of getting divorced."

 4. You ignore work in favor of Facebook "If you're not doing your job in order to sneak time on Facebook, you could have a real problem," Lipari said. 5. The thought of getting off Facebook leaves you in a cold sweat 





   Sarah Browne, who writes the Guru of New blog, gave up Facebook for Lent last month when she realized that she had a "mild" addiction to the site. She's come up with "Seven Signs You May Be Ready for a Social Media Detox." Pile has her own quick test: "Try going a day without Facebook. If you find it causes you a lot of stress and anxiety, you really need to get some help."

 It's Monday morning. You sign into your Facebook profile to update your status and you start due diligence on your friends' profiles. You're looking at photos from the weekend when you see that your girlfriend was tagged in an album of someone who is not your 'friend.'  You click through to that person's profile to get the scoop on how they know each other. Then you see some mutual friends, click around a few more times and before you know it, you're looking at wedding photos of people you don't even know. If you have a social networking profile, the above scenario probably seems all too familiar. (Trust me; there's a reason I was able to go through the steps of it so well...)   While many job seekers heed advice on joining social media sites to use as networking tools, they are also warned not to invest too much time -- especially at work -- in these all-consuming, often-addictive online vehicles. Until now. "With social media becoming a major player in how people communicate and interact with each other, it's natural that this industry needs a marketplace," says Jim Durbin, vice president of social media at Durbin Media, an interactive marketing firm. "A lot of jobs in online marketing are all now requiring some level of social media expertise. The real question is whether the jobs coalesce into new departments and position, or if they become skill sets under old departments." Social media on the rise More companies are utilizing social networking efforts by Twittering, blogging and creating profiles on sites like Facebook and LinkedIn to gain exposure and increase customer service.

 The Daniel Group/Dan Temps, for example, decided to take advantage of social media to enhance its brand recognition. Jarrod Daniel, president of the executive search and staffing firm, says the firm saw an opportunity to communicate better with its associates and candidates on topics like employment, market issues and internal events. Plus, having an active Facebook page has helped candidates find them and increase visibility. "Our Facebook recruiting project has increased our visibility in regards to the job postings that we have. We used to get an average of 30 applications per posting before we created the Facebook page," Daniel says. "Since that page was created, the applications have gone up to an average of 150 applications per posting. That is a 500 percent increase in applications per posting in only three months." While Dan Temps clearly figured out an effective strategy, not every company is in the same boat. Many firms know they need to get in the space, but once they're there, they have no idea how to leverage their existence. As a result, employers need people with social networking skills -- like you -- to come on board and take over. Jobs for Facebook addicts If you're a social media guru, here are five jobs to consider in your next job search: 1. Recruiter Candidates have been on social networks for years now, and it's about time recruiters joined them. Daniel says Dan Temps' recruiters can find candidates faster, screen them better and reach out to individuals they wouldn't see otherwise. "Dan Temps believes that the environment candidates are accustomed to in a social network will keep the conversations and information real," Daniel says. "Candidates don't feel they are being pressured in that environment like they would in a more formal interview or screening process and are more likely to get real with our recruiters." 2. Strategist Many companies are seeking social media strategists to find the best way to interact within various social sites and online communities. In this role, you would be the face of social media for your company, creating and maintaining an effective social media strategy by interacting with users, growing brand awareness, creating buzz, increasing traffic and providing valuable information. To thrive in this position, Durbin says you must have a proven track record of achieving goals, or companies will be hesitant to hire you. 3. Enterprise architect "This is the most exciting job in social media and requires someone with broad experience in networks, multiple platforms, development, security and political infighting," Durbin says. "This is a very rare find. It's for companies looking to completely revamp their content management strategy and internal networks. It could be the most important role in a company in the next five years." 4. User operations analyst For any company with an online presence, user experience is one of the most vital parts of the business. The only way to monitor that is to have someone in charge of the experience themselves. No matter if the company is blogging, has a Web site or pages on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, user operations analysts interact with users, answer queries, investigate problems and keep track of user habits. 5. Director of social media Similar to a strategist, companies need someone to organize company blogging, viral marketing, podcasting, etc. This person has a background in building teams and who really gets the promise and the purpose of social media, Durbin says. These folks should be wary of new technologies and be all over blogs, RSS, have Facebook and Twitter accounts, and know the difference between his or her employees playing and researching on MySpace and YouTube. Searching for social media jobs You might think that finding social media jobs is difficult but many of these positions under a variety of job titles that don't include "social media." Try searching job boards and the Internet for "social media," "interactive marketing," "new media" or "branding manager" and you should get a good start in the right direction.

   Commentary: Will Obama use 'Facebook politics'?Story Highlights Julian Zelizer: Obama is proposing ambitious initiatives on many fronts  He says getting 60 votes in the Senate for the programs will be a challenge  Web-based politics helped build support for Obama during the election, he says  Zelizer: This will be a test of whether "Facebook politics" is really powerful Next Article in Politics »   By Julian E. Zelizer Special to CNN 



 


 

   Editor's note: Julian E. Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School. He is completing a book on the history of national security politics since World War II, to be published by Basic Books. Zelizer writes widely on current events. 
Julian Zelizer says Obama's programs could be a key test of the power of Web-based political organizing. 
 PRINCETON, New Jersey (CNN) -- The battle over the federal budget is about to begin. President Obama has laid out an ambitious agenda.  He told Congress it would not be sufficient to stimulate the economy in the short-term: "Now is the time to act boldly and wisely -- to not only revive this economy, but to build a new foundation for lasting prosperity," Obama said.  "Now is the time to jump-start job creation, restart lending, and invest in areas like energy, health care, and education that will grow our economy, even as we make hard choices to bring our deficit down." As the president pushes for Congress to enact his budget, he is unlikely to receive much Republican support. The vote over the first economic stimulus bill revealed that partisanship is alive and well in Washington.   In addition, the budget proposal will open the president up to the familiar Republican attack of being a tax-and-spend liberal. Obama should not underestimate how effective such criticism can be. He can just ask Bill Clinton, who saw Republicans take over Congress in 1994 following the defeat of his health care proposal. President Obama's biggest problem is the Senate where Democrats do not have the 60 votes they need to end a filibuster. In the past few decades, the congressional minority has been able and willing to hold up almost any piece of legislation with the threat of a filibuster. Unlike earlier eras, the filibuster is no longer reserved for high profile legislation but instead is a normal tool of partisan warfare. Unlike in the House, where only a majority is required to pass a bill, in the Senate a small group of centrist Republicans and Democrats can play a commanding role. Last month, Sens. Nelson and Collins forced Obama's hand by convincing him to ask for much less spending than he believed necessary.

Special Report: Obama's first 100 days


In Depth: Commentaries


   Now the battle starts again. One of the most potentially powerful tools President Obama could use is the "netroots," which some think he can use to build pressure in the states where 19 Republican Senate seats will be in play in the 2010 midterm elections. Using what might be called "Facebook politics," the netroots could raise money to campaign against opponents of Obama's budget proposals. They might also encourage volunteers to explain and promote Obama's policies to their neighbors.  They could also provide a forum to counteract Republican attacks, and remind senators of the kind of voter turnout they might encounter in the midterm elections if they decide to stand in the way of Obama's program.  Of course, Republicans could counter with their own Web-based politics, but so far they have lagged behind the Democrats.   When Obama proposed the economic stimulus legislation in January, he didn't really use Facebook politics and instead relied on an inside-the-beltway approach. He let legislators hammer out the details without heavy-handed presidential intervention. Obama traveled around red states to build support for his plan, but not until after the deal was essentially done. (There was some advertising activity by groups such as MoveOn.Org in the home states of Republican senators, but coordination appears to have been limited.) Now comes the big test. If President Obama follows through on his promise of using the tools of his campaign for the challenges of governance, we will learn just how strong the netroots really is. The ambition for many who put this network together is to provide the same sort of political support that political machines offered in the late 19th and early 20th century -- organizational powerhouses that brought people into office and built support for their legislation. Obama's presidency will allow us to see whether the netroots can provide a viable alternative. The potential weakness of the netroots was recently captured in a BBC parody of Facebook, the social networking site. In the video, a young gentleman, Edward Baxter, opens his door and is greeted by a school mate named Todd. "We sat next to each other in math, we didn't get on, remember?" Todd reminds Edward. The schoolmate asks him to confirm or ignore, convincing the confused Edward to accept this request.   The video moves through a series of jokes that reveal how shallow these interactions can be, such as when Todd explains he can put embarrassing pictures for all of his "real friends" in his "proper life" to see. Asking if his mother is a friend, the classmate yells out "status update!" as another person writes all over the outer wall of the house. The satire is biting, unmasking the thinness of so much of our modern interaction. We don't know how much of this parody is true of the netroots. The stakes are high. If Obama can show that Facebook politics is as organizationally strong as the party politics of yesteryear, then he would on to something big. Not only would the president be able to tap into a powerful political army that could pressure legislators into supporting his agenda, but he very well could introduce a new paradigm for governance, one that would remain a model for future presidents. On the other hand, when he calls on the netroots to support him against those pesky senators, he might learn that many of his virtual supporters have already clicked onto another page. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.

  Secret Service investigating Facebook poll on ObamaStory HighlightsSite member built poll asking if president should be killedSocial networking site pulls third-party application that allows users to create polls Possible poll responses: "yes," "maybe," "if he cuts my health care" and "no"Facebook lets third-party developers create applications such as polls, quizzesNext Article in Politics »  Read VIDEO   



 


 

  (CNN) -- The social networking site Facebook on Monday pulled a third-party application that allows users to create polls after a site member built a poll asking if President Obama should be killed. 
There are more than 350,000 applications on Facebook. The company says it disables any that violate its terms. 
 The U.S. Secret Service, the agency assigned to protect the president, has launched an investigation, agency spokesman James Mackin said. "As is usually the case, our vigilant users reported it to us first," Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt told CNN. "The USSS [Secret Service] sent us an e-mail late this morning PDT asking us to take it down. At that point, it had already been removed, and we let them know."   Schnitt said the application "was immediately suspended while the inappropriate content could be removed by the developer and until such time as the developer institutes better procedures to monitor their user-generated content."  Watch report on Facebook poll » Facebook allows third-party developers to create applications -- such as polls and quizzes -- which are then made available to Facebook users, who use the applications to create specific content. Users may choose to make their content available to the general population of Facebook or limit it only to their friends.   In this case, Schnitt said, the user made the poll asking whether Obama should be killed available to the general public. 





 The possible responses to the poll were "yes," "maybe," "if he cuts my health care" and "no." Schnitt said the poll "appears to have been posted over the weekend."

   New Zealand police use Facebook to stop crimeStory Highlights Security camera records man unsuccessfully trying to break into a pub's safe  Becoming hot, he removed his balaclava and looked up right at the camera  Police posted the images on the popular social networking site, Facebook  By the next day, he was in custody, fingered by viewers who recognized him Next Article in Technology »   By  Saeed Ahmed CNN 



 


 

  (CNN) -- Police in southern New Zealand nabbed a would-be burglar after they posted security camera images of him trying to break into a safe on the popular social networking site, Facebook. 

Having removed his balaclava after his efforts made him hot, the would-be burglar looks up at a security camera. 


 The Queenstown police are calling it their first Facebook arrest. The police department created its online presence on the site just two months ago, said Constable Sean Drader. "It's pretty popular, isn't it, this site?" Drader told CNN Wednesday, surprised at the quick success. The 21-year-old masked man allegedly broke into a local pub through a roof early Monday morning and spent considerable time trying to crack open a safe using an angle grinder. "It's a very small room that he broke into, and it was hot weather. It's summer here," Drader said. "There are sparks flying all about him. And after about an hour, he gets too hot and takes his gloves and balaclava off." Unable to break open the safe, the man gave up and got ready to leave, Drader said. "He looks around to see if he's forgotten anything, and he looks up right at the camera. It was rather silly. We got a good look," he said. The police department posted the surveillance camera photos on its Facebook page. By the next day, the man was in custody, fingered by viewers who recognized him from the images on the site, and from TV segments on the Facebook posting. Police did not release the suspect's name, but said the Queenstown native is charged with two counts of burglary. Facebook, the Web's most popular social networking site, allows users to create personal profiles. They can then connect with one another, upload photos and share links. The site boasts more than 90 million active users. In November, Facebook helped a seafood restaurant owner in Melbourne identify five customers who dined on oysters, trout and expensive wine and then bolted without paying the US $323 bill. According to media reports, the owner remembered one of the diners asking about a former waitress. The waitress suggested the restaurateur look through her friend's list on Facebook. A quick scroll later, the owner spotted one of the bill dodgers.

   All in the Facebook family: older generations join social networksStory Highlights Women older than 55 make up the fastest-growing age group on Facebook  Expert says the site has hit a "tipping point," causing older people to join  Some older family members use the site to get in touch with younger generations  One mother says Facebook has become her family's "living room"Next Article in Technology »   By  John D. Sutter CNN 



 


 

  (CNN) -- Penny Ireland's family is so scattered around the world that Facebook, the popular social networking site, has become the family's No. 1 way to communicate. 

The fastest-growing age group on Facebook is women older than 55, Inside Facebook says. 


 "We call it our living room," the 56-year-old mother said by phone from her home in Houston, Texas. "Everybody can tell what everybody else is doing." "Everybody" includes Ireland's five kids and her 83-year-old mother, who has a Facebook profile she accesses daily, Ireland said. While online social networks like Facebook, Twitter and MySpace are known hang-outs for younger adults and teenagers, older generations in recent months have been taking to the medium at a faster rate than any other age group, according to industry reports.     Many of these older folks use social networks to keep tabs on younger family members and they often find fruitful connections with their peers after they've friended all of their kids and grandkids, according to an informal survey by Stanford University professor BJ Fogg. Join a conversation on this topic at CNN's Facebook page The trend is still relatively confined. Only about 7 percent of people older than 65 have online social-networking profiles, according to research from the Pew Internet & American Life Project.   But Facebook's popularity is growing most quickly among women older than 55, according to a site called Inside Facebook, which tracks Facebook's growth.

CNN's Facebook page


CNET: Facebook hits 200 million members


 There are now about 1.5 million female users older than 55 on the site, the group says -- roughly a 550 percent increase over six months ago. By comparison, membership among people younger than 25 grew by less than 20 percent over the same period, Inside Facebook says.   Facebook now says it has 200 million users, making its user base larger than the populations of all the world's countries except China, India, the United States and Indonesia. Such a vast presence, coupled with news media buzz about all social media, has pushed online social networking to a "tipping point," said Amanda Lenhart, a senior research specialist at the Pew Internet & American Life Project. Fogg, the Stanford instructor, said the trend has spread outward from college towns, where Facebook was first adopted, and inward from the American coasts. Facebook today has a global presence, with 70 percent of users living outside the U.S., the site says. "We've reached critical mass where there's been enough talk about Facebook and people have gotten so many invitations from their friends, they're going, 'OK, what is this Facebook thing? I've got to get onboard or I'm going to be left in the dust,' " Fogg said. Parents who are interested in their kids' online activities contribute to the sharp increase in older users on Facebook, said Linda Fogg-Phillips, a 49-year-old who, with her brother, co-taught a six-week class at Stanford called "Facebook for Parents." "Parents are finally at the point where they realize this is not going away. They better figure out how to get on it and they'd better figure out how to use it," said Fogg-Phillips, who is a mother of eight in Las Vegas, Nevada. "It's a snowball effect. It's viral in a good sense."   Older people often must overcome fears about privacy issues before they will join Facebook, Fogg-Phillips said. Once they do, they often find unexpected uses for the network, she said. iReport.com: Facebook, Twitter growing pains? That was the case for Craig Costa, a 55-year-old fly-fishing guide in Park City, Utah, who said family members forced him to join Facebook. Costa still finds parts of the site annoying, and isn't comfortable having his personal information made public, but he has connected with old friends he wouldn't have otherwise -- including his ex-wife, who now is a Facebook friend of his current wife. "It's been really interesting because so many people have a connection to me," he said. "I was married before and my wife is now talking to my ex-wife. And some of her old friends are telling old stories about me to my wife. It's just bizarre for me." Costa said he also can more easily keep up with his 28-year-old son, who lives in New York and also keeps a Facebook page for his dog. Karen Essman, 61, uses Facebook but said she has trouble convincing her peers to join social-networking sites. They often don't understand the interface or are afraid of scams, she said. "It's a little bit more difficult for older people," she said. Margaret Brooks, 63, of Idaho Falls, Idaho, joined the site because there was no other place for her to see her 18-year-old grandson's artwork. She asked to be his friend online, and at first she worried he wouldn't respond. "I did think, 'Oh my goodness, I'm old grandma. He doesn't want to have anything to do with grandma on Facebook,' " she said. "But he did, and every time I send something to him he sends something to me."  Joanne Woeppel joined Facebook so she could keep tabs on her 13 grandkids. But the Web site also has helped the 71-year-old keep up with other people without changing her routine. "I'm pretty much what you would call a loner. I'm content in my own company. I can find things to do to entertain myself that I don't need to be out and about," she said by phone from her three-bedroom house near Dallas, Texas. "I don't go out to socialize." A former call center worker and aspiring sci-fi author, Woeppel visits the online social network about once a day. Spending time on Facebook, which she joined in September, helps her feel connected to family all over the country -- especially to the youngsters, she said. She has family members who live nearby, but says she's found a way to communicate with them in their own language through Facebook. "Let's face it, kids that age aren't really interested in talking to people my age very much. It's more, 'Hi grandma how are ya? ... Bye!' " she said with a laugh. "That's basically what I get from my grandkids, so if I can engage them through just a little bit of chit-chat [online], it's a lot more than I can get over the phone."

  Facebook hit by phishing attacks for a second dayStory Highlights Facebook stopped a phishing attack Thursday, its second day of battling a worm   Worm lures people to a fake Facebook page and prompts them to log in  The page then steals their information when they type their username and password  Facebook spokesman: The attacks were stopped within a few hours in each case Next Article in Technology »   By Elinor Mills 



 


 

 
 (CNET) -- Facebook stopped a phishing attack on Thursday, its second day in a row of dealing with a worm on the site that lures people to a fake Facebook page and prompts them to log in. 
Facebook has faced two phishing attacks in the past two days but officials aren't sure whether they are related. 
 Unsuspecting Facebook users get a message from a friend urging them to "check this out" and including a link to a Web page that appears to be a Facebook log-in page, but it is a fake site that steals their information when they type in their username and password. The worm also sends a copy of the message to the infected Facebook member's contacts. In the latest attack, the Web address was "FBStarter.com." In Wednesday's attack, the address was "BAction.net." The attacks were stopped within a few hours in each case, said Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt. He said it was too early to say whether the two phishing attacks are related. "We are investigating," Schnitt said. Once Facebook learns of a phishing attack, either by members notifying the company or employees noticing that a URL is being distributed to a lot of people, the company deletes the URL from members' pages, blocks fresh postings, and removes the redirect to the URL that appears in e-mail messages, Schnitt said. Facebook also goes in and resets the passwords of member accounts that had been used to distribute the spam, he said.

 The company also alerts anti-fraud partner MarkMonitor, which passes the phishing URL on to the major browsers to block it and contacts ISPs to take the site down, according to Schnitt. To protect against phishing scams, Facebook users should make sure that the URL they are visiting says "www.facebook.com." If it doesn't use that domain it's likely to be spam. Also, members that are already logged in to Facebook will not be asked to log in again. "People should have a healthy dose of suspicion, and ask themselves 'why did I get logged out?'" Schnitt said. "If something looks a little strange you should check the address bar." Facebook users who think they have been affected by the scam should change their passwords and review their Facebook stream for any unauthorized changes. If they use their Facebook password for other sites, they should change those passwords as well.  And if they are using their Facebook authentication to log in to any other sites, they should check for any unauthorized changes on those sites.

  Marines ban Twitter, Facebook, other sitesStory Highlights U.S. Marine Corps bans Twitter, Facebook, MySpace and other social media sites  Order, issued Monday, states that information on the sites poses a security risk  The Marines' ban is effective immediately and will last a year  U.S. Army recently ordered all U.S. bases to provide access to Facebook Next Article in Technology »   By Noah Shachtman  



 


 

  (WIRED) -- The U.S. Marine Corps has banned Twitter, Facebook, MySpace and other social media sites from its networks, effective immediately. 
The Marine Corps fears that social media sites such as Facebook could pose a security risk. 
 "These internet sites in general are a proven haven for malicious actors and content and are particularly high risk due to information exposure, user generated content and targeting by adversaries," reads a Marine Corps order, issued Monday.  "The very nature of SNS [social network sites] creates a larger attack and exploitation window, exposes unnecessary information to adversaries and provides an easy conduit for information leakage that puts OPSEC [operational security], COMSEC [communications security], [and] personnel... at an elevated risk of compromise." The Marines' ban will last a year. It was drawn up in response to a late July warning from U.S. Strategic Command, which told the rest of the military it was considering a Defense Department-wide ban on the Web 2.0 sites, due to network security concerns.  Scams, worms, and Trojans often spread unchecked throughout social media sites, passed along from one online friend to the next.

 "The mechanisms for social networking were never designed for security and filtering. They make it way too easy for people with bad intentions to push malicious code to unsuspecting users," a Stratcom source told Wired.com. Yet many within the Pentagon's highest ranks find value in the Web 2.0 tools. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has 4,000 followers on Twitter. The Department of Defense is getting ready to unveil a new home page, packed with social media tools. The Army recently ordered all U.S. bases to provide access to Facebook. Top generals now blog from the battlefield. "OPSEC is paramount. We will have procedures in place to deal with that," Price Floyd, the Pentagon's newly-appointed social media czar, said.  "What we can't do is let security concerns trump doing business. We have to do business... We need to be everywhere men and women in uniform are and the public is. If that's MySpace and YouTube, that's where we need to be, too," Floyd said. The Marines say they will issue waivers to the Web 2.0 blockade, if a "mission critical need" can be proven. And they will continue to allow access to the military's internal "SNS-like services." But for most members of the Corps, access to the real, public social networks is now shut off for the next year.

  Facebook buys FriendFeed: Is this a big deal?Story Highlights Facebook founder admires FriendFeed's 'simple and elegant' service  Acquisition of FriendFeed brings over senior-level staff to Facebook  Facebook wants site to be more of a service to users, not a destination  FriendFeed service will operate normally until future plans are flushed outNext Article in Technology »   By  Caroline McCarthy 



 


 

 
 (CNET) -- Surprise! Facebook has acquired FriendFeed, a Bay Area-based social-network feed aggregation start-up. 
FriendFeed consolidates updates from social media and bookmarking sites, blogs and RSS feeds. 
 "Facebook and FriendFeed share a common vision of giving people tools to share and connect with their friends," FriendFeed co-founder Bret Taylor said in a release.  "We can't wait to join the team and bring many of the innovations we've developed at FriendFeed to Facebook's 250 million users around the world." TechCrunch reported the news on Monday, a matter of minutes before Facebook confirmed the acquisition. I'm going to go out on a limb and say it: This is not as ridiculously huge of a deal as the Silicon Valley hype machine is going to have you believe. Basically, FriendFeed has been coasting on a lot of hype and not a lot of mainstream recognition, and it's not a bit surprising that it would be seeking an exit at this point.

 Facebook acquired it for its talent; prior to FriendFeed, Taylor was part of the team that helped launch Google Maps. So the real story here is that Facebook made the rather expensive hire (and we don't know the terms of the deal) of some very talented former Googlers.  FriendFeed's co-founders "will hold senior roles on Facebook's engineering and product teams," according to the release, and the rest of the company's 12 employees will also join Facebook. This would also be consistent with Facebook's minimal past acquisition history: the company bought little-known start-up Parakey two years ago with the primary objective of getting its founders, the creators of the Firefox browser, on board.  It's also well-known that Facebook tried hard to acquire Twitter -- which would've been a far more significant acquisition than FriendFeed -- and was turned down. (Well, there was also ConnectU, whose assets Facebook acquired pretty much just to get that pesky lawsuit off the table.) The release from Facebook repeatedly hinted that this is about talent more than product. "Since I first tried FriendFeed, I've admired their team for creating such a simple and elegant service for people to share information," Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in the statement.  "As this shows, our culture continues to make Facebook a place where the best engineers come to build things quickly that lots of people will use." Yup. "As we spent time with Mark (Zuckerberg) and his leadership team, we were impressed by the open, creative culture they've built, and their desire to have us contribute to it," said FriendFeed co-founder Paul Buchheit, another ex-Googler who was instrumental in building Gmail.  "It was immediately obvious to us how passionate Facebook's engineers are about creating simple, groundbreaking ways for people to share, and we are extremely excited to join such a like-minded group." But Facebook director of product Christopher Cox said to CNET News later, "I wouldn't call it a talent acquisition."  He elaborated, "We really have a vision that's focusing on Facebook being not just a destination but being a service. ... We think FriendFeed's been focused on how that's going to work in an open way, and that's something we're excited about, not just the people but the product they've built." FriendFeed earned praise from prominent voices in Silicon Valley -- most notably Robert Scoble -- but its aim to aggregate all of a user's social networking activity feeds in one place didn't catch on with the mainstream.  But Facebook eventually began to mimic the FriendFeed model through upgrades to its central "news feed" feature, letting members pull in select third-party updates. Bret Taylor said that FriendFeed wasn't shopping itself around. "We weren't up for sale. We had a healthy amount of financing and a really efficient company," he told CNET News.  "As we noticed our products were really converging in terms of product vision, we started having casual conversations with Facebook." It's not clear what will happen to the FriendFeed service, because it sure sounds like Facebook is eager to get its team onto the engineering fast track. "FriendFeed.com will continue to operate normally for the time being," a post by Taylor on the FriendFeed blog read.  "We're still figuring out our longer term plans for the product with the Facebook team." Taylor elaborated more to CNET News later on Monday: "Anything that we would do would be more of a transition, not shutting down. I think our users have invested in our product by putting their data in it, sharing it with their friends. ...We absolutely wouldn't shut (FriendFeed) down."

  Facebook makes privacy changesStory Highlights Facebook to overhaul its privacy policy following Canadian investigation  Social network site will make it clearer for users to know what info is being shared Canadian Privacy Commissioner flagged third-party applications as privacy concern  New Facebook policy will mean user consent needed by all app developers Next Article in Technology »   By  Dean Irvine CNN 



 


 

  (CNN) -- Facebook has announced it is to overhaul its privacy settings to make it clearer for users to know who has access to their personal data.  
Facebook has agreed to update its privacy settings after a Canadian Privacy Commission report. 
 The news follows an investigation into the privacy policy of the social networking site by Canada's Privacy Commissioner.  The social networking site has agreed to make changes that it believes will provide its users with greater transparency and control over their personal information and how it is used.  "These changes mean that the privacy of 200 million Facebook users in Canada and around the world will be far better protected," said Canada's Privacy Commissioner Jennifer Stoddart in a press statement.  In July Stoddart issued an initial report on an investigation into Facebook that followed a complaint from a privacy advocacy group, the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic at the University of Ottawa.  The main concerns highlighted by the report were the lack of clarity over privacy settings and how much personal information is shared with third-party developers of applications such as games and quizzes.

 In response to the investigation Facebook has agreed to make "significant enhancements" over the next 12 months, WHO says. This would include clarifying its privacy policy so that users can clearly understand why personal information like date of birth is requested, the difference between deactivating and deleting an account, and how its advertising works.  Another key amendment is that Facebook will retrofit its application platform in order to prevent developers from accessing users' personal information -- unless users provide explicit consent.  "Application developers have had virtually unrestricted access to Facebook users' personal information. The changes Facebook plans to introduce will allow users to control the types of personal information that applications can access," Stoddart said in her statement.  Work on the planned changes will begin immediately, although Facebook has said some changes will take some time before they are visible. Updates to Facebook's privacy policy will require a notice and comment period for users.  It has also said the changes to how users share information with third-party applications will require time and resources, both for the updating and testing of the new Facebook application platform and for third-party application developers to reprogram and test their applications.  "We will be communicating regularly with developers about the changes and we're going to take our time to make sure the outcome is something users understand and that developers have ample time and notice to adapt," Ethan Beard, Director of Platform Product Marketing at Facebook, said in a statement.  Elliot Schrage, Vice President of Global Communications and Public Policy at Facebook, added in a prepared statement that the changes would "provide even greater transparency and control for Facebook users.  "We believe that these changes are not only great for our users and address all of the Commissioners' outstanding concerns, but they also set a new standard for the industry."

 Facebook unveils privacy changes    Facebook changes being rolled out on Thursday shake up how users control their privacy. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Pop-up on Thursday asks Facebook users to change their privacy settings   Some users dislike how much information is made public to non-friends unless they make changes  More popular is the new ability to decide on every post who gets to see it  Blog calls the changes "Facebook's answer to Twitter"

Information Privacy

 (CNN) -- A large pop-up box will greet Facebook users logging on to the social-networking site on Thursday, asking them to modify their privacy settings. The company says the changes will help streamline privacy controls that have confused many of its 350 million users and were sprawled over six separate pages.  What is getting the thumbs-down Complaints have started flowing in, focusing on three areas: The changes treat as "publicly available information" the following: your name, profile picture, current city, gender and networks, and the pages you're a fan of. Until now, you had the option of restricting much of that information. That option has been removed.  The ramifications, as the nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation sees them: "For example, you might want to join the fan page of a controversial issue (like a page that supports or condemns the legalization of gay marriage), and let all your personal friends see this on your profile, but hide it from your officemates, relatives or the public at large." You cannot do so now. The foundation says: "These changes are especially worrisome because even something as seemingly innocuous as your list of friends can reveal a great deal about you. In September, for example, an MIT study nicknamed 'Gaydar' demonstrated that researchers could accurately predict a Facebook user's sexual orientation simply by examining the user's friends list."  Facebook counters that a user's friends list can be made nonviewable. But it is either viewable by all or by no one. Another source of consternation is Facebook apps, such as the quizzes developed by third parties that many users are fond of taking. Until now, Facebook provided an option so you could specify that your information not be shared with others when one of your friends adds such an app. But now, whenever a friend adds an app, your "publicly available information" becomes accessible to the developer. So why did Facebook undertake the changes?  The Weblog TechCrunch explains it this way: If a user retains the "Everyone" option, the information is accessible by the Web at large. "In short, this is Facebook's answer to Twitter. ... That means Facebook can leverage it for real-time search, and can also syndicate it to other places, like Google and Bing. The feature has been available in the site's privacy settings since last summer, but most people didn't use it (and probably didn't even know it was there). The new privacy launch today puts this as the default option for many users." The changes have met with mixed reaction. By early Thursday, more than 2,700 users had approved of the changes on the Facebook blog. But about 700 people said they were unhappy. "The new setting[s] are ridiculous," commented user Victoria Anne Archer. "I have less control than before and my friends are visible to everyone ... I can't hide them ... but I have no choice ... because if I select only friends ... then NO ON[E] CAN FIND ME!" What is getting the thumbs-up The most commended aspect of the new settings is that they allow users to micromanage who can access every bit of information on the site. One way to do so is to separate your friends into lists and grant those lists varying levels of accessibility. For example, if you would rather your bosses not know what you do on downtime, you can place them on a specially created list. In addition, a user can specify accessibility post by post. After each status update you type or photo you post, you can pick from a drop-down menu whether you want that item visible to everyone, to just your friends, or to friends of friends as well.  How to access the changes The new controls will be available under the "Settings" link at the top right of every page, in addition to being available in the dialogue box. For each section -- profile information, contact information, applications and search -- users will be asked to pick from three options about who can access the information: Friends, Friends of friends, or Everyone. The changes do away with "regional networks," which let users designate themselves as residents of a geographic area. But Facebook is retaining school- and company-based networks. It is worth noting that many users will find their privacy options set at "Recommended settings" by default. If you retain those, your information will be available to everyone. If you would rather the site not share your information publicly, you will need to click through each section and restrict it to "Friends" only. This applies for photos as well. A user will have to specify album by album how much access to grant others. In addition, you will have to go under "Search" and specify whether you want Facebook to make your information available to users who look for you on Facebook and on the Web.

 Los Angeles, California (CNN) --  The beating of 12-year-old boy by a group of classmates at a Southern California middle school may be linked to a Facebook posting encouraging kids to target redheads, authorities say. The redheaded boy was beaten up by a group of seventh and eighth graders at A.E. Wright Middle School in Calabasas in two separate incidents Friday, according to a statement released Sunday by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. A Facebook page stating that Friday was "Kick a Ginger Day," referring to redheads and possibly inspired by an episode of the "South Park" series, may have sparked the injuries at the middle school, authorities said. The boy's injuries were not serious, and no one has been arrested, authorities said Sunday.

   Facebook flashmob shuts down stationStory Highlights Thousands take part in silent disco "flashmob" at London's Liverpool Street station  Event, which imitated phone company advert, was organized over Facebook  22-year-old organizer now planning a bigger flashmob event in Trafalgar Square Next Article in World »    



 


 

  LONDON, England (CNN) -- Thousands of dancers jammed a major London train station in a Facebook-driven "flashmob" mimicking an advertisement for a phone company. And the event last Friday evening was so successful that another is planned for next Friday in Trafalgar Square in central London. Plus, a group has been set up to organize another one at Liverpool Street Station a week later. Videos posted on the social-networking site showed Liverpool Street Station completely filled with people, counting down the seconds until the clock showed 7 p.m., then dancing to music on their mp3 players as the hour struck. The sheer scale of the event came as a complete surprise to the organizer, a 22-year-old Facebook user who identified himself only as Crazzy Eve. "I was watching TV and the T-Mobile advertisement came up and I thought, hm, let's get my friends down to Liverpool Street and do a little dance," he told CNN by phone. He posted the event on Facebook and invited his friends, who invited their friends, he said, and so on until thousands of people had been told of the plan.   "At a quarter to seven people just flocked into the station like someone opened a plughole and the water went out," he said. "They just kept coming in like sheep. As it grew and grew, I just thought, 'This is going to be huge.'" iReport.com: Were you there? Send your photos and video His main memory of the event is "the volume of people -- you couldn't see the floor," he said. He left after 15 minutes -- the scheduled ending time -- for fear of the police, he said, adding that he had deleted his name from the event Web site and refused to identify himself to CNN for the same reason. "The entire main concourse was packed full of people dancing, cheering and screaming," said CNN's Simon Hooper, who was passing through the station on his way home. "There were camera flashes going off constantly. There were also loads of people crammed around the edge of the upper level of the station, looking down at the scene below. "There were a lot of bemused commuters wandering around the edges, trying to get to their trains but nobody seemed to mind too much. Everyone seemed pretty good humored," he said. "I think a lot of people who pass through Liverpool Street regularly are getting used to this sort of thing." British Transport Police also described it as "mainly a good humored event," adding "No arrests were made and no crimes were reported." Police did not have an immediate estimate of the crowd size, but more than 14,000 people joined the Facebook group "Liverpool Street Station Silent Dance."  "It was both good cause we all stuck like a group didn't stop dancing inside and outside but bad cause of the people who could get anywhere but hey I love it WE MADE HISTORY RIGHT THERE!!" one Facebook user said on the event's Web site. "Yeah I agree, there wasn't any bad feelings there. Everybody just had a good time, apart from my friend being groped by some guy, but you'll always get one," another wrote. The T-Mobile commercial which inspired the event shows several hundred people dancing in the station. The dancing in the advertisement appears to be spontaneous but was actually choreographed. It was filmed January 15 and has been widely broadcast since then. The success of the event has prompted Crazzy Eve to call for another silent dance at Trafalgar Square in central London on February 13. A group has been set up to organize another one at Liverpool Street Station a week later. The station has a large open space with a balcony surrounding it. User videos shot from the balcony and posted on Facebook showed every available inch of space filled with people, many of them cheering, though the event was billed as "silent."   Flashmobs -- groups of people meeting and all doing the same thing together in public, from dancing to freezing in place -- have become increasingly regular events around the world. iReport.com: See an organized mass pillowfight in Taiwan London's Tate Modern art museum was the scene of a flashmob dance in 2007, and hundreds of people froze in place in Trafalgar Square, then formed a conga line in 2008. Charlie Todd, a comedian and founder of the New York group Improv Everywhere, which organizes flashmobs, says the point of the group's "missions" is simple. "We get satisfaction from coming up with an awesome idea and making it come to life," he writes on the group's Web site. "In the process we bring excitement to otherwise unexciting locales and give strangers a story they can tell for the rest of their lives. We're out to prove that a prank doesn't have to involve humiliation or embarrassment; it can simply be about making someone laugh, smile, or stop to notice the world around them."

   Facebook users wage condom campaign against PopeStory Highlights Facebook users plan to send condoms to Pope Benedict XVI  Pope Benedict XVI recently said condoms are not the answer to stop HIV/AIDS  Vatican has long opposed use of condoms, other forms of birth control Next Article in World »   By  Faith Karimi CNN 



 


 

  (CNN) -- Critics took to the social networking site Facebook to voice their fury over Pope Benedict's remark that condoms do not prevent HIV. 

Pope Benedict XVI's anti-condom comments have raised the ire of some Facebook users. 


 Thousands have pledged to send the pontiff millions of condoms to protest the controversial comment he made to journalists as he flew to Cameroon last week. "You can't resolve it with the distribution of condoms," the pope told reporters. "On the contrary, it increases the problem."  Pope Benedict XVI has made it clear he intends to uphold the traditional Catholic teaching on artificial contraception. The Vatican has long opposed the use of condoms and other forms of birth control and encourages sexual abstinence to fight the spread of the disease.  About a dozen Facebook groups have sprung up, mostly from European countries, criticizing the pontiff.   "The clergy aren't supposed to have sex at all, but they are free to tell people how to conduct themselves? That's like a girl who wears no make-up as the CEO of CoverGirl," one member posted on the page, "Condoms for Pope Benedict XVI." "It frightens me that a man who has devoted his life to moral guidance ... and is undeniably a learned, intelligent man can be at the same time so narrow-minded, bigoted and irresponsible," posted another person on a different page.

 The online campaign added another voice to a deluge of criticism, which includes the governments of France, Germany and Belgium. Aid agencies and other health organizations have also chimed in. The Lancet, a British medical journal, urged the pope Saturday to issue a retraction for the "outrageous and wildly inaccurate" statement to journalists aboard his plane. "When any influential person, be it a religious or political leader, makes a false scientific statement that could be devastating to the health of millions of people, they should retract or correct the public record," The Lancet said in an editorial. "Anything less from Pope Benedict would be an immense disservice to the public and health advocates, including many thousands of Catholics, who work tirelessly to try and prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS worldwide." Some in the Catholic Church have rallied to the pontiff's support.   Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco, head of the Italian Bishops Conference, told Times Online in Britain that Benedict was simply pointing out that condoms "had not solved and could not solve the AIDS problem." Despite the controversy, the pope's pilgrimage spurred excitement in Africa. An estimated 1 million people turned out to hear him preach a Mass in Angola on Sunday, the last major event of his trip. He spoke of the need for reconciliation in the country, which has endured a brutal civil war. "Look to the future with hope, trust in God's promises and live in his truth. In this way you will build something that will stand and endure," he said.

 The ultimate guide to proper Facebooking 

By Simcha Whitehill, The Frisky     Keep your Facebook both fun to use and appropriate for family to read. STORY HIGHLIGHTSMaintain your Facebook by deleting incriminating photos and postsDon't update too frequently -- once a day is more than enoughIf you've had a bad breakup, don't delete an ex-boyfriend or ex-girlfriend from your page
RELATED TOPICS


Facebook Inc.

Internet

Social Software and Tagging

Technology

 (The Frisky) -- Social networking on the Internet is the easiest way to keep in touch with your pals, tell people what you're up to without, you know, talking to them, promote your parties, and bask in your buddies' love.  Back in the day, MySpace was like the Wild West -- you could post, do, and say anything you wanted. Heck, it turned hussies like Tila Tequila into "stars" with their own TV shows. But now everyone -- including our parents -- has jumped on the Facebook bandwagon. (It's so mainstream there's already a scripted movie about the start of Facebook, "The Social Network," which opened last week.) So how do you keep your page fun to use yet still appropriate for your family and co-workers to read? Here are 8 important tips: The Frisky: 10 celebs who showed way too much in Twitter pics 1. Tag, you're it! Every time someone posts a picture of me with my eyes closed, a chubby double chin, sweat stains, and a face full of runny mascara, I want to die and/or kill them. But, luckily, it's easy to do some easy damage control. Simply click on the offensive pic, then remove the tag. 2. Don't drink and type After a fun-filled party night, you're all amped! Then you come home and surf the Internet because you're not ready to go to bed. It's only natural. But beware! Perusing Facebook is one thing; trying to drunkenly express yourself in a comment or befriending someone you wouldn't if you were sober is another.  So look but don't touch your page or your friends' pages when you're loaded. You don't want to wake up with a hangover and a rude awakening from something stupid you wrote. The Frisky: Angelina Jolie joins Twitter 3. Do not delete exes Sure, you want to get rid of them from your life physically, but unfriending them after you've established Internet friendship makes you look pathetic and bitter. Besides, if they're obsessed enough with you to check your page, let them stalk away.  After all, it's as close to you as they'll ever get again. And if you manage your page right, you'll always be there looking good -- the best revenge you could possibly have. But there IS an exception to every rule, so of course, if your ex is like OJ Simpson, you should for sure delete him. 4. Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes Everyone modifies their interests, hobbies, and headlines. And sure, updating your status is a great way to draw attention to your page, but you don't want negative attention.  Never click update more than once in a day. Nothing makes you look more like a paranoid, obsessed loser than changing your info multiple times in the stretch of mere hours -- nothing is private on Facebook, including the frequency of your activity. So commit to your changes and let them go, at least a little while, before you change them again. The Frisky: 10 biggest Facebook dating mistakes 5. Manage your image Don't empty your camera memory card onto your page. Your photo album shouldn't have 200 snapshots of you from last Halloween in a barely there costume.  Edit the way you want to be seen, especially now that many employers dig into their potential hires' personal info by looking them up online. Keep your sexy self-portraits a secret. A couple shots with cleavage are OK, but, overall, keep it pretty low-key and tame. 6. Keep it classy You have the right to choose what is printed about you on the Internet. If someone posts a comment about something wild you did back in college, you can and should erase it!  Save that stuff in your memory bank for reunions, because those are inside jokes; otherwise, the joke will be on you when it hits the public domain. And, in turn, when you write on someone's page about something crazy they did, it's guilt by association -- so don't incriminate yourself! The Frisky: 13 super annoying ways people abuse Facebook and Twitter 7. Post-personality Your page should look and sound like you. Post a couple pics with cool cultural references, fill in your faves, and don't be afraid to be funny. It's cool to see what music, TV shows, and YouTube videos you have in common with your friends.  But, reading your interests shouldn't take as long as War and Peace. Trim down your likes to the essentials. With everyone from potential bosses to potential boyfriends scouring the web for dirt, why not broadcast the best version of yourself; they have plenty of time down the road to see your dark side. 8. Stay away from strangers The Internet is a great matchmaker. And, sure, that hot guy who friend-requested you may seem totally cool, but if you don't know him or his band, it's best not to accept him into your inner Facebook circle. Who knows what he'll do once he has carte blanche on your page!  Granted, these people will probably just spam you, but still, why give them the access? And just because you have friends in common doesn't mean you have to accept them. Don't give in to peer pressure! If you don't know them, you don't know them. Be more discriminating than the "friends" you have in common.TM & © 2010 TMV, Inc. | All Rights Reserved

 Can Facebook get you fired? Playing it safe in the social media world By  Stephanie Chen, CNN  Dare to trash your boss on Facebook?STORY HIGHLIGHTS A Connecticut woman was fired for posting comments about her boss on Facebook  Social media experts say Facebook messages involving the workplace should remain positive  Employees should restrict who they let into social networks

 (CNN) -- Rants about your boss or your job may have once been reserved for during after-work drinks at a bar, but employee gripes are now being voiced in the social media sphere. Workplace complaints posted on popular sites such as Facebook, Twitter and MySpace could get you fired. But one federal agency has taken an unusual step to protect one complaining worker. The National Labor Relations Board issued a complaint against a Connecticut ambulance service company after it fired a worker for posting unflattering and sometimes vulgar comments about her boss on Facebook. The organization accused the company of illegally terminating Dawnmarie Souza and denying her access to union representation during an investigatory review. The federal agency is arguing that Souza's criticism of her boss on Facebook is generally "a protected concerted activity."  But workers should still be wary about what they post on social media sites. About a quarter of employers surveyed by the Society of Corporate Compliance and Ethics in 2009 had disciplined an employee for improper activities on social networking sites. If a worker posts something negative, and a manager finds it, he or she can legally be fired, some employment attorneys say. CNN asked experts on social media etiquette in the workplace: How can you engage in online forums without losing your job? 1. Think before you post Imagine if the comment you posted or tweeted will appear in the local newspaper the next day, says Tyson B. Snow, an employment attorney at Manning Curtis Bradshaw & Bednar LLC in Utah. While that rule of thumb may sound extreme, Snow says it is a safe way to manage your content.  On a social media site, the audience is unlimited, and the content is permanent. An employee may post one photo and quickly remove it, but someone could still archive the page or make a copy, he says. 2. Be picky about who you friend Only allow people you trust into your social network, says Shanti Atkins, president of ELT Inc., an ethics and compliance training company. Instead of casually accepting all the co-workers or managers who ask to friend you, be selective about who you allow to view your posts.  Atkins says employees may forget who they let into their network and that could lead to problems later on. 3. Do it on your own time and computer Try to limit your Facebook and Twitter activity to your personal computer, several experts say. If you engage in problematic activity on the company property and time, this can provide the managers more leverage, say several workplace experts.  Many employers and workplaces already ban the sites at the workplace to prevent social media spats from becoming an issue. 4. Watch what you post at home Many workers are unaware that mentioning their company in a negative light on the internet -- even if it's done on personal time at home -- could lead to disciplinary measures, says John Lusher, a social media consultant. He says many organizations have departments that monitor social media comments and photographs that pertain to the company. 5. Keep the dialogue positive Social media can be a great way to foster conversations about an employee's recent promotion or a company event, says Josh Whitford, president of Echelon Media, a company that specializes in social media. But, he says, certain topics such as trade secrets should never be disclosed online. 6. Figure out privacy settings Social media privacy settings may be tricky, but take the time to consider all the different settings, says Shanti Atkins, at ELT Inc. She suggests implementing filters and grouping co-workers and bosses so that certain information does not reach everyone. 7. Learn your employee rights Employees need to make the effort to understand corporate policy regarding the use social media at work and at home, says Tyson Snow, an employment attorney. However, most companies don't have such policies in place. Only 10 percent of companies had specific polices to deal with social networking sites, according to The Society of Corporate Compliance and Ethics.

 'Facebook politics' is fleeting By Julian E. Zelizer, Special to CNN      STORY HIGHLIGHTSJulian Zelizer: Tea Party adept at "Facebook politics," rallying supporters via cyberspaceObama, Democrats had same success, but since election, Web support is down, he writesHe says Twitter, Facebook can't sustain a movement when election drama is overFacebook politics lacks local element and commitment crucial to politics, Zelizer saysEditor's note: Julian E. Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. He is the author of "Arsenal of Democracy" and a book on former President Carter and editor of a book  assessing former President George W. Bush's administration, to be published this fall by Princeton University Press.  (CNN) -- The Tea Party has rekindled excitement in the potential of the internet to nurture mass political movements by using the Web to raise money and mobilize manpower.  Activists have used many aspects of cyberspace: Facebook pages, Twitter feeds, iPod apps and more to rally their supporters. According to Investors.com, "Democrats and their allies dominated cyberspace for years. Now the political right, with the Tea Party explosion, at the very least is matching the left." The stories about the Tea Party movement resemble the narrative about Barack Obama's campaign. In 2008, Democrats used cyberspace to the same effect. Relying on what I called "Facebook politics," the Democrats took Republicans by surprise by demonstrating how powerful a vehicle the internet could be in promoting a candidacy, bringing like-minded citizens together and offering an organizational infrastructure for movement politics. Yet will this form of organizing work over the long term? Can it sustain a movement after the drama of an election is over? The verdict is still out. Since 2008, President Obama and Democrats have discovered that the kind of movement created by the internet can be extraordinarily fragile and fleeting. When Obama recently spoke to students at the University of Wisconsin, he implored them not to be apathetic and urged them to return to the world of campaigns.

In doing so, he was acknowledging that the movement created by the campaign had disintegrated since the inauguration. The movement has been largely absent from the policy battles that have shaped his administration, and it lags in the months leading into 2010. Obama's team may still have all the cell numbers that they collected before announcing their vice presidential pick, but few people are answering or texting. What makes Facebook politics vulnerable is that it lacks the local element that has always been so crucial to politics. The most durable forms of political organization have usually depended on local organizing. During the 19th century, political parties were dependent on a dense bottom-up structure rooted in the strength of local political machines. After Election Day, party operatives continued to remain in close contact with voters. They worked hard -- sometimes through illegal means but very often through policy and straightforward patronage -- to retain their loyalty and make sure voters were kept abreast of why their party mattered. The social movements of 20th-century America depended on local organization as well. Malcolm Gladwell recently recounted in The New Yorker that the civil rights movement of the 1960s depended on local activists such as the four African-American students who sat in an all-white Woolworth's lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina, and demanded service. Their personal ties and friendship, as well as their shared experiences, inspired them to work together and risk their lives for this bigger cause. The movement spread as students throughout the state and in other regions joined the cause. Over the next few years, activists from the North would travel into Southern states and join the civil rights cause. It was the experience of directly participating in the struggles and witnessing the kind of racism that existed that forged their connection to the movement. Conservatism in the 1970s was forged through similar dynamics. Ronald Reagan did not make modern conservatism. Rather, thousands of local activists around the country who interacted through church groups, civic organizations and even reading clubs gave rise to the modern right. It was their face-to-face encounters in places such as Orange County, California, and the shared memory of influencing political leaders and public policy that made these Americans so loyal and willing to continue participating in these struggles over time. Facebook politics seems different. The cost of participating is much less. National conversations are as powerful, if not more powerful, than local networks. The experience of being in such a movement is often virtual, requiring nothing but a few clicks on a keyboard. Some of the potential weaknesses of Facebook politics can be seen with the new darling of the Tea Party movement, Delaware Senate candidate Christine O'Donnell. Although O'Donnell has been omnipresent in the national media, she has been notably absent where it matters most, Delaware.  Matt Bai recently wrote in The New York Times that O'Donnell reflects the modern political strategy in that her campaign barely exists at the state level. Conservatives from all over the country helped boost her image and reputation online and through television and radio, but she has barely had any public events in the state. Republican leaders in Wilmington didn't know where she was campaigning. Despite her surprise win, she is way behind the Democrat in the polls. Without question, Facebook politics has reshaped the political landscape. Local candidates can rake in millions of dollars within days, and they can spread their name without anyone going door-to-door or holding fundraisers in the local Holiday Inn. But Obama has already learned that this kind of organization can leave successful candidates without their base of support once the excitement of Election Day is over. It is far too easy for the most fervent supporter of a candidate or cause to simply defriend the movement and move on to something else. Rather than strong, shared memories of participating in something bigger than themselves, the experience might just leave behind the address of a Web page in the auto-fill mechanism of their browser or an occasional text alert to remind them of their political past. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian Zelizer.

 Senators urge Facebook to change privacy settingsBy  Eric Kuhn, CNN Audience Interaction Producer   Is Facebook compromising your privacy?STORY HIGHLIGHTSDemocrats express concerns in letter to Facebook CEOThey say users shouldn't have to opt out of new partnershipsFacebook says changes allow for more personalization
RELATED TOPICS


Facebook Inc.

U.S. Federal Trade Commission

 Washington (CNN) -- Four Democratic senators called on Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday to reconsider the recent changes in its privacy settings and asked the Federal Trade Commission to streamline guidelines regarding privacy on all social networks. "Now, users have less control over private information, and it was done without the users' permission," Sen. Charles Schumer, D-New York, said on Capitol Hill. Schumer and Sens. Michael Bennet of Colorado, Mark Begich of Alaska and Al Franken of Minnesota sent a letter to Zuckerberg about Facebook's decision to allow third-party sharing of users' information. "We are writing to express our concern regarding recent changes to the Facebook privacy policy and the use of personal data on third party websites," the senators wrote. "The expansion of Facebook -- both in the number of users and applications -- raises new concerns for users who want to maintain control over their information." Last week, Facebook began a "small pilot program" with Microsoft Docs.com, Pandora and Yelp that would offer personalized experiences when visiting those sites.  "These partners have been given access to public information on Facebook -- such as names, friend lists and interests and likes -- to personalize your experience when you're logged into Facebook and visit their sites," Austin Haugen, a Facebook product manager, wrote on the network's blog. The senators specifically took issue with the changes because the new settings require users to "opt out" if they do not want to share any information. "The way to go is opt-in," Schumer said. "The default position should be that the information is not shared, not that the information is shared."  Amplifying his colleagues' concerns, Schumer called on Facebook to "reverse its policy so that users have to opt in to shared data, rather than opt out."  The New York Democrat added, "The onus here should be on Facebook, not the user." Franken emphasized the difficulty for users to opt out under the current settings, saying he would "read what you have to do to opt out, but we really only have so much time." Bennet, who was a superintendent of the Denver, Colorado, Public Schools before being appointed to the Senate, expressed concerns about children not understanding the privacy issues. "We want to make sure that when it comes to the very important question of privacy, that the users of these websites are in control of their most personal information," he said. "This is an evolutionary technology. There is a huge amount of benefit that comes from Facebook and companies like Facebook. But we have to be vigilant to protect the information that is in a sense personal." Facebook defended its privacy policies in a letter to Schumer before Tuesday's news conference. Elliot Schrage, Facebook's vice president of global communications, said the changes allow for enhanced personalization and social activity while providing users with the ability to limit who is able to view their information. "Facebook is designed to give people the tools to control their information online and our highest priority is to keep and build the trust of the more than 400 million people who use our service," Schrage wrote. "These goals were central in the development of the new products we announced last week. Specifically, these new products and features are designed to enhance personalization and promote social activity across the Internet while continuing to give users unprecedented control over what information they share, when they want to share it, and with whom. All of Facebook's partner sites interact with a user's consent." Schumer also called on the FTC to streamline guidelines on all social networks to allow users to easily understand privacy settings when signing up for sites. Peter Corbett, CEO of iStrategy Labs, said Facebook's privacy policies are common among digital companies and websites. "The onus is on the user to opt out of data collection for every major site," said Corbett, whose firm consults for major brands on digital strategy.  Corbett noted that Google collects search information and Amazon collects a detailed analysis of what books and music its consumers are browsing to recommend other products. "Most users probably don't understand how to opt out, nor care," Corbett said. "They want an easy way to buy books on Amazon or connect with friends on Facebook. We have sacrificed privacy for convenience." CNN has a business relationship with Facebook that allows CNN.com users to recommend and share stories with their Facebook friends. This kind of arrangement is not what the senators expressed concern about.CNN's Evan Glass contributed to this report.

 Klitschko challenges Haye via Facebook   Klitschko wants fight with HayeSTORY HIGHLIGHTSWladimir Klitschko wants fellow world boxing champion David Haye to agree to a fight a heavyweight showdownUkrainian uses social networking site Facebook to challenge the British boxerKlitschko accuses Haye of "running away" from him and older brother VitaliHaye defended his WBA title with a knockout victory against John Ruiz this month (CNN) -- Wladimir Klitschko has used a social networking site to challenge fellow world boxing champion David Haye to a heavyweight showdown. The Ukrainian posted a video message on his Facebook page taunting Britain's WBA title holder, and then released it to the media on Monday. Haye is widely expected to take on IBF and WBO champion Wladimir or his brother Vitali, the WBC belt holder, following his successful defense against American John Ruiz earlier this month. Vitali revealed last month that the Germany-based siblings will toss a coin to see who fights Haye, and Wladimir has upped the stakes by claiming that the London-born boxer has been running scared of them. 
I am officially calling you out to fight me. You can't run away from me forever--Wladimir Klitschko

Last year, Haye pulled out of a fight with Wladimir due to injury and then pulled out of talks with Vitali before claiming the WBA crown from giant Russian Nikolai Valuev. "I want to send this message to boxing fans and directly to David Haye," the 34-year-old Wladimir said.  "David, you've bitched out on fighting both Klitschko brothers twice already and now is the time to make it happen. On behalf of the boxing fans around the world, I am officially calling you out to fight me.  "You can't run away from me forever, and you need to follow through with this fight to get respect. I'm ready -- what are you waiting for?"  Wladimir returned from a hand injury last month to knock out American challenger Eddie Chambers in their delayed bout, while the 38-year-old Vitali next faces Poland's Albert Sosnowski on May 29.

 The Facebook games that millions love (and hate)By  Doug Gross, CNN    STORY HIGHLIGHTS Zynga games like FarmVille, Mafia Wars are played by millions every day on Facebook  Expert says social gaming succeeds by appealing to women, other non-traditional gamers  Zynga founder says key to success was games that can be played during conference call  Backlash leads to FB group of 5 million saying they're tired of seeing games  (CNN) -- Early each morning, millions of farmers around the world rise to toil in their fields. By night, gangs of mobsters scheme and legions of poker players shuffle up and deal. Sure, none of it's real. But the overwhelming popularity of so-called social gaming -- simple games that let people play with their friends on networking sites such as Facebook -- is changing the face of video games, experts say. And as the maker of popular titles like FarmVille and Mafia Wars, San Francisco, California-based Zynga has ridden the games' skyrocketing popularity to the top of that emerging market. For Zynga founder Mark Pincus, the formula for gaming success on Facebook, MySpace and other sites was as simple as it might seem counterintuitive: create simple games that people like but can easily set aside. "We built the games so they could be played in a tab on your browser while you're on a conference call," said Pincus, a veteran Web entrepreneur who created Zynga in 2007. Of course, they've been helped by the massive growth of Facebook, where the games are so popular they've spawned "fan" pages devoted to complaining about having to watch friends play them. Facebook, with its 400 million users, is where the vast majority of people play FarmVille and Mafia Wars along with other Zynga titles like FishVille, Vampires, Café World, YoVille and Zynga Poker. In all, more than 65 million people play Zynga games every day, according to media tracking company Developer Analytics. 
   More than 75 million people a month play FarmVille, Zynga's most popular title. 
Zynga's top title, FarmVille, is played by an estimated 75 million people each month --  roughly equal to the number who have played the classic arcade and desktop game Tetris during its entire existence. The massive growth was satisfying but not altogether surprising to Pincus, whose previous startups had included Freeloader, a Web-based information-gathering service; tech-support company SupportSoft; and Tribe.net, an early social networking site from 2003. He said that starting the game company, which he named after his late English bulldog, was an effort to fill what he considered a surprising void in most people's daily Internet use. "I thought in 2007 that something had gone oddly wrong with the whole Internet experience," Pincus said. "I would have thought games would have been one of the top two or three experiences people had on the Internet." What Pincus got right, according to gaming expert Scott Steinberg, was a sort of return to the "golden era" of games like Pac-man and Super Mario Bros. "Video games actually appealed to a huge cross-section. They appealed to everybody," said Steinberg, publisher of DigitalTrends.com. "What happened is, as we went through the mid-'80s to the mid-2000s, you started to see gaming become more incestuous in terms of 18- to 34-year-old males making games for people just like them." 
   Zynga games like Café World draw much higher rates of female players than most video games. 
By contrast, three of Zynga's top five games -- FarmVille, Café World and FishVille -- have mostly female players, with many players outside the traditional 18- to 34-year-old range.  Those games all operate on the same basic premise. Starting with a simple farm, fish tank or restaurant, the player works to make it bigger and fancier, sharing items with friends and helping each other along the way. Some of Zynga's early titles simply mirrored existing board and card games. It was Mafia Wars -- in which players team up to whack other gangs -- that first exhibited what would become the hallmarks of social gaming: simple, single-player action that's enhanced by teamwork. With FarmVille, that formula would become complete. Players plant virtual crops that can be harvested hours, or days, later. Along the way, they invite online friends to become their neighbors and help each other by sending gifts or helping with the farming. There's no way to "win," but players take satisfaction in building big, fancy farms that they can showcase to their friends. "A farm is something that is internationally understood and known. It's cross-cultural, cross-gender, cross-age," Pincus said. "A great social game should be like a great cocktail party. If you want it to appeal to absolutely everyone you invite, it has to be broad in its content so that everyone gets it." Not that Zynga's success has come without criticism.  
   Mafia Wars is popular but prompted claims that it was a knock-off. 
With hundreds of smaller companies vying for a piece of the social gaming market, some rivals have accused Zynga of using its hefty venture capital to crowd out less-financed competitors. Many of its most popular games, including FarmVille, are similar to pre-existing games from smaller companies, a fact Pincus dismisses by noting that video games have always fallen into genres with similar titles from competing companies.  Psycho Monkey LLC, the makers of Mob Wars, filed a lawsuit claiming that Mafia Wars ripped them off. Zynga settled that case in August, said a spokeswoman for the company. Zynga also was hit with complaints and lawsuits over its original business model, which let players earn in-game rewards for things like signing up for a credit card or video-rental membership. Critics said some of the offers amounted to scams, leading players to download unwanted software or unwittingly sign up for memberships that appeared stealthily on their phone bills. Pincus has acknowledged not being vigilant enough with the automated ads that appeared on Zynga games during the company's early days. 
   More than 13 million people play FishVille every week, according to Zynga. 
"We were playing whack-a-mole," Pincus said. "Every time we found one of these or got a complaint, we would take them down. Eventually ... we realized we had to take a much more aggressive stance than a normal Web site." In November, Zynga removed all "lead-generating" ads, relying for revenue instead on the roughly 1 to 3 percent of the player base that pays for in-game items, such as a barn in FarmVille. It has since been putting the advertisements back in, with a new system that lets it more closely monitor what kind of ads show up, Pincus said. "We'll see where this goes for the entire industry," Pincus said. "It was really important to us to maintain a trusted position with our users. We wanted to do the right thing, and I think we did." Pincus offers a ray of hope for another vocal group of critics: the social-media users who say they're tired of seeing all of their friends' updates about Zynga and other social games. On Facebook, a group called "I dont care about your farm, or your fish, or your park, or your mafia!!!" had more than 5.2 million members recently. "Please. No more of this stuff," wrote one member. "I've had all I can take. About to hang up FACEBOOK. Just want a nice cozy place to talk with my friends!" 
   Zynga Poker was one of the company's first social games and remains among the most popular.

Pincus said he hopes that messages from games can eventually be targeted to a more select audience. "We have to evolve," Pincus said "I think it's heading to a place that's more narrow-casting. I think you'll get to a place where Facebook will be better about showing feeds to people who have a registered interest in them." For example, he said, there might eventually be a way to send game notifications only to people who play social games themselves. "It's not just games. It's going to be true for music, for pictures, for status updates," Pincus said. "I think, over time, these networks are going to start to shape more to ... your [registered interests]." Meanwhile, Zynga will be among the developers continuing to change how people look at video gaming. It's a change that Steinberg, the gaming guru, says will be for the better. While heavyweights like Electronic Arts and the popular Civilization series are making inroads into social gaming, Steinberg said, the genre is also opening up opportunities for smaller developers. "We're seeing, in many ways, a second renaissance for games," Steinberg said. "There's been an epiphany among the developer community saying, 'Look at these millions of users that we've forgotten to speak to for years.' This can only be a good thing for the gaming industry in the end."

 The Facebook games that millions love (and hate)By  Doug Gross, CNN    STORY HIGHLIGHTS Zynga games like FarmVille, Mafia Wars are played by millions every day on Facebook  Expert says social gaming succeeds by appealing to women, other non-traditional gamers  Zynga founder says key to success was games that can be played during conference call  Backlash leads to FB group of 5 million saying they're tired of seeing games  (CNN) -- Early each morning, millions of farmers around the world rise to toil in their fields. By night, gangs of mobsters scheme and legions of poker players shuffle up and deal. Sure, none of it's real. But the overwhelming popularity of so-called social gaming -- simple games that let people play with their friends on networking sites such as Facebook -- is changing the face of video games, experts say. And as the maker of popular titles like FarmVille and Mafia Wars, San Francisco, California-based Zynga has ridden the games' skyrocketing popularity to the top of that emerging market. For Zynga founder Mark Pincus, the formula for gaming success on Facebook, MySpace and other sites was as simple as it might seem counterintuitive: create simple games that people like but can easily set aside. "We built the games so they could be played in a tab on your browser while you're on a conference call," said Pincus, a veteran Web entrepreneur who created Zynga in 2007. Of course, they've been helped by the massive growth of Facebook, where the games are so popular they've spawned "fan" pages devoted to complaining about having to watch friends play them. Facebook, with its 400 million users, is where the vast majority of people play FarmVille and Mafia Wars along with other Zynga titles like FishVille, Vampires, Café World, YoVille and Zynga Poker. In all, more than 65 million people play Zynga games every day, according to media tracking company Developer Analytics. 
   More than 75 million people a month play FarmVille, Zynga's most popular title. 
Zynga's top title, FarmVille, is played by an estimated 75 million people each month --  roughly equal to the number who have played the classic arcade and desktop game Tetris during its entire existence. The massive growth was satisfying but not altogether surprising to Pincus, whose previous startups had included Freeloader, a Web-based information-gathering service; tech-support company SupportSoft; and Tribe.net, an early social networking site from 2003. He said that starting the game company, which he named after his late English bulldog, was an effort to fill what he considered a surprising void in most people's daily Internet use. "I thought in 2007 that something had gone oddly wrong with the whole Internet experience," Pincus said. "I would have thought games would have been one of the top two or three experiences people had on the Internet." What Pincus got right, according to gaming expert Scott Steinberg, was a sort of return to the "golden era" of games like Pac-man and Super Mario Bros. "Video games actually appealed to a huge cross-section. They appealed to everybody," said Steinberg, publisher of DigitalTrends.com.

 Young job-seekers hiding their Facebook pagesBy  Stephanie Goldberg, Special to CNN      Some Facebook users, like Elana Borchers, are using aliases  on the social-networking site while they hunt for jobs. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Students and post grads are changing their names on Facebook while looking for jobs  Survey: 70 percent of U.S. hiring managers have rejected an applicant based on information they found online   Some young job-seekers say they try to keep their Facebook pages hidden from potential employers

 (CNN) -- Justin Gawel says there's nothing too incriminating on his Facebook page. "There are a lot of pictures of drinking [but] nothing naked or anything -- at least I don't think so," he said jokingly. Even so, the Michigan State University junior recently changed his Facebook display name to "Dustin Jawel" to keep his personal life from potential employers while applying for summer internships. Although Gawel ditched his rhyming alias after two weeks when he realized Facebook users also can be searched by e-mail address, school and network, he is not alone in his efforts to scrub his online résumé. Many students and recent graduates say they are changing their names on Facebook or tightening privacy settings to hide photos and wall posts from potential employers. And with good reason. A recent survey commissioned by Microsoft found that 70 percent of recruiters and hiring managers in the United States have rejected an applicant based on information they found online.  What kind of information? "Inappropriate" comments by the candidate; "unsuitable" photos and videos; criticisms of previous employers, co-workers, or clients; and even inappropriate comments by friends and relatives, according to the survey report, titled "Online Reputation in a Connected World." Such prying into his online life makes Gawel uncomfortable. "I understand that when [employers look] at someone's Facebook page, they're just trying to paint a bigger picture of the people they're hiring -- so they're not just a name on a résumé," he said. "But that doesn't demonstrate whether they can do the job. It shouldn't matter what someone does when they're not in the office." Gawel said he's not sure that employers would object to the information on his Facebook page. For him, it's more about personal privacy. "Too many people take pictures of you. I didn't want to go through and 'untag' all of them," he said. "There's nothing illegal or too ridiculous in the photos ... but people don't take pictures of people studying or doing school work. They take pictures of people at parties and doing silly things." For better or worse, online screenings may be a permanent part of the 21st-century hiring process. The Microsoft survey found that 79 percent of U.S. hiring managers have used the Internet to better assess applicants. Dan Eggers of Partners Marketing Group in Marietta, Georgia, is among that 79 percent. "We review and certainly do research on anyone we're looking at hiring or using as a contract employee," Eggers said. "We would Google their name, look at LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter." He said his firm usually only consults an applicant's online reputation to make sure he or she hasn't misrepresented their work experience. "We try not to pay a lot of attention to wall posts from others. It would take quite a bit for us to be reacting to that," Eggers said. But racist or homophobic comments will land your résumé and cover letter in the garbage, he said. "People have a false sense of security about their personal information out there on the Web ... they think only their friends will see it," said Jack Rayman, senior director of career services at Pennsylvania State University. Elana Borchers, an Indiana University senior, said she exchanged her last name for her middle name on Facebook in November when she started applying for jobs. Borchers even decided to keep her alias after landing a full-time position a month later. "Not everything is certain," she said. "If my employers saw something on my profile now that they didn't like, they could take my job away." Not that she's worried about the content on her Facebook page. "There's nothing bad [on my profile]. I'd rather they learn about me in person," Borchers said. "Big Ten schools have the reputation of excessive partying. That's something that's here with me in college, I don't plan to take that partying with me in the future and I didn't want someone to see that and judge me." Borchers said she thought about removing pictures of her partying, but "they're my memories and I want to keep them for now." Many of Borchers' friends are playing the Facebook name game, too -- dropping their last names or using a nickname to hide from potential employers and grad-school admissions officers. "A lot of my guy friends changed [their user names] to a nickname that their friends call them, so everyone still knows who it is," she said. Facebook spokesperson Kathleen Loughlin said she could not comment on the number of users who change their name on Facebook, but students who spoke to CNN said that among their peers, the trend is rampant. Another Indiana University senior, Jeffrey Lefcort, changed his Facebook user name to Jeffrey David -- his middle name -- when he began applying for jobs, even though he doesn't think his page has anything inappropriate. "I just didn't want to be found by someone who was looking for me that I'm not friends with," Lefcort said. "My Facebook profile is not intended for employers. I didn't want them looking at my personal life." Like Gawel, Lefcort eventually ditched his pseudonym and opted instead to tighten his Facebook privacy settings -- something Facebook's Loughlin said is encouraged. With the Internet playing such a large role in business today, few recruiters don't assess applicants' online reputations in some capacity before hiring, said George Matlock, director of operations at Matlock Advertising and Public Relations in Atlanta, Georgia. And while Matlock said he almost always Googles a person's name before hiring them, he steers clear of Facebook. "I haven't looked at [an applicant's] Facebook page," he said. "I try to stay away from it, myself. I think it's too personal ... maybe I'm just scared to see what's out there. Facebook tends to be something pretty private." Emily Mitnick, a Michigan State University senior who also changed her name on Facebook, said she has nothing to hide but wants to keep a low profile and avoid being searched by potential employers. Mitnick uses LinkedIn to communicate with the "professional world." She describes Facebook as a place "where I can be social with my friends and I don't have to be professional.  "I don't have any of my [tagged pictures] available to the public -- just for precautionary measures, not because they're inappropriate," she added. "I would just like to remain somewhat private." Rayman, the Penn State career counselor, said he recommends that students with potentially incriminating photos or posts change their name on social networking sites. But it's not always that easy to escape your online reputation, he said. "Web sites are almost impossible to eliminate," Rayman said. "They get cached somewhere and they'll keep coming up. It used to be if you had a poor reputation in one school, you'd move to another and your record didn't necessarily follow you. It's getting harder and harder to do that as everyone is on the Internet and everyone knows everyone's business."

 Facebook makes it easier for users to share interests across webBy  John D. Sutter, CNN    Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg called Open Graph "the most transformative thing we've ever done for the web." STORY HIGHLIGHTS Facebook unveils platform to make it easier for users to share their interests on other sites  CEO Mark Zuckerberg: Open Graph is "most transformative thing we've ever done"  Zuckerberg made his remarks during a keynote opening f8, Facebook's annual conference

 San Francisco, California (CNN)  -- Facebook on Wednesday announced plans to turn the web into one big cocktail party. "The web is at a really important turning point right now," Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's co-founder and CEO, said in a keynote address in San Francisco, California. "We're building toward a web where the default is social. Every application and product will be redesigned from the ground up to use a person's real identity and friends." Facebook calls this new social paradigm the "Open Graph," and Zuckerberg called the shift "the most transformative thing we've ever done for the web." The announcement puts Facebook in further competition with other web companies like Google and Twitter, who are also trying to organize and make use of users' preferences. Facebook, which has more than 400 million members, says the Open Graph will make it easier for people to share information about their likes and dislikes all over the internet. The social network will pull information about the websites a person visits, the news stories he or she likes and the music or athletes the person favors -- and share all of that information with a person's Facebook friends. That data will show up on Facebook.com and on other sites. Facebook is launching Open Graph today with more than 30 content partners, including The New York Times, Yelp, the music site Pandora, ESPN and the Internet Movie Database. CNN.com also is a partner. The most tangible way web surfers will notice these changes will be the presence of "like" buttons on sites all over the internet, Zuckerberg said. The buttons will be attached to all kinds of websites, photos and blog posts. If a person clicks the button to indicate they "like" something, that information becomes viewable by that person'sFacebook friends. More than a billion "like" buttons will be scattered all over the web within 24 hours, Zuckerberg predicted. There have been some concerns that integrating Facebook into other web sites would reduce the privacy of people who are browsing the web. In a question-and-answer session with reporters after his keynote at the f8 conference here, Zuckerberg said the changes will not affect the privacy of Facebook users. The Open Graph "shows no new information to anyone than was previously visible," he said. For instance, a person visiting the music site Pandora might see information about bands his or her Facebook friends like -- but wouldn't see info from other web users unless they chose to make their Facebook info public. Some bloggers had expected Facebook to announce a feature that would let Facebook track the locations of its users. Such a feature might allow a person to "check in" at a particular restaurant or bar, and tell that person's Facebook friends about his or her whereabouts. Mobile phone apps like Foursquare have made sharing locations more popular. Zuckerberg dodged questions from reporters on the subject, but didn't say that such a feature is out of the question in the future. "We don't have anything to talk about on that today," he said. Zuckerberg made his remarks during a keynote opening f8, Facebook's annual conference for its developers. He also yielded the stage to Facebook platform product director Bret Taylor, who announced a new programming interface he says will make it easier for outside developers to create applications for Facebook.CNN's Brandon Griggs in Atlanta contributed to this report.

Editor's Note: Pete Cashmore is founder and CEO of Mashable, a popular blog about social media. He writes a weekly column about social networking and technology for CNN.com.  London, England (CNN) -- Facebook this week announced a new way to express your interests -- a "Like" button that's set to appear all around the web. Click the button, and the Web page is shared with your friends.  What's more, every "Like" you submit ensures Facebook (and its partner sites) can deliver a more personalized experience to you.  It's a simple yet powerful feature -- one that delivers a significant blow to rival Twitter. Once the network effects take hold, it's frankly hard to imagine how any company could unseat Facebook's social networking dominance in the months to come. Without a counterattack, even Google may one day be dethroned. Facebook vs Twitter: Size Matters  Twitter, Facebook's direct competitor, has so far been unable to match the social network's growth rate. Twitter has 100 million users; Facebook has 400 million. The size of the network is important, since Web publishers and Web developers want their products and services to gain the greatest exposure possible -- given the choice, they'll choose the social platform with the most users.  Publishers, for instance, may choose to put a Twitter "Retweet" button or a Facebook "Like" button on their pages. Given that the majority of Web site visitors have Facebook accounts, the choice becomes an easy one.  Not to mention that Facebook's button's are far more powerful: They tell a visitor how many friends have liked a story, while an additional widget suggests other stories you might like. The "Like" button will accelerate Facebook's growth by spreading its tendrils to every corner of the web.  Likewise, Web sites can offer the ability to "Log in with Facebook" or "Sign in with Twitter". Conversion rates will likely be higher for those sites that choose Facebook. In every case, the biggest site wins.  Twitter's Developer Troubles  Meanwhile, Twitter's relationship with its developer community -- the coders who fueled its growth by creating Twitter applications for phones and the desktop -- has hit a rough patch.  Twitter's acquisition of a popular iPhone app and the release of an official application for BlackBerry users has led some developers to wonder whether they should build Twitter applications at all -- won't Twitter just release an official application for every device and kill off all the upstarts? Facebook's Like buttons and new tools, by contrast, offer endless possibilities for developers.  Unless Twitter can reboot its growth and convince developers that building Twitter applications is worthwhile, Facebook will surely extend its lead.  Google Vs Facebook: Personalized Search  Facebook looks set to challenge the web's biggest players, too: Google is under siege by Facebook's new-found ability to target search results and ads. Google dominated the web in the era of interlinked Web pages. Every link from one Web site to another counted as a vote, determining the most relevant pages for any search term. The result: An unbeatable search engine.  Except that links between Web pages are no longer the most abundant source of relevant recommendations -- instead, people are sharing links with friends on social networks like Facebook and Twitter. Now Google is paying those sites for access to public updates, but it lacks key data that would allow true personalization of search results. Google doesn't have a complete list of your friends, combined with a list of their interests. Facebook does.  Facebook is in a position to build the world's best search engine: One that delivers results based on your friendships and interests. The launch of the "Like" button, meanwhile, means that Facebook will know more about your individual preferences than ever before.  Facebook: The World's Best Ad Network?  Google makes the vast majority of its money from ads -- these ads typically match your search terms, or the content of the Web page you're viewing. Google has certainly worked to personalize these ads, but its knowledge of your friends and interests is more limited than Facebook's. The data gleaned from thousands of Facebook Like buttons around the web could make for an ad network that rivals Google's AdSense.  Google's Social Stumbles  If Google is to maintain its once insurmountable lead in search and advertising, the company surely needs to perfect social networking.  Google Buzz, the search giant's most recent foray into the social space, received criticism from privacy advocates who noted that a user's email contacts were made public upon signup. The early hiccups may have been fixed, but Buzz has so far failed to catch on. Other social projects from Google -- OpenSocial, Google Friend Connect -- are so latent at this point that few are even aware of their existence.  If Google is to fend off the Facebook threat, it needs new ways to mine a user's interests and social connections. The hard way would be to develop a new competency in building social applications -- something Google has struggled to do. The easy way? Buy Twitter.  Facebook's Success is Not Guaranteed  While Facebook is perfectly positioned to lead the next charge, success is by no means guaranteed. Twitter is set to release "annotations", a way to append extra information to Tweets. Google has enough money on hand to buy, well, whatever it wants.  And Facebook's user base is volatile: They may one day decide to embark on a mass exodus, causing Facebook to fall like MySpace and Friendster before it. © 2013 MASHABLE.com.

Editor's note: Pete Cashmore is founder and CEO of Mashable, a popular blog about social media. He writes a weekly column about social networking and technology for CNN.com.   London, England (CNN) -- Facebook dropped a bombshell on the tech industry last week in the form of a Web-wide "Like" button and the launch of the "Open Graph." Using this new platform, Web sites can drive Web traffic from Facebook by including Like buttons on their pages; every Like posts an update to that user's Facebook page.  What's more, any Web site can customize its experience for you, if you're logged into Facebook: Suddenly CNN.com stories can be ranked not just by an editor but by your friends too.  Likes replace links?  Facebook announced Likes as a form of "social links" -- better than a link because it's related to a specific user. If Like buttons take off, that's really bad news for Google, since its algorithm uses links between sites to determine their order in search results.  Facebook seeks to replace this open system of links between pages with the "social links" (or Likes) that it controls. Google and other search engines won't have full access to all these Likes, so the company best positioned to rank the Web will be Facebook. No wonder the "open Web" advocates are sounding the alarm, concerned that a single company will stockpile all of our personal information and preferences.  Already there are calls to create an "OpenLike" standard that's accessible to all, reports Facebook watcher Nick O'Neill.  Facebook optimization?  Can the measurement of an industry affect the output of that industry? If an Academy Award is the ultimate measure of a movie, do directors set out to create great films or Oscar-winning ones?  Appearing on the first page of Google results for your chosen search term is perhaps the online equivalent of an Oscar win.  As Google rose to become the barometer of all that's worthy on the Web, publishers rushed to change their sites to appease the Google god. "Search Engine Optimization" became a massive industry; a multitude of SEO consultants sprung up, offering to tweak your Web site to better fit Google's measure of the Web.  What if Facebook Likes take off? Or to use the proper jargon: What if the Open Graph becomes the measure of the Web? Will publishers change their sites to appease our new overlord?  I'm already seeing it: Thousands of sites are adding Facebook's version of semantic data in preference to the open standards as Facebook becomes the new kingmaker. In the week since launch, more than 50,000 Web sites have added Facebook's "social plug-ins." All of which will make it blissfully easy for Facebook to organize the Web:  Facebook Optimization may be the new SEO.  Open Web advocates have reason to be concerned. Privacy experts are also raising red flags. No doubt they'll find an ally in Google: Without access to the stitches that bind Web pages together, the search engine could falter.

 Principal to parents: Take kids off FacebookBy  Jason Kessler, CNN   Principal calls for Facebook banSTORY HIGHLIGHTS New Jersey principal urges parents to yank kids from social-networking sites  He believes tweens don't have the resilience to withstand internet name-calling  Anthony Orsini sent an e-mail blast to the Benjamin Franklin Middle School community  Facebook: Children under the age of 13 are prohibited from using the site (CNN) -- In a move likely to earn him few Facebook friend requests from tweens, a New Jersey middle school principal is calling for parents to yank their children from all social-networking sites. Anthony Orsini sent an e-mail blast to the Benjamin Franklin Middle School community in Ridgewood, New Jersey, on Wednesday, urging parents to take down their children's online profiles on Facebook and elsewhere. "There is absolutely no reason for any middle school student to be a part of a social networking site!," he wrote. "Let me repeat that - there is absolutely, positively no reason for any middle school student to be a part of a social networking site!" After issuing a rallying cry --"It is time for every single member of the [school] Community to take a stand!" -- Orsini enumerated the reasons he opposes social-networking by his students. The main problem, he wrote, is that tweens do not have the resilience to withstand internet name-calling. "They are simply not psychologically ready for the damage that one mean person online can cause," he said. His school's guidance counselors for years now have been mediating spats that originated online, Orsini said. The last straw for him was students' growing use of Formspring, a social-networking upstart where members ask and answer questions about one another. Orsini singled out the site for scorn in his e-mail to Ben Franklin Middle School parents, calling it a "scourge" that exists "simply to post mean things about people anonymously." "The nicest thing you see [on it] is, 'Jane is a slut,'" he said In a phone interview with CNN.  Formspring did not reply to a request for comment on the principal's campaign.

A Facebook spokesman pointed out that many middle school-age children are formally barred from the site. "We prohibit children under the age of 13 from using Facebook both for safety reasons and to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act," the spokesman said. In his e-mail, Orsini also warned parents that the casual cruelty of an unsupervised 12-year-old online is a more realistic threat to their children than the oft-raised specter of sexual predators. "The threat to your son or daughter from online adult predators is insignificant compared to the damage that children at this age constantly and repeatedly do to one another through social networking sites," he wrote. In recent years Facebook, MySpace and other social-networking sites have been blamed for the suicides of teenage girls in Missouri, Massachusetts and New York. Parents complained the girls were traumatized by nasty comments posted on the sites. Inez Bunza, the parent of a student at the Ridgewood, New Jersey, school, said she agreed with the principal's point, but her daughter was "completely up in arms" when she broached the possibility of shutting down her Facebook account Wednesday. She said she remains hopeful they can hammer out "an amicable solution." Orsini says that, on the whole, parental response to his e-mail has been overwhelmingly positive, and that parents as far away as Israel and Korea have e-mailed him to say, "thank you for saying something." Fans of Orsini's zero-tolerance philosophy toward student social-networking can also friend him on Facebook, of which he is a member.

 Apple Game Center: the Facebook of mobile gaming?By  Scott Steinberg, Special to CNN | Filed under: Gaming & Gadgets     Game Center is a social network that can help smartphone users instantly connect with gaming opponents. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Game Center is a mobile social network that can instantly find and connect with opponents   Game Center will have global high score boards to compete on  Game Center is planned to launch with a future iOS 4 update for iPhone and iPad  Games for iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad tend to be less advanced than a PSP or DSi XL

Editor's note: Scott Steinberg is the head of technology and video game consulting firm TechSavvy Global, as well as the founder of GameExec magazine and Game Industry TV. He frequently appears as an on-air technology analyst for ABC, CBS, NBC, FOX and CNN. His most recent book is "Get Rich Playing Games."  (CNN) -- Gamers looking to quickly hop online and score permanent bragging rights typically turn to set-top multiplayer services like Xbox Live and PlayStation Network.  But now, Apple is stealing a page from the competition's playbook with Game Center, a social network for smartphone users that helps you instantly find and connect with opponents anytime, anywhere -- and offers global high score boards to compete on. "We've seen this sort of thing on consoles for years, but never on a phone, and that's revolutionary," says Daniel Bernstein, CEO of Sandlot Games, publisher of celebrated franchises "Cake Mania" and "Tradewinds."  "People will soon be able to play more types of games than ever before, from social titles like 'FarmVille' to multiplayer games to those supporting trophies and ranking ladders." Consider it the Facebook of mobile gaming. Planned to launch with a future iOS 4 update for iPhone and iPad, users can set up and browse profiles, issue friends invites to play and enjoy mobile multiplayer matches wherever the urge strikes.  "It's like dining in vs. takeout," explains game developer Steve Demeter, creator of popular puzzler "Trism." "Because Game Center's meant for a mobile device... you'll be more in touch with friends in games [and] have more ways to make new friends, helping make the community a real thriving thing."  Collectible achievements -- virtual badges earned for completing challenges (e.g. collecting rare items or killing 100 enemies) -- should also provide long-term incentive to stay in the game. Not that your DSi XL or PSP is headed for extinction anytime soon: Games for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad tend to be less sophisticated, with puzzles and arcade outings more common than first-person shooters or sprawling role-playing adventures.  Competing multiplayer services like OpenFeint and Plus+ may also undermine Game Center's appeal, while Apple's inexperience in game design could result in missing features, undercooked user functionality or myriad technical hiccups.  But by offering a one-stop solution for mobile multiplayer networking, the inside word is that the service will ultimately let developers spend less time programming, more designing new and innovative games. "Apple's finally getting serious about being a player in the gaming industry," says Pangea Software CEO Brian Greenstone, who says the technical support and software upgrades it could offer developers may lead to new breakthroughs. "Once they add buttons and a gamepad to the iPhone/iPad, it could be a DS or PSP killer."

 Sharing vs. your privacy on FacebookBy  Doug Gross, CNN      Facebook users can hide their info from applications, but some fear not enough people know that. STORY HIGHLIGHTSFacebook developers can get some users' info without permission if friend authorizes itSite keeps tabs on developers and ban any who search for more info than they needSome critics say Facebook doesn't do enough to help users with privacy settingsDeveloper says he keeps minimal details on users, doesn't see need for more (CNN) -- Facebook is, by its nature, a social experience. But as the undisputed king of social networking expands ways for its users to interact, it's raising more questions about how much of their information is made available to people they don't know.  In some cases, users may not even realize it's happening. One example is the hundreds of thousands of developers approved by Facebook to create games, quizzes and other applications. Some of those developers are able to access basic information about users after a Facebook friend has started using their application. Facebook provides pages of instructions on how people can tighten up their privacy settings to hide their personal information from other users and outside applications.  But some observers say that too many of the site's estimated 400 million users don't know how to do so. Microsoft researcher and social-media analyst Danah Boyd, speaking at last month's South by Southwest Interactive festival, said none of the "non-techy" users she talked to about their privacy settings knew how they were configured. "I ask them what they think their settings are and then ask them to look at their settings with me. I have yet to find someone whose belief matched up with their reality," said Boyd, a keynote speaker at the Austin, Texas festival. "That is not good news." In January, Facebook announced that 35 percent of its users had tweaked their privacy settings after a December change that made more information public.  
 How to adjust your Facebook privacy settings1. Click on the word "Account" on the blue band at the top right of your profile page. 2. Scroll down and click "Privacy Settings." 3. "Applications and Websites" lets you edit settings regarding who can see your information.

To be sure, that represents millions of users. But Boyd said that can't possibly be all the people who want at least some of the privacy features that Facebook's new default settings changed. "Are there Facebook users who want their content to be publicly accessible? Of course," she said. "But 65 percent of all Facebook users? No way." For Facebook, it's a balancing act. The site wants to give users the privacy they've come to expect, but at the same time make information available to create experiences that will compete with other emerging applications such as Foursquare and Twitter. Twitter, as well as photo sharing sites such as Picasa, default to open access, making them more accessible by outside applications and search engines. Facebook's material that is public can also be searched -- for example, by Google's new social search feature -- while private material cannot. "The experience that we're trying to provide through the Facebook platform is fundamentally a social one," said Simon Axten, a manager on Facebook's public policy team. "There are some really interesting and useful applications that have come out of that development that really allow people to have a social experience that involves the people that they are friends with." Axten said the rules of the road for developers are pretty strict. Basically, developers are instructed to collect only the data they need for their application. Anything else could land them in trouble, he said. For example, an application that lets users send friends an electronic greeting card might need to know their birthday or anniversary. Games that require players to work together must know which other friends play the game so it can send them alerts when they need to act. Axten said Facebook can take "a spectrum of actions" when it discovers inappropriate use of people's information -- from warning developers who may not realize they're misusing the data to disabling a developer's access to the site. No application can access a user's most sensitive data, such as contact information, according to Facebook. And the site announced late last year that they're working on a new approval process that will require an application to more specifically state what information it wants to access. Mike Rasmussen is president of Republic of Fun, a game company with a crowdsourcing app on Facebook that lets users give feedback and advice on current games and, in the near future, to suggest new ones. He said Facebook's list of rules for developers is a strict one. "Developers, if they were creative, could certainly abuse it," he said. "But with Facebook, it's almost not worth it. They make it so easy to get what you really need, unless you're being malicious." Rasmussen said his application stores a single identifier for users and does not even keep their names. He said he's only heard "second- or third-hand" about developers getting into trouble for pushing the boundaries. Evan Brown, a Chicago technology and intellectual-property attorney, said he's not familiar with any legal cases involving private information gathered by a Facebook developer. He said Facebook's rules governing outside developers are designed so the site may legally expel a developer easily. "They have the sole discretion to determine what the crime is, and they have the sole discretion to determine the punishment," said Brown, who blogs about Internet legal issues. Facebook's Axten said a team monitors complaints,  which users can file simply by clicking a link that's on every Facebook application. The team also regularly monitors popular and fast-growing applications and conducts random checks, he said. And of course there are personal settings. A user can click the "Account" tab at the top right of their Facebook home page, then scroll down to "Application Settings" and "Privacy Settings" to make changes. Increasing awareness about that ability is what Facebook and other social-networking sites need to work harder on, Boyd said. "While you want your services to go viral, help users walk through the value proposition first," she said. "Not through a video, but through an experience."

 Divorce attorneys catching cheaters on FacebookBy  Stephanie Chen, CNN    North Carolina attorney Lee Rosen uses evidence and leads culled on Facebook to build his divorce cases. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Attorneys report an increase in using social media in divorce and family law cases  Facebook, especially, has been a gold mine for evidence in divorce disputes  Facebook's relaxed privacy policies make investigations easier, some attorneys say  Private investigators report a surge in demand for Facebook searches

Divorce Law

Family Law

 (CNN) -- Before the explosion of social media, Ken Altshuler, a divorce lawyer in Maine, dug up dirt on his client's spouses the old-fashioned way: with private investigators and subpoenas. Now the first place his team checks for evidence is Facebook. Consider a recent story of a female client in her 30s, who came to Altshuler seeking a divorce from husband. She claimed her husband, an alcoholic, was drinking again. The husband denied it. It was her word against his word, Altshuler says, until a mutual friend of the couple stumbled across Facebook photos of the husband drinking beer at a party a few weeks earlier. It was the kind of "gotcha moment" Altshuler knew would undermine the husband's credibility in court. His firm presented the photos to the judge, and the wife won the case in April, he said. "Facebook is a great source of evidence," Altshuler said. "It's absolutely solid evidence because he's the author of it. How do you deny that you put that on?" Social media stalking skills have become invaluable to the legal world for divorce cases in particular. Online photo albums, profile pages, wall comments, status updates and tweets have become gold mines for evidence and leads. Today, divorce and family law firms routinely cull information posted on social media sites -- the flirty exchanges with a paramour, unsavory self-revelations and compromising photographs -- to buttress their case. Posting hugging and kissing photos online can show a happily married relationship, or it can expose a secretive affair. At least 80 percent of attorneys surveyed by the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers cited a growth in the number of cases that used social media over the last five years. The study was released earlier this year. Divorce attorneys say social media sites have opened windows for infidelity because it's become easier to rekindle romance with an old flame or flirt with a stranger. And the posted, shared, and tagged evidence of infidelity is precisely the type of evidence attorneys look for online.  "You need to familiarize yourself with privacy settings to ensure there is no way personal information can be accessed," said Adam Ostrow, editor in chief of Mashable.com, a social media guide.  Facebook -- where attorneys find most of the evidence and leads -- has gradually relaxed privacy settings over the last year. Attorneys say that enabled some members'  personal details to be leaked without the user realizing it, attorneys say. On May 26th, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged the problem and, in a blog, announced new tools making it easier for users to tighten privacy settings and block outside parties from seeing personal information. "It's becoming all but impossible to protect your information unless you spend hours and hours figuring it out," said Lee Rosen, a divorce attorney in North Carolina, who added he reaped the benefits of the tricky privacy controls in a recent case.  Rosen was investigating a North Carolina husband in his 40s accused of cheating on his wife. The husband failed to set privacy controls on his Facebook wall, an area where users can post information. Rosen noticed a suspicious message from the husband's younger female co-worker. The post was the hunch he needed to steer him in right direction. Rosen reports about a quarter of his divorce cases use information found on social media sites. 
It's becoming all but impossible to protect your information unless you spend hours and hours figuring it out.--Lee Rosen, North Carolina divorce attorney

Finding the Facebook profiles is so simple that Rosen says anyone could do it. He goes to a site called Flowtown.com, a site intended for marketers but is useful for attorneys, too. Type an e-mail address and the site generates various social media profiles. If that fails, Rosen hires a private investigator. At National Digital Forensics, Inc., a North Carolina company that mines digital sites for information, requests for social media searches from divorce lawyers have surged, says president and senior digital investigator Giovanni Masucci. The social media detective work requires different snooping skills, he says. "For example, someone may be cheating, but they are married," Masucci explained. "If their status on the web page says single, that's a major red flag." Masucci estimated about half the social media cases they investigate expose some kind of cheating. The happy reality for divorce attorneys is that most clients are bound to be on Facebook or another social media site. Facebook is more popular than ever, drawing in 400 million users, the company reports on its website. Each user creates an average of 70 pieces of content monthly and has an average of 130 friends.  The most common way to gather information on Facebook relies on the battling couple's mutual online friends who still have access to the spouse's profile. Many times the spouse will "de-friend" a partner but forget about their shared friends, who can play detective and access information on their profile.  Another way of exposing damaging information is searching the profiles of the suspected "other man" or "other woman", says says Marlene Eskind Moses, a divorce attorney in Tennessee. "It's amazing how people tell their life stories," said Moses, who represented a Tennessee woman who believed her husband was cheating on her. After the wife found herself blocked from her husband's Facebook page, she found the profile page of the other woman whom she suspected in the affair. On that woman's profile page, a public album of photos taken on a romantic getaway appeared. Scenic shots of South Carolina's mountains. Her husband and another woman embracing in front of an art gallery. Portraits of the couple with their faces nuzzled close together. Elizabeth K. Englander, professor of psychology at Bridgewater State College in Massachusetts, says people divulge information on social media because they believe no one will ever see the information they post. "The sense online is sort of like the mob effect," Englander said. "You feel like you're one in a million, and so who will ever notice you?" But when someone does notice, that's when some divorce attorneys pounce. Information copied from social media sites can sway the outcome of alimony payment disputes and custody fights, attorneys say. Some parents have even lost a child because of the behavior they exhibited online, the lawyers say. The ultimate goal, after all, is to catch a spouse in a lie. Sometimes it's a wife claiming she can't afford child support payments but subsequently purchased expensive jewelry and posted photos of the items on Facebook. Or if a husband who claims he doesn't have anger problems while his social media profile is loaded with expletives. Once there is evidence of a person caught in an obvious lie, attorneys say, it undermines the rest of their credibility with the judge. Attorneys advise users of Facebook and other social media who are headed toward a divorce or custody battle to edit their profiles, be cautious about updating statuses and double check to see who is really a "friend." Or to make things easier -- at least until the trial is over or a settlement is reached -- just get off Facebook completely.

 Cashmore: Google building a Facebook rival? Let's hope soBy  Pete Cashmore, Special to CNN | Filed under: Social Media     Pete Cashmore says there is no truly competitive social network to which disgruntled Facebook users can flee. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Even satisfied Facebook users should hope Google's social-networking efforts bear fruit  Facebook could launch both a search engine and ad network, a double threat for Google  Facebook's recent privacy issues made users face reality: There's no real alternative  Google's social-networking efforts have so far fallen flat

Editor's note: Pete Cashmore is founder and CEO of Mashable, a popular blog about social media. He writes a weekly column about social networking and tech for CNN.com.   (CNN) -- Google is working on a social service to rival Facebook, if Web rumors are to be believed.  And while Google's social-networking efforts have so far fallen flat, even satisfied Facebook users should hope that the search engine's efforts bear fruit. First, to the rumor: A now-deleted Tweet last weekend from entrepreneur Kevin Rose claimed that Google is working on a Facebook competitor called "Google Me." That claim gained credence as former Facebook CTO Adam D'Angelo weighed in. Posting a response on the question-and-answer service Quora, D'Angelo wrote: "This is not a rumor. This is a real project. There are a large number of people working on it. I am completely confident about this."  Google, he added, is threatened by Facebook's rise to prominence and feels the need to build a social network of its own.  The Facebook threat The search giant has legitimate cause for concern. As I wrote in this column two months ago, Facebook is gathering masses of data through its recently launched "Likes" feature, which lets Web visitors express interest in a piece of content.  More than 50,000 websites implemented this "Like button" in the week after it launched, providing Facebook with a treasure trove of data about the preferences of Web users. This data could form the basis of a powerful search engine, ranking Web pages by "Likes" rather than the links that Google relies upon.  What's more, Facebook could serve up different search results to each user based on the preferences of his or her friends. It gets worse for Google. Facebook's mountain of personal data could also provide the backbone of an ad network many times more targeted than Google's keyword-based advertising. If Facebook were to launch both a search engine and ad network, it could put a significant dent in Google's more than $23 billion in annual revenue.  But Google shouldn't be the only party concerned about Facebook's rapid ascent -- the lack of a Facebook alternative is a threat to consumer choice, providing no escape route when things turn sour.  No real alternative Facebook's privacy issues over recent months have opened our eyes to a grim reality: There is no real alternative. While dissatisfied MySpace users hopped over to Facebook, there is no truly competitive social network to which disgruntled Facebook users can elope.  The demand for a legitimate alternative is so great that a project called Diaspora was able to raise more than $200,000 from Web users to develop its "privacy aware, personally controlled, do-it-all, open source social network."  Until such a rival emerges, Facebook has little incentive to maintain user trust -- the only option available to unhappy Facebookers is to delete their accounts and lose contact with their friends.  Google's social stumbles  Alas, Google has a dismal track record when it comes to social networks. Orkut, an early social-networking effort, has seen success in Brazil, but in the U.S. it's virtually unheard of. Google Friend Connect, a possible rival to the recently renamed Facebook Connect, went nowhere.  Open Social, a challenge to Facebook Apps, has been forgotten. And Google Buzz, a recent attempt to add Twitter-like status updates to Gmail, flopped -- and generated a regrettable privacy backlash for the company.  Google, the narrative goes, is exquisitely talented at solving problems with algorithms. But when it comes to the touchy-feely stuff -- like human interaction -- it falls flat.  Getting behind Google So while it's definitely a long shot, it's time to rally behind Google. If the search giant is able to pull off a half-decent Facebook rival, the fast-growing social network will finally have a competitor to keep its power in check.  That would be a win not just for Google, but for the Web as a whole.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Pete Cashmore.

 Facebook to recognize faces, help tag photos 

By  Ben Parr | Filed under: Social Media     Facebook says new face detection tech will help find friends, making photo tagging easier. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Facebook is testing face-detection technology for the site  Face-recognition will make tagging large photos easier, FB says  Some users started seeing the ability as early as Friday
RELATED TOPICS

Internet

 (Mashable) -- Facebook has begun testing face detection technology for Facebook Photos. This is the first of what seems like a series of new features for its popular photo product. The tests, which some users will see starting today [Friday], focus on decreasing the tediousness of "tagging" friends in Facebook photos. In the current Photos feature, users upload photos, click on each face in a photo, tag that photo with the friend pictured therein and continue the process until the album is tagged. If you've got a large album or a lot of friends in a single photo, this process is inefficient and tedious. To solve this problem, Facebook has implemented face detection technology that will automatically find faces in photos and select them, eliminating one of the most tedious steps in tagging Facebook friends in photos. Your friends are already selected by the software -- all you have to do is answer the Facebook prompt, "Whose face is this?" The technology is the same as the facial detection technology most digital cameras use today. While the tech itself may not be all that new, it is a clever and very welcomed addition to the Facebook Photos feature set. The company also promises that face detection is merely the first of many improvements that they're trying out. It's also interesting that the post was written by Sam Odio, one of the co-founders of Divvyshot, which Facebook acquired back in April in order to improve the Photos product. What other improvements and features do you want to see implemented in Facebook Photos? Do you think facial recognition -- that is, Facebook automatically knowing whose face is whose -- could be on the horizon? The company has a suggestion form for letting them know, but we also encourage you to share your ideas in our comments section below.© 2013 MASHABLE.com. All rights reserved.

 By the numbers: Do we have Facebook fatigue? 

By  Ryan Singel | Filed under: Social Media     Privacy controversies might have slowed Facebook growth, or maybe everyone who wants a page has one. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Report says Facebook added 320,000 users in June, down from massive 7.8 million in May  Possible privacy controversies hurt growth, but could be an aberration  Also possible all internet users who want a Facebook page already have one  If the site has peaked, Facebook may need to look for alternate funding sources

Internet

 (Wired) -- Have we reached the Facebook saturation point? That's one possibility suggested by monthly growth data from Inside Facebook, which reports that Facebook gained only 320,000 new U.S. users in June after a blockbuster gain in May of more than 7.8 million.  Moreover, the net's dominant social networking site lost active users in the 18-25, 26-34 and 35-44 demographic ranges, while gaining users in their mid-teens and middle years. One possibility is that the May and June controversies over Facebook's privacy policies and dominance have kept the company from tremendous new growth and even led some to curtail their use.  Another possibility is that it's just a statistical aberration, or a result of changes to the advertising system, where Inside Facebook says it gleans its numbers. But there's also the possibility that almost every American who has any interest in joining Facebook already has. Facebook says it has about 125 million active U.S. accounts and is likely closing on half a billion accounts worldwide. According to Inside Facebook, some 41 percent of Americans have Facebook accounts, a rate surpassed only by the U.K and Canada, which clock in at 44 percent and 48 percent respectively. What would peak-Facebook mean for the company?  Certainly not irrelevance, since Facebook is now the second most visited site in the world after Google and is the largest photo sharing site on the net. However, it's yet to prove that it can create a money-making machine like Google found in tiny search advertising tied to what users search for, not who they are. Facebook's ads, by contrast, are all about knowing what you are interested in, according to the data you tell it.  Advertisers have powerful ways to target ads at users. One techie even created an ad specifically for his wife by targeting his ad at very select criteria -- geography, degree, gender and interest. As a private company, Facebook's revenues are not publicly disclosed, but the company has confirmed that they are close to $1 billion. That's a pittance compared to Google's $25 billion in annual revenue. Investors, including Microsoft, have invested in the company with a valuation of $15 billion. But if Facebook has hit its peak in terms of U.S. users, the company will have to turn its attention to finding ways to make money off the site, not just add more users.  It's increasingly weaving itself into the fabric of the web, and it now seems odder to see a news story without a Facebook 'Like' button than with one, even though that feature has only been around a few months. The other problem with the possibility of hitting peak-Facebook? There's only one way to go from there and that's down. Users are finicky, and Facebook could find itself caught in a battle of just trying to retain users who might jump ship to Google's rumored new network or even just decide they are tired of maintaining a social networking profile. Facebook did not immediate respond to an e-mail seeking comment.Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT! Click here!

 Facebook Gifts shop shutting downBy  Doug Gross, CNN | Filed under: Social Media     Gifts that raise money for charity are options in the Facebook Gifts store, which closes August 1. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Facebook says it will close its Gifts shop on August 1  Blog post says ending the virtual gifting will let staff focus on other projects  Old gifts on users' walls will not disappear, Facebook says 
RELATED TOPICS


Facebook Inc.

Virtual and Augmented Reality

Internet

 (CNN) -- The days of digital birthday cakes, virtual bottles of champagne and other cutesy icons from Facebook are numbered. Facebook Gifts, the virtual shop born out of a 2007 "hackathon" by FB staffers, will close on August 1, even as the social networking giant looks for other ways to make money. "Closing the Gift Shop may disappoint many of the people who have given millions of gifts, but we made the decision after careful thought about where we need to focus our product development efforts," product manager Jared Morgenstern wrote on Facebook's official blog. "We'll be able to focus more on improving and enhancing products and features that people use every day, such as Photos, News Feed, Inbox, games, comments, the 'Like' button and the Wall." Facebook allows users to buy virtual credits that can be cashed in for digital gifts, such as bouquets of flowers, to be sent to friends' pages on the social networking site. Most of the virtual items cost the equivalent of about $1 apiece. Ditching the gift shop suggests that its popularity has dipped as it competes with free Facebook apps, like Pieces of Flair and Birthday Calendar, that let users hand out similar digital goodies. People who have gifts displayed on their wall will not lose them when the store is closed, Morgenstern wrote. Users also will still be able to view a page showing all the gifts they've given and received. Morgenstern, who helped create Facebook Gifts for Valentine's Day in 2007, called the ending bittersweet. But he credited the feature with launching Facebook Credits, the virtual cash used most often for premium items in massively popular Facebook game apps like FarmVille. Reactions to the blog post were mixed. Some users mourned the end of the gift shop. "I am actually upset by this," one user wrote. "I hate third-party apps for it because they are full of spam and stuff you do not want. I fail to see why this has to actually disappear. It's working fine right now as it is." But many of the more than 1,000 commenters appeared to be less concerned about the change. "Yay! Who wants to pay real money for fake gifts anyway?" a user wrote.

 Microsoft Launches Outlook Facebook Integration 

By Ben Parr, Mashable.com | Filed under: Social Media   Microsoft's Outlook Social Connector syncs social networking feeds with your Outlook contacts. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Outlook Social Connector syncs social networking feeds with your Outlook contacts  New Facebook status updates will pop up in realtime within Outlook  Outlook will only pull data from e-mails connected to Facebook accounts
RELATED TOPICS

Computer Technology

LinkedIn Corporation

Microsoft Corporation

Microsoft Windows Live Messenger

MySpace Inc.

 (Mashable.com) -- Microsoft is announcing today that it has integrated Facebook and Windows Live Messenger into Outlook, bringing the streams of millions of Facebook users into inboxes across the world. Last year, Microsoft launched Outlook Social Connector, a plugin that syncs social networking feeds with your Outlook contacts, giving you immediate data on what they are doing and thinking. It started last year with LinkedIn integration, but soon the company announced MySpace and Facebook were coming. Today, Outlook completes the cycle with not only Facebook integration, but support for Windows Live Messenger as well. Not only that, but the company is releasing the plugin for Outlook 2003 and 2007 users as well, bringing Facebook, MySpace, LinkedIn and Windows Live Messenger to millions of business and personal inboxes worldwide. Last week, we got a sneak peek at the new Outlook at Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Washington. Here's what you can expect from the new Facebook integration, as well some features that you can expect in the near future: Facebook + Outlook = Realtime Contact Data Facebook and Microsoft worked together to get the launch of Facebook's integration in Outlook Social Connector right. Facebook's Strategic Partner Manager Rick Armbrust told us that they worked closely with the Office team to make the experience more social. One of the things he immediately highlighted was the pulling of Facebook profile pictures into Outlook. The entire experience is a step above the Outlook-LinkedIn integration, which itself was pretty strong. Not only does it pull Facebook profile photos so that you can associate a name to a face, but it pulls the news feeds of your contacts into your inbox. When you're looking at someone's e-mail, you'll also get a glance at their status updates, picture uploads and wall posts, among other activities. When you combine that with LinkedIn, MySpace, Windows Live Messenger, and Outlook data, you get a very detailed history of your interaction with your contacts, as well as an at-a-glance look at their activities and interests. Knowing that a potential client just returned from a trip to Hawaii can be all that you need to have the upper hand against your competition. Microsoft Group Product Manager Paco Contreras told us that there's another new feature to the Facebook integration: realtime updates. Thanks to a new update to the social connector platform, also being released today, updates from your contacts will automatically be pushed to your inbox. There's no need to refresh anything: new Facebook status updates will pop up in realtime within Outlook. The Facebook integration does have limitations, though: except for friend requests, Outlook can only pull data from Facebook. There is no "liking" posts or updating your status via Outlook, at least right now. Microsoft says that the next step is to provide a richer social experience by integrating the ability to push data to other social networks, improving the look and feel of Outlook Social Connector, and adding other social networks from other regions. The Social Inbox Microsoft has known for a while that social technologies are going to dominate the web. That was made evident by its $240 million stake in Facebook and its many partnerships and attempts at social media (some of which have bombed). However, Outlook Social Connector has always felt like one of the company's smarter social media plays. Facebook's Rich Armbrust probably put it best: "What's unique is that it's bringing social elements and context from Facebook form your colleagues and your friends into the Outlook experience, which is pretty unique given that there are so many that use Outlook as their primary communiction tool." E-mail isn't inherently a "social" experience (it's not a one-to-many platform), and attempts at integrating social into the inbox (think Google Buzz) have mostly fallen flat. However, social data can be incredibly useful in the business world, especially when you need to understand what your client or colleague is thinking or doing right now. While we'd still love to see Twitter integration in Outlook, Facebook is far larger and, in most cases, has far more useful information. Microsoft's also learned a few lessons from the privacy fiascos Facebook and Google have undergone in recent months. Outlook will only pull data from e-mails connected to Facebook accounts. If your business e-mail isn't linked to your Facebook, your data stream won't appear in Outlook Social Connector. It gives users a choice, although most people do choose to add their work e-mails to Facebook in order to join their company's Facebook network. If you want to learn more about the announcement, Microsoft has also released a short video articulating Outlook's new features.© 2013 MASHABLE.com. All rights reserved.

 Facebook a 'tool' for cheating spouses, some say  By the CNN Wire Staff | Filed under: Social Media  STORY HIGHLIGHTSNEW: Facebook responds to the idea of social-networking sites leading to divorcesKen Savage created a website after discovering his wife's messages with an ex-boyfriendAffairs conducted on the web are growing as social-networking sites growStudy: 81 percent of divorce attorneys use evidence found on networking sites  (CNN) -- Ken Savage says that, at first, he welcomed his wife's new interest in Facebook. She had recently recovered from a bout with depression and dependence on prescription drugs, and he thought reconnecting with old friends would help get her out of her rut. But he says he became increasingly suspicious of her social networking activity when she began hiding her computer screen when he entered the room. Savage soon discovered his wife was using the site to meet up with an old boyfriend -- an increasingly common occurrence as more and more adults join Facebook. Savage, 38, of Lowell, Massachusetts, is the creator of FacebookCheating.com, a website he started in 2009 shortly after he discovered his wife's affair in an effort "to help others cope with someone cheating on them as well as shine light upon someone who is using Facebook to cheat." A recent survey by the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers found that 81 percent of divorce attorneys have seen an increase in the number of cases using social networking evidence during the past five years. More than 66 percent of those attorneys said the No. 1 site most often used as evidence is Facebook with its 400 million registered users. Another recent survey by Divorce-Online.co.uk of more than 5,000 divorce petitions says Facebook is mentioned in about 20 percent of divorce cases. 



Facebook a tool for infidelity?


"As everyone continues to share more and more aspects of their lives on social networking sites, they leave themselves open to much greater examinations of both their public and private lives in these sensitive situations," Marlene Eskind Moses, president of the AAML, said in a statement of the survey's results.

Savage, who says he has nothing against Facebook and uses it regularly to connect with childhood friends, told HLN's "Prime News" Wednesday that the networking site is simply "a tool for an affair." He says that if there is trouble within a marriage or a relationship, "the affair's going to happen anyway," but Facebook "makes it much easier." Andrew Noyes, a spokesman for Facebook, says the website is not responsible for breaking up marriages. "It's ludicrous to suggest that Facebook leads to divorce and we would suggest that anyone who purports to have conducted surveys about the topic also ask respondents about other popular communication channels, such as text messaging, chat sites and email, before jumping to conclusions," Noyes said. Stacey Kaiser, a psychotherapist and relationship expert, says she estimates Facebook plays a much larger factor in divorces. "It's not just your everyday affair," Kaiser told "Prime News." "When it comes to something like Facebook, you are reconnecting with a long-lost love. All those teenage feelings, those college feelings come back again, you feel young again, and it drives you to do something you don't normally do." Savage, who is separated and living apart from his wife, says communication with your spouse is key to keeping your Facebook page as a place to network, not coordinate illicit rendezvous. "In the beginning when we first got on Facebook, we would openly talk" about shared friends' new babies and other milestones posted on the site, Savage told HLN. "When it got real quiet, that was the problem," he said. Brenda Wade, a clinical therapist whose self-proclaimed mission is to cut the divorce rate by half, says the mistake most couples make is placing priorities on material things rather than partnership. "We need to put that energy, that time, that money into the relationship," she told "Prime News." "That's where you want to feel the excitement and the rush."

 Five things that could topple Facebook's empire 

By Ryan Singel, Wired | Filed under: Social Media   Facebook's founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has changed the culture of the world. Will his success last? STORY HIGHLIGHTS Facebook is nearing 500 million users, but is it invincible?  A poll says people are as happy with Facebook as they are with their cable company  There are rumors that Google is hatching its own social network system  Location-centric services are gaining users at the rate that Facebook used to

Mark Zuckerberg

Facebook Inc.

Google Inc.

 (Wired) -- Facebook is primed to announce this week that it's amassed a half billion active friends, a milestone reinforcing its status as the king of social networks -- a company to be regarded with the seriousness and power (if not revenue) of Google, Apple, Yahoo and Microsoft. Five hundred million and rising also makes it clear to anyone not paying attention that Facebook is no fad, that it is a cultural force shaping our collective culture. Even if you have no desire to ever set up a profile, you can't ignore it and you are now oddly defined in the negative and left out of the zeitgeist. A service of that size won't disappear anytime soon, even if Facebook has hit its plateau in the U.S. But net users are fickle and the web's short history includes dozens of sites that were once high-flying that have either since died (Geocities), lost their luster (Yahoo) or faded into irrelevance (Friendster). So how could Facebook lose its place at the center of the web?  1. Open, distributed alternatives A pack of college kids drunk on Free Software launched an open-source, federated alternative to Facebook called Diaspora. After collecting an astonishing $120K in donations, the group is knocking out code.  Meanwhile, there's other cool stuff going on, including OneSocialWeb, the Appleseed Project and WebFinger. Get enough of these open protcols into decent shape and someone is likely to build them into an improbably powerful stack. Research the LAMP stack, if you don't get my drift. What might that look like? An elimination of the need for a centralized home and coordinator of social networking -- where your social profile lives wherever you want it to (as your e-mail does) and can interact with any other profile around the net, on your own terms. While it sounds far-fetched, a recent poll suggests that people are as happy with Facebook as they are with their cable company, even if they do find it similarly indispensable.  2. Google Me There's rumors the search giant is hatching its own social network system, despite the fact that it's just not particularly good at social networking. Its Orkut social network has flailed and even seems to be losing its final two treasures, India and Brazil, to Facebook. Google's take on Twitter, called Buzz, isn't bad, but it's not been much of a hit -- despite some fine features such as threaded coversations. And then it's got Wave and Google Talk, and Google Chat and Google Profile and Google pages and Google Docs.  I wonder if anyone has tried stacking any of those together over there in the Googleplex to create a place where people actually want to hang out -- the clear difference between a site like Facebook and a site like Google search. Interesting things happen when people hang out.  3. Location-based services and the mobile device With the stunning popularity of pocket computers -- starting with the iPhone, location-centric services such as Foursquare are gaining users at the rate that Facebook used to. Perhaps most importantly, they are figuring out ways to use the addictive mechanics of gaming to create services even more engrossing than Facebook. To compete, Facebook has its own, very well-liked mobile app, and is set to expand how it interacts with the real world. But there's a real threat here that Facebook could get outflanked by clever kids not too much unlike themselves, who figure out how to create a more potent digital heroin.  4. The U.S. Postal Service For those who love dark horses or the old and familiar, there's always a chance that the world suddenly tires of their Facebook wall or virtual farming and decide to get off the net's grid entirely. Socializing will still be necessary, of course, so we'll see the return of sockhops, neighborhood restaurants and church socials. As for written messages, the Postal Service is actually quite good at delivering hand-written correspondence anywhere in the States for a nominal fee. The photo postcard will be huge again. But since the Postal Service is proposing to cease Saturday delivery, its social networking service would be a weekday-only affair. Vive la Poste!  5. Overreaching on the part of Mark Zuckerberg Facebook's founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has changed the culture of the world with his single-minded devotedness to making people share more information with more people. In a world where software can determine culture, Zuckerberg's unwavering drive to make more and more of the details of our lives public by default has triumphed in nearly every instance over prevailing cultural norms -- with the glaring exception of the Beacon project. But as with all visionaries, there is always the danger that in his attempt to lead his flock to the land of milk and honey, there will come a moment where he steps too far ahead, and the flock abandons the frontier for the pasture, leaving him alone and howling in the wilderness.Subscribe to WIRED magazine for less than $1 an issue and get a FREE GIFT!

 Who in the world isn't on Facebook?By  Doug Gross, CNN | Filed under: Social Media   A half-billion users later, Facebook's growth looks to come from countries outside the United States. STORY HIGHLIGHTS With grandmas aboard, who in the world hasn't already signed up for Facebook?  Facebook announced this week that it has hit 500 million users  While U.S. market may be saturated, plenty of people overseas aren't on the site  Only about 2 percent of computer users in Asia are on Facebook; 1 percent in Africa (CNN) -- Seriously ... at this point, who's not on Facebook? Grandmas are commenting on their teen grandkids' angst-ridden status updates. One of your grade-school teachers wants you to join their mafia. Candidates for the Planning and Zoning Commission have fan pages. So does actor Will Arnett's voice. Not Will Arnett. Just his voice. On Wednesday, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that the site hit a half-billion active users. That's nearly five times as many people as watched this year's Super Bowl -- the most popular television broadcast ever -- and about four times as many people as voted in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. People spend more than 700 billion minutes per month on the site and, according to Facebook, 400 million of them have logged in during the past month. Keep in mind there are only 309 million people in the United States -- total. So, seriously ... who's left? In the United States, the answer comes pretty close to this: "nobody who (a) would like to have an account and (b) is able to create one." "In certain countries, particularly the United States and Western Europe, Facebook has actually reached a point where it appears they've saturated the market," said Justin Smith, founder of Inside Facebook, which offers news and market research on the social networking giant. Sure, there are the people who just don't use computers. And everyone knows that one guy who can't wait for Facebook to come up in conversation, just so he can loudly and proudly announce he's not a part of the network. There also were a handful of users who bolted in recent months over privacy concerns. But in the United States, it seems like that's about it. "It's people who are not computer users -- either really young or really old and for whom using technology just isn't a part of their daily lives," Smith said. "For people who do rely on technology, Facebook has just really become a common way to function and get a lot of normal things done." But while it might seem to U.S. users like everybody is on Facebook, most of the world's internet users actually aren't. According to the International Telecommunication Union, there are about 1.7 billion people in the world with internet access. Since everyone on Facebook has to use the internet, that means Facebook can count about 40 percent of the digitally enabled population as its users. So the majority of Web users -- 60 percent -- still aren't on the site. In densely populated India and the teeming cities of Brazil, local social networking sites have won the loyalties of internet users. But Facebook has them in its sights. 
In certain countries, ... Facebook has actually reached a point where it appears they've saturated the market.--Justin Smith, founder of Inside Facebook

Facebook says it has 12 million users in India, up from just 8 million earlier this year. And in statistics updated on Wednesday, Facebook listed 6 million users in Brazil, the first time it had offered statistics for that country. Google-owned Orkut has been the top social site in Brazil. And Brazil has the world's second-highest reach by social networking, with 85 percent of internet users visiting the sites, according to web stats firm comScore. The number of active computer users on Facebook in Asia is just a little over 2 percent and it's just about 1 percent in Africa, two places Facebook is targeting. And in those areas, there's a familiar-looking pattern that might mean the Facebook boom could be on the way. Students are becoming the early adopters, followed by young adults -- presumably opening up the possibilities that older and younger folks could be on the way. "Those growth patterns really are mirroring what happened in the U.S.," Smith said. To analysts, that means a half-billion users might not even be close to Facebook's potential. "Is one billion users possible? With revenue approaching $1 billion and extensive efforts underway in mobile that can help Facebook extend its reach in the developing world, it certainly can't be ruled out," wrote Adam Ostrow, editor-in-chief of social media blog Mashable, which is a CNN content partner. So, if you're a Facebook user in Cairo, Seoul or Rio, get ready. Grandma just might be on her way.

 Facebook CEO interviewed on IPO, lawsuit and more 

By Jolie O'Dell, Mashable | Filed under: Social Media   "The real story of Facebook is just that we've worked so hard for all this time," Zuckerberg says in his interview with Sawyer. STORY HIGHLIGHTS  Zuckerberg says "The Social Network" seems a lot more exciting than the real-life history   The CEO denies ever signing a contract that gives ownership of his website to Paul Ceglia  "At some point along the path, I think it'll make sense to have an IPO," Zuckerberg says  The interview will air tonight on ABC's "World News with Diane Sawyer"

 (Mashable) -- In an interview that will air tonight on ABC's "World News with Diane Sawyer," Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg talked frankly about an upcoming IPO, the Facebook movie, a shady lawsuit and much more. As far as the movie "The Social Network" is concerned, Zuckerberg seemed to echo Facebook co-founder Dustin Moscovitz's opinion that the film seems a lot more exciting than the real-life version of Facebook's history. "I just think people have a lot of fiction.... The real story of Facebook is just that we've worked so hard for all this time," Zuckerberg said in his interview with Sawyer. "I mean, the real story is actually probably pretty boring, right? ...We just sat at our computers for six years and coded." Somewhere in that six years of coding, however, it is alleged that Zuckerberg signed a contract that would give ownership of his website to a web designer and former associate at Harvard, one Paul Ceglia. Although a Facebook lawyer said yesterday the company is "unsure" whether such a contract was ever signed, Zuckerberg told Sawyer unequivocally, "We did not sign a contract that says that [Ceglia has] any right to ownership over Facebook." As far as an initial public offering of stock is concerned, Facebook's IPO is one of the most hotly anticipated by many in the tech world. The company is currently valued at upwards of $20 billion and is expected to generate around $1 billion in revenue in 2010.  Zuckerberg told Sawyer that, while he and the rest of the Facebook team are still rather single-mindedly focused on product, "At some point along the path, I think it'll make sense to have an IPO. But we're not running the company to do that. We're running the company to serve more people." Of course, Sawyer's interview also touches on the privacy debacle ("We have made mistakes, for sure," said Zuckerberg) and the site's crossing the 500-million-user mark (Zuckerberg said the journey had been "surreal") as well as several other topics.

 Should Facebook add a dislike button? 

By Pete Cashmore, Special to CNN | Filed under: Social Media     A 'dislike' button on Facebook? Mashable's Pete Cashmore says don't hold your breath. STORY HIGHLIGHTS A Facebook group for the concept has nearly 3.2 million fans  Like buttons result in more connections, which creates more value  Dislike buttons would create tension between Facebook, brands, web publishers

Facebook Inc.

 (CNN) -- Editor's note: Pete Cashmore is founder and CEO of Mashable, a popular blog about social media. He is writing a weekly column about social networking and tech for CNN.com. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told ABC's Diane Sawyer this week that Facebook would "definitely think about" adding a Dislike button to the site, allowing users to express distaste for updates or pages on Facebook.  But Zuckerberg is just humoring us: Facebook will never add a Dislike button, regardless of users' demands.  Here's why:  Demand for the dislike button There's certainly some demand for dislikes. In answer to Sawyer's question on whether a Dislike button would be considered, Zuckerberg replied: "We listen to all the user suggestions and it's something that we've thought about. You know, people like the Like button so much ... I dunno, it's something that we would definitely think about. People definitely seem to want it." A Facebook group for the concept has nearly 3.2 million fans, while there are at least two unofficial extensions for the Firefox browser -- FaceMod and Facebook Dislike -- that claim to add a Dislike button for those users who install them. Those clamoring for a "thumbs down" option seem to fall into two camps. For some, "Liking" tragic news seems inappropriate -- and yet Facebook does offer a "Share" option on its own site, while third party sites can opt to use a "Recommend" button instead. Others simply want to express distaste for a page or news update -- this is a move Facebook will never make, however, because it doesn't align with the company's interests.  The role of the Like button The Like button serves numerous purposes for Facebook. One obvious benefit is that it lowers the psychological barrier to connecting with commercial entities on the site -- while previously users could "Become a Fan" of a brand, they now imply "Like" that brand's page, resulting in higher engagement. Another is that it increases clicks for web publishers: Facebook users are more inclined to "Like" a news article than they are to hit a "Share" button. A third benefit: Facebook aims to connect people who share similar interests. Like buttons result in more connections, which creates more value. Downside of Dislike buttons A Dislike button provides none of these benefits. In fact it would create significant tension between Facebook, brands, and web publishers. Imagine if Facebook users could not only choose to "Like" Coca-Cola, but were also provided the option to "Dislike" the brand. Would Facebook become a more appealing place for brands to spend their marketing budgets and ad dollars ... or a less appealing one? Now imagine that websites could add "Dislike" buttons to their pages. Would web publishers rush to add this option, desperate for the negative feedback from their visitors? Hardly.  And what about Facebook's mission to "make the world more open and connected"?  While Like buttons connect Facebook users to their interests, Dislike buttons serve no such purpose. Like buttons are about connection; Dislike buttons are about division.  In short, Facebook will never add a Dislike button because it would damage the company's relationships with brands, businesses and web publishers -- these groups are essential for building both web traffic and ad revenue.  Like it or not, Dislike buttons aren't coming to Facebook anytime soon.© 2013 MASHABLE.com. All rights reserved.

 Facebook Questions: Brilliant or useless? By  Pete Cashmore, Special to CNN | Filed under: Social Media     Mashable's Pete Cashmore says Facebook Questions bears similarities to Quora and Aardvark -- a positive sign.

Social Software and Tagging

Editor's note: Pete Cashmore is founder and CEO of Mashable, a popular blog about social media. He is writing a weekly column about social networking and tech for CNN.com.  (CNN) -- Facebook began rolling out an ambitious new product this week: A "question and answer" service.  Facebook Questions hopes to deliver relevant answers to your queries, served up by friends and other members of the Facebook community. But such Q&A services have a mixed record: Some provide invaluable answers from topic experts, while others simply spread misinformation. Which camp does Facebook Questions fall into? The quality question The poorest performing Q&A sites typically have a broad audience consisting of few experts. Yahoo Answers, which has built massive traffic from search engine queries, is regularly cited for its inane questions and uninsightful answers. At the time of writing, the most popular question on Yahoo Answers is "How to disguise weed smoke?" The top-rated answer, meanwhile, is "how 'bout not smoking weed?" This "open" model -- in which users weigh in regardless of topic-based expertise -- works well for Yahoo and its ilk since their primary interest is in building traffic to sell ads against. For any question you type into Google, the chances are that someone already asked it on Yahoo Answers -- that page will show up in your search results, creating traffic and ad revenue for Yahoo when you click. But for those seeking genuine insight, Yahoo's offering falls flat. Relevance and expertise A new breed of Q&A services uses online profiles to deliver expert-driven answers. Aardvark, now part of Google, asks the user to log in using his or her Facebook account, before directing the question to the most qualified people in that person's social network. Unsurprisingly, the answers received are of far higher quality than on Yahoo Answers. Another Q&A service receiving critical acclaim is Quora, founded by former Facebook CTO Adam D'Angelo. Quora also increases relevancy through the use of social-networking profiles: Log in with your Facebook account, and the site will suggest topics for you to "Follow" based on your expertise. This system increases the odds of receiving answers from experts. Is it a coincidence that two of the best new Q&A sites leverage information gleaned from Facebook to deliver more relevant answers? If third-party sites can match questions to topic experts using social-networking profiles, surely Facebook can do an even better job? A good start Facebook Questions does bear many similarities to Quora and Aardvark -- a very positive sign. For instance, you can "tag" your question with a topic, and Facebook will direct the question to those users who list that topic in their interests.  And of course Facebook understands that we tend to share a lot in common with our friends (and friends of friends) -- so questions are targeted to your network to increase the chances of a useful answer. But Facebook's new service could still go the way of Yahoo Answers. While in testing mode, Questions benefits from the fact that there is currently no public database of questions and the product is not being indexed by search engines -- should Facebook open up the product in this way, the quality of answers could fall. Privacy issues remain While the product is still embryonic, Facebook Questions looks to be a well-crafted product that could deliver highly relevant answers to your questions. But that doesn't mean it will be without its critics. Every question asked with the tool is public -- a fact that could raise the ire of privacy advocates. Others might see Facebook Questions as yet another distraction -- something to be blocked out along with "fun quizzes" and incessant FarmVille updates from friends. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Pete Cashmore.

 Facebook launches Questions feature 

By Ben Parr, Mashable.com | Filed under: Social Media   Facebook Questions will allow users to pose questions to the Facebook community, much like Yahoo! Answers. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Facebook has begun the rollout of a new feature, Facebook Questions  Questions will allow users to get answers to their queries from the Facebook community  Feature will roll out to a limited group of beta testers Thursday
RELATED TOPICS


Facebook Inc.

Yahoo! Answers

Search Engines

 (Mashable.com) -- Facebook has begun the rollout of a new feature, Facebook Questions, which will allow users to get answers to their queries from the entire Facebook community. Similar in concept to Yahoo! Answers, Quora and Mahalo, Facebook Questions gives users the opportunity to ask questions just by clicking the "Ask Question" button on the homepage. Questions is also available on friends' profiles just as you would post on someone's wall. We first learned of Facebook's Q&A feature two months ago, when the company started asking for volunteers to beta test the product. The world's largest social network even went so far as to promise beta testers a trip to Facebook's offices to meet with the Q&A team. I had the chance earlier today to discuss the new feature with several Facebook employees. Questions has several defining features: • Photo questions: For example, if you take a picture of a bird, but don't know what species it is, you can post the picture on Facebook Questions and get your answer.  • Polling: If you're simply looking for the answer to "Which city is better: Chicago or Dallas?", you can get your answer by creating a poll.  • Tagging: The company seems to be placing a lot of emphasis on tagging questions based on category or topic. The goal seems to be to make Q&A discovery an easier and faster process by making it simple to look up questions on cooking, photography, San Francisco or a variety of other topics.  • Topic exploration: Facebook described this as a roulette-type feature that allows users to browse Facebook's eventual mountain of Q&A. Under the "Questions about" drop-down menu, there's a feature called "Everything" that allows users to browse the company's catalog of questions.  • Following: You can follow specific questions for updates and new answers. • Updated homepage: Facebook Questions does actually change the homepage, adding a new bar at the top of the page where you can choose to update your status, ask a question, add photos, or post a link. There was one more thing that Facebook made clear to me: Facebook Questions is not an advertising product. While brands with Facebook Pages will eventually be able to answer questions, it's not meant to be a promotional platform; it's meant to be a useful and insightful product for users. Facebook Questions will roll out to a limited group of beta testers today, but the company promises to "bring this product to all of you as quickly as we can." The entire feature is public, so we don't suggest posting those awkward bedroom questions on Facebook. Will Facebook Questions prove to be more useful than Quora or even Twitter as a Q&A platform? We think so, if only because it has the biggest advantage of them all: 500 million users.© 2013 MASHABLE.com. All rights reserved.

 (CNN) -- Social-networking giant Facebook has entered the check-in world. Facebook executives on Wednesday announced the launch of Facebook Places, which -- similar to services such as Foursquare and Gowalla -- will allow people to use the GPS on their mobile phones to let friends know exactly where they are. Facebook Places is available immediately in the United States through the latest version of Facebook's iPhone app and, for other advanced mobile phones, through the company's site for advanced mobile devices, executives announced at Facebook's headquarters in Palo Alto, California. Users who wish to announce their location to their friends on Facebook would tap a "check in" button to see a list of places nearby, and then choose the place that matches where they are. "After checking in, your check-in will create a story in your friends' News Feeds [on Facebook] and show up in the Recent Activity section on the page for that place," Places product manager Michael Sharon wrote on Facebook's blog. What do you think of the new feature? Facebook staff also said the feature will be useful not only to let friends know where they are, but also to learn if their friends are nearby at the same time, and to write down what they are doing at the location and what they think about it -- creating a trail allowing friends to see what the writer did there days or even years ago. When users check into a place, they also can "tag" any Facebook friends who are with them, essentially letting other friends know that the person is there, too. To cut down on the potential for users to falsely tag friends to a place, people can tag friends only if the taggers themselves check in to the location, too. Sharon, speaking during Wednesday's announcement, said Places has other safeguards to address potential privacy concerns.  First, check-ins will appear only to users' Facebook friends as a default, and users can further trim the recipients list to specific friends. Users also can remove check-ins by phone or web at any time, Sharon said. Facebook said it would make Places available in other countries and on more mobile platforms soon. Facebook staff said the company planned to let Foursquare, Gowalla and other services enhance their current integration with Facebook. Executives with Foursquare and Gowalla were at Wednesday's announcement in Palo Alto, previewing plans to ramp up how their users will announce their locations on the social-networking site. The past year has seen big growth in the relatively new mobile check-in space. Foursquare, which essentially made its debut in 2009 at the South by Southwest Interactive festival in Austin, Texas, was one of the combatants in a so-called "Location War" at this year's festival, going heads-up with Austin-based rival Gowalla. Since then, Foursquare has become the clear favorite of the two -- and a darling of tech media, even as it looks for ways to turn a profit. Boasting a half-million users at the start of SXSW, Foursquare doubled that in about a month then needed only another three months to hit 2 million last month. On mobile apps like Foursquare, users "check in" at restaurants, bars, movie theaters or just about anywhere else they visit. The idea is twofold -- to let friends know what you're up to, while racking up points and earning virtual badges in the application's gaming element. The New York-based Foursquare has begun forging some corporate partnerships and some businesses have started offering discounts and other deals for users who check in frequently. Facebook, with its half-billion users, represents a massive potential user base for Places.CNN's Doug Gross and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.

 Report: Older users flocking to Facebook, Twitter By  Doug Gross, CNN | Filed under: Social Media   While younger people are the majority on social-media sites, the number of users over 50 is the fastest growing, a survey says. STORY HIGHLIGHTS In a year, percentage of over-50 users on sites like Facebook, Twitter nearly doubled  The figure was charted in a survey reported Friday by the Pew Research Center  Older users say the recent spike has been noticeable  They say networking sites help to contact old friends and stay current on new trends

Pew Research Center

 (CNN) -- Nancy Ehrlich was nearing 50 and frustrated, teaching at her small Pennsylvania town's elementary school with colleagues who didn't share her love of technology. Then, last summer, she found Twitter. Now, Ehrlich -- who turns 51 in a few weeks -- barely qualifies for the fastest-growing club on the Web. The number of internet users over 50 who use social-networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter have nearly doubled in the past year, according to a study released Friday. "It definitely has changed my whole life -- that's how significant Twitter is to me," said Ehrlich, who now regularly chats with educators around the world and helps host a weekly forum for them on the micro-blogging site. "At first, I didn't really get it. But I just kept watching it and, before you knew it, I was hooked." Between April 2009 and May, the percentage of internet users 50 and up who said they use social-networking sites has risen from 22 percent to 42 percent, according to the survey by the Pew Research Center. Respondents 65 and older reported a 100 percent increase, while those between 50 and 64 jumped 88 percent. By comparison, the number of users from 18-29 who said they use networking sites rose a much more meager 13 percent. For anyone who logs on to sites such as Facebook and Twitter, the increase in older users is probably pretty obvious. It's not unusual for three generations of one family to chat on Facebook now. (Yes, teenager, that means grandma might comment on your angst-ridden status update.)  And just last month, Ivy Bean, who, at 104 was believed to be the world's oldest active Twitter user, passed away in England -- a sad event tweeted by nursing-home staff to her more than 60,000 followers. But the Pew report highlights just how dramatic, and fast, the spike in older users has been. "Young adults continue to be the heaviest users of social media, but their growth pales in comparison with recent gains made by older users," said Mary Madden, a senior research specialist with the Pew Research Center's Internet & American Life Project and author of the report.  "E-mail is still the primary way that older users maintain contact with friends, families and colleagues, but many older users now rely on social-network platforms to help manage their daily communications." Roland Provost, 65, said he's definitely noticed the increase. He's been on Twitter and Facebook -- as well as being an active "World of Warcraft" player -- for several years. "It's been a major evolution in the last year or so ...," said Provost, of Dover, New Hampshire. "Almost all my old high school friends are on. It's been amazing to reconnect. "Before a year ago, I was there, but I didn't know anybody else over 30." Older users often say keeping in touch with family and friends is a key reason they use the networking sites. "There are few other spaces -- online or offline -- where tweens, teens, sandwich generation members, grandparents, friends and neighbors regularly intersect and communicate across the same network," Madden said. And while the stereotype of older users has been that they only log in every so often to look at pictures of the kids or grandkids, the report suggests otherwise. About 44 percent of respondents who said they use Facebook-like sites said they had used one within a day of when they got the phone call. In all, 47 percent of internet users from 50-64 said they use social media, as did 26 percent of those 65 and older.  They still have a long way to go to catch up with younger users, though -- by comparison, 86 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds say they use social-networking sites. Ehrlich, whose Twitter account is @NancyTeaches, said she also uses Facebook. But she's found the two sites are good for different things. "Facebook is the people I went to high school with and Twitter are the people in my life now," said the Ambler, Pennsylvania, teacher. "For my age group, it's a very reflective time in our lives, so that's why I think Facebook is so popular. "But as a teacher, I had a different agenda. I wasn't looking to reconnect with people, I was looking to learn and feel challenged." The Pew report is based on a nationwide telephone survey in the United States of 2,252 adults. The margin of error is 2 percent for the total group and 3 percent for internet users.

 Facebook working with GLAAD to stop anti-gay bullying 

By Jolie O'Dell, Mashable | Filed under: Social Media     Facebook "intends to work closely with GLAAD and other LGBT organizations on future initiatives." STORY HIGHLIGHTSGLAAD teams up with Facebook to reduce hate speech on internetAfter recent tragic events, celebs and organizations have taken to web to fight bullyingMTV Networks even rolled out an iPhone app to help combat bullying

Facebook Inc.

Bullying

 (Mashable)  -- The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) has teamed up with Facebook to reduce the amount of hate speech and anti-gay bullying that goes on around the internet. Members of the gay community reached out to GLAAD recently when a Facebook page created to remember the victims of anti-gay bullying who had committed suicide was flooded with hateful, violent and derogatory remarks and images.  Fortunately, GLAAD was able to work with Facebook to remove the content, and this organization's work with Facebook has just begun. Recently, tragic events that included the use of technology to shame and harass a college student, Tyler Clementi, because of his sexual preference led to Clementi's suicide.  And this sad news came just a couple weeks after 15-year-old Billy Lucas committed suicide after being tormented by other young people about his sexuality. Since then, celebrities, organizations and social media users have taken to the web to spread words of encouragement and discourage bullying behavior. Columnist Dan Savage launched a YouTube channel, "It Gets Better," and many celebrities have spoken out on YouTube about LGBT issues and teen bullying. MTV Networks even rolled out an iPhone app to help combat bullying. Still, the largest online destination for many beleaguered gay teens and young adults is Facebook -- ironically, one of the platforms where hate speech, though prohibited, is unfortunately still carried out. Today, Facebook announced that they're making new efforts to respond quickly when hateful speech violates the terms of service and needs to be removed. And this isn't just routine TOS policing, either. Facebook Public Policy Communications Manager Andrew Noyes wrote in an email today that Facebook "intends to work closely with GLAAD and other LGBT organizations on future initiatives." Stay tuned for more information on how exactly the social network plans to support LGBT teens and the larger gay community.© 2013 MASHABLE.com. All rights reserved.

Facebook Inc.

 (Mashable)  -- In an update to one of the more iconic "year-end" magazine editions, People has launched a "Sexiest Man Alive on Facebook" campaign to complement its "Sexiest Man Alive" issue, which hits newsstands later this month. For the campaign, People has chosen five celebs that aren't just "sexy" (as defined by the editors, we presume), but also have a big presence in social media.  Notably, the Old Spice guy is on the list, as well as Vin Diesel (who we've long noted is disproportionately popular on Facebook) and NFL social media super user Chad Ochocinco. Enrique Iglesias and "Jersey Shore's" Pauly D round out the five celebrities that People's Facebook fans can vote for through November 10.  The winner will be revealed in the "Sexiest Man Alive" issue -- the 25th edition of the feature. While hardly the most innovative application, we imagine it will be a win for People -- which also recently launched its iPad app -- as its social media obsessed nominees encourage their fans to vote.  Who do you think should take the title? Let us know in the comments.© 2013 MASHABLE.com. All rights reserved.

 Facebook knows when you'll break upBy  Doug Gross, CNN | Filed under: Social Media   This chart tracks relationship trouble via Facebook status updates, which show a spike of breakups in the spring. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Facebook graph shows when people are most likely to breakup  Journalist David McCandless scraped 10,000 status updates for words "break up" or "broken up"  Spring and pre-Christmas are most treacherous; Christmas Day the safest

Relationships

Internet

 (CNN) -- Worried about when you might get dumped? Facebook knows. That's according to a graphic making the rounds online that uses Facebook status updates to chart what time of year people are splitting up. British journalist and graphic designer David McCandless, who specializes in showcasing data in visual ways, compiled the chart. He showed off the graphic at a TED conference last July in Oxford, England. In the talk, McCandless said he and a colleague scraped 10,000 Facebook status updates for the phrases "breakup" and "broken up." They found two big spikes on the calendar for breakups. The first was after Valentine's Day -- that holiday has a way of defining relationships, for better or worse -- and in the weeks leading up to spring break. Maybe spring fever makes people restless, or maybe college students just don't want to be tied down when they're partying in Cancun. And let's hear it for cheapskates. The other big romantically treacherous time, according to the graph, is about two weeks before Christmas -- presumably as people begin pricing gifts for their significant others. Mondays, as if they weren't bad enough, are the most likely day to break up. Summer and fall look like the safest seasons. And, possibly showing that some people's sense of humor is more twisted than others, there's a spike in breakups on April Fool's Day. What single day are you least likely to get a "Dear John (or Jane)" letter? "Christmas Day," McCandless said. "Who would do that?" (Via blogger Matthias Mikkelsen)

 (Mashable) -- It's official: the British Monarchy has decided to join Facebook. Before you rush off to friend -- or, even more boldly, poke -- your favorite queen or heir to the throne, note that it's only an official Page that will go live Monday morning, rather than individual profiles for each member of the monarchy. This is the fourth profile Britain's royal family will have set up on a social networking site, having established a channel on video-sharing site YouTube in 2007, a profile on microblogging service Twitter in 2009 and an official photostream on photo-sharing site Flickr earlier this year. The Page, a collaborative effort between Buckingham Palace, Clarence House and the Royal Collection, will feature a mix of news, links, videos and photographs of various members -- primarily Queen Elizabeth, and Princes Charles, William and Harry. Those who "Like" the Page will be able to receive updates about the Royal Family's doings through their Facebook News Feed. Users will also be able to follow the Family's official engagements via the wall of an affiliated Page, dubbed the Court Circular.

 Too drunk for Facebook? This tool may helpBy  Doug Gross, CNN | Filed under: Social Media   "Social Media Sobriety Test" lets users prove they're at least relatively sober before ill-advised, booze-induced Web posts. STORY HIGHLIGHTS "Social Media Sobriety Test" lets users check themselves before posting  Firefox plug-in has tests like writing the alphabet backward or following moving objects  The plug-in works on sites like Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Myspace

Internet

 (CNN) -- Regretting that drunken tweet from Friday? Did your mom's reply to your 3 a.m. Facebook video post reveal that, in the sober light of morning, it might not have been a good idea? Help is just a download away. "The Social Media Sobriety Test," a free Firefox plug-in from online-security company Webroot, lets users name sites, like Facebook and Twitter, on which they'd like a little oversight. Set the hours you feel most likely to give in to booze-fueled temptation, and the plug-in will ask you to pass a simple test before being able log on. "Nothing good happens online after 1a.m.," reads the Web page for the add-on, promising to help "put an end to the embarrassment that follows regrettable, late-night posts." "Pass a simple test to prove you're sound of mind," it says. "Post away or, if you fail, maybe just go to bed." A test on Monday required this writer [who was stone-cold sober, thank you very much] to keep the computer's cursor inside a moving circle. Brenna Ehrlich over at social-media blog Mashable, however, reports flunking a sign-in test while sober. "You try typing the alphabet backwards," she wrote. "It's not as easy as it looks." The site also lets users set up the test on Myspace, photo site Flickr, blog host Tumblr and YouTube. The user can manually add other social-media sites to the list. As evidence of the need for its service, the app's page features a scroll of what appear to be Twitter posts that could have been avoided. "There may be a video that just popped up of me singing Taylor Swift's 'Mine.' I may or may not be drunk in it," says one. "My boss is drunk in my living room when all I really wanna do is read Harry Potter before bed," says another. The feature is similar to Google's "Mail Goggles." That app requires Gmail users who install it to solve math problems before sending booze-soaked messages late at night on weekends.

 Labor board: Facebook vent against supervisor not grounds for firingFrom  Monika Plocienniczak, CNN | Filed under: Social Media  Dare to trash your boss on Facebook?STORY HIGHLIGHTSAn EMT in Connecticut complained about her supervisor on her Facebook pageShe was fired, with the company saying it was for her work, not her Facebook writingsThe National Labor Relations board has issued a complaint against the companyOpinion: Facebook, freedom and thin-skinned bosses  (CNN) -- In what could prove to be a precedent-setting case, the National Labor Relations Board has issued a complaint against a Connecticut company for firing an employee after she posted critical, derogatory comments about her supervisor on Facebook. The company, ambulance service American Medical Response, says emergency medical technician Dawnmarie Souza was fired because of "multiple, serious complaints about her behavior," not because she took to a social networking site to describe her supervisor in various unflattering terms, among the mildest of which was comparing the supervisor to a psychiatric patient. The labor board, a federal agency that oversees union elections and investigates claims of unfair labor practices, accuses the company of illegally terminating Souza and denying her access to union representation during an investigatory review. The labor relations board argues that workers' criticism of their bosses on social networking sites like Facebook is generally "a protected concerted activity." "You are permitted to talk about terms and conditions with employees or anyone else, it's public because you are protected under the National Labor Act," says Jonathan Kreisberg, the board's regional director in Hartford, Connecticut.

Kreisberg says that in addition to describing her supervisor in unflattering and sometimes vulgar terms on her Facebook page, Souza also wrote about "how the company allows a 17 to be a supervisor." The 17 reference is the company's jargon for a psychiatric patient, Kreisberg says. The National Labor Act gives workers the right to form unions and it prohibits employers from taking action against employees -- union or non-union -- for discussing working conditions, says Kreisberg. He adds that the case could be "ground-breaking" because it is in the uncharted legal territory of social networking sites on the internet. "It was Souza's ... own page; she did this on her own time in her own home. This case is different because in this situation it happened online and the company's rules were unlawfully broad," says Kreisberg. In a statement to CNN, American Medical Response says it believes that the offensive statements made against the co-worker were not activities protected under federal law. The company "denies the allegations made by the NLRB and believes the facts will show that they are without merit. The employee in question was discharged based on multiple, serious complaints about her behavior," the statement says. An attorney representing the ambulance company adds, "This is not about Facebook." "This employee was terminated after the company received complaints on two separate incidents in 2009. All pointed to Souza's rude and discourteous behavior with patients," says attorney Jackson Lewis. Souza, who was fired last December and who is seeking reinstatement to her job, declined comment to CNN, saying only that granting an interview would "jeopardize her case at this point." On the issue of assistance from a union representative, the labor board says Souza wanted help from the union representing the company's workers when she wrote up a response to the company. The company's lawyer says she was not denied union representation. "Before submitting her response, she checked in with her union representative," says Lewis. A labor board hearing for the case is scheduled for January 25.

 Could Facebook replace your e-mail inbox? By  Pete Cashmore, Special to CNN | Filed under: Social Media     Facebook may want to compete with your current e-mail provider, Pete Cashmore says. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Facebook may be overhauling its Messages feature next week  Pete Cashmore: Facebook wants to become "the hub of online communication"   But for more serious correspondence, Facebook unlikely to be medium of choice
RELATED TOPICS


Facebook Inc.

Google Gmail

Internet

Yahoo! Inc.

MSN Hotmail

Editor's Note: Pete Cashmore is founder and CEO of Mashable, a popular blog about social media. He writes a weekly column about social networking and tech for CNN.com.   (CNN) -- Facebook is inviting the press to a special event Monday, leading some to speculate that the company is set to overhaul its Messages product. The basis for the speculation? The invite prominently displays Facebook's inbox logo. With some additional features, Facebook may even compete with your current e-mail provider, the theory goes. Facebook hasn't confirmed the speculation, of course, and there are alternative explanations for what the social networking site may unveil. (One possibility: Facebook could bring its chat product to mobile devices.)  But let's imagine that Facebook's long-rumored overhaul of its Messages product does transpire, either at this event or in the future: Could it pose a threat to existing e-mail providers? Will Facebook users begin to use Facebook Messages more, and their existing e-mail accounts less? While I'm usually bullish on Facebook's ability to make any new product stick -- with 500 million users, even a minuscule adoption rate means millions of users -- I'm not sure the company would be able to dominate e-mail completely. In one context -- personal communications -- Facebook could certainly make inroads. The service is already the leading venue to connect with friends online, and providing standard e-mail features such as POP, IMAP, attachments, forwarding and an "@facebook.com" e-mail address would possibly lead some users to retire their accounts on Yahoo, Windows Live Hotmail, AOL or Gmail.  For Facebook, this would be a masterstroke: Virtually all of its major competitors have popular e-mail products. What's more, by combining social networking, chat and e-mail, Facebook would become the hub of online communication. However, there's very little chance that Facebook Messages will ever be used for professional correspondence. Facebook is already banned in many corporate settings: It's considered a time-waster and a potential security threat to some companies.  Even for those unburdened by such restrictions, it's hard to imagine anyone conducting serious business through Facebook accounts. For instance: Would a job applicant appear more professional sending his or her resume via a Gmail address or a Facebook one? It's clear that Facebook wants to become the ultimate contact list for everyone on the Web: Its social graph is an attempt to map all of the connections between its users.  And yet the name "Facebook" is still strongly associated with personal pursuits, from photo sharing to playing FarmVille. To shake off those associations would be an arduous task.  Facebook could, if it so desired, become a leader in personal e-mail between friends and family members -- but for more serious correspondence, it's unlikely to be the medium of choice.

 Facebook overhauling inbox, combining e-mail, texting and IMBy  Mark Milian, CNN | Filed under: Social Media   Facebook is overhauling its messaging system, said CEO Mark Zuckerberg at an event Monday. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Facebook's overhaul aims to help users communicate more seamlessly  All Facebook users can get an @facebook.com email address  The system combines e-mail with text messaging and chat  Overhaul will come in a "slow rollout," with more users getting updates over time  San Francisco, California (CNN) -- Facebook wants to be your inbox for every kind of message. The world's largest social networking company is providing each of its 500 million users with an @facebook.com e-mail address as part of a revamped messaging system that integrates with various types of communications. Facebook's new inbox can tie together mail sent to someone's e-mail address, instant-message aliases and cell phone number in addition to Facebook's own messages and chat conversations. Like the News Feed, unread notes are ranked by how important Facebook thinks the sender is in your life, and users can tweak those settings. "Because we know who your friends are," said Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, "we can do some really good filtering for you." Rather than creating separate threads for each conversation, Facebook logs all communications and groups them together by contact. So all chats with your mom are listed on one page. Based on a brief demo Monday, the stripped-down page resembles an IM or text-message window, eliminating the option of e-mail subject lines.

"I should only need those two things: a person and a message," Andrew Bosworth, a software engineer at Facebook, said at the company's news event Monday. "The system is definitely not e-mail. We've actually modeled it more after chat." Incoming messages pop up on the bottom of Facebook's site, similar to the chat feature. "We think that we should take features away from messaging," Zuckerberg said. "We think it should be minimal." But like e-mail, users can attach files. Sharing documents via Microsoft's Office Web Apps service will be integrated "over the coming months," a Microsoft spokeswoman said. The inbox is broken into three folders. The "social inbox" contains conversations with your top contacts -- people you message with most often. An "other" folder keeps correspondences of less importance, or those with people or companies that Facebook's system is not familiar with, such as banking notices. (Operators of pages you've "Liked" can send messages to this folder as well.) Finally, the service filters what it thinks is spam into a last bin. Facebook will launch this with a "slow rollout," said Bosworth, turning it on for more users over time. Facebook's iPhone application will support the new inbox Monday for accounts that have it enabled, Bosworth said. The system may incorporate more services later. Zuckerberg said he considered voice as one. For instant messaging, it supports Jabber -- the underlying technology of Google Chat -- but not Skype, AIM or Windows Live Messenger. Support for IMAP, which would allow Facebook.com e-mail users to access their inbox from a program such as Microsoft's Outlook, is in development, Zuckerberg said. Zuckerberg opened the announcement by talking about changes in how young people communicate. He reminisced about a conversation with some high school students who said they primarily talked through Facebook and text messaging on their phones. E-mail is "too slow," he recalled them saying. "It's not that e-mail doesn't get delivered immediately," Zuckerberg said. "It's too formal." Numerous studies, as recently as April of this year, have found that e-mail is a very small part of how young people keep in touch. Facebook has modeled its new system to reflect those trends. Zuckerberg said 350 million people use its system for private correspondences, transmitting 4 billion messages a day. Zuckerberg will take the stage again Tuesday during the Web 2.0 Summit, presumably to elaborate on this new system, which Bosworth said has been among the company's biggest undertakings. The project took about 18 months of work from 15 engineers -- the largest team the company has ever devoted to a new product, Bosworth said.

 Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg prefers underdogsBy Mark Milian, CNN | Filed under: Social Media   Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg predicts great opportunity for entrepeneurs, whereas larger companies could struggle. STORY HIGHLIGHTSFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg favors "underdogs" and entrepreneursApple and Google have struggled to make apps that work well with FacebookSmall companies can freely build apps that work with Facebook San Francisco, California (CNN) -- Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg favors the little guy, but that attitude can pose obstacles for popular websites that want to work with his company. Apple and Google, which are among the biggest technology businesses in the world, find themselves stonewalled at times by Zuckerberg and company. That sometimes results in less functional applications. Apple launched its music-centric social network, called Ping, as part of an iTunes update that contained a Facebook component. But Apple had to remove integration with the world's largest social network hours after Ping launched. Last week Twitter announced an agreement with Apple's Ping. Steve Jobs, Apple's CEO, spurned Facebook for what he considered were "onerous terms."  When questioned about this in an interview onstage at the Web 2.0 Summit in San Francisco on Tuesday, Zuckerberg said with a shrug, "It's fine."

Then Zuckerberg pointed out that the two work together in many ways. For example, Facebook's app "is on the vast majority of iPhones," he said at an event earlier this month at Facebook's Palo Alto, California, headquarters. As for Facebook's relationship with Google, the two are in the midst of a public spat about letting users import and export personal data between the social network and Gmail. Facebook, which launched an email service on Monday, doesn't let users easily migrate addresses to other apps. Zuckerberg said at the conference on Tuesday that this move was meant to protect the private contact information of a user's friends. He backtracked near the end of that fireside chat and highlighted the data export issue as a potential mistake. "I've made so many mistakes in running the company so far," he said. "We still make mistakes all of the time." The trouble, he said, is figuring out which of the company's myriad problems "really matter." Zuckerberg also seemed to distance himself from Google, the undisputed leader in search, last month when Facebook announced a deal with Microsoft's Bing. "They're just trying to rapidly gain [market] share by doing awesome stuff," Zuckerberg said of Microsoft at the Bing event. "They're really the underdog here." But Microsoft wasn't spared from criticisms during Tuesday's event. Microsoft, a massive computer software company and an investor in Facebook, has thousands of engineers, Zuckerberg pointed out; Facebook has fewer, and is therefore seen by developers as a more effective and attractive employer, he said. Zuckerberg makes it known that he has a soft spot for budding entrepreneurs. When asked about "The Social Network" -- the film based on the founding of Facebook -- Zuckerberg boasted of fan mail from people who say his story inspired them to become entrepreneurs. His mission is to "enable others to build" social networking services, which can be accomplished using Facebook's platform, he said. Small-time developers can freely make use of Facebook's offerings, but larger companies must work directly or be locked out. Despite amassing 500 million people actively using the service, Zuckerberg still doesn't consider Facebook a giant company. "In some ways, I actually think we're only now entering the zone where a lot of entrepreneurs will consider working with us," he said. But during Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz's onstage interview earlier Tuesday, she described Facebook as Yahoo's "competition." This sentiment could create even greater disconnects between Facebook's service and popular apps, as is the case with Gmail and Ping. Without being specific, Zuckerberg derided some large internet companies, saying they won't make it past a social networking revolution. "Some aren't going to make it," he said on Tuesday. "I think there's an exciting opportunity for some entrepreneurs." Zuckerberg's advice to "incumbents," as he calls technology giants: "Get on the bus." But that doesn't mean he's going to make it easy for them to board.

 The theology of Facebook, an online 'altar'By Omar L. Gallaga, Special to CNN | Filed under: Social Media   Is Facebook, with its dream-like constellation of friends and acquaintances from our past, like a digital version of the afterlife? STORY HIGHLIGHTS Omar Gallaga: Commingling of people from various chapters of our lives has spiritual overtones The author went on a theological search for the spirituality of Facebook connections  Pope Benedict XVI suggested earlier this year priests should embrace digital media Editors Note: Omar L. Gallaga is a technology contributor to NPR's All Tech Considered segment on "All Things Considered." He writes about technology for the Austin American-Statesman and for the newspaper's tech blog, Digital Savant.  (CNN) -- I grew up an Air Force brat who typically moved to a new place every three years. I switched schools, made friends, then had to write letters to stay in touch when I inevitably left. Except for a precious few, most of those friends went away forever, lost to memory, fading and eventually anonymous in aging photos. But in the recurring dreams I had in my teenage years, they were all together. My friends from Oklahoma went to school with my classmates in Biloxi, Mississippi. My favorite teacher from my years in Germany got to see me grow up alongside my cousins from South Texas. It wasn't until many years later, when Facebook shot past its first 100 million users, that I began to get that sensation again, the one most frequent users are now well familiar with. It's that sense of worlds colliding, of unlikely paths crossing; your work life, home life, past life and present all mashing together, commented upon and decorated with photos from here and from there, from then and in the now. Facebook's enormous membership makes it a more likely spot than any other place on the English-language Web to connect with a multitude of family members, friends, former co-workers, old classmates and anyone else you haven't seen in the flesh for decades. It wasn't until the May series finale "Lost," however, that I made another connection -- that this idea of people coming into your life and never going away is a lot like what many people believe the afterlife is like.  



Married couples: Thou shall not Facebook


Could it be that Facebook, the digital Tower of Babel built by a cocky Harvard student, is -- to paraphrase singer Belinda Carlisle -- sort of like what would happen if heaven were a place on earth? The thought led me to a theological search for the spirituality of Facebook connections. Amid the recent flood of political rants, children's Halloween photos and YouTube videos, many of us have seen status updates from friends offering Bible passages, spiritual quotes or information on upcoming religious services.

Along with a few alarming blog posts ("Facebook killed the church," one bluntly proclaimed), I found a lot of theologians struggling to figure out whether mobile phones, social networks and text-messaging harm their religions or help reinvent them in positive ways.  There's even debate on whether being so constantly connected to so many people is good or bad, spiritually speaking. Bruce Epperly, a theology professor, author and co-pastor in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, wrote a thoughtful piece about so-called "Facebook theology," likening the "intricate web of relationships" in our lives to our online social network. He acknowledged that even the lowly, short-form status update can carry a profound holiness. "It might surprise my high school friends to discover that I often pray for them as I read their posts," Epperly writes. "I believe that Facebook can be an altar on the Internet and a place of spiritual awakening." That seems to gibe with what Pope Benedict XVI proclaimed earlier this year. In January, the pontiff suggested that priests should embrace new digital communication mediums. But he stopped short of blessing Facebook itself as a virtual holy land. Facebook, which recently passed the 500-million-user mark, grew so quickly in such a short span of time that even its creators likely haven't been able to stop and examine the spiritual significance of its near-constant presence in so many lives. To what do we owe our continually growing house of "friends," the ones we never see, never call, never write to, but who contribute to our digital chatter, our daily chorus. Don't those connections count for some kind of community? Wouldn't we miss it if all these non-strangers were lost to us again? What if Facebook itself, which digitally houses not only the living but also the "memorial page" dead, is a kind of pre-afterlife training where all those personal connections are forever maintained, even after you've shuffled off this analog coil? And if the afterlife exists, and it's anything like Facebook, does it have an "Unfriend" option? Because as much as I love all the connectedness, eternity sounds like a really long time to spend reading everyone's status updates.

 Boy meets girl: How Facebook functions in modern romance  

By Brenna Ehrlich, Mashable  | Filed under: Social Media   "Teens are incredibly social, and Facebook plays a huge role in their love lives," says Ann Shoket, editor-in-chief of "Seventeen."

 (Mashable) -- There's no denying that Facebook has had an impact on the way the younger set flirt, fall in love and break up. Now, Seventeen magazine has released a study that depicts just what kind of repercussions the social networking site has had on modern courtship. "Teens are incredibly social, and Facebook plays a huge role in their love lives," says Ann Shoket, editor-in-chief of Seventeen magazine. According to the study -- which polled 10,000 guys and girls ages 16 to 21 -- Facebook plays an important part in how amorous teens make a connection.  Within one week of meeting a new person, 79 percent of people click "friend," and after adding a new friend; 60 percent of people stalk their crush's profile once a day (40 percent check in on their would-be soulmate several times a day).  Moreover, contrary to beliefs that social networking is erroding interpersonal communication, 72 percent of those surveyed said that talking to someone online brings you closer to them IRL. As we have already seen in other studies, Facebook also plays a role in how we fall out of love.  Mashable writer Samuel Axon wrote a detailed feature about how Facebook has changed dating for the worse, Facebook dating app AreYouInterested released a study in which 21 percent of respondents said they would break up with someone via changing their statuses, and, most recently, infographic wizard David McCandless came out with a chart that shows popular breakup periods by way of status updates. Seventeen, for its part, reports that 10 percent of people have been dumped over Facebook, and the same number would just change their relationship status to "single" to cut a lover loose.  The report also depicts the anguish the site can cause after a breakup, citing that 27 percent of people change their connection to their exes after a breakup via blocking (getEx-Blocker for that extra push), hiding him or her on the News Feed or unfriending.  Surprisingly, 73 percent of people keep their exes in the friends list. I'd like to see some stats on how many of those 73 percent stalk said ex after the breakup. A couple of other interesting tidbits from the study: Girls are more judgmental: 43 percent of girls would decide not to date someone based on their Facebook profile, compared to 33 percent of guys.  Guys are more likely to keep relationship statuses under wraps: 17 percent of guys don't share their status, compared to 12 percent of girls.  Girls think it's exciting to change their relationship status: 50 percent of girls get a kick out of the status change -- one-third of guys agree; 24 percent of guys find it unnecessary, compared to 17 percent of girls.

 The 'Facebook killer' won't look like Facebook By  Pete Cashmore, Special to CNN | Filed under: Social Media     Mashable's Pete Cashmore says the website that trumps Facebook will look nothing like Facebook.

Editor's note: Pete Cashmore is the founder and CEO of Mashable, a popular blog about social media. He writes a weekly column about social networking and tech for CNN.com.   (CNN) -- In the spring of this year, the "Facebook alternative" Diaspora achieved extensive media coverage -- including an article in the New York Times -- and raised tens of thousands of dollars in funding from online donors.  The pitch was an appealing one: In the midst of a privacy backlash at Facebook, Diaspora proposed a more private alternative to the leading social network. But Diaspora is no Facebook rival, and history tells us it won't make a dent in Facebook's success. A focus on privacy Diaspora, which began sending out invites this week, attempts to outclass Facebook in privacy features and user freedom. Features include granular control over who sees your information, the ability to download your photos and the option to delete your account without any hassle.  With $200,000 now raised for the project, you'd think Diaspora was off to a great start. In reality, its impact on Facebook will be minimal. There are plenty of ways for a social network to fail; the fact that your friends are already on Facebook and not Diaspora is the most obvious issue. But when it comes to toppling web giants, one factor is frequently overlooked: The replacement is usually radically different from its predecessor. In other words: If Facebook is ever beaten, it won't be by a site that tries to be "Facebook, but better." Rise of the Digg clones A cautionary tale emerged this year in the form of Digg.com. The once-pioneering social news site allows users to vote on stories, pushing those articles to the front page. This concept inspired hundreds of "Digg clones," few of which were able to gain traction. Most notably, a much-hyped relaunch of Netscape.com with Digg-like voting wasn't a success. This year, Digg entered a decline after a series of stumbles, and some users were said to defect to rival Reddit. And yet the site's troubles really began much earlier, with the rise of Twitter and Facebook. Although radically different in their execution, these two social services served much the same purpose as Digg by allowing users to share interesting links they found around the web. As web users found new outlets for these behaviors, Digg's relevance dwindled. The real threat to Digg wasn't a clone but rather a completely different approach. MySpace in decline Likewise, Facebook, which usurped MySpace for the social networking crown, did so with a radical innovation: the launch of its News Feed in 2006. This new feature wasn't just a "better MySpace" but a completely different approach to social interaction that replaced static pages with streams of constantly updated information. Facebook vs. Google Perhaps unexpectedly, Google is now feeling the heat from Facebook. Although hundreds of "Google killers" have come and gone, all of them trying to tackle Google head-on, it looks like Facebook might be the most credible threat so far to Google's core search business. What makes Facebook a possible Google rival is the massive amount of data it possesses on your individual preferences, your network of friends and the links you share. All this information could, the pundits predict, power a search engine with better results than Google. Social networks pose another threat to Google's search business, too: By subscribing to Twitter feeds and Facebook pages, users have relevant content delivered straight to them, which reduces the need to use search engines. In short: The most likely "Google killers" look nothing like Google. Diaspora is no threat So, if recent history is a guide, Facebook need not worry about Diaspora. Such incremental improvements almost never create new market leaders. Instead, it takes a completely different approach to unseat incumbents.  If a true "Facebook killer" should ever emerge, it probably won't resemble Facebook at all.

George W. Bush

Facebook Inc.

 (Mashable)  -- Former U.S. President George W. Bush's book tour will stop at Facebook's headquarters in Palo Alto, California, on Monday, with the social networking site announcing a "Facebook Live" event for 5 p.m. ET / 2 p.m. PT. Bush has been making the media rounds over the past several weeks, appearing on "The Today Show," "Oprah" and "The Tonight Show," among other programs, to talk about his memoir "Decision Points." Like other Facebook Live events, users will have an opportunity to ask Bush questions, though at this point it's unclear how the event will be moderated or who will be asking user's questions. While this will be the first appearance of Bush (or any President) on Facebook Live, the 43rd President has been on the site since June, when he setup a Facebook page.  The page currently has more than 600,000 fans and is being used to promote the book and Bush's various media appearances.© 2013 MASHABLE.com. All rights reserved.

Social Issues

 (Mashable)  -- Today, users can start connecting with all their favorite social causes in one online sphere, as Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes has launched his much-buzzed-about social network, Jumo. Hughes, who left Facebook in 2007 to become the Obama campaign's director of online organizing, soft-launched Jumo last March.  At that time the site existed merely as a homepage featuring a rather intriguing survey box that asked the site visitor an array of questions from, "If you had a daughter tomorrow, which would you name her?" to "Would you say the world is getting better or worse?"  Upon answering these queries, you could also submit your e-mail address to get more information as it came. Since the site first came on our radar, we here at Mashable have waited with interest to see what Hughes would reveal.  Would the site have its desired effect: Bringing together those interested in social change to expedite global do-gooding? And, more simply, what would it look like? Would it be easy to use? A couple of months ago, we got a little more insight into the project when Hughes spoke at the Mashable & 92Y Social Good Summit in New York City about the inspiration behind Jumo -- how, after the January 12, 2010, Haiti earthquake, he saw people reaching out those in need and the incredible response of the online community. He also saw that reactions like this are not enough. Instead of having the doing-good-at-Thanksgiving-time mentality (i.e. being galvanized by big events and holidays), people need to be involved with their causes of choice year-round. And that's where Jumo comes in. Jumo was designed to let users find, follow and support the causes important to them, and with 3,500 organizations on board at launch, would-be philanthropists should be able to find and follow something of interest upon joining. (For comparison's sake -- Apple's Ping had 2,000 artists two months out of the gate.) We have yet to actually get our mitts on the site, but Hughes gave us a walkthrough that revealed how easy-to-use and intuitive the layout is.  In fact, it's very similar to Facebook. Upon signing up via Facebook Connect, which lets you easily find friends on the site, you can begin to shape your Jumo experience by figuring out "What You're Interested In" by way of selecting "Issues." "This is to get a sense of who someone is, what they're passionate about, what's meaningful to them," Hughes says. "It's the first way to figure out what a person might want to see more of." Every Issue also has a page that you can follow, allowing you to discover more organizations over time. After choosing your Issues, you can either drill down to find more specific Issues (think education reforms, schools, at-risk youth, etc), or sort through "Projects" affiliated with that space and select which ones you would like to follow. You can also sort through Projects by location, finding those close to you, if you are so inclined. Once you choose your Projects and click "Done," you're transferred to your homepage, which, again, is very similar to Facebook's. It even has a newsfeed of sorts with updates from all the projects, people and issues you're following.  It also has a "Talk" section showing social updates from Projects and people you follow. "Our real mission is to make it as easy as possible for people to be able to find these organizations and then connect with them in a substantive way," Hughes says.  The site even features its own "Like" buttons, which allow you to "Like" a news story or video posted by a Project you follow and share that story on your own profile page, which is basically a feed of your activity on the site.  That way, you can see what your friends are interested in and check out Issues and Projects they might be involved with. You can also "Like" organization pages via Facebook "Like" buttons, thereby sharing that info with your Facebook friends. "It's all geared to answer the question: What does [insert name] care about?" Hughes says. In addition to joining as an individual, you can also add Projects to the site -- so long as they pertain to social or environmental issues.  "We're an open platform where anyone can create a profile or an organization page. You have to be vetted by the IRS to be able to receive any money from anyone on the Jumo platform [via a donation button], but anyone can create a page," Hughes says. By joining Jumo, a Project can pull all its social streams into one place -- Twitter, Facebook, Flickr, blogs, etc. That way, followers can check out a wealth of information on a single organization all in one framework. Again, Project pages are a lot like Fan Pages on Facebook, however the key difference here is that the focus seems to be less on the individual than on the organization.  On Facebook, it's more about the connections you make with friends than those you do with brands/bands/etc. Jumo focuses much more on creating a space where you can learn more about organizations, and thereby take action. At this juncture, you're probably thinking: "So what does this site actually do? Isn't this just another form of the infamous slacktivism?" "I think that when people click a 'Like' button of follow something on Twitter or sign up for an e-mail list, it's the first statement of support for any interest," Hughes says. "It doesn't mean that they don't then go out and do things like knock on doors and go to protests or go to rallies or go volunteer or donate. They do do these things." "We can make it easier for people to connect with the professionals working in a lot of fields in order to make change happen. There are a million different groups out there working day in, day out to provide healthcare or education services, or do good government work and I think that our challenge is not to use social media to reinvent the engagement paradigm, but instead to support the work of the people who are out there getting the job done, day in, day out."© 2013 MASHABLE.com.

 Facebook won't 'share' contacts with GmailBy  John D. Sutter, CNN | Filed under: Web   Facebook is catching heat for the fact that it won't let users share their data with Google. STORY HIGHLIGHTSA "data war" has developed between Facebook and Google, according to reportsFacebook won't let users export their contact lists to GmailGoogle retaliated by by blocking users from uploading Gmail contacts to FacebookWall Street Journal compared it to a fight between a 6-year-old and a 12-year-old

 (CNN) -- Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg talks about "sharing" info and "connecting" people to each other more than Kanye West talks about himself. And the site's mission statement hits those themes hard, saying Facebook's goal is to give people "the power to share and make the world more open and connected." So it might come as a surprise to Facebook users that the site takes a do-as-I-say-not-as-I-do approach to letting people share their own information with one of its biggest competitors. In what's been called "data hoarding," Facebook will not let users export their Facebook contacts lists -- which include pictures and e-mails -- to Google's e-mail system.  That's not new, but Facebook's anti-sharing policy has come under scrutiny recently since Google last week retaliated by blocking users from uploading their Gmail contacts to Facebook, according to TechCrunch. Facebook, in turn, found a work-around that let it pull in contact lists from Google anyway -- a sort of technical slap in the face to Google. "We're disappointed that Facebook didn't invest their time in making it possible for their users to get their contacts out of Facebook," a Google spokesperson wrote in an e-mail to CNN. "As passionate believers that people should be able to control the data they create, we will continue to allow our users to export their Google contacts."  Facebook did not respond to a CNN request for comment. At first read, this may sound kind of silly or irrelevant -- two multibillion-dollar tech companies bickering with each other. But these companies hold the keys to millions of peoples' online identities. They control whether you can download or export lists of your contacts, where on the internet you can use those lists, and which data companies they'll sell this information to. The new lockdowns on user data could signal a change in how the Web works, writes Michael Arrington from TechCrunch. The big tech companies are now in a "data war," and it may be hard to stop this escalation now that it has started, writes Arrington, who sees Facebook as the aggressor in this situation. Facebook "just pretty much refused to let users export social graph data, even though they import it like crazy from every source they can get their hands on," he says. The Wall Street Journal compared the situation to "what happens when a 6-year-old and a 12-year-old get in a fight." (Facebook is the 6-year-old, apparently.) "Expect neither side to let go easily," Geoffrey A. Fowler writes. Despite this fight, it's still possible to share your contacts among plenty of websites, which makes it easier to find friends on social networks and to synchronize the digital contacts you've accumulated from various sources. Below is a list of four of the big players in the online contacts space, and who shares with whom, compiled from each of these sites' contacts pages. This should give you an idea of how "trapped" your data is in any one of these services. (Note that companies who are "friends" -- i.e. Facebook and Microsoft, since that company owns a stake in Facebook -- tend to be fans of sharing data. Rivals like Google and Facebook -- not so much): Who holds onto your data?

 Photo sites work to hold out against Facebook, upstartsBy  Doug Gross, CNN | Filed under: Web   Photo site staffers say that mobile tools, like Photobucket's Android app, are one key to fending off competition from Facebook. STORY HIGHLIGHTS With growth of Facebook Photos and upstart apps, established photo sites work to stay ahead  Sites like Photobucket, Flickr and Picasa say advanced features, mobility are keys to their success  Facebook had more photo views in October than all three other sites combined

PhotoBucket.com Inc.

Internet

Photography

 (CNN) -- There's a photo-sharing website that, by some measures, is more popular than Flickr, Picasa and Photobucket combined. You might have heard of it. It's called Facebook. The emergence of the social-networking giant as a way to store and share photos has those established photo sites working to stay relevant. At the same time, a handful of new, upstart photo-sharing apps are seeking to carve out their own niches. In the end, the established photo sites say, it will be their ability to do more -- particularly in the rapidly expanding world of mobile photography -- that will set them apart. Most photo sites offer similar tools for cataloging, editing and sharing photos, along with ways to display them in albums and slide shows. Until recently, it has been easy enough for these sites to brush off any threat Facebook may pose.  The easy argument, and one that still exists to some extent, is that Facebook is only good for simple snapshots that don't need any editing and are designed more to document an event than render an artistic image. "Our users like to share, they like to edit, they like to create," said Tom Munro, who took over as CEO of Photobucket last month. "All of that you can't do on Facebook. Most people don't want all their photos on Facebook. You really can't do a whole lot with them once they're there." But Facebook, which can parlay its userbase of roughly 500 million into relative success with most anything Web-related, is trying to chip away at that argument. Last month, Facebook announced it was upgrading its Photos service to include high-resolution photos, group tagging and a lightbox for viewing photos from anywhere on the site. Some of those changes were clearly designed to compete with the specialty photo sites. Numbers-wise, Facebook dwarfs the competition. According to Web analytics firm comScore, Facebook Photos had nearly 98 million visitors in October. Photobucket remains narrowly atop the photo sites with a little over 25 million visitors, according to comScore, with Flickr at 21 million and Picasa drawing nearly 11 million users. Picasa was the only photo site comScore charted a year-to-year comparison for, and its traffic increased about 14 percent from October 2009. In comparison, Facebook Photos users more than doubled, from 47.6 million a year ago. It's probably safe to say, however, that a lot of those clicks represent casual glances instead of folks who come to photo sites specifically. More than 3 billion photos are uploaded to Facebook every month, according to a recent estimate. And in the past few weeks, others have thrown their names into the online photo bucket. Path aims to be a sort-of anti-Facebook (or, perhaps more of an anti-Twitter, where popular users can have 1 million-plus followers), allowing users to share photos with no more than 50 friends. The new app picplz (pronounced "pic, please") lets users share photos to Facebook, Myspace and Twitter. Pixable, which just got a $2.5 million venture capital infusion, turns photos from Facebook and other sites into animated videos. At Yahoo!-owned Flickr, head of product strategy, Matthew Rothenberg, said he doesn't see Facebook's numbers as a problem. "We look at Facebook almost more as a partner than a competitor," he said. "We have Facebook integration, integration on Twitter.  "Our mission is to be the best place to put your photos and share with the people who matter to you. If the people who you care about happen to be on Facebook, we want Flickr to work great with all of those things." He highlighted features like geotagging which embeds images with geographical coordinates. The site hosts more than 184 million location-tagged photos, he said. Flickr also has been a leader in mobile photography, offering mobile uploads since 2005. "The number-one, most-used camera on Flickr right now is a camera phone -- currently the iPhone," he said. "I have a [digital camera] gathering dust in my closet right now. Obviously, there's still a place for high-end cameras, but we are increasingly seeing more and more camera phone usage." Flickr has a mobile app for multiple platfoms. It has been downloaded 5 million times for the iPhone alone. Munro said Photobucket has its own slate of plans to keep up. In the next few days, the site has a planned ravamp to give it a more intuitive look and feel, he said. A second update, he said, will bring bigger and more fundamental changes to Photobucket. Although he wasn't ready to give away details, it seems likely that additional mobile features could be part of the package. "You're kind of hinting at a direction we're looking at for the future," Munro said to a question about an app that could instantly share Photobucket images with multiple sites. A spokeswoman for Google-owned Picasa provided a list of features the site trumpets as setting it apart -- including automatic face-recognition software and tagging "that really works," photo montage and collage creation, and a state-of-the-art desktop client: Picasa 3.8. It's those sort of advanced features that these photo sites say will keep them ahead of their new challengers. The sites will need to constantly evolve to keep up with a rapidly changing digital world, they said. "The real goal of online photo share is to make sharing photos online the same kind of rich and wonderful experience that sharing photos in the offline world is," said Tara Suan Kirchner, Flickr's head of marketing.

Virtual worlds: The next Facebook? - CNN.com 



















 

  







 





 



























   Virtual worlds: The next Facebook?Story Highlights  By 2020, experts believe virtual worlds will be widespread   Online worlds could replace Facebook as most popular Internet phenomenon  Experts say young users could lead spartan lives offline, luxurious lives online  But Star Trek-style fully-interactive holodecks still some way off Next Article in Technology »  By  Linnie Rawlinson for CNN 



 


 

  LONDON, England (CNN) -- It's 2020. You get home from work, kick off your shoes and relax -- on your very own tropical island. That night, your friends teleport over with other glamorous guests, all nipped, tucked and primped to perfection, for a hedonistic cocktail party at your five-star beach house, decked out in expensively understated chrome, crystal and fine Italian furniture. 

Experts say the use of virtual worlds like Second Life may be widespread by 2020 


 But this is no billionaire way of life. If virtual worlds become the next Facebook phenomenon, experts predict that logging on to a luxury lifestyle could be attainable for all of us -- and we might even spend more money on our online homes than on our real-life surroundings. With over 30 million users worldwide, 8.5 million photos uploaded each day and 15 billion page views a month, Facebook is undoubtedly the Internet's flavor of the month. But by 2020, virtual worlds may have surpassed social networking sites as the place to spend time online. Experts believe that the draw of 3-D spaces where our avatars can hang out with our friends -- and meet new ones -- may tempt away even the most ardent Facebook addict. David Knighton, a 35-year-old Second Life user from Jacksonville, Florida, is one of many netizens exploring virtual worlds. He's been visiting the site for over a year and told CNN that he enjoys its social dimension. "I've met several good friends in Second Life, who are still friends to this day in the 'real world'" he said. At times, David has spent six hours a day, seven days a week on Second Life. But what is the draw of a virtual world? Are they only attractive to tech-heads? David doesn't think so. He says, "Experience plays a role in acceptance to be sure, but Second Life takes hold more on a social and creative level. Someone who signs in and recognizes those aspects of Second Life will immediately be hooked."

The future of living space


Metaverse Roadmap


 This is backed up by blogger and writer Caleb Booker, who has tracked virtual worlds from phone "party lines" through the first one-player text-based computer adventures to the two- and three-dimensional Internet worlds that are burgeoning today. Booker believes that, in a society that's increasingly mobile, virtual worlds help us hold our far-flung social networks together. He cites the example of his mother-in-law, who recently moved to a new city and uses Facebook to stay in touch with her three daughters. "They're all busy, so virtual world technologies and Web 2.0 apps are the best and most convenient ways to keep up," he told CNN. Booker says that virtual worlds take this interaction to a more sophisticated level. "I don't even have to worry about cab fare if I want to have a little get-together with my friends from the UK and the US tonight," he said. And he thinks that it's only a matter of time before virtual worlds follow Facebook and explode in popularity. "Bottom line: if people are using email for social interaction, they'll probably be interested in other ways to be social online." Life-like avatars Interaction on Facebook, MySpace and other social networking sites is mainly limited to text, with the ability for users to add photos and video. But in a virtual world, people are represented by avatars: computer-generated figures which can look uncannily like ourselves -- if we choose. They can walk like us, they'll soon talk like us and they can interact with each other. As 3-D technology becomes increasingly sophisticated, Booker says that photo-realistic avatars are just around the corner, and will become increasingly convincing. "Eye movement, breathing, and realistic expressions will be the easy part," he revealed. "The hard part will come with things like synching mouth movements with voice recognition. That's something we might not quite have nailed by 2020, but there will definitely be some kind of engine that attempts it by then." Holographic projections of 3-D objects are in development, but it will be some time before virtual reality offers us experiences akin to Star Trek's holodecks: touching and tasting virtual matter is still some way off. "We're a long, long way away from having a completely immersive Matrix-like world," he told CNN. "But then again, technology can surprise you. I remember joking with a friend about a guy who bought a brand-new VGA monitor. It could display 256 colors at once -- who could honestly need something like that?" Spartan life offline, exotic life online The authors of the "Metaverse Roadmap," a briefing document that explores the possible development of virtual worlds over the next 20 years, agree that a boom within a decade is likely. Their research has indicated that by 2016, half of us will have interactive avatars, with those aged between 13 and 30 spending around 10 hours a week socializing in 3-D visual environments. And the draw of virtual worlds may encourage some of us to forsake our mundane real-life surroundings for a luxury life online. The Metaverse Roadmap points to the millions of youths who already use worlds like Habbo Hotel and Playdo, and suggests that "Youth raised in such conditions might live increasingly Spartan lives in the physical world, and rich, exotic lives in virtual space." It makes a certain kind of sense: why cripple yourself with huge mortgage payments on "real" real-estate when on Second Life you can buy an entire island for $1,600 and $300/month maintenance? The uses for virtual worlds don't stop at socializing. Virtual environments are already being built for education, like Edward Castronova's "Arden" project at Indiana University, which will transport users into a Shakespearean world. The applications for interior designers are clear, while a team at the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) in Bethesda, Maryland have used the virtual shoot-em-up "Duke Nukem" to diagnose depression in players. Business collaboration Booker believes that virtual worlds will be used increasingly as business tools. "They're very well suited to collaborative work," he explained. "We're not sure why yet, but there's something about seeing everybody's avatar in the room with yours that makes the whole experience far more effective than if you were to simply have a conference call. It creates a real shared experience." And with the launch of Sony's PlayStation Home -- an online world for the games console -- this autumn, it seems the big players in the entertainment world are banking on virtual realms being part of the future, too. "The common feeling is that by 2020 virtual worlds will be as widespread as the World Wide Web is now," states Booker. With that popularity comes opportunity -- and not only for Internet land barons like self-proclaimed Second Life millionaire Anshe Chung, but also virtual builders, landscapers and interior decorators, designers of avatar clothing and accessories, and even community moderators and governors. "A significant percentage of the world's population will be able to make a living working in virtual worlds," says Booker. And he thinks that this potential is just around the corner. "The truth is that, as far as virtual worlds go, we're living in the flash point at the beginning of the explosion." ........................     What future do you think virtual worlds hold?

 Top 4 most annoying Facebook couplesBy Wendy Atterberry, The Frisky 

     We're supposed to feel jealous of their burning love for one another. Unfriend! STORY HIGHLIGHTS Outside of their relationship, the pathetic couple is miserable and empty  The passive-aggressive couple acts out fights online in melodramatic updates  The boring couple hangs out at home... all the time
RELATED TOPICS


Relationships

Facebook Inc.

 (The Frisky) -- For anyone who is remotely active on Facebook, you no doubt have been faced at some point with inane updates on one of your friend's kid's colds or how wedding-planning was coming along for one of your engaged buddies.  That's why, when parenting Web site Babble published "Facebook's Most Annoying Parents," I immediately thought, "But what about all the annoying couples?" So, without further ado, I present to you the top four most annoying couples on Facebook. The too-much-in-love couple Between the constant "I love my honey sooooo much!!" and "I have the most amazing husband in the whole world!!!" updates, these couples do proclaim too much.  Their updates are filled with flowery adjectives and almost always include the words "amazing," "luckiest," and "best! ever!" Sometimes the updates are even addressed to each other, like, "Kelly, it was exactly two months ago today I met you and became the luckiest man in the universe!" or "Mark, I loved every amazing second of our beautiful weekend together!!"  Don't these people have personal email addresses? Can't they actually speak to one another in person and leave the rest of us out of it? But, of course, all these proclamations aren't for their benefit, they're for ours.  We're supposed to feel jealous of their burning love for one another and their incredible luck to have found each other. Unfriend! The pathetic couple Outside of their relationship, this couple is miserable and empty. If either of them so much as works outside the home and they're forced to spend eight hours apart, their updates are peppered with hourly countdowns until their end-of-the-day reunion.  The Frisky: Free teeth whitening (for your Facebook photos)  If one gets invited to a function without the other, they use their Facebook update to announce how unfair the world is and how nothing else in life is as important as the time they spend with each other.  "I have to go to my BFF's bachelorette party tonight, which means a whole evening without Nick! No fair!!!" How these couples ever managed to survive in the world without each other is one of the great mysteries of life. The boring couple It's clear that the Boring Couple, who does nothing but constantly hang out at home, has forgotten that other people actually have fun for fun. They update with: "Excited to stay in for 'movie and pizza night' with the hubby!" or "Gonna cook a big dinner for wifey tonight!!"  Well, hey, guess what, the rest of us are going to eat dinner at some point, too, and unless it's enjoyed with a mentor we've just been granted a meal with from the Make-A-Wish foundation, it probably doesn't warrant two exclamation points...or, you know, a status update on Facebook. These people would be more sad than annoying if they weren't so smug about their domestic bliss. The Frisky: Are social media sites making us rude?  The passive-aggressive couple Perhaps the biggest offender of them all, this couple hashes out their issues with one another in passive-aggressive, embarrassing, and often melodramatic updates, like "Would have gotten a lot more sleep if somebody didn't keep me up all night with his constant farting!" or "There's nothing I hate more than a man who can't make up his mind which he woman he wants!"  Every other day your feed is cluttered with messages that they've broken up or gotten back together. At least you can take comfort in knowing that they totally deserve each other.TM & © 2010 TMV, Inc. | All Rights Reserved

 Facebookers rage against Simon Cowell's Christmas juggernautBy  Richard Allen Greene, CNN      Simon Cowell claims the Facebook campaign is aimed at him. STORY HIGHLIGHTSFacebookers vow to make Rage Against the Machine song "Killing in the Name" number oneTheir aims is to stop song from Simon Cowell's "X-Factor" talent show being top of Christmas chartWinners of his talent show have taken the top slot for the past four yearsCowell accused the Facebook group of "treating our audience as if they're stupid" London, England (CNN) -- At least half a million Facebookers are raging against Simon Cowell, trying to keep his British TV talent show "The X-Factor" from claiming the number-one spot on the British singles chart on Christmas Day. They've vowed to download the Rage Against the Machine song "Killing in the Name" starting on Monday to make it the number-one single in the country on the Sunday before Christmas. It might seem like a frivolous contest, but hundreds of thousands of pounds -- and a place in history -- are at stake. A Christmas Number One enters the history books, exciting passion, disgust, joy and, yes, rage. British music fans sometimes take the high road. They put the charity single "Do They Know It's Christmas?" at the top of the charts three times: First in 1984, then in 1989 and 2004 when anniversary editions came out. Once upon a time, they got into the spirit of the season -- with "Rudolf the Red-Nosed Reindeer," "Mary's Boy Child," and "When a Child is Born" all topping the charts on Christmas Day in days of yore. And often they just buy the songs they like, paying no heed to the season's mistletoe and wine. The Beatles topped the Christmas Day chart four times. The Spice Girls claimed the title three times. Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, Elvis Presley and Westlife all had Christmas number ones. So did Pink Floyd, with "Another Brick in the Wall." (Merry Christmas, everyone!) Most infamous of all are the songs that drive you around the bend. 
It's quite a cynical campaign geared at me
--Simon Cowell

Mr. Blobby's single "Mr. Blobby" -- no, really -- was the 1993 chart-topper. The theme song from the kids' show "Bob the Builder" took top honors in 2000. Slapstick comic Benny Hill ruled the charts in 1971 with "Ernie (The Fastest Milkman in the West.)" And, to the everlasting fury and despair of John Lennon fans, "There's No One Quite Like Grandma," by the St. Winifred's School Choir, claimed the top spot in 1980, weeks after the former Beatle was gunned down, knocking off his "(Just Like) Starting Over." Historically, there has been a lively business trying make Christmas number ones -- and to predict what they will be, said Rupert Adams of the William Hill betting shop. "It used to be massive -- five years ago you would have all the big record producers try to get in on the Christmas sales," he said. "Hundreds of thousands of pounds" would be wagered on the results, he added. Then came Simon Cowell, the flat-topped, smirking, eye-rolling impresario behind "The X-Factor." Winners of his talent show have taken the top slot for the past four years, and William Hill now runs a separate pool for betting on what will be the number two single -- behind "X-Factor winner," as they generically call it. Cowell is the unstoppable force in front of which Jon and Tracy Morter are trying to put an immovable object. "2009 X-Factor is in its final stages and we need to gain more people here to try once again to stop this manufactured crap stealing our national heritage of a CHRISTMAS No.1!!" they say on the page of their Facebook group. 
We're not against the contestants in any way. I watch it. I enjoy seeing who's good and who's not--Tracy Morter, Facebooker

"We were bored of the Christmas Number One being predictable," Tracy Morter said. "When we grew up it was always exciting wondering what it was going to be. (The song) was sometimes rubbish but it was fair." Now, she said, people are pre-ordering the X-Factor winner's song without even knowing what it is. They've signed up more than half a million members in a week for a Facebook group dedicated to putting Rage Against the Machine on top of the charts. Rupert Adams, for one, is taking notice. "X-Factor winner" still tops his list of most likely chart-toppers -- people who place a £5 bet on it at William Hill will win only £1 if they're right -- but the Morters are at least making it competitive. Adams -- who runs the William Hill betting, or "book" on the Christmas Number One -- makes Rage Against the Machine the second most likely winner. William Hill will pay out £10 on a £3 bet if "Killing in the Name" takes top honors. "X-Factor will sell somewhere around 800,000," guaranteed, Adams said. "For Rage Against the Machine, on Monday I would have given you 100 to 1. But since then, there's this Facebook group and they now have half a million members." The critical question -- and what makes this fun for Adams, he said -- is whether group members will actually shell out money on the song. "We have absolutely no idea how strong this group is," he said. "Having lots of mates on Facebook doesn't mean you are going to transfer that to sales." Cowell himself dismissed the campaign as "stupid. "It's not going to change my life particularly" if the X-Factor winner isn't number one on Christmas, he said at a press conference with the show finalists in London Thursday. "It does, however, change these guys' lives." Cowell accused the Facebook group of "treating our audience as if they're stupid," and said the Rage Against the Machine movement was "quite a cynical campaign geared at me." Tracy Morter laughed off the accusation. "He's going to get his sales anyway -- we're not going to persuade people not to buy it," she said. "People are pre-ordering without even knowing who won." What she hopes is that people who would not normally buy music will purchase the Rage Against the Machine single -- and donate money to Shelter, a homeless charity, at the same time. She insisted she did not have a grudge against X-Factor contestants. "We're not against the contestants in any way. I watch it. I enjoy seeing who's good and who's not," she said. Cowell proteges are unlikely to spend Christmas unwrapping presents alone, whatever happens. William Hill lists Susan Boyle as the fourth most likely Christmas chart-topper, at 25-to-1 (behind Walt Disney-backed Miley Cyrus at 20-to-1), and former "X-Factor" winner Leona Lewis as sixth, at 33-to-1. Just as a reminder of how random the Christmas Number One contenders can be, the Muppets are joint fourth with Boyle, the frumpy Scottish woman who went viral when she sang "I Dreamed a Dream" on Cowell's show earlier this year. Lady Gaga, Michael Jackson, Take That and George Michael round out the top 10, while number 11 is World War II sweetheart Vera Lynn, whose greatest hits album this year fueled a mini-comeback this year for her -- at age 92. Whatever the winner, oddsmaker Adams is delighted that the field is once again competitive. "It could be a bumper year" for betting, he said. "It could be the best year since the X-Factor came onto the scene." Then again, it might -- just might -- be another year like 1972, when Little Jimmy Osmond topped the charts with "Long Haired Lover From Liverpool."

William Hill will pay out £10 on a £3 bet if "Killing in the Name" takes top honors. "X-Factor will sell somewhere around 800,000," guaranteed, Adams said. "For Rage Against the Machine, on Monday I would have given you 100 to 1. But since then, there's this Facebook group and they now have half a million members." The critical question -- and what makes this fun for Adams, he said -- is whether group members will actually shell out money on the song. "We have absolutely no idea how strong this group is," he said. "Having lots of mates on Facebook doesn't mean you are going to transfer that to sales." Cowell himself dismissed the campaign as "stupid. "It's not going to change my life particularly" if the X-Factor winner isn't number one on Christmas, he said at a press conference with the show finalists in London Thursday. "It does, however, change these guys' lives." Cowell accused the Facebook group of "treating our audience as if they're stupid," and said the Rage Against the Machine movement was "quite a cynical campaign geared at me." Tracy Morter laughed off the accusation. "He's going to get his sales anyway -- we're not going to persuade people not to buy it," she said. "People are pre-ordering without even knowing who won." What she hopes is that people who would not normally buy music will purchase the Rage Against the Machine single -- and donate money to Shelter, a homeless charity, at the same time. She insisted she did not have a grudge against X-Factor contestants. "We're not against the contestants in any way. I watch it. I enjoy seeing who's good and who's not," she said. Cowell proteges are unlikely to spend Christmas unwrapping presents alone, whatever happens. Before the final chart week, William Hill listed Susan Boyle as the fourth most likely Christmas chart-topper, at 25-to-1 (behind Walt Disney-backed Miley Cyrus at 20-to-1), and former "X-Factor" winner Leona Lewis as sixth, at 33-to-1. Just as a reminder of how random the Christmas Number One contenders can be, the Muppets are joint fourth with Boyle, the frumpy Scottish woman who went viral when she sang "I Dreamed a Dream" on Cowell's show earlier this year. Lady Gaga, Michael Jackson, Take That and George Michael round out the top 10, while number 11 is World War II sweetheart Vera Lynn, whose greatest hits album this year fueled a mini-comeback this year for her -- at age 92. Whatever the winner, oddsmaker Adams is delighted that the field is once again competitive. "It could be a bumper year" for betting, he said. "It could be the best year since the X-Factor came onto the scene." Then again, it might -- just might -- be another year like 1972, when Little Jimmy Osmond topped the charts with "Long Haired Lover From Liverpool."

 Facebook campaign trumps Cowell songBy  Richard Allen Greene, CNN    STORY HIGHLIGHTSRage's win marks 1st time in five years winner of Simon Cowell's "X-Factor" has lostJoe McElderry's "The Climb" came in second to Rage's "Killing in the Name"Facebook group vowed to download "Killing" to make it Britain's pre-Christmas No. 1 London, England (CNN) -- Rage Against the Machine has claimed the prestigious No. 1 spot on the British singles chart on the last Sunday before Christmas, marking the first time in five years the winner of Simon Cowell's "X-Factor" has not won. Joe McElderry's "The Climb" came in second, beaten by a huge online swell of support for "Killing in the Name," backed by a Facebook group with nearly 1 million members. It was the first time a group had ever won the top slot based on downloads alone, BBC's "The Chart Show" said. Tracy Morter, one of the founders of the Facebook group backing Rage, said her response was "shock, really."

"You don't actually think it's going to happen, and we just want to make sure Joe knows it wasn't personal against him and hope he has a wonderful Christmas," she said. The Facebook group also raised about 63,000 pounds ($101,829) for the homeless charity Shelter, she said. The group had "nearly a million people -- we're 3,000 off a million," she said. The group vowed to download "Killing in the Name" starting earlier this month to make it the No. 1 single in the country on the Sunday before Christmas. It might seem like a frivolous contest, but hundreds of thousands of pounds -- and a place in history -- are at stake. A Christmas No. 1 enters the history books, exciting passion, disgust, joy and, yes, rage.

   Fears of impostors increase on FacebookStory Highlights Media reports of impersonation on Facebook are increasing  Facebook says fewer than 1 percent of its 150 million users are affected  A Seattle-area man says someone impersonated him to get money from his friends  In Wisconsin, a man was accused of using a false ID to solicit sex actsNext Article in Technology »   Read  VIDEO   From  John Sutter and Jason Carroll CNN  



 


 

  (CNN) -- Without his input, Bryan Rutberg's Facebook status update -- the way friends track each other -- suddenly changed on January 21 to this frightening alert: 
Fears of impostors are increasing as Facebook's membership grows. 
 "Bryan NEEDS HELP URGENTLY!!!" His online friends saw the message and came to his aid. Some posted concerned messages on his public profile -- "What's happening????? What do you need?" one wrote. Another friend, Beny Rubinstein, got a direct message saying Rutberg had been robbed at gunpoint in London and needed money to get back to the United States. So, trying to be a good friend, Rubinstein wired $1,143 to London in two installments, according to police in Bellevue, Washington.  Meanwhile, Rutberg was safe at home in Seattle. Rubinstein told CNN he misses the money, but it's perhaps more upsetting to feel tricked by someone who impersonated his friend on Facebook, a social-networking site where millions of friends converse freely online.   "It's an invasion of your whole privacy, who your friends are," he said.  Watch Rutberg talk about his Facebook page being hacked » While reports of extortion and false impersonation have been common in phony phone calls and fake e-mails, similar fraud hasn't been reported on Facebook until recently. Now a number of complaints are surfacing.

Facebook turns 5 -- but can it survive?


 In response to the trend, the Better Business Bureau in late January issued a warning on its Web site, intended for Facebook's 150 million users: know who your friends are and keep your sensitive information private. In the Seattle case, a hacker appeared to steal Rutberg's identity to get money from his friends by toying with their emotions.   In Wisconsin, police accuse an 18-year-old man of posing as a woman on Facebook to get high school boys to send him naked photos of themselves.  Watch 18-year-old accused in Facebook case » Anthony Stancl, of New Berlin, Wisconsin, allegedly used the naked photos he had solicited to force the young men into sex acts with him, according to a criminal complaint. Stancl was arrested on 12 felony complaints, including sexual assault of a child younger than 16 and possession of child pornography, the complaint says. CNN left multiple messages for Stancl's attorney but did not receive a response. Stancl is being held in lieu of $250,000 bail and has no previous criminal record, according to CNN affiliate WISN. There are primarily two ways to stay safe on Facebook, said Jim Lewis, director of the technology and policy program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. First, make sure your computer anti-virus programs are up to date; and tell online companies you want better privacy protection, he said. In a statement, Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt told CNN that impersonation schemes affect fewer than 1 percent of Facebook's 150 million users. He would not comment on whether the rate of such incidents is increasing, but said any increase in the total number of impersonations could be due to the fact that the site is growing by 600,000 users per day. "In many cases, the scammer has added a new contact e-mail to attempt to maintain control of the account," Schnitt said in a prepared statement. "To combat this, we're instituting changes that will better notify users when their account is modified and empowering them to reverse these changes." Rutberg, the Seattle man who had his Facebook page hacked, said he worked with the site to shut down his profile within a day. It was back up in a week, he said. All Internet users should be aware their identities can be compromised, and "every user of the Web should be better educated," Rutberg said. Like other types of Internet fraud, Facebook impersonation cases are difficult to solve and costly to pursue, said Officer Greg Grannis, spokesman for the Bellevue Police Department in Washington. "We are not investigating this case," he said, noting that a report on the case had been filed with his office. "It is pretty much at a dead end." Because the money went to London, it would be nearly impossible to send officers out to investigate the case, he said. Facebook says it is taking measures to reduce impersonations. The popular site also offers these preventative tips for those who want to take the security of their online profile into their own hands: • Be suspicious of anyone -- even friends -- who ask for money over the Internet. Verify their circumstances independently, either by calling them directly, or checking with mutual friends. • Choose a strong password and use unique credentials for each of your Web accounts. Facebook says hackers tap into one site and then try to reuse passwords on others. • Use an up-to-date browser that features an anti-phishing blacklist. • Use and run anti-virus software on your computer. 





 • Reset your Facebook password if you suspect your account has been compromised. • Have more than one contact e-mail address. This will help if one of them is hacked.

   Facebook faces furor over content rightsStory Highlights Facebook answers users' concerns about its ownership of images and other content  Flap arose after the social-networking site reorganized its terms of service last week  Blog phrased new policy as "We Can Do Anything We Want With Your Content"  Facebook: "We are not claiming. . .ownership of material that users upload"  Next Article in Technology »   By Caroline McCarthy 



 


 

 
 (CNET) -- On an otherwise placid holiday weekend, one blog's commentary on a change to Facebook's terms of service created a firestorm of banter on the Web: does the social network claim ownership to any user content on the site, even if the user deletes it? 
Facebook is addressing users' concerns about its ownership of images and other content. 
 Facebook reorganized its terms of service last Wednesday. In a blog post, company legal representative Suzie White provided an explanation. "We used to have several different documents that outlined what people could and could not do on Facebook, but now we're consolidating all this information to one central place," White wrote.  "We've also simplified and clarified a lot of information that applies to you, including some things you shouldn't do when using the site."   The blog post sounded benign. But the brouhaha arose on Sunday over a revision in the wording of Facebook's policy over what happens to profile content--shared items, blog post-like "notes," photos--when members delete their accounts. Consumer advocacy blog The Consumerist phrased Facebook's fresh policy as "We Can Do Anything We Want With Your Content. Forever," pointing out that Facebook's ToS spruce-up removed several sentences in which the company said its licenses on user content expired upon account deletion.  And that's where the hysteria began.

 "Facebook should now be called The Information Blackhole," one Consumerist commenter proclaimed. "What goes in never comes out. Be careful what you huck in there." Truth be told, most Facebook users won't give a hoot, the same way that the flurry over the Beacon advertising program in late 2007 was fueled by a few vocal privacy advocates while the general population didn't seem to care about it one way or the other.  But for advocates of copyright reform and privacy, not to mention photographers and writers who may want the photos they upload or "notes" they write on Facebook to eventually lead to some kind of profit, the news was alarming. Some prominent Twitterers and bloggers, like New Yorker music critic Sasha Frere-Jones, announced that they were deleting their Facebook accounts or pulling all uploaded content. So Facebook issued somewhat of a clarification on Monday to explain what the change really meant. "We are not claiming and have never claimed ownership of material that users upload," a statement from Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt read. And indeed, Facebook's terms of service do say that "User Content and Applications/Connect Sites" are exempt from its claims on content ownership. "The new Terms were clarified to be more consistent with the behavior of the site," Schnitt's statement continued. "That is, if you send a message to another user (or post to their wall, etc...), that content might not be removed by Facebook if you delete your account (but can be deleted by your friend)." The statement also noted a few fine points. First, Facebook's license only permits it to use user content "in connection with the Facebook Service or the promotion thereof," indicating that CEO Mark Zuckerberg does not plan to make the site profitable by selling scandalous user photos to the National Enquirer when those Facebook members run for elected office. And second, if that Facebook content was not public, the site will respect the member's chosen privacy settings. In other words, if your profile and the photos you have uploaded to it are only accessible to people on your friends list, Facebook says it does not have the right to show those photos to anyone outside your friends list.

 Facebook has expressed disapproval when photographs and profile screenshots normally protected by the site's login wall or privacy settings have been made public on the Web.  The site reportedly threatened gossip blog mogul Nick Denton with an account deletion when one of his properties, Gawker, posted photographs found on a socialite's Facebook profile. Suffice it to say it would be hypocritical for Facebook to publicly distribute, let alone sell, the same content itself. Things are a little bit murky for sure, though. Unlike the Yahoo-owned Flickr, Facebook does not have extensive copyright preferences, meaning that a professional photographer might want to choose a media-sharing site where there's less of a gray area as to what can actually happen down the road.   But as Facebook becomes more and more of a content-sharing hub, especially now that the Facebook Connect product expands its reach to third-party sites, it's likely there will be a louder cry among members--especially those involved in creative industries who use their Facebook profiles for professional promotion or publicity--for clearer terms. iReport.com: Too much information posted online? The way they stand now, Facebook's terms of service claim that the company does not have ownership over content, yet that it does have "an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, fully paid, worldwide license (to)...use, copy, publish, stream, store, retain, publicly perform or display, transmit, scan, reformat, modify, edit, frame, translate, excerpt, adapt, create derivative works, and distribute" material as long as it doesn't violate the privacy preferences set by the user. Considering Facebook content is login-protected by default, the outcry should be quelled somewhat by that "subject only to your privacy settings" phrasing. Still, this is a debate that might not go away so quickly.  Zuckerberg wrote a post for the Facebook blog later on Monday about the issue: "We still have work to do to communicate more clearly about these issues, and our terms are one example of this," he wrote.  "Our philosophy that people own their information and control who they share it with has remained constant. A lot of the language in our terms is overly formal and protective of the rights we need to provide this service to you. Over time we will continue to clarify our positions and make the terms simpler." Zuckerberg continued: "We're at an interesting point in the development of the open online world where these issues are being worked out. It's difficult terrain to navigate and we're going to make some missteps, but as the leading service for sharing information we take these issues and our responsibility to help resolve them very seriously."

   Facebook backs down, reverses on user information policyStory Highlights Facebook this month changed its policy to say user content belonged to Facebook  Outraged members canceled their accounts or created online petitions  On Wednesday, Facebook reviewed user "feedback," and reverted to its old policy Next Article in Technology »   Read  VIDEO    



 


 

  (CNN) -- Under fire from tens of thousands of users, the social networking site Facebook said early Wednesday it is reverting to its old policy on user information -- for now. 
Backlash against Facebook began after a consumer advocate site flagged Facebook's policy change. 
 The site posted a brief message on users' home pages that said it was returning to its previous "Terms of Use" policy "while we resolve the issues that people have raised." The "Terms of Use" is the legalese tacked on to the bottom of most Web sites that details what the site's owners can do with the information that users provide. Facebook, the Web's most popular social networking site, has been caught in a content-rights battle after revealing earlier this month that it was granting itself permanent rights to users' photos, wall posts and other information even after a user closed an account. The popular site allows users to create personal profiles where they can then connect with one another, upload photos and share links. The site boasts more than 150 million active users. Member backlash against Facebook began over the weekend after a consumer advocate Web site, The Consumerist, flagged a change made to Facebook's policy earlier in the month. The company deleted a sentence from the old Terms of Use. That sentence said Facebook could not claim any rights to original content that a user uploaded once the user closed his or her account.

 It replaced it with: "You may remove your User Content from the Site at any time. ... (H)owever, you acknowledge that the Company may retain archived copies of your User Content." In response, Chris Walters wrote in the Consumerist post, "Make sure you never upload anything you don't feel comfortable giving away forever, because it's Facebook's now."   Thousands of indignant members either canceled their accounts or created online petitions. Among them were more than 64,000 who joined a group called "The People Against the new Terms of Service." iReport.com: Too much information posted online?   On Monday, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg tried to quell the controversy by saying the company's philosophy is that "people own their information and control who they share it with." But members were not appeased because the site did not fix its Terms of Use. The company, in its post Wednesday, said it was returning to its previous Terms of Use because of the "feedback" it had received.    "As Mark expressed in his blog post on Monday, it was never our intention to confuse people or make them uneasy about sharing on Facebook," company spokesman Barry Schnitt said in a blog post. "I also want to be very clear that Facebook does not, nor have we ever, claimed ownership over people's content. Your content belongs to you." iReport.com: Your thoughts on Facebook's about-face Schnitt said the company is in the process of rewording its Terms of Use in "simple language that defines Facebook's rights much more specifically." 





   "Well that worked pretty fast," wrote member Al Reford of Vancouver, British Columbia. "Numbers count when giving feedback :)" And Shahrzad Grami of St. Paul, Minnesota, added: " YAYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!! nice job guys! i won't be canceling my account after all."

   Facebook hits 200 million members, thinks charityStory Highlights Facebook, the social-networking site, reached 200 million members this week  To commemorate, the site launched a charity page called Facebook for Good  Facebook has partnered with 16 charities that have created virtual "gifts"   Members can buy the gifts for one anothers' profiles, with proceeds going to charityNext Article in Technology »   By   Caroline McCarthy 



 


 

 
 (CNET) -- We knew Facebook was about to hit 200 million active users, but now it's official, per a post Wednesday by founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg on the company's official blog. 
Members can share stories about how the social site has helped them give back on this page. 
 "We will welcome our 200 millionth user to Facebook some time today," wrote Zuckerberg, who's just over a month away from his 25th birthday. "Growing rapidly to 200 million users is a really good start, but we've always known that in order for Facebook to help people represent everything that is happening in their world, everyone needs to have a voice." To commemorate the occasion, Facebook has launched a page called Facebook for Good, a page for members to share stories and experiences about how the social site has helped them give back. It has also partnered with 16 charities and advocacy groups that have created virtual "gifts" that members can buy for one anothers' profiles. Most of the proceeds of the sale will go to the charity--Zuckerberg wrote that the rest will go to administrative costs, not to Facebook. The partner organizations include a few longstanding names in charity like the American Red Cross and the American Heart Association, as well as newer tech-industry favorites like micro-loan start-up Kiva, shoe retailer Toms, and clean-water group Charity Water. The campaign also puts Facebook's virtual-gift platform and "credits" system back in the spotlight at a time when, after much anticipation, the company is finally starting to make some moves in the micropayment space.

 Slightly over a year ago, at the South by Southwest Interactive Festival, Zuckerberg was asked about Facebook's plans in the philanthropic space. His response was that the company wasn't yet at that point. "I think at this point, because we're not incredibly profitable, we're not at that stage of the company--hopefully we get there--that's not really something that we can do a lot of," he said to CNET News last March. "But I'd like to think that just what the company is trying to do in general, just helping people communicate, is actually making the world better." A year later, Facebook's revenues are up, but not as much as some critics say they ought to be. This kind of growth isn't cheap--and with 200 million users, Facebook still has a lot of work to do on the business side, not just in the feel-good, change-the-world department.

  Facebook urged to remove Holocaust-denial groupsStory Highlights Brother of Dallas Mavericks owner wants Facebook to remove offensive pages  Brian Cuban is fighting to have Holocaust Denial groups banned from site  Facebook spokesman: "Being offensive or objectionable" doesn't warrant removal  Expert: Deniers are drawn to social-networking sites to find like-minded people Next Article in Technology »   By  Lisa Respers France  CNN 



 


 

  (CNN) -- Part of the power of social networking is the ability to form communities with like-minded individuals. 
Attorney Brian Cuban is trying to get Facebook to remove pages for Holocaust denial groups such as this one. 
 But what happens when those communities are offensive to others?  That issue is at the heart of attempts by a Dallas, Texas, attorney to have social-networking site Facebook remove pages for Holocaust deniers. The Holocaust Denial movement seeks to deny or minimize the Holocaust, in which Nazis killed about six million European Jews during World War II.  Attorney Brian Cuban, brother of Dallas Mavericks team owner Mark Cuban, has been trying since last year to have the pages of groups with such names as "Holocaust: A Series of Lies," and "Holocaust is a Holohoax" removed from Facebook.  He pointed out that Facebook has removed groups based on complaints before and said the site is "setting the subjective standard on what they remove and what they don't."

 "There is no First Amendment right to free speech in the private realm," Cuban said. "This isn't a freedom-of-speech issue. Facebook is free to set the standard that they wish."    Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt said his company is in agreement with Cuban that the Holocaust-denial pages are offensive and objectionable.  Where the two sides part, Schnitt said, is whether people have the right to discuss such ideas on Facebook.  "It's a difficult decision to make. We have a lot of internal debate and we bring in experts to talk about it," Schnitt said. "Just being offensive or objectionable doesn't get it taken off Facebook. We want it [the site] to be a place where people can discuss all kinds of ideas, including controversial ones."  Schnitt said Facebook has drawn the line with pages or groups that attack an individual or incite or threaten violence. Schnitt pointed to the recent removal of the "Isle of Man KKK" page, created by residents of the island off the coast of England.  Facebook interpreted the page's advocacy of "cleansing the island of foreigners" as threatening and inciting violence, he said.   Facebook receives lots of reports about such pages and actively polices the site, Schnitt said. Last year Facebook removed several pages posted by Italian neo-Nazis after complaints that they encouraged violence against gypsies.    Brian Cuban, who is of Russian Jewish descent, has written about his fight to have the Holocaust-denial pages removed on his site, The Cuban Revolution.  He said he contacted Facebook after a conversation with a friend who runs the Jewish Internet Defense Force, a group that monitors and tries to eradicate anti-Semitic online content.    The Jewish Internet Defense Force, which was successful in removing a Facebook page for the group "Israel Is Not A Country! Delist It From Facebook As A Country," is outspoken in its own right and sometimes guilty of sweeping generalizations of its own. In an article on Brian Cuban's site published during the 2008 presidential campaign, a representative from the Jewish Internet Defense Force was quoted as saying that "99.9 percent of Muslims hate us."  The article went on to quote JIDF spokesman on the last Presidential campaign: "We hope to continue to highlight the issues surrounding [then-candidate Barack Obama's] terrorist connections as well as his racist and anti-Semitic church, which has supported Hamas and the Rev. Louis Farrakhan."  A Jewish Internet Defense Force spokesperson named David, who requested his last name be withheld because his group has received death threats, said Thursday he would rather people not focus on those specific quotes for several reasons, including the fact that it was an "informal interview" and Cuban "would not let us correct any of our statements after we quickly answered him to help him meet his deadline."  But on the matter of Facebook and Holocaust deniers, the Jewish Internet Defense Force has a clear stance.  "Facebook should not provide a platform for hatred, especially as it is against their TOS [terms of service]," David said. "Holocaust denial is illegal in 13 countries and represents a form of Jew hatred and hate speech in general." Deborah Lipstadt is the Dorot Professor of Modern Jewish and Holocaust Studies at Emory University and an expert on Holocaust denial. She said social-networking sites like Facebook are attractive to deniers.  "It allows people to find one another, both for good and for bad," she said. "People who are drawn to Holocaust denial tend to be fringe kind of people who might not otherwise be able to find a group, but this way they can find other like-minded people."    Deborah Lauter, director of Civil Rights for the Anti-Defamation League, said the issue of anti-Semitism and hate speech online is a growing one, partly because of the anonymity the Web offers. Lauter pointed out that Facebook's Statement of Rights and Responsibilities says that users "will not post content that is hateful, threatening, pornographic, or that contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence."  She said the Anti-Defamation League has worked with sites such as YouTube and MySpace to encourage them to be "socially responsible corporate citizens."  "Even though in the States this kind of hate is protected speech, [Web sites] don't have to provide the forum to help spread it," said Lauter, whose organization is the U.S. representative for the International Network Against CyberHate. "Our position is that if you are going to be providing it, then you have to step up and put in the mechanism for policing it."

Michael Jackson is Facebook's most popular - CNN.com 



















 

  







 





  













  Michael Jackson is Facebook's most popularStory Highlights Michael Jackson is most popular person on Facebook with nearly 7 million fans  Previously, U.S. President Obama had the most fans  Experts say Jackson's fan base gaining more than 20 fans per second Next Article in Technology »   By  Stephanie Busari CNN  



 


 

  LONDON, England (CNN)  -- Michael Jackson has officially become the most popular person on Facebook, with more than 7 million fans on the social networking site. 
The Michael Jackson Facebook page is now the most popular on the social networking site. 
 Previously, the most popular person on Facebook, with just over 6 million fans, was U.S. President Obama.  Over the past week, Jackson's page has grown from 80,000 fans to just over 7 million, generating the largest response on a Facebook page, the social networking site says.     He has continued to gain about 20 fans per second and even more during peak traffic hours, said social media commentator Nick O'Neill, founder of the Social Times Web site.   By comparison, actor Ashton Kutcher recently entered a race to beat CNN's Larry King to 1 million followers on Twitter. Kutcher won and remains the most popular person on Twitter -- but still has only 2.6 million followers. During his memorial service at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California, all 10 trending topics on Twitter.com were Jackson-related.

   Jackson's popularity and the viral nature of Facebook fan pages are the primary reasons for the huge fan base, O'Neill explained.  He said, "It's simply his popularity. Also, as users become fans, the page gets recommended to others, driving the viral growth of the page.    "Michael Jackson is simply the largest celebrity in the world. While he was a controversial figure, he clearly attracts the attention of the global media," he continued.  The Facebook page has become an online memorial to Jackson, with thousands of comments from around the world; dozens appear every minute.

 Free virtual versions of Jackson's famous glove are the most popular gift on the site, with more than 800,000 sent to members.  The huge following leaves the singer's heirs (and his record label) with a massive network to communicate with fans and continue the massive resurgence of interest in Jackson's music, O'Neill said.  "While Sony has not heavily engaged the fan base on Michael Jackson's page, they at least have a presence. If your fans are there, you should be there. "This also provided an ongoing promotional channel for any future products that are released. It's simply not an option and will become a component of all marketing strategies." There have been 2.6 million downloads of Jackson's music since his death. He has the top two albums on iTunes, as well as three of the top 10 singles.  In the United Kingdom, Jackson held 11 of the top 200 album positions and 43 of the top 200 singles, based on sales monitored by the Official Charts Co. for the week ended June 27.  His "Number Ones" album topped the OCC album chart after selling 46,400 physical copies and 10,000 downloads.  The surge for demand in Jackson's music looks likely to continue for several months: The fan page has a music player with some of Jackson's hits and an option to buy them through Amazon.

  Marines ban Twitter, Facebook, other sitesStory Highlights U.S. Marine Corps bans Twitter, Facebook, MySpace and other social media sites  Order, issued Monday, states that information on the sites poses a security risk  The Marines' ban is effective immediately and will last a year  U.S. Army recently ordered all U.S. bases to provide access to Facebook Next Article in Technology »   By Noah Shachtman  



 


 

  (WIRED) -- The U.S. Marine Corps has banned Twitter, Facebook, MySpace and other social media sites from its networks, effective immediately. 
The Marine Corps fears that social media sites such as Facebook could pose a security risk. 
 "These internet sites in general are a proven haven for malicious actors and content and are particularly high risk due to information exposure, user generated content and targeting by adversaries," reads a Marine Corps order, issued Monday.  "The very nature of SNS [social network sites] creates a larger attack and exploitation window, exposes unnecessary information to adversaries and provides an easy conduit for information leakage that puts OPSEC [operational security], COMSEC [communications security], [and] personnel... at an elevated risk of compromise." The Marines' ban will last a year. It was drawn up in response to a late July warning from U.S. Strategic Command, which told the rest of the military it was considering a Defense Department-wide ban on the Web 2.0 sites, due to network security concerns.  Scams, worms, and Trojans often spread unchecked throughout social media sites, passed along from one online friend to the next.

 "The mechanisms for social networking were never designed for security and filtering. They make it way too easy for people with bad intentions to push malicious code to unsuspecting users," a Stratcom source told Wired.com. Yet many within the Pentagon's highest ranks find value in the Web 2.0 tools. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has 4,000 followers on Twitter. The Department of Defense is getting ready to unveil a new home page, packed with social media tools. The Army recently ordered all U.S. bases to provide access to Facebook. Top generals now blog from the battlefield. "OPSEC is paramount. We will have procedures in place to deal with that," Price Floyd, the Pentagon's newly-appointed social media czar, said.  "What we can't do is let security concerns trump doing business. We have to do business... We need to be everywhere men and women in uniform are and the public is. If that's MySpace and YouTube, that's where we need to be, too," Floyd said. The Marines say they will issue waivers to the Web 2.0 blockade, if a "mission critical need" can be proven. And they will continue to allow access to the military's internal "SNS-like services." But for most members of the Corps, access to the real, public social networks is now shut off for the next year.

 The 12 most annoying FacebookersBy  Brandon Griggs, CNN      Far too many Facebook posts read like navel-gazing diary entries, the author says. STORY HIGHLIGHTSFacebook is a great tool -- and a reminder of why some people get on your nervesToo many status updates read like navel-gazing diary entries, or worse, spamA dozen of the most annoying types of Facebook users listedAmong them: bores, shameless self-promoters and people who send you quizzes
RELATED TOPICS


Facebook Inc.

Internet

 (CNN) -- Facebook, for better or worse, is like being at a big party with all your friends, family, acquaintances and co-workers. There are lots of fun, interesting people you're happy to talk to when they stroll up. Then there are the other people, the ones who make you cringe when you see them coming. This article is about those people. Sure, Facebook can be a great tool for keeping up with folks who are important to you. Take the status update, the 160-character message that users post in response to the question, "What's on your mind?" An artful, witty or newsy status update is a pleasure -- a real-time, tiny window into a friend's life. But far more posts read like navel-gazing diary entries, or worse, spam. A recent study categorized 40 percent of Twitter tweets as "pointless babble," and it wouldn't be surprising if updates on Facebook, still a fast-growing social network, break down in a similar way.  Combine dull status updates with shameless self-promoters, "friend-padders" and that friend of a friend who sends you quizzes every day, and Facebook becomes a daily reminder of why some people can get on your nerves.   Here are 12 of the most annoying types of Facebook users: The Let-Me-Tell-You-Every-Detail-of-My-Day Bore. "I'm waking up." "I had Wheaties for breakfast." "I'm bored at work." "I'm stuck in traffic." You're kidding! How fascinating! No moment is too mundane for some people to broadcast unsolicited to the world. Just because you have 432 Facebook friends doesn't mean we all want to know when you're waiting for the bus. The Self-Promoter. OK, so we've probably all posted at least once about some achievement. And sure, maybe your friends really do want to read the fascinating article you wrote about beet farming. But when almost EVERY update is a link to your blog, your poetry reading, your 10k results or your art show, you sound like a bragger or a self-centered careerist. The Friend-Padder. The average Facebook user has 120 friends on the site. Schmoozers and social butterflies -- you know, the ones who make lifelong pals on the subway -- might reasonably have 300 or 400. But 1,000 "friends?" Unless you're George Clooney or just won the lottery, no one has that many. That's just showing off. The Town Crier. "Michael Jackson is dead!!!" You heard it from me first! Me, and the 213,000 other people who all saw it on TMZ. These Matt Drudge wannabes are the reason many of us learn of breaking news not from TV or news sites but from online social networks. In their rush to trumpet the news, these people also spread rumors, half-truths and innuendo. No, Jeff Goldblum did not plunge to his death from a New Zealand cliff. The TMIer. "Brad is heading to Walgreens to buy something for these pesky hemorrhoids." Boundaries of privacy and decorum don't seem to exist for these too-much-information updaters, who unabashedly offer up details about their sex lives, marital troubles and bodily functions. Thanks for sharing. The Bad Grammarian. "So sad about Fara Fauset but Im so gladd its friday yippe". Yes, I know the punctuation rules are different in the digital world. And, no, no one likes a spelling-Nazi schoolmarm. But you sound like a moron. The Sympathy-Baiter. "Barbara is feeling sad today." "Man, am I glad that's over." "Jim could really use some good news about now." Like anglers hunting for fish, these sad sacks cast out their hooks -- baited with vague tales of woe -- in the hopes of landing concerned responses. Genuine bad news is one thing, but these manipulative posts are just pleas for attention. The Lurker. The Peeping Toms of Facebook, these voyeurs are too cautious, or maybe too lazy, to update their status or write on your wall. But once in a while, you'll be talking to them and they'll mention something you posted, so you know they're on your page, hiding in the shadows. It's just a little creepy. The Crank. These curmudgeons, like the trolls who spew hate in blog comments, never met something they couldn't complain about. "Carl isn't really that impressed with idiots who don't realize how idiotic they are." [Actual status update.] Keep spreading the love. The Paparazzo. Ever visit your Facebook page and discover that someone's posted a photo of you from last weekend's party -- a photo you didn't authorize and haven't even seen? You'd really rather not have to explain to your mom why you were leering like a drunken hyena and French-kissing a bottle of Jagermeister. The Obscurist. "If not now then when?" "You'll see..." "Grist for the mill." "John is, small world." "Dave thought he was immune, but no. No, he is not." [Actual status updates, all.] Sorry, but you're not being mysterious -- just nonsensical. The Chronic Inviter. "Support my cause. Sign my petition. Play Mafia Wars with me. Which 'Star Trek' character are you? Here are the 'Top 5 cars I have personally owned.' Here are '25 Things About Me.' Here's a drink. What drink are you? We're related! I took the 'What President Are You?' quiz and found out I'm Millard Fillmore! What president are you?" You probably mean well, but stop. Just stop. I don't care what president I am -- can't we simply be friends? Now excuse me while I go post the link to this story on my Facebook page.

 Protesters hijack more than 200 Facebook groupsBy  Doug Gross, CNN      Hundreds of Facebook groups have been hijacked by users protesting what they say are flaws in how the site is run. STORY HIGHLIGHTS A group called "Control Your Info" apparently took over 286 Facebook groups  The organization is protesting how groups are administered on Facebook  It is blaming Facebook for shutting down its fan page and accounts  Members of hijacked groups call the stunt inappropriate, selfish 
RELATED TOPICS


Facebook Inc.

 (CNN) -- Hundreds of Facebook groups have been hijacked in recent days by users pointing out what they say is a weakness in how the social-networking site handles the administration of its groups. By Tuesday morning, 286 groups had apparently been renamed Control Your Info and had a new message posted to their walls. "Hello, we hereby announce that we have officially hijacked your Facebook group," the message reads. "This means we control a certain part of the information about you on Facebook. If we wanted we could make you appear in a bad way which could damage your image severly [sic]."  According to Control Your Info, when Facebook group administrators step down, anyone else can take over their duties -- giving them access to members' personal information, the ability to send messages to all members of the group and the authority to make changes to that group. "For example we could rename your group and call it something very inappropriate and nasty like 'I Support Pedophiles' Rights,' " the message continued. "But have no fear. We won't." Among the groups renamed "Control Your Info" on Tuesday were a "Twilight" fan group, supporters of a high school football team and patrons of a Virginia winery. In a statement, Facebook said no confidential information has been placed at risk.  "The groups in question have been abandoned by their previous owners, which means any group member has the option to make themselves an administrator in order to continue communication to the group. Group administrators have no access to confidential information and group members can leave a group at any time," said a Facebook spokesperson. "For small groups, administrators can simply edit a group name or info, moderate discussion, and message group members. The names of large groups cannot be changed nor can anyone message all members.  "In the rare instances when we find that a group has been changed inappropriately, we will disable the group," the spokesperson said.  The names of two Facebook users who have posted Control Your Info messages after group takeovers -- Janis Roukkos and Bella Roregit -- did not appear to have active Facebook accounts by mid-morning Tuesday. A message on Control Your Info's Web site blamed Facebook for shutting down the group's fan page. Members of the group could not be reached for comment Tuesday.  The group, which offered only a YouTube account as contact information, disagreed with calling what it had done "hacking." "This isn't some kind of scare tactics, nor is it a hack, it's a feature that can be used, and is being used, in bad ways," the post reads. "Remember, control your info! Also, this project is strictly not for profit and done for a good cause." The group's site contains pages of tips on protecting social-network users' private information. Not all members of the groups that were hijacked were taking the stunt in the spirit it was apparently intended. "It's pretty inappropriate and [expletive] you hijacked a facebook group for Palestinian rights to selfishly promote your little conspiracy theory page," one user wrote. "I reported this to facebook and others should too."

 Facebook board aims to keep kids safe       Facebook's advisory board will include five Internet groups to help protect children, the social-networking site says.

 (CNN) -- Facebook has joined forces with five Internet groups to help protect kids, the social-networking site said. "We believe that the only way to keep kids safe online is for everyone who wants to protect them to work together," Elliot Schrage, a Facebook vice president, said in a statement Sunday.  "The formation of a board to advise specifically on safety issues is a positive, innovative and collaborative step toward creating a more robust safety environment, and we are thrilled that such a well-respected, trusted group of organizations has joined us in this endeavor." Making up the advisory board are Common Sense Media, ConnectSafely, WiredSafety, Childnet International and the Family Online Safety Institute.  Facebook's announcement comes less than a week after it added new privacy features, including the ability for users to select who can see each post made to the Web site.  The highlight is deciding which Facebook friends see updates, photos or other posts at the time they're posted -- "something many of you have asked for," Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg said. "In addition, we'll also be fulfilling a request made by many of you to make the privacy-settings page simpler by combining some settings," he said.  A letter on the Web site said that, in the next couple of weeks, Facebook's roughly 350 million users will be asked to review and update their privacy settings. A message on the site will explain the changes and take users to the page where they can update the settings, Zuckerberg said.

  Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg opens upStory Highlights Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg talks about the evolution of his company  You should be able to connect to business like you do a person, Zuckerberg says  Zuckerberg: It's easy to have philosophy but moving people there is harder  Value of site is that it "opens up communication channels and builds relationships"Next Article in Technology »   By   Fred Vogelstein 



 


 

  (WIRED) -- Back in April, I interviewed Mark Zuckerberg as part of my research for Wired's Great Wall of Facebook piece. 
Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks at the Digital Life Design conference in Munich, Germany. 
 Here is an edited transcript in which the Facebook founder and CEO talks about the limitations of walled gardens, the evolution of privacy online and why Home Depot should "humanize" itself. Wired.com: What is your vision for Facebook? Mark Zuckerberg: When I started Facebook from my dorm room in 2004, the idea that my roommates and I talked about all the time was a world that was more open.  We believed that people being able to share the information they wanted and having access to the information they wanted is just a better world: People can connect better with the people around them, understand more of what's going on with the people around them, and understand more in general.  Also, openness fundamentally affects a lot of the core institutions in society -- the media, the economy, how people relate to the government and just their leadership. We thought that stuff was really interesting to pursue. I think it turns out that the best way to do that is to build a company and an organization. We've learned a lot along the way about how to do that.  One of the things we learned was that there were two ways to get to this place of more information access. There was the top-down way, right -- you can kind of characterize that by the Google, or search approach -- where you have a bunch of machines and algorithms going out and crawling the web and bringing information into them.

 But we figured that over time that wouldn't actually be the best approach. We figured it wouldn't get the most information. It would only get stuff that was publicly available to everyone, and it wouldn't give people the control that they needed to be really be comfortable. No one wants to live in a surveillance society, which, if you take that to its extreme, could be where that's going. And there's (Facebook) -- a kind of a ground-up approach -- where people choose to share all this information themselves.  It's a slower approach, right, because what it means is that people need to move through this process of realizing that sharing information is good, and slowly sharing more and more information over time.  But by doing that you get a lot richer information; you get information that people don't want to share with everyone, but they just want to share with some people around them. You get personal information, like photos from my vacation, or a trip that I want to share with people. And it just ends up being a richer web, and it's more democratically controlled by the people who are sharing stuff, as opposed to by some central entity that's going out and indexing all this information, right? And that's the path we've been on, and it's really interesting just watching the rate of information production change.  I think at this point there are probably more people who are sharing stuff either privately or semi-privately on social networks (than just letting it be crawled by search engines). When I use that word, I mean sharing with 100 or 1,000 or 10,000 people. It's not e-mail that you're sending to one or two people, but it's also not something that you're making available to everyone. I think there's a lot of information that people are sharing like that now, and that's probably growing a lot quicker than the volume of blogs, or other completely open sites on the web.    There's something like a billion new photos a month (on Facebook), and that's just one type of media on the site (Facebook) where there is over a billion new pieces of information shared each week. Wired.com: Let's be a little bit more specific. You just gave us a 30,000-foot view. Maybe we should do it now from 5,000 or 10,000 feet. Zuckerberg: So I think there are two big themes: One is just the trend that Facebook is taking for the next couple years, and then there's more structural stuff that's underlying that in terms of the platform that we're building. First, think about how the Facebook platform has evolved. We started off as this platform inside Facebook; and we were pretty clear from the beginning that that wasn't where it was going to end up.  A lot of people saw it and asked, "Why is Facebook trying to get all these applications inside Facebook when the web is clearly the platform?" And we actually agreed with that. It's just that we were just getting started. And now as time goes on, we're shifting away from Platform inside Facebook and shifting more towards Connect (outside of Facebook). And Connect has just a lot of advantages that I think developers will gravitate towards. So, the ability for developers to have their own website with all the same functionality in it that they could've built inside Facebook allows them to build their own brand, allows them to have their own users more than just getting Facebook users inside the site. So, I just think it ends up being a stronger system than the first Facebook platform we had. The structural change comes from this point of openness. We talk about this concept of openness and transparency as the high level ideal that we're moving towards at Facebook.  The way that we get there is by empowering people to share and connect. The combination of those two things leads the world to become more open. And so as time has gone on, we've actually shifted a bit more of a focus not just on directly making it so people can use Facebook and share and be open on Facebook, but instead on making it so that the systems themselves have open properties. So, one analogy that we think about is a government or a nation. If you want to be free, or you want to preserve freedom for people, you both need to have laws that make it so people have freedom of speech and all the freedoms that they need. You also need to have an open governance system where people can vote and people have representation. And we think that over the long-term the way that we actually create the most openness and transparency in the world (at Facebook) is both by creating the most powerful applications ourselves and creating a platform that is fundamentally moving more in the direction of being an open platform itself, right? So we're aiming for openness on two levels: One on the fact that there's more sharing, and another on the fact that by having these open standards, you're constantly moving towards a place in the industry where there will be more and more sharing, right? So people can bring their information anywhere they want. Anyone can use the platform. Wired.com: Does that mean every Facebook user will have control over how public his/her information is and be able to decide whether or not it can be crawled by search engines? Zuckerberg: We've already started moving in that direction. Just a couple of weeks ago we announced this open privacy setting where prior to that it was impossible for someone to take their profile and say that they wanted it to be open.  Now they can do that. They can say it's open to everyone. And what I would just expect is that as time goes on, we're just going to keep on moving more and more in that direction. We launched stuff like Platform, and we get a lot of praise for that. We also get a lot of people saying "But this isn't as open as it needs to be." And in a lot of ways I think they're right, but this stuff takes time.  We're moving a community of 200 million people along this spectrum trying to tell people to share information and be comfortable with that. Just from the launches that we've had, it's pretty clear that we haven't mastered the art of moving people along in terms of change, making these changes; but I think we're getting better at it. And there's a long way to go, but I think that's kind of the direction that we're moving in. Wired.com: Why not pursue this strategy from the beginning? Why did you wait until now to do all the things that we're talking about? Zuckerberg: So this is a really important point. It's really easy to have a nice philosophy about openness, but moving the world in that direction is a different thing. It requires both understanding where you want to go and being pragmatic about getting there.  In politics you get this all the time. It's easy for people to have a point of view on how things should be, yet the people who are actually in the Senate or Congress or White House need to balance on a daily basis where they want to go with how they actually get stuff done. Wired.com: So would you agree with the statement, then, that you can't succeed on the internet by putting up walls? Zuckerberg: I think it's not quite that black and white. What I think is true is that over time things trend towards becoming more open, right. I think early on they tend to start closed. And that's important, right? It's an important phase.  One analogy and example that I look at is personal computers and how they evolved. You started off with people who just built the whole thing themselves. Then as time went on the platforms either for hardware or software became more open, and that has produced a much better outcome in terms of the types of machines that people can use.  But it had to start somewhere, right? It couldn't start off as this open platform. Someone had to put the idea of a computer out there first. So I think you generally want to move towards more openness. I don't think anything ever gets completely open. Is there an open format for keyboards? I guess so. There are multiple different keyboard layouts. But basically everyone uses one, right? Wired.com: Except many believe that the rules that drove the PC industry don't apply to the rules that are evolving around business on the internet. They say that you actually need to start open and continue to be open. Zuckerberg: So I think one thing that's really important is that the rules are constantly changing. I think a lot of the issues that some of these other companies have had is they define themselves too narrowly as a company in a specific medium.  Like e-mail could have easily moved into being what social networks are today. I think a lot of e-mail companies now are actually trying to move in that direction. But I feel like because they defined themselves as just e-mail companies, they didn't adapt quickly enough. We define ourselves more broadly, as a company that's trying to bring innovative things to people that help them share more and make the world more open. And I think that that mindset allows us to change very rapidly.  Sometimes it's so rapid that our community isn't ready for it or isn't happy about it when it initially happens. But I feel like our approach of just being focused on understanding this trend (of openness and sharing) and moving very quickly along it has been a stronger approach than anyone who's tried to build a medium for where the world is in any given point in time. Wired.com: How do you envision what you're doing today enabling other companies and Facebook to make money? Zuckerberg: Openness and transparency affects how people and businesses relate to each other. So it used to be the case where only really big companies could do advertising on the web, and then Google came along. And they made it so anyone can do basic direct response advertising. Now they have millions of advertisers. Wired.com: Right. Zuckerberg: I think that there could be even a more dramatic change with Facebook. If you look at the space of the people who do brand advertising, which is basically advertising that's more for the long-term -- not to sell something today, but instead to build a relationship -- I think that that's going to be something that's not only accessible to the largest brands, but accessible to everyone.  If you take that idea a step further you might conclude that not only will it be something that's accessible to everyone, but something that everyone feels they have to participate in. Think about what people are doing on Facebook today. They're keeping up with their friends and family, but they're also building an image and identity for themselves, which in a sense is their brand. They're connecting with the audience that they want to connect to. It's almost a disadvantage if you're not on it now. If you carry that thinking over from people to things like stores and brands you realize that everyone's trying to do the same thing, which is communicate, build a reputation, build relationships with people, and just have more information out there. Wired.com: So give me an example. A year or two from now, what might you be able to do on Facebook that would be an example of what you're talking about -- if you're a small business. Or a large business, for that matter? Zuckerberg: You should be able to connect to a business in the same way that you connect to a friend, or a person on the site, and then that business should be able to publish things in the same way that that happens for people you care about. So, that was a big part of this whole streams release on the homepage that we just did. Now, it's not completely there yet, right? People are still bi-directional confirmed relationships while Facebook Pages (those for businesses and celebrities) have to be these one-directional relationships. People can send messages to each other. Facebook Pages can only send these updates to all their fans. Over time we're going to see that those things are just going to converge completely, right? So a business or celebrity Page will be able to send a message to all their fans. At the same time they'll be able to send messages to individuals that they're connected to. So no matter who you are -- a person on the site or a store, or a big brand -- you'll be able to have the same options for how you connect to people. You could make it bi-directional, so you have to confirm each one, or you could make it so people can just connect you. Wired.com: The part that makes sense to me is the small business part because I can understand wanting to have a relationship with my local butcher or dry cleaner.  It's harder for me to envision how that works with, say, The Gap, or any other big brand out there, because almost by definition people perceive those interactions as not being about relationships, but being about just pure commerce. You can make the case that your local butcher really cares about you and your relationship, but you can't really say that anymore about your local Home Depot or your bank. Zuckerberg: Actually I think this is one of the most profound changes that more openness and transparency brings: It puts more weight and importance on building better social relationships and being more trustworthy. So, I actually do think you're seeing this trend towards organizations just caring more about their brand and engaging. And so I think Home Depot will want to humanize itself. I think that's a lot of why companies are starting blogs, are just giving more insight into what's going on with them.  I think it's actually a big reason why a lot of companies are embracing the green movement, for example. It's really easy to portray people running companies as only caring about money, but they care about real things too. And I think part of this trend is that there will be more visibility into that, right?  So the Home Depot will have a brand that is about what they sell -- different tools and things. But it will also have a brand that is based on their staff and how they relate to customers. And I think that that ends up being really important. Look at the way celebrities and politicians are using Facebook already. When Ashton Kutcher posts a video, he gets hundreds of pieces of feedback. Maybe he doesn't have time to read them all or respond to them all, but he's getting good feedback and getting a good sense of how people are thinking about that and maybe can respond to some of it, right? And that's still really valuable. And I would expect a similar dynamic to evolve with businesses. Wired.com: People have been trying for years to make money selling ads on IMs, selling ads on e-mail, selling ads in all forms on communication mediums, But the reality is that when you're in communication mode, you're not particularly receptive to advertising. Why is that not an issue for Facebook? Zuckerberg: Yeah, I agree with that. And I think the difference is that this isn't a pure communication medium. People use it to share information, but sharing is a bit different than communicating, right? Sharing is putting something out there, and then people are going and getting it asynchronously, right?  So a lot more of what we do is trying to surface the right information to the right people, which gives us leverage and opportunities to surface other information, like interesting advertisements that they might want to see as well. But yeah, I agree that like when people are IM-ing on Facebook, which is one of the behaviors, it wouldn't make sense for us to have an ad in the IM, right? But when people go to their homepage in the morning to see what's going on, one of the things that's going on could be a sponsored thing.  I think a lot of the value that Facebook creates is that it opens up communication channels and builds relationships. I think that that's just a really valuable thing, and it has probably been undervalued to this point. Wired.com: Facebook's focus on real-time streams reminds me a little bit of TV before Tivo. If you're a business and you want people to see your brand and have a relationship with your brand in peoples' stream, you have to be looking at the stream at specific times. Doesn't that mean you have to start selling ads like networks do -- based on the size and type of audience at different times of the day? Zuckerberg: There are different modalities. One is a real time element. There's also the highlights and news feeds components. And then you have search or behaviors where the person's actively seeking out some information.  We want to make that available to them very, very clearly. So, if I type in tools, then, I think that there's a good opportunity to show you things that your friends are connected to. Wired.com: And you're going to build the search stuff yourself, I would suspect. Zuckerberg: Yes, or at least we'll try.

  Clerics: We don't want to ban Facebook, we use itStory Highlights Indonesian Islamic clerics say they have not called for a ban on Facebook  Clerics say they are against its use for things like pornography and drug dealing  They are avid Facebook users, saying it can be a positive toolNext Article in World »   By  Kathy Quiano CNN 



 


 

  JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN) -- Indonesian Islamic clerics say they have not called for a ban on popular social networking sites like Facebook, and that they are avid users themselves. 
A group of Indonesian clerics says they do not want Facebook banned. 
 According to media reports, the clerics in East Java had banned the faithful from gossiping and flirting on social networking Web sites such as Facebook and Friendster. They also demanded an end to "lewd and pornographic" content, the reports said. However, Muchammad Nabil Haroen, a spokesman for the Liboryo Islamic Boarding School, told CNN Monday that they were not after a ban and that he and several other clerics had Facebook accounts.   Haroen said that a meeting of about 700 clerics at the boarding school last week had issued guidelines on the use of online networks and mobile phones, saying Web sites like Facebook should only be used for "positive" purposes like networking and seeking old friends.  "If Facebook is used for negative purposes like drug dealing or prostitution, then it's forbidden," he clarified. If it was used for such offences the clerics could push for a  fatwa or edict, he said.

 He stressed that the clerics' statement was only a recommendation for the Indonesian Council of Religious Scholars and the Nahdlatul Ulama, one of the country's largest Muslim organizations, to consider. Choli Nafis, deputy head of Nahdlatul Ulama's Fatwa Commission, confirmed the organization had received the recommendation but said: "Facebook is just a tool, like a car or a television. If people use it in a good way, there's no need to ban it." Nafis too, uses Facebook. The  most recent fatwas include bans on smoking in public and the practice of yoga that incorporates religious rituals like chanting and meditation. These have largely been ignored by Indonesian Muslims. A survey cited by alexa.com, which tracks Internet traffic, and that appeared in The Jakarta Post, found that Facebook was the top ranked site in Indonesia.  Nearly four percent of all Facebook users come from Indonesia, making it the largest source of visitors after the United States, United Kingdom, France and Italy, alexa.com found.

 Facebookers blame Vietnam for blocking siteBy  Giang Nguyen, CNN     Blogger Nguyen Thanh Phong satirizes what he believes are government attempts to block Facebook. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Facebook users accuse Vietnamese government of blocking the site   Blogger named Diesebemol: The government can't control it so they oppose it  Vietnam denies it is blocking the site but admits to concerns about Facebook   Facebook says it has not made changes that would affect services   (CNN) -- An American friend studying in Vietnam was the first to tell me about her problems accessing Facebook, back in November. Soon, voices from Vietnam multiplied online, reporting the same issue. Now, Facebook users there are blaming the government for allegedly blocking access to the social networking site. My family still maintains ties to Vietnam after we emigrated almost three decades ago. With the Internet and Facebook, it has been easier than ever. Armed with a few online connections and a bit of Vietnamese, I set out to talk to the parties involved. Among my first leads - a blogger from Vietnam, who calls himself Diesebemol. At 50 years old, he makes a living as a private driver for foreign businessmen. He did not want to give his real name for fear of reprisal. He says he used Facebook to share perspectives, discuss social issues and politics. "It's a matter of information flow. Everybody can express themselves (on Facebook)," he says. "The government can't control it, so they oppose it." Vietnamese government officials deny the accusation. Mr. Dang Anh Tuan, with the government's Ministry of Information and Communications, told CNN: "We don't have a policy to block Facebook," although he acknowledged that Facebook activities are a concern to the agency and that its use by Vietnam's netizens were monitored. Vietnamese Internet Service Providers, or ISPs, in turn cite a series of reasons for the ongoing access errors, from technical malfunctioning to a problem with Facebook itself. Debbie Frost, a spokeswoman for Palo Alto, California-based Facebook, told CNN there are no issues on Facebook's end. "We have not changed our service; we haven't made it more difficult or made any changes that would affect service." 
A partial block is all that's needed to kill off the widespread use of Facebook.--Huy Zing, U.S. ex-pat in Vietnam

Facebook would not comment on who or what is to blame for the access problems many of Vietnam's Facebook users say they're experiencing. Although there appear to be no public records to validate claims of a government-ordered ban, some users still believe the government is to blame. The U.S. State Department raised the issue with its counterparts at the Vietnamese embassy in Washington and in Hanoi. A State Department official told CNN: "The department views censorship of Facebook in Vietnam as a threat to Internet freedom." "We are especially disappointed to see Facebook being persistently blocked in Vietnam so soon after that dialogue," the official wrote in an e-mail, referring to the Vietnam Human Rights Dialogue the agency held with Vietnam's Foreign Ministry in November. Spotty access to the popular site was first reported around the same time. Service providers take turns blocking access, claims blogger Diesebemol, and it's gradually spreading to more providers. On the day I talked to him, Diesebemol says he could not access Facebook through his ISP. "I use Netn@m and they just completely blocked the Facebook page," he said. I reached a technical worker at Netn@m who confirmed the company was having problems providing Facebook at that time. Pham Phuong Lien, a 22-year-old business management student in Hanoi, also received a dreaded "Access Denied" message when she tried to log in. She and other anxious Facebook friends traded workarounds -- alternative ways to get access. "We exchange Internet addresses via e-mail or chat messenger. In class, our teachers send them to us! Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't." The block, if there is one, can be overcome by savvy web surfers with a bit of know-how. On Twitter, blogs and even Facebook's Vietnamese competitor, Zing Me, users shared their outrage, but also helpful instructions on how to overcome the firewall. Huy Zing, a U.S. ex-pat and software developer in Ho Chi Minh City, posted on his blog: "A partial block is all that's needed to kill off the widespread use of Facebook." "We know it's a half-assed job. The technical block is not a high-quality block." he explains further. "You don't have to have a full block to stifle opinion." Still, the obstacles put in place are irking many, Facebook addicts and casual users, especially among the ex-pat community. Their first reaction was: "This sucks! I'm not gonna stay in this country!" Zing said. So why should the government be worried about Facebook? Government spokeswoman Nguyen Phuong Nga said at a December 3 news conference: "[A] number of social Web sites have been misused to convey information with contents that oppose the Democratic Socialist Republic of Vietnam," she said. "...threatening information security and causing a bad influence on Internet users." But for some Vietnamese it's not a matter of government protection but censorship.  Nguyen Thanh Phong, a graphic designer in Hanoi, said: "Maybe the government is afraid of the expansive nature of Facebook and the speed with which information is spread? If it spreads too far, they can't control it." Just as Vietnam's Internet community is still wary of using the Internet to its fullest potential, the government also finds itself in a tug of war between business interests and information control, as newspaper editor Vu Hao Nhien sees it. The Vietnamese Government created the Administration Agency for Radio, TV and Electronics Information in 2008 that acts as a watchdog over Internet activity. In September 2009, eight bloggers were tried on charges of "anti-government propaganda." They were convicted and sentenced to jail sentences ranging from two to six years, the press advocacy organization Reporters Without Borders reported. The blogger community suspects they were targeted because they began to organize offline. More sophisticated than blogs, Facebook offers the latest in the line-up of online organizational tools, from groups and fan pages to applications. "Facebook, even though it's not a political site, it is a convenient and friendly tool for people to use to organize and get together," says Vu, managing editor of Nguoi Viet, the largest Vietnamese language newspaper published outside Vietnam. Vu, who also publishes the blog bolsavik.com, created the Facebook page "Free Nguyen Tien Trung" calling for the release of the democracy activist. But pages with a stated mission opposing government policies are the exception on Facebook. Vu says Hanoi's motives are much simpler than that. "They're afraid of dialogue and Facebook is about dialogue. They're paranoid, what can I say." Blogger Diesebemol is all too familiar with that reality. "Vietnamese people like me, that's how I live. I talk when they let me talk. I don't have any right to express myself." Not entirely resigned, he adds: "Sometimes though, I'll find a way to get online and talk behind their back."

  Israel warns citizens to beware Facebook spy requestsStory Highlights Terrorist groups using social networking to recruit spies, Israel says  Subjects are offered money to pass along secrets, security agency says  Groups looking for personal information to contact Israeli citizens Next Article in World »    



 


 

  JERUSALEM (CNN)  -- Terrorism groups are using Facebook and other social networking sites to recruit Israeli citizens as spies, the Israeli government warned Monday. 
Israel says its citizens have been targeted by terrorist groups seeking to recruit spies on Facebook. 
 Shin Bet, Israel's security agency, issued a statement warning Israelis about the dangers of trading confidential information for money. "The Shin Bet has gotten many reports about cases where terrorist elements are using the Internet to get in touch with Israelis with proposals to enlist in terror activity or to pass classified information in exchange for payment," the statement said. Not only could the leaked information hurt Israeli security, citizens traveling to other countries to exchange the information for money "might lead to them being kidnapped by terror organizations," Shin Bet said.   The government did not reveal any examples of Israelis becoming spies through Facebook, but it did describe one attempt.   "Lately, an Israeli citizen contacted the Shin Bet and complained about a request in Facebook from a person that presented himself as a Lebanese merchant, who asked him to give him classified information for money," the statement said. Shin Bet said this was just one example "among many incidents that were identified by the security services." "It is initiated contacts, concrete and direct to Israeli citizens, with emphasis on the social networks, that offers them to enlist to terror activity or to pass classified information in exchange for payment," it said. Shin Bet said terror groups are combing Facebook and other networks "for business or personal matters like names, addresses, Internet addresses and phone numbers that are being used to find and contact Israeli citizens in Israel and also abroad."

 Does Facebook unite us or divide us?By Ethan Zuckerman, Special to CNN   Connecting the world on the WebSTORY HIGHLIGHTSFacebook has half a billion users, notes Ethan ZuckermanHe says Facebook could be force to connect  people from many backgroundsOnline networks tend to connect us with people we already know or who are like us, he saysZuckerman: We have work to do to make web, social networks truly worldwide

Editor's note: Ethan Zuckerman is a senior researcher at Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet and Society and co-founder of the international blogging network, Global Voices. Zuckerman spoke at the TED Global conference in July. TED, a nonprofit organization devoted to "Ideas Worth Spreading," hosts talks on many subjects and makes them available through its website.  (CNN) -- Last month Facebook announced it had signed up its 500 millionth member. Many news outlets began stories on this milestone by declaring that if Facebook were a nation, it would be the third-most populous on the planet. Immigrants to this nation include tens of millions from Mexico, Turkey, France, Italy, India and the Philippines. The 125 million Americans who've joined the service represent only a quarter of the citizens. And with support for 100 languages, Facebook would be one of the world's most polyglot lands, far surpassing India's 22 official languages. Facebook, of course, is not a nation. It's a service that allows users to share photos, updates, news and play games with other users of the service. And while 500 million people from all over the globe use the service, for most of us, Facebook feels less like an transnational melting pot and more like the neighborhood bar where everyone knows your name. While more than 5 percent of Facebook users are Indonesian, it's unlikely that you're friends with any of them, unless you have Indonesian friends in the offline world. That's because Facebook is designed to connect you with people you already know, not introduce you to new people. When you sign up for Facebook, the service first searches for any mentions of your name and suggests you befriend anyone who has mentioned you in their posts. It then asks to access your e-mail account so you can connect with anyone with whom you regularly correspond. Finally, it encourages you to add information about your high school, college and employer to your profile. It uses this information to find friends within your classmates and co-workers. You have ample opportunity to connect with people you already know before you have a chance to discover anyone new. Read more about Ethan Zuckerman on TED.com Once you've found your friends on Facebook, they share their news, gossip and discoveries with you. This can be a source of serendipitous discovery, as friends find stories and inspirations you would have missed. Or it can serve as an echo chamber, slowly persuading you that everyone views the world the way you do, because the people you know on Facebook share your prejudices and views. I study the ways new media shapes people's perceptions of the world. It's my fond hope that social networks such as Facebook will help users broaden their perspectives by listening to a different set of people than they encounter in their daily life. But I fear services such as Facebook may be turning us into imaginary cosmopolitans. We hear that 500 million people from around the world are using Facebook and forget that we hear mostly from our 130 (on average) friends, many of whom we've known since we went to high school together. On the internet, information from Indiana and India is equally cheap and easy to access. But of the 100 most popular news and information sites in the United States, only 10 are hosted outside the country. And 94 percent of those page views are to U.S. sites. This pattern holds true in all 10 countries with the largest numbers of internet users. Despite ample opportunity to use the internet to seek information from beyond our national borders, most of our internet usage is local. Like the Internet itself, Facebook is one of the most powerful technologies ever built to increase connection between people separated by borders of nation, language, religion and culture. Armenian journalist Onnik Krikorian reports that Facebook has created a space where young Armenians and Azeri -- separated in physical space by a decades-old border dispute -- can explore friendships that would never otherwise develop. But Facebook can also spawn spaces that make cross-cultural dialog more difficult. The "Everybody Draw Mohammed Day" Facebook campaign began as a humorous protest in support of freedom of expression, inspired by a cartoon drawn by Molly Norris. As the group attracted 100,000 members on Facebook, the drawings of the Muslim prophet submitted to the group became increasingly offensive and violent. Norris and others initially involved with the protest distanced themselves as the group became a campaign against Islam rather than a campaign for free speech. Before Facebook removed the campaign from its site, a Pakistani court ordered a nationwide ban on the social networking service in reaction to the offensive content. Is Facebook a space for cross-cultural interaction? For fomenting reactionary hatred? Or is it primarily a space for online interaction with our local, offline friends? "Peace on Facebook" is a page where Facebook tries to quantify connections made on the service across lines of religion and nationality. Some of the news is encouraging: 29,651 connections between Indian and Pakistani users made in the past 24 hours. Some is dispiriting -- only 974 Muslim/Jewish connections in the previous day. With half a billion users and an estimated 65 billion friendships, such numbers are small. To me, they suggest we have work to do if we want a network such as Facebook to do its part in making the world a wider and better-connected place. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ethan Zuckerman.

 Aaron Sorkin on Facebook: 'Not my cup of tea' By Cody Combs, CNN  Facebook movie: fact or fiction?STORY HIGHLIGHTSAaron Sorkin wrote the screenplay for "The Social Network"He says social networking sites such as Facebook are "not my cup of tea" (CNN) -- If you want to "friend" screenwriter Aaron Sorkin after seeing his movie about Facebook, you'll have to have to wait indefinitely. In an interview with CNN's Howard Kurtz of "Reliable Sources," Sorkin admitted that despite the movie taking up two years of his life, he remains indifferent to the social networking website. "It's not my cup of tea but there are a lot of things that aren't my cup of tea that the world likes," said Sorkin, who wrote the screenplay for "The Social Network." "I don't like soccer, but it's the most popular sport in the world." Sorkin also addressed mounting criticism that the movie portrays women as sex objects or groupies. "I was writing about a very specific group of people who are misogynistic, who do see women as ... enemies," Sorkin said. "They're angry because the cheerleader still wants to date the quarterback, not them, the cheerleader doesn't understand they're the ones that are running the universe right now." As for the movie's less than flattering portrayal of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, Sorkin said that he found great respect and admiration for Zuckerberg through the process of writing. "I find the parts of him that are like me," Sorkin said. "What I found is that I'm shy and awkward in social situations, like a lot of people I felt like I'm on the outside looking in...that I haven't been invited to the cool kids table." Zuckerberg addressed the movie's portrayal of him during a recent appearance on "The Oprah Winfrey Show." "It's a movie, it's fun, a lot of it is fiction," he said. "They're trying to build a good story... this is my life, I know it's not that dramatic."

 Facebook gives itself a birthday face-liftBy  John D. Sutter, CNN      Facebook has announced changes designed to help users find new photos and updates more easily. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Facebook unveils several minor changes to its home page on Thursday night  The site appears to emphasize gaming, applications and a new search  Facebook celebrates its sixth birthday, says it has 400 million users  The online community has not lashed back at these Facebook changes  (CNN) -- Facebook has given itself a face-lift for its sixth birthday. The online social network -- which now boasts a population of 400 million people -- unveiled on Thursday night several surface changes to the look and feel of its home page. "Facebook began six years ago today as a product that my roommates and I built to help people around us connect easily, share information and understand one another better," founder Mark Zuckerberg wrote in a blog post on Thursday night. "We hoped Facebook would improve people's lives in important ways. So it's rewarding to see that as Facebook has grown, people around the world are using the service to share information about events big and small and to stay connected to everyone they care about." Facebook's population grew by more than 200 million people in the last year alone, to a total of 400 million users now, Zuckerberg said in the post.  For comparison, the site's current population would make it the third-largest country in the world, behind only China and India and ahead of the United States, which has about 308 million people. Many of the changes made to Facebook on Thursday were relatively minor.

Users can more easily access Facebook applications and games, as well as a list of friends who are currently online. The search function on the site became more prominent. And Facebook's news feed is now divided into categories for "top news" and "most recent" posts from Facebook friends, a slight change from the previous arrangement, which also allowed users to sort posts by what's newest and what's most relevant to them. Video: Facebook's 6-year history The site also tries to make it easier for users to find friend requests and new messages, creating a potential all-in-one hub for online communication. "For example, when you receive a Facebook notification about someone writing on your Wall or tagging you in a photo, you'll see a red bubble appear in the left-hand corner near the search bar," Facebook engineer Jing Chen wrote in a blog post on the site. "When you click on the icon, you'll see a drop-down menu with your most recent notifications." Facebook says it's going for a "simplified design." So far, the online community has not reacted with the same vitriol it has to other Facebook changes.  When the site first introduced the "news feed," which pulls in new information from friends' pages, users blasted the site for eliminating the privacy of their pages. And changes to Facebook's privacy settings typically are met with heated discourse on blogs and on the site. Video: Facebook's privacy issues In this case, more than 5,200 people have said they "like" Zuckerberg's recent post, and many users are wishing the site a happy birthday as if it were a friend of theirs. "What a great venue to reconnect with old friends or make new ones. Thank you Facebook Happy sixth birthday," one user wrote, in response to Zuckerberg's post. Some bloggers said the site looks and feels similar to before, with a slightly greater emphasis on gaming and applications. "Many changes are subtle and the look and feel of the site remains the same," Jessica E. Vascellaro wrote on the Wall Street Journal's Digits blog. VentureBeat's Kim-Mai Cutler says the updated and more-prominent search function on Facebook is perhaps the most significant part of the update. "When you type in names, it auto-completes for people who are the closest to you by social promixity (sic) -- e.g. the people you share the most mutual friends with," she writes on the site's DigitalBeat blog. Facebook says the changes will be rolled out worldwide. As of Friday at 9:30 a.m. ET, it appeared that not all pages had been updated.

 Google Buzz goes after Facebook, TwitterBy  Doug Gross, CNN    Google Buzz, a feature of Gmail, aims to compete using elements similar to Facebook and Twitter. STORY HIGHLIGHTS NEW: Google Buzz plunges search giant into social networking world  NEW: The service was being rolled out to some users as early as Tuesday afternoon  Buzz will work through Gmail, allow users to post updates or pull in material from other sites  Move comes after Google tweaked searches to emphasize social networks 
RELATED TOPICS


Google Inc.

Facebook Inc.

Twitter Inc.

 (CNN) -- Google plunged into the world of social networking on Tuesday, melding pieces of Facebook and Twitter into a new feature, Google Buzz. Buzz, which will work through the popular Gmail service, will allow users to post status updates, photos and links to members of their network -- as well as pull in their activity on other sites like Twitter, Flickr and Picasa. Google spokesman Bradley Horowitz said the service, which was rolling out to some Gmail users Tuesday afternoon and should be available to all in the next couple of days, aims to weed out what he called the clutter of other networking sites. With networking sites, "there's obviously value there," he said. "It's a phenomenon that's real, but it's increasingly becoming harder and harder to make sense and find the signal in the noise." By letting users post photos, links and updates openly, the tool would mimic Twitter's micro-blogging format. But users also will be able to make their content available to "friends only," more closely following the Facebook model. At an event at the company's Mountain View, California, headquarters, Google also seemed poised to take a poke at the AOL Instant Messenger service, saying Buzz will be offered to companies as a tool for interoffice communication. "It will change the way businesses communicate around the world," Horowitz said. Despite the inevitable comparisons, Google spokesmen said they didn't set out to tread on anyone else's turf. "We try not to pay too much attention to competitors," Gmail product manager Todd Jackson said. "We try to listen to users." Horowitz said Google Buzz will automatically make "friends" out of the people a user e-mails or chats with the most on Gmail. See CNNmoney's report on reaction from some Google competitors. Comments on posts will appear in real time. And comments by other users will be weighted, similar to how Google's search engine weighs results, to "collapse bad buzz and recommend the good buzz," Jackson said. The hands-down leader in the search engine world, Google has been branching out on projects that include its Nexus One smartphone, the company's first foray into hardware marketing. Late last month, Google announced that people could tweak their accounts to make results related to friends, co-workers and other members of their social networks appear above all other results.  The Social Search feature was introduced to a limited number of Google users last year and was made available to everyone in beta status on January 28. The change came with a hint of more things to come. "This is just a first step in our ongoing effort to ensure that Google Web search is always as social as the Web itself," the company said in an instructional video posted to its official blog.  Google Buzz probably won't be able to bring in status updates and other materials from Facebook for the same reason that Social Search doesn't.  Because most Facebook users set their information to be viewed only by friends, Google's search engine can't collect that information in the same way it can from Twitter and, obviously, Google-owned sites like YouTube. Buzz also will have a mobile component, operating on most major wireless operating systems with features that include voice-recognition posting and a GPS-enabled ability to attach the user's location to posts. The Web-based mobile application, which can be used by iPhones despite not going through Apple's online store, can also be set to pick up posts to Buzz being made near the user's location. Changes to the tool could be coming quickly, too. Google officials say they're already studying possible expansions. They include allowing Buzz updates by phone, letting users post to their Twitter account through the tool and linking Buzz with the still-emerging Google Wave system. "We're just getting started," Horowitz said. "We're not launching this today because we think we're done. We don't think that's how a product like this is built."

 Divorce attorneys catching cheaters on FacebookBy  Stephanie Chen, CNN    North Carolina attorney Lee Rosen uses evidence and leads culled on Facebook to build his divorce cases. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Attorneys report an increase in using social media in divorce and family law cases  Facebook, especially, has been a gold mine for evidence in divorce disputes  Facebook's relaxed privacy policies make investigations easier, some attorneys say  Private investigators report a surge in demand for Facebook searches

Divorce Law

Family Law

 (CNN) -- Before the explosion of social media, Ken Altshuler, a divorce lawyer in Maine, dug up dirt on his client's spouses the old-fashioned way: with private investigators and subpoenas. Now the first place his team checks for evidence is Facebook. Consider a recent story of a female client in her 30s, who came to Altshuler seeking a divorce from husband. She claimed her husband, an alcoholic, was drinking again. The husband denied it. It was her word against his word, Altshuler says, until a mutual friend of the couple stumbled across Facebook photos of the husband drinking beer at a party a few weeks earlier. It was the kind of "gotcha moment" Altshuler knew would undermine the husband's credibility in court. His firm presented the photos to the judge, and the wife won the case in April, he said. "Facebook is a great source of evidence," Altshuler said. "It's absolutely solid evidence because he's the author of it. How do you deny that you put that on?" Social media stalking skills have become invaluable to the legal world for divorce cases in particular. Online photo albums, profile pages, wall comments, status updates and tweets have become gold mines for evidence and leads. Today, divorce and family law firms routinely cull information posted on social media sites -- the flirty exchanges with a paramour, unsavory self-revelations and compromising photographs -- to buttress their case. Posting hugging and kissing photos online can show a happily married relationship, or it can expose a secretive affair. At least 80 percent of attorneys surveyed by the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers cited a growth in the number of cases that used social media over the last five years. The study was released earlier this year. Divorce attorneys say social media sites have opened windows for infidelity because it's become easier to rekindle romance with an old flame or flirt with a stranger. And the posted, shared, and tagged evidence of infidelity is precisely the type of evidence attorneys look for online.  "You need to familiarize yourself with privacy settings to ensure there is no way personal information can be accessed," said Adam Ostrow, editor in chief of Mashable.com, a social media guide.  Facebook -- where attorneys find most of the evidence and leads -- has gradually relaxed privacy settings over the last year. Attorneys say that enabled some members'  personal details to be leaked without the user realizing it, attorneys say. On May 26th, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged the problem and, in a blog, announced new tools making it easier for users to tighten privacy settings and block outside parties from seeing personal information. "It's becoming all but impossible to protect your information unless you spend hours and hours figuring it out," said Lee Rosen, a divorce attorney in North Carolina, who added he reaped the benefits of the tricky privacy controls in a recent case.  Rosen was investigating a North Carolina husband in his 40s accused of cheating on his wife. The husband failed to set privacy controls on his Facebook wall, an area where users can post information. Rosen noticed a suspicious message from the husband's younger female co-worker. The post was the hunch he needed to steer him in right direction. Rosen reports about a quarter of his divorce cases use information found on social media sites. 
It's becoming all but impossible to protect your information unless you spend hours and hours figuring it out.--Lee Rosen, North Carolina divorce attorney

Finding the Facebook profiles is so simple that Rosen says anyone could do it. He goes to a site called Flowtown.com, a site intended for marketers but is useful for attorneys, too. Type an e-mail address and the site generates various social media profiles. If that fails, Rosen hires a private investigator. At National Digital Forensics, Inc., a North Carolina company that mines digital sites for information, requests for social media searches from divorce lawyers have surged, says president and senior digital investigator Giovanni Masucci. The social media detective work requires different snooping skills, he says. "For example, someone may be cheating, but they are married," Masucci explained. "If their status on the web page says single, that's a major red flag." Masucci estimated about half the social media cases they investigate expose some kind of cheating. The happy reality for divorce attorneys is that most clients are bound to be on Facebook or another social media site. Facebook is more popular than ever, drawing in 400 million users, the company reports on its website. Each user creates an average of 70 pieces of content monthly and has an average of 130 friends.  The most common way to gather information on Facebook relies on the battling couple's mutual online friends who still have access to the spouse's profile. Many times the spouse will "de-friend" a partner but forget about their shared friends, who can play detective and access information on their profile.  Another way of exposing damaging information is searching the profiles of the suspected "other man" or "other woman", says says Marlene Eskind Moses, a divorce attorney in Tennessee. "It's amazing how people tell their life stories," said Moses, who represented a Tennessee woman who believed her husband was cheating on her. After the wife found herself blocked from her husband's Facebook page, she found the profile page of the other woman whom she suspected in the affair. On that woman's profile page, a public album of photos taken on a romantic getaway appeared. Scenic shots of South Carolina's mountains. Her husband and another woman embracing in front of an art gallery. Portraits of the couple with their faces nuzzled close together. Elizabeth K. Englander, professor of psychology at Bridgewater State College in Massachusetts, says people divulge information on social media because they believe no one will ever see the information they post. "The sense online is sort of like the mob effect," Englander said. "You feel like you're one in a million, and so who will ever notice you?" But when someone does notice, that's when some divorce attorneys pounce. Information copied from social media sites can sway the outcome of alimony payment disputes and custody fights, attorneys say. Some parents have even lost a child because of the behavior they exhibited online, the lawyers say. The ultimate goal, after all, is to catch a spouse in a lie. Sometimes it's a wife claiming she can't afford child support payments but subsequently purchased expensive jewelry and posted photos of the items on Facebook. Or if a husband who claims he doesn't have anger problems while his social media profile is loaded with expletives. Once there is evidence of a person caught in an obvious lie, attorneys say, it undermines the rest of their credibility with the judge. Attorneys advise users of Facebook and other social media who are headed toward a divorce or custody battle to edit their profiles, be cautious about updating statuses and double check to see who is really a "friend." Or to make things easier -- at least until the trial is over or a settlement is reached -- just get off Facebook completely.

 Yahoo punches up pages with FacebookBy  Doug Gross, CNN    Yahoo says the revamp lets users connect with Facebook "in a big way." STORY HIGHLIGHTS Yahoo revamp links Facebook with Yahoo pages  More than 600 million users access Yahoo sites each month, company says  Yahoo also created a single dashboard to let users control their privacy settings  Facebook deal follows a similar arrangement with Twitter from February

Yahoo! Inc.

Facebook Inc.

Internet

 (CNN) -- People who use both Facebook and Yahoo will be able to link those accounts and share updates and messages across platforms thanks to a major redesign rolled out by Yahoo on Monday. It's all part of a move by Yahoo -- and other established online players like Google and Hotmail -- to get more social and further integrate with other sites. In February, Yahoo announced a similar integration deal with Twitter. "As the place that 600 million people visit every month, Yahoo! is in a unique position to bring together different social experiences from across the Web to a single place," read a post on the official Yahoo! Yodel Anecdotal blog. The blog said the Facebook integration is part of an ongoing plan "to rewire Yahoo! to be more open and social." On the main Yahoo page Monday morning, users were able to click a Facebook icon on the left of the page to link the two accounts. Then, with another click, they could set the icon for "QuickView," which makes a Facebook news feed appear when the user scrolls over that icon. Similar functions work on Yahoo Mail, Yahoo Sports, Yahoo News and entertainment sites like omg! and Yahoo Music. The integration plan is the second with a major social media player that Yahoo has created in recent months. Yahoo and the microblogging site Twitter announced a plan to allow real-time tweets to be shared with the 600 million users in Yahoo's global network.  That partnership lets people access their Twitter feeds on Yahoo properties, including their home pages, Yahoo Mail, Yahoo Sports and others, making it easier to tweet or check on the people they follow.  Users are able to update their Twitter status from Yahoo sites and share content from Yahoo in their Twitter stream.  In the blog post on the Facebook integration, Yahoo also said it would be ramping up privacy controls. A central dashboard, called Yahoo Pulse, lets users manage their information and privacy settings in one spot. Facebook came under fire in recent weeks for privacy changes that defaulted many user settings to public and, according to many users, made it difficult to change those settings back to private. The ultra-popular networking site eventually revamped the settings, letting users revert to all-private with a handful of clicks. Facebook had not issued a statement or posted on its official blog acknowledging the Yahoo announcement as of mid-morning on Monday.

 Are your kids safe online? Facebook, PTA want to make sureBy  Doug Gross, CNN | Filed under: Social Media     Facebook, PTA targeting child safety, security online with new partnership. STORY HIGHLIGHTSFacebook, PTA team up for a children's online education programMany kids use Facebook, other sites, even though its against the rules if they're under 13Many students don't learn online skills in school, parents don't know how to helpResources for the project are worth more than $1 million, Facebook says

Parenting

 (CNN) -- Worried whether your kids are being safe when they're on the internet? So, apparently, are Facebook and the PTA. The national education group and the social-media giant announced a long-term partnership Thursday aimed at teaching children, parents and teachers about responsible internet use. The collaboration, set to be announced at the Parent Teacher Association's national convention in Memphis, Tennessee, will establish a comprehensive program, on both Facebook and the PTA's website. Topics that will be addressed include cyber-bullying, internet safety and security and "citizenship online," according to a news release. "Nothing is more important to us than the well-being of the people, especially the many teenagers, who use Facebook," said Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer. Facebook, the No. 1 social media site by a longshot with more than 500 million accounts, requires users to be at least 13 years old. But with no practical way to check the ages of that many people, it's widely acknowledged that pre-teens use the site. That is one of the factors that has left many parents debating whether to allow their children to break the rules and use Facebook, and other social-media sites. According to a PTA report released this week, many children aren't learning online literacy in their schools, and parents say they don't know enough to help them. "Unless new media are used in schools and within families, youth are on their own in figuring out the ethics, social norms and civil behaviors that enable good citizenship in the online part of their media use and lives," reads the report, from a PTA Online Safety and Technology Working Group. Under the agreement, Facebook and PTA also work to bridge what's called the digital divide -- helping minority and low-income families gain access to the tools to become digital-savvy. "Our vision is that each child, parent and teacher will have the knowledge and tools they need to harness the power of the internet effectively and safely," said Charles J. Saylors, that National PTA president. Facebook said its commitment of resources to the project on its pages amount to a $1 million investment. The PTA also will be reaching out to the 24,000 local PTAs across the United States, with the goal of reaching every student in the nation as part of the program. In the coming months,Facebook and PTA will be consulting child-safety and technology experts to collect education resources. Kids, parents and teachers will be surveyed for their thoughts on what's needed.

 Debunked: Why you'll never have to pay for Facebook  

By  Nicholas Carlson, Special to CNN | Filed under: Social Media   The fact that you keep coming back to Facebook makes it easier for Facebook to sell more ads -- and make more money. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Spokesman: "We have no plans to charge for the basic service of using Facebook"  Employees say putting up a paywall runs counter to the company's mission   Facebook has a deep profit motive to never charge you for access

Editor's note: Nicholas Carlson is editor of the blog Silicon Alley Insider, which covers business and technology in Silicon Valley, California.  (CNN)  -- Millions of Facebook addicts worldwide worry that someday soon they'll have to pay to use the site. If you go to Facebook.com and search for the terms "Facebook free" or "Facebook charge," you'll find hundreds of groups with names like, "If 1 Million People Join Before 9th July 2010 Facebook Will Stay Free!" or "If Facebook Charges A Fee We Will Discontinue Using It." Some of these groups have dozens of users, others have thousands. During a recent press conference, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said while Facebook users do care about privacy, the question of whether or not Facebook will eventually charge for its service is actually a much bigger concern among the site's 500 million users. But are these fears justified? No! Facebook will never charge you to be a member and use the site. Don't take it from me. Here's Facebook spokesman Larry Yu on the issue: "We have absolutely no plans to charge for the basic service of using Facebook." He continues: "Last year we saw a similar rumor circulating that Facebook was going to begin charging $1.99 to use the site, but this year we're hearing that fee increased to $14.99 with the spread of this rumor. We look forward to hearing what Facebook might be rumored to cost for use next year." If you press Facebook employees on this, they will tell you the reason they will never charge for access is that putting up a paywall runs counter to the company's mission to make the world more open and connected. But even if you don't buy that idealistic hoopla, you should understand Facebook has a deep profit motive to never charge you for access. Why? Because Facebook makes its money bringing together as big of an audience as possible and then selling that audience's attention to advertisers. It's a business that works. Facebook should bring in as much as $2 billion in revenue this year. That's more than twice as much as Facebook brought in last year. If Facebook started charging users, its membership would start shrinking fast -- and so would its revenues. So while Facebook may charge you for certain bonus features, such as gifts for your friends, or credits to play games like Farmville, it will never charge for basic access to the site. Why then do people worry Facebook might start charging soon? Probably because Facebook users feel like they're getting something valuable for free, and everybody knows there's no such thing as a free lunch. Just remember: The fact that you keep coming back to Facebook makes it easier for Facebook to sell more ads -- and make more money.  Your lunch isn't free, it's sponsored.Copyright © 2011 Business Insider.

Barack Obama

 (CNN) -- Lady Gaga and President Obama don't often travel in the same circles, but they're the top competitors in a popularity contest that could have one of them setting a record by this weekend. Facebook publicists told CNN on Thursday that the pop star and the president are neck-and-neck in the race to become the first living person with more than 10 million fans on the social networking site. As of early Friday, Obama was in the lead, with 9,058,881 fans. Lady Gaga trailed behind with 9,023,966. Both of them were more than 4 million fans behind the No. 1 individual, Michael Jackson, who had 13,285,811. The singer died a year ago. Obama's page, which is run by the group Organizing for America, includes photographs of his recent Gulf Coast visit and links to speeches from news conferences. His page lists the president's interests as "basketball, writing, spending time w/ kids" and says his favorite books include The Bible, Toni Morrison's "Song of Solomon" and Shakespeare's tragedies. Lady Gaga's page lists upcoming concerts and includes a biographical article describing how the 24-year-old pop star, who played piano by ear as a toddler, grew into a theatrical performer who wows the masses with flashy performances in international concert tours. "I'm just trying to change the world one sequin at a time," she says in the posted story. Facebook says it has more than 400 million active users. The unofficial popularity contest comes about a year after another internet milestone: a race to attract 1 million followers on the Twitter micro-blogging site. Actor Ashton Kutcher narrowly beat out CNN, reaching the goal 30 minutes before CNN passed the mark. Kutcher challenged CNN to the competition, saying he would donate 10,000 mosquito bed nets to charity for World Malaria Day in late April if he beat CNN, and 1,000 if he lost. CNN agreed to donate 20,000 nets.CNN's JD Cargill contributed to this report.

 Facebook's paternalistic attitudes aren't empoweringBy danah boyd, Special to CNN | Filed under: Social Media   Facebook's new privacy model is a start, but the site needs to listen, not condescend, to its users. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Facebook's data says what people do but little about why they do it  When people share info with Facebook, they become vulnerable to Facebook   Do people really know who is included in their "Friends-of-Friends?"
RELATED TOPICS


Facebook Inc.

Internet Privacy

Editor's Note: danah boyd is a social media researcher at Microsoft Research New England and a fellow at Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet and Society. She recently completed her Ph.D. on social media, youth practices and other intersections between technology and society.   (CNN)  -- Facebook's privacy problems have been in the news ... again.  Although complaints may have started deep in the blogosphere, even Time Magazine has made them its cover story.  In response, Facebook announced a new privacy model to address complaints that it's too darn hard to actually navigate privacy settings on Facebook. (Well, duh.) It's not yet clear whether Facebook's changes will satiate the Facebook citizenry (let alone the rabid critics), but the conversations about privacy settings tend to emphasize only a fraction of the core concerns.  Facebook rightfully believes that it's important to give users control over their settings, to empower them to make decisions about what's accessible. But Facebook can also be condescending, suggesting that they know what's best for their users because they have so much data about them (which they do).  Unfortunately, Facebook's data tells them a lot about what people do but little about why they do it. They know that people aren't quitting Facebook, but that doesn't mean that users aren't frustrated or concerned (or would be if they understood what was happening). Don't get me wrong -- the privacy settings are confounding even for the most experienced digerati and I'm very glad that they're addressing this fundamental issue.  But in doing so, I hope that they realize that the main reason for so much public outrage goes beyond privacy settings. The issue is fundamentally about trust and informed consent. When people share information with Facebook, they become vulnerable to Facebook. They trust Facebook to respect their interests. Facebook has the power to expose people in ways that make their lives really miserable.  Because of that power, it's crucial that they stop telling users what's best for them and start engaging in a more meaningful dialogue.  Changing things and then forcing users to opt out is manipulative. Instead, they should be seeking informed consent -- actively working with users to help make sure that they understand what's at stake in their choices.  It is unacceptable for a company like Facebook to trick people into "consenting" to make their data more visible than they might think that it is.  People should be able to understand Facebook's changes and have choices available that allow them to make appropriate decisions. When Facebook changed its privacy settings in December, far too many people clicked on through without realizing that a few mouse clicks meant that they were exposing their status updates to the world. Many people may know exactly how not-private their Facebook profile or updates are. But do they? I recommend using ReclaimPrivacy to scan your privacy settings.  Keep in mind that "Everybody" is more than the people searching for you on Facebook -- this includes every company or individual who wants to use your information for any purpose.  In many ways, it's more accessible than simply posting something on a public website and waiting for Google to find it. And keep in mind that "Friends-of-Friends" means more than the people that you'd invite to a birthday party. I talked with a young woman who vowed that she'd never friend her mother; she didn't realize that if she friended her aunt and her aunt friended her mother than "Friends-of-Friends" included her mother. Do people really know who is included in their "Friends-of-Friends?" Facebook doesn't just need to fix its privacy settings. It needs to fix its attitude and repair its relationship with its users. Facebook isn't just a space for users to share; it is built on the backs of people and profits off of the data people entrust to them. An abusive relationship is simply unacceptable.  Facebook must go beyond paternalism and start empowering users to help guide the future of the service. It starts with committing to an opt-in approach to changes and developing features that allow users to have complete transparency as to how their data is exposed to, and used by, third parties.  It then requires innovating ways to actively engage participants. Facebook built a platform for mass sharing, but if it wants to change the world, it must also develop mechanisms for informed participation.  With great power comes great responsibility.

 Why Google Wave's demise is good news for FacebookBy Pete Cashmore, Special to CNN | Filed under: Social Media     Mashable's Pete Cashmore says the death of Google Wave means the search giant is no force in social networking. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Google's social collaboration tool, "Wave," was abandoned this week  Wave was a testament to Google's tech skills, a symbol of its social networking struggles  Google's failure to develop engaging social services must please rival Facebook 
RELATED TOPICS

Facebook Inc.

Editor's note: Pete Cashmore is founder and CEO of Mashable, a popular blog about social media. He is writing a weekly column about social networking and tech for CNN.com.  (CNN) -- Google this week abandoned "Wave," its much-hyped social collaboration tool. Wave was perhaps the prototypical Google product: Technically advanced, incredibly ambitious and near-impossible to use. Its demise is the canary in the coal mine for Google's social networking plans: Facebook is destined to build the Web's next wave, as Google continues to tread water. Wave was a testament to Google's technical prowess: A real-time communication platform that combined elements of instant messaging, e-mail and collaboration software. The only problem: With its many dials and switches, mastering Wave was the web equivalent of programming your VCR.  Few users took the time to understand the product, and mainstream adoption proved unattainable. It's the same fate that awaited Google's other recent foray into the social realm: Google Buzz. This Twitter-like service seemed smart in theory, but Google's inability to build simple and compelling social tools meant the service was perceived as a nuisance rather than a breakthrough. All of which must have Mark Zuckerberg rubbing his hands together in glee. While Google is one of the few companies large enough to build a significant social network, Google Wave's demise is further proof that these efforts (rumored to be called "Google Me") are destined to fail.  Like Wave, Google Me will likely be a work of technical wizardry too advanced for us mere mortals to understand. Google's failure to develop engaging social services is more disastrous than it might seem at first. Social networking is no longer just a time-waster for young people -- it now reaches all demographics and encompasses personalized search, highly targeted advertising and the red-hot social gaming trend. As Facebook builds a user base of more than 500 million people, it also stockpiles the personal information required to provide more comprehensive ad targeting -- and a more personalized search engine -- than Google could ever hope to engineer through algorithms alone. Google isn't unaware of this predicament: The company is throwing its resources behind a plan to escape its social networking slump. But short of a miracle -- an acquisition of Facebook nemesis Twitter, perhaps -- Google won't become a socialite anytime soon.

 New Delhi citizens turn traffic police on FacebookBy Harmeet Shah Singh, CNN | Filed under: Social Media     Delhi's traffic police have set up a Facebook page, enabling commuters to file complaints against bad fellow drivers. STORY HIGHLIGHTSNew Delhi issues up to 10,000 traffic tickets a dayThe city is struggling to discipline its driversA new Facebook page allows citizens to file complaints against bad driversResidents have uploaded over 3,000 pictures of what they believe are violations New Delhi, India (CNN) -- Lanes often dissolve into meaningless white lines painted on roads. Slow three-wheeled taxis splutter right in the middle of overpass bridges as a chaotic mix of tailgating motorcycles, scooters, cars, cycle-rickshaws, vans, trucks and buses overtake each other aggressively. New Delhi is struggling to discipline its reckless road users. And it has now undertaken a digital venture to rein them in -- via Facebook. The city's traffic police have set up a page on the social networking site, enabling commuters to file complaints against bad fellow drivers, with still images and videos serving as photographic evidence. In a little over two months, the account has registered more than 18,000 fans. Residents have uploaded over 3,000 pictures showing defective license plates, bikers without helmets, overloaded transport, wrong parking and officers breaking rules.

With more than 6 million vehicles zigzagging its roads, the city has been issuing up to 10,000 tickets a day for traffic offenses, police say. On their website, city traffic police list more than 40 road offenses punishable with a fine. Now, about 700 notices have been dispatched solely on the basis of complaints posted on the Facebook page since its launch in May, said Satyendra Garg, a joint commissioner of New Delhi's traffic police. Inspectors used license-plate numbers in the pictures to track down the alleged offenders, he explained. The Facebook initiative, officers say, is part of what they call their department's mission objective to encourage public involvement in traffic management.  Authorities expected users would mainly be alerting them about systemic flaws, such as faulty signals, bad street-lighting and broken roads. Instead, fans have turned their cameras on others creating danger on streets. An image, for instance, showed three children and three adults riding one motorcycle. Another had three men hanging out on the rear of a cargo auto-rickshaw. Traffic officials now have staff dedicated to monitoring the Facebook posts. They, however, are aware that the cyber forum they have opened to regulate road use is prone to abuse. Concerns, too, have been raised over privacy issues, Garg said. Yet, he insisted, citizens have a right to report violations. "As a concept, we welcome it," Garg said. In any case, account users could be prosecuted for posting false complaints, he said. But no bogus claim has come to notice so far. Already faced with a manpower crunch, the city's traffic police say they now have more work to do than before after their Facebook endeavor. "Certainly it has increased our workload," Garg said. "But at the same time it has also facilitated traffic response."

Facebook Inc.

 (Mashable.com) -- You can't block CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Facebook.  Try it. You'll get an error message that says, "General Block failed error: Block failed." We don't know whether it's a bug or an intentional inside joke, but Facebook's developers have created jokes and pranks in the past, so we wouldn't put it past them.  Of course, we're also not sure why you'd want to block him; it's not likely that he's spamming your wall with unwanted FarmVille invitations. Nevertheless, there's a website called Block Zuck that acts as a sort of catharsis for people fed up with some of Facebook's recent choices, such as allowing your friends to location-tag you in Facebook Places by default with no confirmation from you. Maybe you'll want to block Zuckerberg after you see the fictionalization of his early years at Facebook in the upcoming movie "The Social Network" just for the principle of the thing.  Or maybe you'll just laugh a little at this easter egg or bug and move on with your life. Either way, you can verify this by going to Zuckerberg's Facebook profile, scrolling down near the button of the left panel and clicking "Report/Block this person," then checking "Block this person" and clicking "Submit." Assuming this isn't just a bug, is it a funny easter egg, or a joke in bad taste? Let us know in the comments.© 2013 MASHABLE.com. All rights reserved.

 Facebook working with GLAAD to stop anti-gay bullying

Facebook Inc.

Bullying

 (Mashable)  -- The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) has teamed up with Facebook to reduce the amount of hate speech and anti-gay bullying that goes on around the internet. Members of the gay community reached out to GLAAD recently when a Facebook page created to remember the victims of anti-gay bullying who had committed suicide was flooded with hateful, violent and derogatory remarks and images.  Fortunately, GLAAD was able to work with Facebook to remove the content, and this organization's work with Facebook has just begun. Recently, tragic events that included the use of technology to shame and harass a college student, Tyler Clementi, because of his sexual preference led to Clementi's suicide.  And this sad news came just a couple weeks after 15-year-old Billy Lucas committed suicide after being tormented by other young people about his sexuality. Since then, celebrities, organizations and social media users have taken to the web to spread words of encouragement and discourage bullying behavior. Columnist Dan Savage launched a YouTube channel, "It Gets Better," and many celebrities have spoken out on YouTube about LGBT issues and teen bullying. MTV Networks even rolled out an iPhone app to help combat bullying. Still, the largest online destination for many beleaguered gay teens and young adults is Facebook -- ironically, one of the platforms where hate speech, though prohibited, is unfortunately still carried out. Today, Facebook announced that they're making new efforts to respond quickly when hateful speech violates the terms of service and needs to be removed. And this isn't just routine TOS policing, either. Facebook Public Policy Communications Manager Andrew Noyes wrote in an email today that Facebook "intends to work closely with GLAAD and other LGBT organizations on future initiatives." Stay tuned for more information on how exactly the social network plans to support LGBT teens and the larger gay community.© 2013 MASHABLE.com. All rights reserved.

 Are Facebook ads outing gay users?By  Doug Gross, CNN | Filed under: Social Media   Facebook says any ad that makes assumptions about a user's sexual orientation is violating rules. STORY HIGHLIGHTS Researchers say Facebook ads target users believed to be gay  Critics say system could "out" gay users who click ads, even those not gay-related  Facebook says such use of the site is a violation of its rules and will be dealt with

Advertising

 (CNN) -- Facebook ads are guessing whether users are gay and targeting a broad range of products to them based on the answer, according to a research study making the rounds on the internet Thursday. The research, by the Microsoft Institute and the Max Planck Institute in Germany, has some critics saying that by pushing ads toward those users and then registering whether they respond, the system could inadvertently be outing some users on the site. Facebook, meanwhile, questions the research and says any ad that makes assumptions about a user's sexual orientation is violating the site's rules. For the study, researchers set up six fake Facebook accounts. Two were for males who had listed that they are interested in females, two were for females interested in males, and one each was created for a man and women interested in the same sex. Otherwise, the profile information was identical. All were listed as 25 years old and all listed Washington, D.C., as their home. The report says that there was a "measurable difference" in the sorts of ads that appeared on the home pages of the accounts. About half of the ads targeted specifically to the gay male account were for gay nightclubs and other offers specifically referencing gender orientation. But significantly, they say, half were not. As an example, they cite an ad for a nursing program at a Florida college that appeared for the gay male account, but none of the others. The supposed lesbian account also had targeted ads that didn't appear for the "straight" female accounts, but not as many. "The danger with such ads, unlike the gay bar ad where the target demographic is blatantly obvious, is that the user reading the ad text would have no idea that by clicking it he would reveal to the advertiser both his sexual preference and a unique identifier (cookie, IP address or email address if he signs up on the advertiser's site)," the researchers wrote. That possibility had online commentators speculating that Facebook's algorithm could in effect "out" users to advertisers. "[C]oming on the heels of revelations that Facebook leaked user information to advertisers through third-party apps, this latest snafu underscores how nearly impossible it is for Facebook to both profit from your personal information and to guarantee it will never be shared without your permission," blogger Adrian Chen wrote on Gawker's Valleywag tech blog. "The collection of such information (especially when tied to something as sensitive as sexual preference) could spell disaster for a user who thinks he's being fastidious when keeping his profile private," wrote Jacqui Cheng on tech blog Ars Technica, a CNN.com content partner. But Facebook said any advertiser that charts how a user responds to ads for future advertising use is breaking the rules. "We explicitly prohibit them from associating that targeting detail with the data collected from the user in forms they fill out, applications they make or other interactions on their site," Facebook spokesman Andrew Noyes said. He also said that Facebook requires targeted ads to be directly related to the information they relied upon for targeting (so, theoretically, the ads for gay bars would be allowed while the nursing-school ad would not). "We take the privacy of our users very seriously and take action when violations of these policies come to our attention," Noyes said. It's worth noting that the study, reported Wednesday by privacy and security blogger Christopher Soghoian, is hypothetical and based on the very small sample size of six accounts.  Also illegal under Facebook rules: Creating fake accounts.

Let's play telephone roulette Let's start with the most old-school of communication devices -- the phone -- and a simple exercise: 1). Take out your phone, 2). Close your eyes, 3). Scroll through your contacts 4). Open your eyes, 5). Dial. If you're now thinking to yourself, "Oh, no! Don't call THAT PERSON!" it's time to clean out your phone. Let's face it, when it comes to our address books, we're all woeful hoarders -- you know, those people who live in castles fashioned from piles of newspapers, around which prance a parade of feral cats? That's us. From Thai delivery services located in cities we no longer inhabit to exes we no longer remember ("Who the hell is 'Ricardo Lardo'? I feel like it might be a pejorative nickname designed to dissuade me from contacting him...") to old bosses, for some reason, we cling to these old digits like ratty blankies, clutched in our no-longer-childlike hands. Here's a hot tip for all you hoarders out there: Take out the trash. Delete any number that would make your plasma harden if dialed randomly. You'll thank us when you're fumbling with your cell at 2:33 a.m. desperately trying to call a car service, and your old boss Caren (who fired you two years ago after you cussed her out and threw her impressive collection of desk toys against the wall in a fit of rage) gets a surprise ring-a-ling. Hit "undo" on an email gone awry You've just shared a bottle of wine -- or four -- with a couple of friends, over which you discussed everyone's various and sundry romantic woes. Stumbling a bit, you pour yourself (and about a gallon of pinot) into a cab, where the cabbie -- who is an aspiring novelist, in the style of the ever-venerable Bukowski -- tells you that you'll never fall in love in this city.  It's a dark time, and the hearts of young folks are even darker. Feeling a bit more black and blue than usual, you go to your computer, thoughts of your not-quite-platonic best friend tumbling through your mind. You open an email from said friend, containing a link to a hilarious video featuring a bomb squad discovering a box of kittens (ha!), and shoot off a reply, "I love you. No. Seriously." Suddenly, you sober up -- what with all the expletives that are spewing from your mouth and the sweating -- and stare at the computer in horror. Well, luckily for you, Google -- in typical Big Brother fashion -- knew that you would do that, and has a quick fix: The Undo Button. In the past, the lesser-known Gmail feature only gave you 5 seconds to un-email, but a few months ago, the service extended that limit to 30 seconds. To unlock this ability, merely click the little green icon on the top right of your inbox, which will take you to Google Labs.  Find "Enable Undo Send," do so, and choose the 30-second option. Now your BFF will never know (unless, of course, you're slow on the draw -- or you pass out before reversing the damage). Remember: After enabling it, you still have to go up to "settings" to change the duration. Still don't trust yourself? Scroll down to the "Mail Goggles" app in Google Lab -- during windows of time you assign (say, 1 to 6 a.m.), it asks you to complete a few simple math problems before you proceed with the emailing. It's like a more helpful version of, "How many fingers am I holding up?" Take the social media sobriety test It's 4 a.m. and you are a pathetic loser. You're tweeting incessantly about how your parents think you're a disappointment, how you think you're in love with your intern and how that weird rash on your-- Oh, and did we mention there's a half-empty bottle of vodka and a fully empty container of Mexican takeout in bed with you? Yeah. Times are tough. Luckily for you, you can actually prevent such sad-sack behavior with a simple download. Just last week, web security company Webroot came out with a social media sobriety test. It's basically a Firefox plugin that, once installed, will require you to pass a test (like typing the alphabet backwards) in order to access services like Twitter, Facebook and MySpace between certain (inebriated) hours. Now if only you could install said plugin on your fridge. Did you really need to consume an entire block of cheese? Take it back! Ever decide to friend someone on Facebook because, well, it would be kind of funny? You know, your high school math teacher who always smelled vaguely of feet, that fake(?) Justin Bieber account, your mom? Well, Facebook actually has a little-known feature that allows you to take those friend requests back -- you know, after the hilarity dies down and you realize that since you didn't want to be friends with that kid who chewed incessantly on his jacket collar in middle school in middle school, you certainly don't want to befriend the grown-up version now. Merely go to said weirdo's profile and click on the little "x" next to "Awaiting friend confirmation" to take it back. Of course, Weird Wally will still get the requisite email alert that initially requested his friendship, so the damage is not fully mitigated. But, well, he's weird... he's probably used to rejection, right?

 Facebook brings facial recognition to photo tagging 

By Ben Parr, Mashable | Filed under: Social Media    STORY HIGHLIGHTSFacebook photos getting a big and potentially controversial upgrade Tag Suggestions will begin rolling out to U.S. users next weekSuggestions will only appear when algorithms have "high confidence"
RELATED TOPICS


Facebook Inc.

Internet Privacy

Technology

 (Mashable)  -- Facebook Photos, one of the social network's most popular features, is getting a big and potentially controversial upgrade with a new feature that automatically suggests who users should tag in photos based on facial recognition technology. The new feature, Tag Suggestions, will begin rolling out to U.S. users next week, according to Facebook Vice President of Product Chris Cox.  He told us that the product utilizes technology that was built in-house, as well as some technology that came from partners. Cox did not disclose the partners Facebook worked with for Tag Suggestions, although we have our suspicions. Tag Suggestions is fairly straightforward. Whenever you're offered the chance to tag groups of your friends in an album, Facebook will utilize its facial recognition technology to group similar faces together and automatically suggest the friend you should tag them with.  Facebook fills in the "Who is this?" box with its suggestion -- all you have to do is click the "Save Tags" button to accept. Cox says that suggestions will only appear when its algorithms have "high confidence" of who's being suggested. Unlike Face.com, Facebook doesn't reveal its certainty level and wouldn't reveal what percentage actually correlates to "high confidence." The social giant is also preemptively addressing the potential privacy issues that will be brought up from automatic, algorithmic tagging. Users can opt out of Tag Suggestions by going to their privacy settings and disabling the "Suggest photos of me to friends" feature. This release is part of a bigger effort to upgrade Photos. Earlier this year, Facebook launched a slew of upgrades, including bigger thumbnails, group tagging and drag-and-drop photos. This may be the biggest upgrade for Photos yet, though. Photo tagging is considered a chore by many users, yet it is the company's most popular product.  "Photos are by far the most engaging content Facebook has ever had," Cox told us earlier today.  By vastly simplifying the tagging process, Facebook expects that its millions of users will tag more photos, which will create millions of new engagement points and social connections, making it that much more addicting.© 2013 MASHABLE.com.

 2011 cyberattack targets: iPhone, Facebook, FoursquareBy  John D. Sutter, CNN | Filed under: Web   Apple products, including the iPhone, will be among the hot targets of cyberattacks in 2011, McAfee says. STORY HIGHLIGHTS McAfee releases its predictions for cyberthreats in 2011  Among the targets: smartphones, social networks and URL shorteners  Report: E-mail spam is becoming less significant as people use new tools to communicate 
RELATED TOPICS


Computer Crime

McAfee Inc.

Internet

 (CNN) -- Spamming e-mail is so last year. Malicious coders and all-out cybercrooks will target newer and hipper forms of digital communication in 2011, according to a report released Wednesday by McAfee, the computer security company. Noting a "significant decrease" in the total volume of spam messages sent to e-mail, the company's annual "Threat Predictions" report says attacks on instant messaging services, Facebook, Foursquare, URL shorteners, smartphones like the iPhone and even long-protected Apple operating systems will increase in the coming year. The changes are driven by how people use tech, the report says. As e-mail starts to die, so do e-mail-targeted scams. "This year ended with some of the lowest global e-mail spam levels in years, as more and more users transition from 'slower' legacy communications such as e-mail in favor of more immediate methods such as instant messaging and Twitter," the report says. "This shift will completely alter the threat landscape in 2011." McAfee's report is based on data collected in 2010 and is simply a list of "fearless predictions" for what's to come in the realm of cyberattacks. It's also worth noting that the company sells anti-virus software, so it has an incentive to make the digital world sound frightening.  With those caveats in mind, here's a quick look at some of the types of threats it highlights: Location services Foursquare, Gowalla and Facebook Places -- which let mobile phone users alert their friends to their current whereabouts -- pose an increasing security threat, the report says. Location-tagged Twitter posts are also a worry. "Use Bing's mapping functionality, for example, and plot all the GPS-enabled tweets in an area. It is easy to correlate these by topic or area of interest. In just a few clicks cyber criminals can see in real time who is tweeting and where, what they are saying, what their interests are, and the operating systems and applications they are using," McAfee says. "It then becomes child's play to craft a targeted attack based upon what the bad guys have just learned from these services." Social media This is kind of a no-brainer. If criminals know lots of stuff about you from social media posts and profiles, they can use that information to try to trick you into trusting potential scammers. Security geeks call this "spear phishing." "Social media connections will eventually replace e-mail as the primary vector for distributing malicious code and links," the report says. URL shorteners These sites -- like bit.ly, is.gd and tinyurl.com -- take long internet addresses and shorten them so that they are easier to send via e-mail, text or Twitter. But with convenience comes risk, the report says. "The trouble -- and abuse -- follows because users do not know where these shortened links actually lead until they click them. This is a huge opportunity for abuse," McAfee says. Smartphones There haven't been many cases of cyberattacks on smartphones. But McAfee says that's about to change. "McAfee Labs predicts that 2011 will be a turning point for threats to mobile devices," the report says, adding: "The widespread adoption of mobile devices into business environments combined with these and other attacks is likely to bring about the explosion we've long anticipated." Apple operating systems If you know an Apple-head, you've probably heard him or her say something to this effect: "My Mac NEVER gets bugs or viruses." Ahem. That may change soon, says McAfee. "The popularity of iPads and iPhones in business environments and the easy portability of malicious code between them could put many users and businesses at risk next year and beyond," the report says." "The lack of user understanding regarding exposure on these platforms and the lack of deployed security solutions make a fertile landscape for cyber criminals. McAfee Labs expects to see botnets and Trojans (types of cyber attacks and viruses) move from a rare encounter to a more common occurrence on Apple platforms in 2011." Hacktivism "Hacktivists" are internet activists who shut down websites and cause other digital trouble to make a political point. The most recent high-profile example of this was the WikiLeaks saga, when hacktivists shut down credit-card websites as a show of support for that document-leaking website. Hacktivism is at least a decade old. But it will continue to be prevalent in 2011, McAfee says, partly because of the attention WikiLeaks has drawn to the activity.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.Providing free music to more than 750 million people seems like a no-brainer. Story highlightsFacebook is partnering with top music services Spotify, MOG and RdioFree music services have been among the fastest-growing on the webBiggest roadblock to Facebook Music won't be users, it'll be record companiesFacebook will launch a music service later this month, according to recent news coverage.  Details on the new platform are scarce, but Ben Parr at Mashable reports that Facebook is partnering with top music services Spotify, MOG and Rdio to let users stream music on Facebook.com.For the uninitiated: Spotify is a service that lets you listen to virtually any song for free on your desktop, with an occasional (but infrequent) ad.  Users can pay a small fee to remove the ads or use the service on their phones.That's right -- Facebook may be about to unleash unlimited free music to all its users.  Music is enjoyed almost universally, and free music services have been among the fastest-growing on the web -- Napster, to name but one.  Providing free music to more than 750 million people (assuming Facebook Music launches globally)  seems like a no-brainer: Why wouldn't everyone in the world want to listen to and share free music with friends?  This is the web equivalent of giving away free ice cream.And yet.I've been wrong on Facebook so many times before.Simply putting a product in front of millions of people is no guarantee of success, Pete Cashmore says. I was wrong on Facebook Places, the social network's challenger to location-based startups.  "It's inevitable that Facebook will surpass Foursquare in the check-ins race," I declared more than a year ago.  While I can't verify that Facebook Places didn't surpass Foursquare in terms of the check-ins it provided, Facebook no longer feels that it's viable as a stand-alone product: These location features are being merged into status updates and brand pages, the company announced recently. I was wrong, too, about Facebook Deals.  In my predictions for 2011, I saw the service as a potential rival to market leader Groupon.  After all, how could you provide a "50% off" coupon for a local business and not have a small percentage of Facebook's massive user base accept? Wrong! Facebook Deals is set to shut down in the coming weeks, with a few limited offers remaining on business pages.  Meanwhile, the daily deals space is coming under fire, and even Groupon is drawing extensive criticism as it prepares for its IPO.How can Facebook take something popular, provide it free of charge to its 750 million users, and yet fail to become the market leader?  Perhaps the company simply isn't able to devote the resources required to nurture so many non-core products?  Or perhaps Facebook users are so focused on their news feeds that no product can take off unless it's inserted into this stream from the start.? Whatever the reason, one thing is clear: For Facebook, simply putting a product in front of hundreds of millions of people is no guarantee of success.I find it hard to imagine a situation in which Facebook users decide that free music isn't for them.  Virtually all of us enjoy music. If Facebook can't make this work, then giving away "unlimited free money" might also prove a challenge.No, the biggest roadblock to Facebook Music won't be the users; It'll be the record companies who, having already cut deals with Spotify et al., decide to rescind the offer.  Another threat: Spotify and its ilk may realize that giving away free music to millions of people isn't the most sustainable of business models.Or maybe I'm wrong again: Perhaps Facebook will fail to convince us that free ice cream is delicious.The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Pete Cashmore.Powered by LivefyreUSCrime + JusticeEnergy + EnvironmentExtreme WeatherSpace + ScienceWorldAfricaAmericasAsiaAustraliaChinaEuropeIndiaMiddle EastUKPolitics45CongressSupreme CourtFacts First2020 ElectionBusinessMarketsTechMediaSuccessPerspectivesVideoOpinionPolitical Op-EdsSocial CommentaryHealthFoodFitnessWellnessParentingLive LongerEntertainmentStarsScreenBingeCultureMediaTechInnovateGadgetMission: AheadUpstartsBusiness EvolvedWork TransformedInnovative CitiesStyleArtsDesignFashionArchitectureLuxuryAutosVideoTravelDestinationsFood & DrinkPlayStayVideosSportsPro FootballCollege FootballBasketballBaseballSoccerOlympicsVideoLive TV Digital StudiosCNN FilmsHLNTV ScheduleTV Shows A-ZCNNVRShopCNN Underscored-Explore-Wellness-Gadgets-LifestyleCNN StoreVRHow To Watch VRArchivesMore…PhotosLongformInvestigationsCNN profilesCNN LeadershipCNN NewslettersWork for CNN© 2019 Cable News Network.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.Mark Zuckerberg unveils a new version of the Facebook profile page called "Timeline."Story highlightsFacebook is about to completely change the way its profile pages look Cashmore: I thrive on new things, but this change was radical even for meYour profile will become a scrapbook documenting your entire life, all the way back to birthFacebook users, mark my words: You'll revolt when the site rolls out its new features in the coming weeks.  Facebook is about to completely change the way its profile pages look as part of the website's biggest redesign so far, and only a fraction of the website's 800 million users seem to have the slightest clue.I'm not talking about the new real-time "Ticker" at the top right of your Facebook profile. I'm not even talking about the "Top Stories" that now appear at the top of your Facebook news feed -- those are tiny, insignificant changes compared to what's just around the corner.But boy, did some people react badly to even those minuscule improvements. Among my Facebook friends, more than half said they disliked the changes and some threatened to quit. Of course, they did no such thing. How will they react when Facebook throws away the old profiles and replaces them with something completely new?If you use Facebook, chances are you're unaware of the major changes that are slated to begin rolling out by the end of this month (full disclosure: Mashable is one of several news organizations partnering with Facebook on a social news app). Only geeks like me are obsessed enough to have watched Facebook's 90-minute announcement of the new profile pages last week. Users will eventually realize that Facebook has unleashed something remarkable, Pete Cashmore says.And an even smaller percentage of Facebook users have discovered, like I did, that you can enable the new "Facebook Timeline" profile page right now so you're prepared for the launch.So what's the big change? Facebook will be switching profile pages, perhaps optionally at first, to a new format called "Facebook Timeline."  I switched my profile over last week and boy was it a shock -- I immediately wanted to switch it back to the old format. I'm someone who thrives on trying new things, but this change was radical even for me. Yet I could find no way to switch my profile back, so I stuck with it for a few days.  I'm so glad I did: Facebook Timeline is the best change Facebook has ever made.  JUST WATCHEDFacebook unveils 'Timeline' featureReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFacebook unveils 'Timeline' feature 03:44Here's what'll happen once the Timeline profiles are launched: Your Facebook profile will go from having one central column to two, with boxes of text, photos, videos and even maps of your favorite locations. Rather than just displaying your most recent activities, your profile will become a scrapbook documenting your entire life, all the way back to your birth. Facebook will become a record of your existence: All  your memories, your victories and your defeats, your loves, your losses and everything in between.JUST WATCHEDFacebook apps go beyond 'like' featureReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFacebook apps go beyond 'like' feature 03:10You'll be shocked, as I was, when this change is made. Suddenly your life is laid out before you, the highs and lows somehow pinpointed by Facebook's algorithms. You'll wonder why the status update box is so tiny now, and where all your most recent updates went.  You'll add a big, new "Cover photo" to your page and waste a few hours preening your Timeline, choosing to feature your happiest memories, hide the inconsequential ones, and lingering awhile on the most bittersweet of moments.  And you'll realize, as I did, that Facebook knows you better than you know yourself.Through this process, you'll realize that Facebook Timeline is much more than a way to post the minutiae of your existence. While a typical social networking profile might highlight what you ate this morning, or what time you left for work, or where you had lunch, Facebook Timeline takes these thousands of seemingly inconsequential events, discards the irrelevant ones, finds the most emotive, the most visual, the most striking and emotionally touching moments and pulls them into sharp focus.  Much like our memories, Facebook Timeline understands that some moments have resonance that lasts through the years. It's a marvel of computer programming: An algorithm that comes eerily close to emulating human memory; perhaps the first algorithm to spark such a deep emotional response.So yes, you will hate the new Facebook profile when it launches in the coming weeks. Then, like me, you'll realize that Facebook has unleashed something so remarkable that you didn't even recognize it at first: A meaningful social network. And like any other groundbreaking technology -- the PC, the smartphone, the iPad -- you'll wonder why life wasn't always this way, and how you got by without it.Powered by LivefyreUSCrime + JusticeEnergy + EnvironmentExtreme WeatherSpace + ScienceWorldAfricaAmericasAsiaAustraliaChinaEuropeIndiaMiddle EastUKPolitics45CongressSupreme CourtFacts First2020 ElectionBusinessMarketsTechMediaSuccessPerspectivesVideoOpinionPolitical Op-EdsSocial CommentaryHealthFoodFitnessWellnessParentingLive LongerEntertainmentStarsScreenBingeCultureMediaTechInnovateGadgetMission: AheadUpstartsBusiness EvolvedWork TransformedInnovative CitiesStyleArtsDesignFashionArchitectureLuxuryAutosVideoTravelDestinationsFood & DrinkPlayStayVideosSportsPro FootballCollege FootballBasketballBaseballSoccerOlympicsVideoLive TV Digital StudiosCNN FilmsHLNTV ScheduleTV Shows A-ZCNNVRShopCNN Underscored-Explore-Wellness-Gadgets-LifestyleCNN StoreVRHow To Watch VRArchivesMore…PhotosLongformInvestigationsCNN profilesCNN LeadershipCNN NewslettersWork for CNN© 2019 Cable News Network.

Facebook will be switching profile pages, perhaps optionally at first, to a new format called "Facebook Timeline."  I switched my profile over last week and boy was it a shock -- I immediately wanted to switch it back to the old format. I'm someone who thrives on trying new things, but this change was radical even for me. Yet I could find no way to switch my profile back, so I stuck with it for a few days.  I'm so glad I did: Facebook Timeline is the best change Facebook has ever made.  JUST WATCHEDFacebook unveils 'Timeline' featureReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFacebook unveils 'Timeline' feature 03:44Here's what'll happen once the Timeline profiles are launched: Your Facebook profile will go from having one central column to two, with boxes of text, photos, videos and even maps of your favorite locations. Rather than just displaying your most recent activities, your profile will become a scrapbook documenting your entire life, all the way back to your birth. Facebook will become a record of your existence: All  your memories, your victories and your defeats, your loves, your losses and everything in between.JUST WATCHEDFacebook apps go beyond 'like' featureReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFacebook apps go beyond 'like' feature 03:10You'll be shocked, as I was, when this change is made. Suddenly your life is laid out before you, the highs and lows somehow pinpointed by Facebook's algorithms. You'll wonder why the status update box is so tiny now, and where all your most recent updates went.  You'll add a big, new "Cover photo" to your page and waste a few hours preening your Timeline, choosing to feature your happiest memories, hide the inconsequential ones, and lingering awhile on the most bittersweet of moments.  And you'll realize, as I did, that Facebook knows you better than you know yourself.Through this process, you'll realize that Facebook Timeline is much more than a way to post the minutiae of your existence. While a typical social networking profile might highlight what you ate this morning, or what time you left for work, or where you had lunch, Facebook Timeline takes these thousands of seemingly inconsequential events, discards the irrelevant ones, finds the most emotive, the most visual, the most striking and emotionally touching moments and pulls them into sharp focus.  Much like our memories, Facebook Timeline understands that some moments have resonance that lasts through the years. It's a marvel of computer programming: An algorithm that comes eerily close to emulating human memory; perhaps the first algorithm to spark such a deep emotional response.So yes, you will hate the new Facebook profile when it launches in the coming weeks. Then, like me, you'll realize that Facebook has unleashed something so remarkable that you didn't even recognize it at first: A meaningful social network. And like any other groundbreaking technology -- the PC, the smartphone, the iPad -- you'll wonder why life wasn't always this way, and how you got by without it.Powered by LivefyreUSCrime + JusticeEnergy + EnvironmentExtreme WeatherSpace + ScienceWorldAfricaAmericasAsiaAustraliaChinaEuropeIndiaMiddle EastUKPolitics45CongressSupreme CourtFacts First2020 ElectionBusinessMarketsTechMediaSuccessPerspectivesVideoOpinionPolitical Op-EdsSocial CommentaryHealthFoodFitnessWellnessParentingLive LongerEntertainmentStarsScreenBingeCultureMediaTechInnovateGadgetMission: AheadUpstartsBusiness EvolvedWork TransformedInnovative CitiesStyleArtsDesignFashionArchitectureLuxuryAutosVideoTravelDestinationsFood & DrinkPlayStayVideosSportsPro FootballCollege FootballBasketballBaseballSoccerOlympicsVideoLive TV Digital StudiosCNN FilmsHLNTV ScheduleTV Shows A-ZCNNVRShopCNN Underscored-Explore-Wellness-Gadgets-LifestyleCNN StoreVRHow To Watch VRArchivesMore…PhotosLongformInvestigationsCNN profilesCNN LeadershipCNN NewslettersWork for CNN© 2019 Cable News Network.

And you'll realize, as I did, that Facebook knows you better than you know yourself.Through this process, you'll realize that Facebook Timeline is much more than a way to post the minutiae of your existence. While a typical social networking profile might highlight what you ate this morning, or what time you left for work, or where you had lunch, Facebook Timeline takes these thousands of seemingly inconsequential events, discards the irrelevant ones, finds the most emotive, the most visual, the most striking and emotionally touching moments and pulls them into sharp focus.  Much like our memories, Facebook Timeline understands that some moments have resonance that lasts through the years. It's a marvel of computer programming: An algorithm that comes eerily close to emulating human memory; perhaps the first algorithm to spark such a deep emotional response.So yes, you will hate the new Facebook profile when it launches in the coming weeks. Then, like me, you'll realize that Facebook has unleashed something so remarkable that you didn't even recognize it at first: A meaningful social network. And like any other groundbreaking technology -- the PC, the smartphone, the iPad -- you'll wonder why life wasn't always this way, and how you got by without it.Powered by LivefyreUSCrime + JusticeEnergy + EnvironmentExtreme WeatherSpace + ScienceWorldAfricaAmericasAsiaAustraliaChinaEuropeIndiaMiddle EastUKPolitics45CongressSupreme CourtFacts First2020 ElectionBusinessMarketsTechMediaSuccessPerspectivesVideoOpinionPolitical Op-EdsSocial CommentaryHealthFoodFitnessWellnessParentingLive LongerEntertainmentStarsScreenBingeCultureMediaTechInnovateGadgetMission: AheadUpstartsBusiness EvolvedWork TransformedInnovative CitiesStyleArtsDesignFashionArchitectureLuxuryAutosVideoTravelDestinationsFood & DrinkPlayStayVideosSportsPro FootballCollege FootballBasketballBaseballSoccerOlympicsVideoLive TV Digital StudiosCNN FilmsHLNTV ScheduleTV Shows A-ZCNNVRShopCNN Underscored-Explore-Wellness-Gadgets-LifestyleCNN StoreVRHow To Watch VRArchivesMore…PhotosLongformInvestigationsCNN profilesCNN LeadershipCNN NewslettersWork for CNN© 2019 Cable News Network.

Facebook is about to completely change the way its profile pages look as part of the website's biggest redesign so far, and only a fraction of the website's 800 million users seem to have the slightest clue.I'm not talking about the new real-time "Ticker" at the top right of your Facebook profile. I'm not even talking about the "Top Stories" that now appear at the top of your Facebook news feed -- those are tiny, insignificant changes compared to what's just around the corner.But boy, did some people react badly to even those minuscule improvements. Among my Facebook friends, more than half said they disliked the changes and some threatened to quit. Of course, they did no such thing. How will they react when Facebook throws away the old profiles and replaces them with something completely new?If you use Facebook, chances are you're unaware of the major changes that are slated to begin rolling out by the end of this month (full disclosure: Mashable is one of several news organizations partnering with Facebook on a social news app). Only geeks like me are obsessed enough to have watched Facebook's 90-minute announcement of the new profile pages last week. Users will eventually realize that Facebook has unleashed something remarkable, Pete Cashmore says.And an even smaller percentage of Facebook users have discovered, like I did, that you can enable the new "Facebook Timeline" profile page right now so you're prepared for the launch.So what's the big change? Facebook will be switching profile pages, perhaps optionally at first, to a new format called "Facebook Timeline."  I switched my profile over last week and boy was it a shock -- I immediately wanted to switch it back to the old format. I'm someone who thrives on trying new things, but this change was radical even for me. Yet I could find no way to switch my profile back, so I stuck with it for a few days.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.Unfriend this man, now. "Take This Lollipop" combines horror movie tropes with online security fears.Story highlights"Take This Lollipop" mines Facebook fears to make a short horror videoIn the viral clip, a creepy, crazed guy peers at your Facebook profileCreator Jason Zada says it shows how online "privacy is dead"As Halloween nears, more than 2 million people have shared the videoA sweaty, wild-eyed man in a stained undershirt hunches over his computer in a shadowy basement. He's broken into your Facebook account and is reading your posts as his dirty, cracked fingernails paw at the keyboard.Rage (jealousy? hate?) builds as he flips through your photos and scrolls through your list of friends. He rocks back and forth, growing more agitated as the pages flash past. Then he consults a map of your city and heads to his car ...So why ... oh, why ... did you include so much personal information -- and your address -- in your profile?If that all sounds like the stuff of a digital-era horror movie, you're not far off."Take This Lollipop" is an interactive short video that's been making its way around the Web as Halloween approaches. Visitors to the site are first presented with an image of a lollipop with a razor blade in it -- don't take candy from strangers, kids -- and asked to grant access to their Facebook account. Don't worry: The application claims it uses your data only once, then deletes it. But the creepy results just might make you think twice about who else gets access to your online information.The video uses the developer tool Facebook Connect and features actor Bill Oberst Jr. (whose credits range from "The Secret Life of Bees" to the inexplicably Oscarless "Nude Nuns With Big Guns") as the aforementioned grungy nutjob.As he stares at his computer, it's actual photos and other information from your page that he's scrolling through. (Note to parents: If you're tagged in pictures of your kids, be ready for those to pop up, too. It ups the ante on creepiness exponentially).In the weeks since the video went live, viewers have begun sharing it with friends and asking them to video-record themselves while watching it. (This one from YouTube has more than 18,000 views, not to mention a vaguely "Blair Witch Project" vibe.)Creator Jason Zada, a commercial and viral marketing director who was the brains behind the viral "Elf Yourself" online campaign for OfficeMax, told Porter Gale of Ad Age that he'd been kicking around Halloween ideas and "wanted to do something that messed with people."He said the clip is definitely meant to spur thought about how much information we share online."Our privacy was dead a while back and will never be the same," he said. "Life as a whole has changed. If you look at the video, the scariest part is that your information is in the video. The piece is scary because a person is violating your privacy, not because it's bloody or there's anything jumping out." As of Thursday morning, nearly 2 million people had "liked" the page. How many of them are at Facebook's headquarters remains unclear."I did hear the video project has been polarizing inside of Facebook, and I received a call from Facebook's Developer Relations Team, " Zada said.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks in September. The site's large user base makes it a hacker target.Story highlightsFacebook porn spam casts light on site as a target for hackersSecurity analyst says the site could do more to prevent attacksFacebook calls security a top concern, has rolled out multiple prevention initiativesThe site also has sued spammers, leading to millions in court penaltiesThe wave of pornographic and violent images that flooded Facebook over the past few days has drawn attention to a side of the social networking mega-site most of its users don't think about:Facebook is a coveted prize for hackers."It's hard to put it into perspective as to how good a job they're doing (at preventing spam), because they have a giant target on their back," said Chester Wisniewski, a senior analyst with security firm Sophos. "They have a giant target on their back with the user base they have. Every spammer's got a dream of catching them."In this week's attack, a hack that exploited security flaws in some Web browsers sent images of porn, Photoshopped pictures of celebrities in compromising positions and images of intense violence to millions of users, according to Facebook. Users apparently were duped into copying malicious code into their browser windows, helping the images spread.Many Facebook users were outraged by the fact that porn made its way onto the social network. On one hand, the offensive images call into question Facebook's ability to rein in spam as it becomes more popular. On the other, it's a counterintuitive testament to Facebook's spam-fighting abilities that users were surprised to see these nasty images showing up on the social network.If this happened on e-mail, after all, no one would blink.JUST WATCHEDFacebook apps go beyond 'like' featureReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFacebook apps go beyond 'like' feature 03:10Less than 4% of the content shared on the Facebook is spam, Facebook says. Compare that with e-mail, where a whopping 89% of content is spam, as CNN partner site Mashable reports.Less than 5% of the site's members experience spam on any given day, Facebook said in October. Meanwhile, only 0.06% of its 1 billion log-ins per day are compromised, the site says. (Of course, that's still 600,000, so someone could shade that number to make it sound miniscule or huge, depending on intent.)To Wisnieswski, the way Facebook responds to spam and other hacks is a mixed bag. Generally, he says, they're quick to jump on the big problems but slower on the day-to-day stuff."If it's malware-related ... scams and spam and things like that ... they're pretty good about it," he said. "They're very conscious about the fact that they don't want their users to be infected."But with the survey scams and things, they don't seem to be that effective."Facebook, of course, is far more likely to agree with the former point than the latter.Spokesman Andrew Noyes says that, on a site under virtually constant attack, the Facebook team is constantly working to protect its users."We believe the security fight requires a multipronged approach," he said. "In addition to our dedicated legal team, Facebook also has security experts and engineers focused on the integrity of the site. We're continuing to build systems to prevent and respond to spam attacks. Our User Operations team also works around the clock to identify problems and assist those affected."Noyes said Facebook's security team has identified the hackers behind this week's attack and are "working with our legal team to ensure appropriate consequences follow."In recent months, the site has launched several public tools and initiatives trying to stay ahead of the inevitable attacks.Last month, Facebook announced two tools it's testing: Trusted Friends and App Passwords.  Trusted Friends would help users get back into their account if their password is changed without their knowledge. App Passwords would add a layer of security when users approve third-party apps.This summer, Facebook launched a "Bug Bounty" program that pays people for reporting security problems, and a suite of security tools rolled out in May includes "clickjacking" protection and remote log-ins. In January, users got the ability to surf Facebook with a secure browser setting."We work regularly with analysts, engineers, fraud experts, and security investigators to prevent abuse, defeat criminals, and help maintain Facebook as a trusted environment," Noyes said in an email.In fact, there are some built-in advantages to the way Facebook works that help keep the level of spam lower than with e-mail, a relative Wild West for spammers and scammers.As he pondered upcoming changes to Facebook messaging last year, Craigslist founder Craig Newmark noted in a blog post that the site's requirements for creating an account help."The deal is that a Facebook identity (profile) pretty much ensures that there's a real person behind it," Newmark wrote. "It's possible to fake a Facebook identity, but it's a fair amount of work, way more expensive than getting a new Gmail or Hotmail account."While acknowledging those efforts, Wisnewski says there are still some holes in Facebook's security game.A major one, he says, is the Facebook app development process. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has publicly celebrated the millions of third-party app developers registered with the site. But that means there are millions of people who get expanded access to Facebook data just for paying a nominal fee. "Because Facebook doesn't verify anything about you or have any human review process at all ... we see these guys create hundreds of developer accounts for the same scam," he said.Wisnewski also wishes Facebook would add additional layers of security every time users start up an app. "If they really want to get a grip on this, there are a few things they could do -- but the things they could do, by Zuckerberg's worldview, would slow down innovation."All that said, Facebook has a track record of aggressively going after scammers and spammers once they're caught.In August, self-proclaimed "Spam King" Sanford Wallace was indicted in a California court. Two years ago, Facebook sued him and a federal court ordered him to pay $711 million. Previously, Facebook won a $360 million judgment against spammer Philip Porembski and, in 2008, was awarded the largest award ever under federal anti-spam laws -- $873 million -- after suing Adam Guerbuez and Atlantis Blue Capital for sending objectionable images on the site, according to news reports.Powered by LivefyreUSCrime + JusticeEnergy + EnvironmentExtreme WeatherSpace + ScienceWorldAfricaAmericasAsiaAustraliaChinaEuropeIndiaMiddle EastUKPolitics45CongressSupreme CourtFacts First2020 ElectionBusinessMarketsTechMediaSuccessPerspectivesVideoOpinionPolitical Op-EdsSocial CommentaryHealthFoodFitnessWellnessParentingLive LongerEntertainmentStarsScreenBingeCultureMediaTechInnovateGadgetMission: AheadUpstartsBusiness EvolvedWork TransformedInnovative CitiesStyleArtsDesignFashionArchitectureLuxuryAutosVideoTravelDestinationsFood & DrinkPlayStayVideosSportsPro FootballCollege FootballBasketballBaseballSoccerOlympicsVideoLive TV Digital StudiosCNN FilmsHLNTV ScheduleTV Shows A-ZCNNVRShopCNN Underscored-Explore-Wellness-Gadgets-LifestyleCNN StoreVRHow To Watch VRArchivesMore…PhotosLongformInvestigationsCNN profilesCNN LeadershipCNN NewslettersWork for CNN© 2019 Cable News Network.

Previously, Facebook won a $360 million judgment against spammer Philip Porembski and, in 2008, was awarded the largest award ever under federal anti-spam laws -- $873 million -- after suing Adam Guerbuez and Atlantis Blue Capital for sending objectionable images on the site, according to news reports.Powered by LivefyreUSCrime + JusticeEnergy + EnvironmentExtreme WeatherSpace + ScienceWorldAfricaAmericasAsiaAustraliaChinaEuropeIndiaMiddle EastUKPolitics45CongressSupreme CourtFacts First2020 ElectionBusinessMarketsTechMediaSuccessPerspectivesVideoOpinionPolitical Op-EdsSocial CommentaryHealthFoodFitnessWellnessParentingLive LongerEntertainmentStarsScreenBingeCultureMediaTechInnovateGadgetMission: AheadUpstartsBusiness EvolvedWork TransformedInnovative CitiesStyleArtsDesignFashionArchitectureLuxuryAutosVideoTravelDestinationsFood & DrinkPlayStayVideosSportsPro FootballCollege FootballBasketballBaseballSoccerOlympicsVideoLive TV Digital StudiosCNN FilmsHLNTV ScheduleTV Shows A-ZCNNVRShopCNN Underscored-Explore-Wellness-Gadgets-LifestyleCNN StoreVRHow To Watch VRArchivesMore…PhotosLongformInvestigationsCNN profilesCNN LeadershipCNN NewslettersWork for CNN© 2019 Cable News Network.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks in September. The site's large user base makes it a hacker target.Story highlightsFacebook porn spam casts light on site as a target for hackersSecurity analyst says the site could do more to prevent attacksFacebook calls security a top concern, has rolled out multiple prevention initiativesThe site also has sued spammers, leading to millions in court penaltiesThe wave of pornographic and violent images that flooded Facebook over the past few days has drawn attention to a side of the social networking mega-site most of its users don't think about:Facebook is a coveted prize for hackers."It's hard to put it into perspective as to how good a job they're doing (at preventing spam), because they have a giant target on their back," said Chester Wisniewski, a senior analyst with security firm Sophos. "They have a giant target on their back with the user base they have. Every spammer's got a dream of catching them."In this week's attack, a hack that exploited security flaws in some Web browsers sent images of porn, Photoshopped pictures of celebrities in compromising positions and images of intense violence to millions of users, according to Facebook. Users apparently were duped into copying malicious code into their browser windows, helping the images spread.Many Facebook users were outraged by the fact that porn made its way onto the social network. On one hand, the offensive images call into question Facebook's ability to rein in spam as it becomes more popular. On the other, it's a counterintuitive testament to Facebook's spam-fighting abilities that users were surprised to see these nasty images showing up on the social network.If this happened on e-mail, after all, no one would blink.JUST WATCHEDFacebook apps go beyond 'like' featureReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFacebook apps go beyond 'like' feature 03:10Less than 4% of the content shared on the Facebook is spam, Facebook says. Compare that with e-mail, where a whopping 89% of content is spam, as CNN partner site Mashable reports.Less than 5% of the site's members experience spam on any given day, Facebook said in October. Meanwhile, only 0.06% of its 1 billion log-ins per day are compromised, the site says. (Of course, that's still 600,000, so someone could shade that number to make it sound miniscule or huge, depending on intent.)To Wisnieswski, the way Facebook responds to spam and other hacks is a mixed bag. Generally, he says, they're quick to jump on the big problems but slower on the day-to-day stuff."If it's malware-related ... scams and spam and things like that ... they're pretty good about it," he said. "They're very conscious about the fact that they don't want their users to be infected."But with the survey scams and things, they don't seem to be that effective."Facebook, of course, is far more likely to agree with the former point than the latter.Spokesman Andrew Noyes says that, on a site under virtually constant attack, the Facebook team is constantly working to protect its users."We believe the security fight requires a multipronged approach," he said. "In addition to our dedicated legal team, Facebook also has security experts and engineers focused on the integrity of the site. We're continuing to build systems to prevent and respond to spam attacks. Our User Operations team also works around the clock to identify problems and assist those affected."Noyes said Facebook's security team has identified the hackers behind this week's attack and are "working with our legal team to ensure appropriate consequences follow."In recent months, the site has launched several public tools and initiatives trying to stay ahead of the inevitable attacks.Last month, Facebook announced two tools it's testing: Trusted Friends and App Passwords.  Trusted Friends would help users get back into their account if their password is changed without their knowledge. App Passwords would add a layer of security when users approve third-party apps.This summer, Facebook launched a "Bug Bounty" program that pays people for reporting security problems, and a suite of security tools rolled out in May includes "clickjacking" protection and remote log-ins. In January, users got the ability to surf Facebook with a secure browser setting."We work regularly with analysts, engineers, fraud experts, and security investigators to prevent abuse, defeat criminals, and help maintain Facebook as a trusted environment," Noyes said in an email.In fact, there are some built-in advantages to the way Facebook works that help keep the level of spam lower than with e-mail, a relative Wild West for spammers and scammers.As he pondered upcoming changes to Facebook messaging last year, Craigslist founder Craig Newmark noted in a blog post that the site's requirements for creating an account help."The deal is that a Facebook identity (profile) pretty much ensures that there's a real person behind it," Newmark wrote. "It's possible to fake a Facebook identity, but it's a fair amount of work, way more expensive than getting a new Gmail or Hotmail account."While acknowledging those efforts, Wisnewski says there are still some holes in Facebook's security game.A major one, he says, is the Facebook app development process. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has publicly celebrated the millions of third-party app developers registered with the site. But that means there are millions of people who get expanded access to Facebook data just for paying a nominal fee. "Because Facebook doesn't verify anything about you or have any human review process at all ... we see these guys create hundreds of developer accounts for the same scam," he said.Wisnewski also wishes Facebook would add additional layers of security every time users start up an app. "If they really want to get a grip on this, there are a few things they could do -- but the things they could do, by Zuckerberg's worldview, would slow down innovation."All that said, Facebook has a track record of aggressively going after scammers and spammers once they're caught.In August, self-proclaimed "Spam King" Sanford Wallace was indicted in a California court.

Report: Facebook making phone, code-named 'Buffy' - CNN

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.Sarah Michelle Gellar starred in "Buffy the Vampire Slayer." Story highlightsAll Things D says phone is 12 to 18 months from hitting storesHTC phone will run a modified version of Google's Android, report saysINQ Mobile's Cloud Touch and Cloud Q put Facebook front and centerFacebook is working with HTC to develop a phone that has a much deeper integration with the social network than any previous "Facebook phone." That's according to a report from All Things D, which says the phone is probably 12 to 18 months away from hitting store shelves.Codenamed "Buffy" after the vampire slayer of the same name, the phone will run a modified version of Google's Android, but Facebook is reported to be tweaking the system "heavily." HTC is known for modifying Android on its phones with its HTC Sense interface, and both Amazon and Barnes & Noble have created tablets with highly customized versions of the Android, so it's possible that Facebook is adopting a similar strategy.Part of the package would be serving up Facebook apps via HTML5 support. This would allow users to play games like Farmville and Poker directly from the Facebook app. While most developers offer their apps as separate downloads from Facebook, that prevents them from tapping into active Facebook users, while cutting Facebook off from potential revenues. Buffy would presumably bridge the gap.Buffy will be far from the first Facebook phone. Earlier this year INQ Mobile released two phones, the Cloud Touch and Cloud Q that put the service front and center. Then HTC took it a step further with the Status, which came to the U.S. on AT&T this summer and featured a prominent dedicated Facebook button. Finally, Facebook released an app designed specifically for the iPad in October.Apple, however, hasn't played as nice with Facebook as the service might have liked, however. When Apple unveiled iOS 5, the latest major update to the software on iPhones and iPads, it featured deeper integration with Twitter -- letting users share photos directly from the phone's camera app, for example. An option for sharing to Facebook was noticeably absent.Both HTC and Facebook told Mashable that they don't comment on rumor and speculation, though the Facebook spokesperson added, "Our mobile strategy is simple: we think every mobile device is better if it is deeply social. We're working across the entire mobile industry; with operators, hardware manufacturers, OS providers, and application developers to bring powerful social experiences to more people around the world."The collaborative picture Facebook paints is a far cry from the ultra-competitive war among mobile platforms with Google, Apple, Facebook, and others vying for consumers' hearts and minds. Perhaps the most telling aspect of the rumored phone is the codename. With a name like Buffy, the Facebook phone's mission is clear: slay all comers.See the original story on Mashable.comPowered by LivefyreUSCrime + JusticeEnergy + EnvironmentExtreme WeatherSpace + ScienceWorldAfricaAmericasAsiaAustraliaChinaEuropeIndiaMiddle EastUKPolitics45CongressSupreme CourtFacts First2020 ElectionBusinessMarketsTechMediaSuccessPerspectivesVideoOpinionPolitical Op-EdsSocial CommentaryHealthFoodFitnessWellnessParentingLive LongerEntertainmentStarsScreenBingeCultureMediaTechInnovateGadgetMission: AheadUpstartsBusiness EvolvedWork TransformedInnovative CitiesStyleArtsDesignFashionArchitectureLuxuryAutosVideoTravelDestinationsFood & DrinkPlayStayVideosSportsPro FootballCollege FootballBasketballBaseballSoccerOlympicsVideoLive TV Digital StudiosCNN FilmsHLNTV ScheduleTV Shows A-ZCNNVRShopCNN Underscored-Explore-Wellness-Gadgets-LifestyleCNN StoreVRHow To Watch VRArchivesMore…PhotosLongformInvestigationsCNN profilesCNN LeadershipCNN NewslettersWork for CNN© 2019 Cable News Network.
